In psychology sensation is the first stage in the biochemical and neurologic events

It begins with a stimulus upon the receptor cells of a sensory organ which then leads to perception the mental state that is reflected in statements like I see a uniformly blue wall

A sensation that might lead to that statement could include the excitation of cone cells in the retina

In the West the human bodys senses are divided into eight visual auditory gustatory olfactory cutaneous kinesthetic vestibular organic The ways in which these senses are divided from one another in concept and combined in varying ratios in perceiving the world differs based on individual physiology social and cultural context and physical surroundings The whole sensory system including both physical sensation and interpretation of information from the senses is referred to as a sensorium

Light enters the eyes through the cornea It then passes through the pupil and is refracted by the crystalline lens of the eyes Light is then channeled through the vitreous humour and then on to the retina In the retina there are two kinds of cells rods and cones Rods see black and white colors and are dominant in the night Cones then see colored structures Cones are exceptionally abundant in the fovea Cones are reactive to the three colors of red blue and green Other colours are sensed as combinations of these

Sound is received by the ear via the pinna the outer ear structure which then leads the sound inside through the external auditory meatus After the sound passes through the meatus it goes to the eardrum or tympanus then vibrates its way through the tiny ossicles the hammer anvil and stirrup then to the cochlea The cochlea converts vibration into electrical impulses which are transmitted to the brain

Taste or gustation is the ability to detect sensory changes in the tongue through the use of taste buds situated deep into the papillae Intriguingly the sense called gustation is in fact comprised of varying ratios of multiple sensory systems shifting in importance and attention as food is chewed tasted and swallowed These include the taste buds the sense of touch in the structures of the mouth and digestive system chemical sensation of irritation in the trigeminal nerve system and unique receptors for sensing the properties of water located at the rear of the oral cavity

Smell or olfaction is received by the olfactory bulb and connected to the brain by the olfactory nerve the first cranial nerve of the brain just after the nasal turbinates of the nose warm strain and filter the air

Please see the skin article for more details

The kinesthetic sense is the sense of posture and movement It is also referred to as proprioception

The vestibular sense is the sense of balance It is mediated by the action of the fluid inside the Semicircular canals

The organic sense per se refers only to sensation from the internal organs or viscera but can however be expanded to include certain physiological processes such as hunger thirst drowsiness and air hunger It is also referred to as interoception

Instant soups are a kind of soup They are produced on an industrial scale Later they are treated in different ways to preserve them Usually they are dried canned or treated by freezing 

Packaged instant soups come in two varieties

 ImageInstant miso soupjpgInstant Miso soup ImageInstant ramenjpgDifferent packets of instant ramen

ImageCampbellsjpgSome instant soup come in tins They are basically like cold soups that just need to be heated 

Sensation may refer to any of the following

In psychology and the cognitive sciences perception is the process of getting interpreting selecting and organizing sensory information 

Methods of studying perception range from essentially biological or physiological approaches through psychological approaches through the philosophy of mind and in empiricist epistemology such as that of David Hume John Locke George Berkeley or as in Merleau Pontys affirmation of perception as the basis of all science and knowledge

 History of the study of perception  Perception is one of the oldest fields within scientific psychology and there are correspondingly many theories about its underlying processes The oldest quantitative law in psychology is the Weber Fechner law which quantifies the relationship between the intensity of physical stimuli and their perceptual effects It was the study of perception that gave rise to the Gestalt school of psychology with its emphasis on holistic approach

Because noodles made out of pure buckwheat can easily fall apart when boiled the buckwheat flour is usually mixed with binders  often wheat flour Under the Japan Agricultural Standards regulations the noodles must contain at least 30 buckwheat in order to be called soba but noodles with a high buckwheat content are seen as more desirable The raw noodles are made by making a dough out of buckwheat flour and binder The dough is then spread out flat After that strands of noodles are sliced off with a special knife The quality of noodles is highly dependent on the skill of the maker especially for soba noodles with high buckwheat content The raw noodles are boiled before being served hot or cold

In Japan soba noodles are served in a variety of situations They are a popular inexpensive fast food at train stations throughout Japan they are served by exclusive and expensive specialty restaurants and they are also made at home Markets sell dried noodles and men tsuyu or instant noodle broth to make home preparation easy

Some establishments especially cheaper and more casual ones may serve both soba and udon as they are often served in a similar manner However soba is traditionally the noodle of choice for Tokyoites This tradition originates from the Edo period At that time the population of Edo was considerably wealthier than the rural poor were more susceptible to beri beri because of their high consumption of white rice which is low in thiamine They are thought to have made up for this by regularly eating thiamine rich soba Every neighbourhood had one or two soba establishments many also serving sake which functioned much like modern cafes where locals would drop by casually

Soba is almost always eaten with chopsticks and in Japan it is traditionally considered polite to slurp the noodles noisily This is especially common with hot noodles as drawing up the noodles quickly into the mouth acts to cool them down

Like many Japanese noodles soba noodles are often served drained and chilled in the summer and hot in the winter with a soy based dashi broth Extra toppings can be added onto both hot and cold soba Toppings are chosen to reflect the seasons and to balance with other ingredients Most toppings are added without much cooking although some are deep fried Most of these dishes may also be prepared with udon Soba has a diameter of 5 mm

Chilled soba is often served on a sieve like bamboo tray called a zaru sometimes garnished with bits of dried nori seaweed with a dipping sauce known as soba tsuyu on the side The tsuyu is made of a strong mixture of dashi sweetened soy sauce and mirin Using chopsticks the diner picks up a small amount of soba from the tray and swirls it in the cold tsuyu before eating it Wasabi scallions and grated ginger are often mixed into the tsuyu

Soba is also often served as a noodle soup in a bowl of hot tsuyu The hot tsuyu in this instance is thinner than that used as a dipping sauce for chilled soba Popular garnishes are sliced scallion and shichimi toragashi

Soba is traditionally eaten on New Years Eve in most areas of Japan a tradition which survives to this day In the Tokyo area there is also a tradition of giving out soba to new neighbours after a house move although this practice is now rare

The most famous Japanese soba noodles come from Nagano Soba from Nagano is called Shinano Soba or Shinshu soba Ni hachi soba consists of two parts of wheat and eight of buckwheat

Soba is also the Japanese word for buckwheat Roasted buckwheat kernels may be made into a grain tea called sobacha which may be served hot or cold Buckwheat hulls or sobakawa are used to fill pillows

Soba is occasionally used to refer to noodles in general In Japan ramen is sometimes called chka soba or shina soba Parboiled chka soba is stir fried to make yakisoba Note that these noodles do not contain buckwheat

In Okinawa soba usually refers to Okinawa soba a completely different dish of noodles made out of flour not buckwheat Okinawa soba is also quite popular in the city of Campo Grande due to influence of Japanese immigrants It is eaten at street markets or in special restaurants called sobarias

Carmen Basilio was an American boxer who held the welterweight and middleweight world championship He won the welterweight title from Tony DeMarco in 1955 He then fought Sugar Ray Robinson for the middleweight title He won the belt from Robinson in 1957 but lost it when they fought again

He is the uncle of former welterweight boxing champion Billy Backus

Johnny Saxton was an American boxer who won the welterweight championship

Saxton beat Kid Gavilan in 1954 to become the welterweight champion The lost the title the following year to Tony DeMarco In 1956 he won the title again by beating Carmen Basilio but lost the title in a rematch with Basilio later in the year He retired in 1958

The WeberFechner law is a proposed relationship between the magnitude of a physical stimulus and the intensity or strength that people feel 

The relationship between stimulus and perception is logarithmic This logarithmic relationship means that if a stimulus varies as a geometric progression the corresponding perception is altered in an arithmetic progression For example if a stimulus is tripled in strength the corresponding perception may be two times as strong as its original value If the stimulus is again tripled in strength the corresponding perception will be three times as strong as its original value Hence for multiplications in stimulus strength the strength of perception only adds

This logarithmic relationship is valid not just for the sensation of weight but for other stimuli and our sensory perceptions as well

A logarithmic scale is a scale of measurement that uses the logarithm of a physical quantity instead of the quantity itself 

The logarithmic scale can be helpful when the data covers a large range of values the logarithm reduces this to a more manageable range 

Some of our senses operate in a logarithmic fashion That makes logarithmic scales for these input quantities especially appropriate In particular our sense of hearing perceives equal ratios of frequencies as equal differences in pitch

On most logarithmic scales small values of the underlying quantity correspond to small values of the logarithmic measure 

Well known examples of such scales are

Some logarithmic scales were designed such that large values of the underlying quantity correspond to small values of the logarithmic measure Examples of such scales are

A logarithmic scale is also a graphical scale on one or both sides of a graph where a number x is printed at a distance clog from the point marked with the number 1 A slide rule has logarithmic scales and nomograms often employ logarithmic scales On a logarithmic scale an equal difference in order of magnitude is represented by an equal distance The geometric mean of two numbers is midway between the numbers 

Logarithmic graph paper before the advent of computer graphics was a basic scientific tool Plots on paper with one log scale can show up exponential laws and on log log paper power laws as straight lines

Noodle soup is a kind of soup It contains the normal soup stock together with noodles and sometimes other ingredients This kind of soup is very popular in Asia where it originally came from There are also many instant soups of this kind

Some of the varieties are

One speaks of scale in context with measurement if something is represented proportionally by something else 

The scale of a map or enlarged or reduced model indicates the ratio between the distances on the map or model and the corresponding distances in reality or the original Eg a map of scale 150000 shows a distance of 50000 cm as 1 cm on a map and a model on a scale 125 of a building with a height of 30 m has a model height of 120 m An alternative method of indicating the scale is by a scale bar This can also be applied on a computer screen etc where the ratio may vary and also remains valid when enlarging or reducing a paper map

Scale could mean

Scale scale of enrollment

Scales with special uses are often named after the person who invented them

A map scale is the size of an object compared to the size of the objects smaller representative on a map This can be shown by a scale bar and a ratio 1n This lets the person using the map measure a distance on the map and know what is the distance on the ground 

People sometimes speak of a map as one with a large scale or small scale In this context scale is obviously relative It is safe to say that a large scale map displays objects such that they appear relatively large For example an island displayed on a 110000 map will appear larger than if it were displayed on a 125000 map Thus the former is large scale What can be confusing is that for a map of a given physical size say 11 by 17 inches a large scale map will have a smaller geographic extent than a small scale map centred on the same point Maps with a ratio of 150 000 or larger are considered large scale Maps with a ratio of 150 000 to 1250 000 are considered intermediate scale Any maps with a smaller scale are considered small scale

Midnight sun is a phenomenon that exists north of the Arctic circle and south of the Antarctic circle It means that the sun on parts of the year is visible the whole night long

There are no people living permanently south of the Antarctic Circle but in Alaska Canada Norway Sweden Finland Russia and some other countries it is possible to watch the Midnight sun in the summer

The opposite of the Midnight sun is the Polar night

The Most Noble Order of the Garter is an English order of chivalry It was started in 1348 by King Edward III of England The Order is the highest level of knighthood that can be given by the English monarch It is the worlds oldest national order of knighthood Membership in the Order is limited to those people who have done many great things for the United Kingdom

The Order of the Garter is made up of a very small number of people This group includes the Sovereign and no more than 25 full members These members are called Companions Male companions are called Knight Companions Female members are called Lady Companions There are also a number of extra members known as Supernumerary Knights and Ladies These members are usually members of the British Royal family and monarchs of other countries Unlike other British Orders the Sovereign is the only person who decides who is chosen to be a member of the Order of the Garter

HD DVD also known as High Definition DVD is an optical disc that is able to store large amounts of data such as high definition videos It was considered to be the successor of the DVD It used to compete against the Blu ray Disc a similar version of an optical disc that is designed to hold large amounts of media but all of the companies that backed it decided to only use Blu Ray discs so the HD DVD format is now considered dead

Immortality or eternal life is the idea of something which is alive that will stay alive forever The opposite of immortality is mortality which means a living thing can die Right now only a small number of living things are known to be immortal These are mainly simple lower forms of life like bacteria Stories about immortal people or animals are popular in fiction and mythology but not yet actually possible 

Some people are using science to look for a way to make immortality possible Other people feel that death is what defines all living things and as a natural part of life should not be taken away

Insurance actuaries have calculated that even if everyone were physically immortal the average life span would still be only be 400 years because of the accident rate of about five percent per year eventually everyone would die of a fatal accident and it would be very unusual to encounter anyone more than 800 years old Therefore it would seem that the only practical way to achieve actual immortality is to upload ones mind into a supercomputer to live in virtual reality Futurists such as Ray Kurzweil believe this will become possible about the year 2045 in the technological singularity

The color amaranth represents immortality in Western civilization while the color peach represents immortality in Chinese civilization

The European Union has an independent parliament and civil service which is distinct from those of the 27 member states It has to pay for broken wikt linkexpenditureexpenditure on common policies throughout the EU Therefore the EU has an agreed budget of 862 billion for the period 2007 2013 By comparison the UK expenditure for 2004 alone was estimated at about 759 billion

The EU has three elements to its government the Council of Ministers the European Commission and the European Parliament All three take a part in setting the annual budget

The EU obtains most of its revenue indirectly by payments from treasuries of member states Revenue is divided into three categories

Traditional own resources are taxes raised on behalf of the EU as a whole principally import duties on goods brought into the EU These are collected by the state where import occurs and passed on to the EU States are allowed to keep a proportion of the revenue to cover administration

VAT based own resources are taxes on EU citizens as a proportion of VAT in each member country VAT rates and exemptions vary in different countries so a formula is used to create the harmonised tax base The starting point for calculations is the total VAT raised in a country 

GNI based own resources currently forms the largest contribution to EU funding A simple multiplier is applied to the calculated GNI for the country concerned Revenue is currently capped at 124 of GNI for the EU as a whole

The largest single expenditure item is the Common Agricultural Policy at around 45 of the total budget The second largest element is the regional policy at 30 Foreign policy consumes 8 administration 6 research 5

Columbia University in the City of New York is a research university in the United States It is mainly located in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of the Borough of Manhattan in New York City It is one of the eight Ivy League universities

The university was created as Kings College by the Church of England It got a royal charter in 1754 from King George II of Great Britain It was the first college in New York and the fifth college in the Thirteen Colonies After the American Revolution it was run by the state from 1784 1787 In 1787 the university was placed under a private board of trustees A board of trustees runs the university to this day 

Columbia is home to the Pulitzer Prize For over a century the Pulitzer has been given to people for very good work in journalism literature and music Columbia is where FM radio was created The school is where the foundation of modern genetics was discovered Its Morningside Heights campus was the first North American site where the uranium atom was split 

The Columbian Exchange is one of the most important events in history It was the exchange of goods and ideas from Europe Africa and Asia and goods and ideas from the Americas It also spread different diseases It started in 1492 when Christopher Columbus arrived in the West Indies

This exchange of plants and animals changed European American African and Asian ways of life Foods that had never been seen before by people became a major part of what they ate For example before 1492 no potatoes were grown outside of South America By the 1840s Ireland was so dependent on the potato that a diseased crop led to the devastating Irish Potato Famine The first European import to the Americas the horse changed the lives of many Native American tribes on the Great Plains letting them to change to a nomadic lifestyle based on hunting bison on horseback Italy became fanous for its Tomato sauce made from New World tomatoes while coffee from Africa and sugarcane from Asia became the main crops of very large Latin American plantations Also the chili and Paprika from South America was introduced in India by the Portuguese and it is today an important part of Indian cuisine

Before the Columbian Exchange there were no oranges in Florida no bananas in Ecuador no paprika in Hungary no zucchini in Italy no pineapples in Hawaii no rubber trees in Africa no cattle in Texas no Chili peppers in Thailand and India no cigarettes in France and no chocolate in Switzerland Even the dandelion was brought to America by Europeans for use as an herb 

Before there was regular communication between the two hemispheres the different types of domesticated animals and diseases were much larger in the Old World than in the New This partly led to the horrible effects of Old World diseases on Native American tribes Smallpox probably caused in the highest death toll for Native Americans  

Barely any civilization on earth stayed the same by this global ecological exchange

Elliott Carter is an American composer He is one of the most important composers of classical music of his time He experimented with new ideas of composition Although he is now one hundred years old he is still composing today He recently composed a piece called Interventions for Piano and Orchestra which was given its first performance in the Symphony Hall Boston where it was played by the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by James Levine with the pianist Daniel Barenboim as soloist The same players played it again a week later on 11 December 2008 in the Carnegie Hall New York to celebrate Carters 100th birthday 

Elliott Carter was born in New York The composer Charles Ives noticed his talent and gave him encouragement taking him to concerts Carter studied English and music at Harvard University He then went to Paris to study with Nadia Boulanger returning to the USA in 1935 where he directed the Ballet Caravan 

In 1939 he married The couple had one son

He wrote a ballet called Pocahontas In 1940 the suite from this ballet got him the Juilliard Publication Award From then on his got many more important awards and prizes for his music

Carter has taught music and other related subjects in a number of well known places including the Peabody Conservatory Columbia University Queens College New York Yale University and the Julliard School He has received honorary doctorates from many universities and honours from many countries

He has not written a large number of compositions but the ones he has written are important works

When Carter went to study in Paris in the early 1930s Stravinsky was the most famous composer who worked there Carter was influenced to some extent by Stravinskys music as well as by that of his friend Charles Ives but he worked hard to find a style of his own Some of his music during the Second World War is quite tonal but his later music uses more atonality and has complicated rhythms His best known works include the Variations for Orchestra the Double Concerto for harpsichord piano and two chamber orchestras the Piano Concerto written as an 85th birthday present for Igor Stravinsky the Concerto for Orchestra and A Symphony of Three Orchestras

Dubrovnik is a city in Croatia called until last century Ragusa It lies on the Adriatic Sea About 50000 people lived there in 2001 The old city of Dubrovnik has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site The Italian name of the city is Ragusa this sometimes leads to confusion because there is already a city named Ragusa on Sicily

The old city of Ragusa was founded by romanized Illiryans after the barbarian invasions in the VI century Ragusa of Dalmatia grew to be an important maritime republic called Republic of Ragusa This republic lasted until Napoleon times

Ragusa originally was the only neolatin city of Dalmatia not dominated by the Republic of Venice but after the Middle Ages started to be populated more and more by Croats and Serbs from inland areas of Bosnia Herzegovina The original neolatin population was reduced to the few people of the ragusean aristocracy and in the XIX nearly all the people living in Ragusa were Slavs Ragusa of Dalmatia changed name to Dubrovnik after 1918 when the city was entered in the newly created Yugoslavia

Contemporary Dubrovnik is one of the main touristic destinations in Croatia Dubrovnik is famous for its Old Town  this is an ancient fortress with large stone walls which helped Dubrovnik people to maintain its liberty during many centuries

Sichuan pepper is a part of a fruit of a plant that is used as a spice Usually the outer pods of a number of species in the genus Zanthoxylum are used to make the spice Most commonly these plants are Z piperitum Z simulans Z sancho or Z schinifolium Many people in Asia grow them for the spice Although the plants are called pepper they are not related to either black pepper or Chili pepper Sichuan pepper is widely used in the cuisine of Sichuan China from which it takes its name as well as Tibetan Bhutani and Japanese cuisines among others

Sichuan pepper is known in Chinese as hujio a lesser used name is shnjio broken wikt linkbroken wikt link literally mountain pepper In Japanese it is sansh using the same Chinese characters as shanjiao In Tibetan it is known as gyer ma In America it is sold as fagara or flower pepper as well as Sichuan pepper

Sichuan pepper has a unique aroma and taste This taste is compeletely different from that of black or white pepper or chile pepper It tastes a little like lemon It also creates a special feeling in the mouth a kind of numbness This is cause by a chemical called hydroxy alpha sanshool Sichan pepper contains up to 3 of this substance 

Recipes often say that sichuan pepper should be slightly toasted then crushed before it is added to food Only the hull are used in cooking the seeds are ignored or thrown away In general Sichuan pepper is added at the last moment

Star anise and ginger are often used with it and it figures prominently in spicy Sichuan cuisine It is considered to go well with fish duck and chicken dishes as well as with fried eggplant It has an alkaline pH and a numbing effect on the lips when eaten in larger doses Ma la a flavour common in Sichuan cooking is a combination of Sichuan pepper and chili pepper

It is also available as an oil In this form it is best used in stir fry noodle dishes without hot spices The preferred recipe includes ginger oil and brown sugar to be cooked with a base of noodles and vegetables with rice vinegar and Sichuan pepper oil to be added after cooking

Hua jiao yan is a mixture of salt and Sichuan pepper roasted and browned in a wok and served as a condiment to accompany chicken duck and pork dishes The peppercorns can also be lightly fried in order to make a spicy oil with various uses

Sichuan pepper is one of the few spices which are important for Tibetan and Bhutanese cookery of the Himalayas This is because few spices can be grown there One Himalayan specialty is the momo a dumpling stuffed with vegetables cottage cheese or minced yak meat beef or pork and flavoured with Sichuan pepper garlic ginger and onion The noodles are steamed and served dry together with a fiery sauce Tibetans believe it can sanitize meat that may not be so fresh In reality it may only serve to mask foul flavors Perhaps it is because of the foul smell masking property of Sichuan pepper that made it popular in dishes made of visceral organs of slaughtered animals

In Japan the dried and powdered leaves of Zanthoxylum sancho are used to make noodle dishes and soups mildly hot and fragrant The whole leaves kinome are used to flavour vegetables especially bamboo shoots and to decorate soups The buds seeds flowers and hulls are also used

Sichuan peppercorns are one of the traditional ingredients in the Chinese spice mixture five spice powder and also shichimi togarashi a Japanese seven flavour seasoningFactdateFebruary 2007

In Korean cuisine two species are used Z piperitum and Z schinifolium

The genus name Zanthoxylum or Xanthoxylum comes from the Greek xanthon xylon meaning blond wood

From 1968 to 2005 the United States Food and Drug Administration banned the importation of Sichuan peppercorns because they were found to be capable of carrying citrus canker This bacterial disease which is very difficult to control could potentially harm the foliage and fruit of citrus crops in the US It was never an issue of harm in human consumption The import ban was only loosely enforced until 2002 In 2005 the USDA and FDA lifted the ban provided the peppercorns are heated to around 70 degrees Celsius to kill the canker bacteria before importation

It is possible to come across names such as Szechwan pepper Chinese pepper Japanese pepper Aniseed pepper Sprice pepper Chinese prickly ash Fagara Sansho Nepal pepper Indonesian lemon pepper and others sometimes referring to specific species within this group since this plant is not well known enough in the West to have an established name

Sichuan pepper is unrelated to black pepper and to Chili peppers which are also widely used in Sichuan cookery

In Nepal where it is extensively used it is known as timur

A spice called teppal is used in the Indian states of Maharashtra Karnataka and Goa by a very small community called Konkanis an official language of Goa and spoken in many parts of these three states Teppal is a fruit which grows on trees full of thorns It grows in bunches like grapes Fresh fruits are parrot green in color and are used as a flavouring agent in many curries made with a paste of coconut chilis and other spices The fruit is seasonal and available during the monsoon period When dried the flesh of the fruit hardens turns to brownish black color and opens up to show the black seeds within The seeds are discarded and the dried fruit is stored in containers for use around the year This spice is mostly used in fish preparations and a few vegetarian dishes with the coconut masala This spice has a very strong woody aroma and is discarded at the time of eating the vegetablefish curry This tree is also called by the name gamathe haralu in Kannada and koili kaya in Malayalam

 

Corresponding to most kinds of particle there is an associated antiparticle with the same mass and opposite charges 

Even electrically neutral particles such as the neutron are not identical to their antiparticle In the example of the neutron the ordinary particle is made out of quarks and the antiparticle out of antiquarks

Particle antiparticle pairs can annihilate each other if they are in appropriate quantum states They can also be produced in various processes These processes are used in todays particle accelerators to create new particles and to test theories of particle physics High energy processes in nature can create antiparticles These are visible in cosmic rays and in certain nuclear reactions The word antimatter properly refers to antiparticles composite antiparticles made with them and to larger assemblies of either

In 1932 soon after the prediction of positrons by Paul Dirac Carl D Anderson found that cosmic ray collisions produced these particles in a cloud chamber a particle detector in which moving electrons leave behind trails as they move through the gas 

The antiproton and antineutron were found by Emilio Segr and Owen Chamberlain in 1955 at the University of California Berkeley Since then the antiparticles of many other subatomic particles have been created in particle accelerator experiments In recent years complete atoms of antimatter have been assembled out of antiprotons and positrons collected in electromagnetic traps

Hamo Beknazarian also known as Hamo Bek Nazarov was a Armenian movie director His career in cinema started in 1914 when a friend offered him a part in a movie Between 1914 and 1918 he played about 70 parts becoming a popular actor in pre Revolutionary Russian film In 1920 instead of going to Armenia as he planned he went to Tbilisi where he developed a film department for Georgian Commissioners office of Public Education Many of his movies were filmed in Tbilisi including The Father Murderer and Lost Treasures In 1925 he filmed his first Armenian movie and moved to Armenia In 1933 he made the first Armenian movie to have sound Pepo

Beknazarian also made a few documentary films

The Septuagint is a translation of the Hebrew Bible and other books into the Greek language It was done between the 3rd and 1st century BC in Alexandria It is the oldest of several translations of the Hebrew Bible into Greek The Septuagint has all of the books of the Old Testament and it also has books that Catholics and Orthodox Christians call the Deuterocanon These books are called Apocrypha by Protestants because they do not think these books are sacred

An ancient tradition says that 70 Jewish scholars were each in a different room when they translated the Torah from Hebrew into Greek yet they all wrote down exactly the same text People thought this was a miracle The Latin language word for 70 is septuaginta and the word Septuagint comes from that Another way to write 70 is LXX which is why writers sometimes use that as a short name for Septuagint

The Septuagint was used as the starting point for some later translations of the Bible

The Islamic calendar is a calendar It is used to determine islamic holidays It is a lunar calendar It has 12 months and about 354 days This means that each year the calendar is about 11 days shorter than a solar calendar like the Gregorian Islamic years are often called hijra years because the first year of the calendar when the hijra occurred that is when Muhammad went from Mecca to Medina Each year is therefore labelled with either H or AH

Town privileges were important things They were special treaties or charters used in the Middle Ages In such a charter a sovereign a monarch granted the city special rights These usually included

There were only a few of these charters notable for them was perhaps the Lbeck law the Magdeburg rights and the Kulm law

Medieval music means music from the Middle Ages The time we call the Middle Ages is a long period from about 400 AD to 1400 AD We do not know a great deal about music of this time because it was such a long time ago and music was not often written down Music was used for entertainment It was played at feasts and used for dancing Peddlers shouted or sang to advertise what they were selling All this music is secular There was also sacred music

In Europe there were people who went around the countryside making a living by singing and playing musical instruments They often went to big houses where rich people lived and entertained them with their faces These travelling musicians were called minstrels in England and troubadours or trouvres in many other countries or Minnesinger in Germany

The minstrels often sang long songs which told stories This was a way to tell people about what was happening in the world Some of the stories were made up they were about love or about mythology

Richard the Lionheart was a keen musician He wrote many songs in the style of the trouvres On the way back from a Crusade he was captured by Leopold of Austria The story goes that his attendant Blondel was looking for him everywhere Then he heard Richards voice singing a tune which he knew and so he found him The song that he was singing was called Ja Nuns Hons Pris

Minstrels very often went with their masters when they went on journeys to battles They also sang at important ceremonies for example when people were being knighted Many of them played instruments such as the lute or fiddle

Minstrels were poets and musicians because they made up their own words and the tunes Sometimes we know the words of these songs because they wrote them down but they did not write the tunes down Walther von der Vogelweide was a famous minnesinger in Germany

One famous tune that was written down is the round Sumer is icumen in It was written down by a monk Monks could often read and write

There were two main types of dances in medieval times line dances and circle dances The farandole is a line dance It was a bit like a modern conga with people following a leader in a line The bransle was a round dance or circle dance The word bransle comes from the French word branler It is pronounced Brawl 

Other dances were the basse dance and estampie

Instruments could be divided into quiet ones which were used indoors and loud ones which were used outside The recorder was a very popular indoor instrument There was also the psaltery and the harp

The bagpipes were loud instruments for outside They were used for dancing They were not as loud as modern Scottish bagpipes They were more like Northumbrian pipes or the French musettes There was also the hurdy gurdy which was played by turning a handle Pipe and tabor were used for Morris dancing

Many medieval plucked string instruments were similar to the modern guitar such as the lute and mandolin The dulcimer and zither were had strings which were hit with sticks These are still popular in East Europe today There were also fiddles and trombones

It was believed that if you were entertained with music while you are eating it would help you digest your food and help keep your heart healthy And people believed that you will not get fat even if you scoffed down a load of food Also eating food while having people dancing for you was believed to have made you fit

Church music was very important The mass was the main form of church music It used the five parts of the mass Kyrie Gloria Credo Sanctus and Agnus Dei The priests in the churches wanted church music to be serious They did not want it to become popular They thought that if people enjoyed it too much they would forget about worshipping God Religious plays had become very popular They told stories from the Bible However the church leaders banned them so they were performed in the streets and squares of the towns

Instruments were also banned in church The church leaders thought that they belonged to the devil Only singing was allowed Gradually however the organ started to be allowed in church It helped people to sing Some organs were very tiny They were called portative organs The large organs that were fixed in place were called positives Bells were also used in church They looked like our sleigh bells

Medieval music was based on plainsong This was a melody which sounded quite free in rhythm Composers started adding a second part to the melody as an accompaniment This was called organum Sometimes it just simply followed the main tune a fourth or fifth below This was called parallel organum In the 12th and 13th centuries the original plainsong started to be put at the bottom It became known as the cantus firmus Sometimes antiphony was used The simplest form of antiphony is when a leader sings something and a group sing something back

The type of plainchant that evolved was called Gregorian chant By the 13th century all other types of chant had been forgotten in Western Europe

Carols became popular at this time At first a carol was a dancing song but often these popular songs became used for songs for particular seasons or festivals In later periods these developed into Christmas carols as we know them

People often went around in groups particularly at Christmas singing at the houses of rich people This was called Wassailing The word means being of good cheer The Boars Head is a well known medieval carol

Mummers were groups of people who performed religious plays They were travelling entertainers They normally wore masks so that people did not know who they were

There are not many musical manuscripts which have survived from the Middle Ages Most of them are religious music They were often written using a system called neumes The pitch of the music is shown by the neumes but the rhythms were not very clear Gradually the system of writing music we know today was evolving Philippe de Vitry was an important composer and music theorist He developed ways of writing rhythms

Most of the medieval music we know today belongs to the last part of the Middle Ages There was a tradition known as the Notre Dame school This music dates from around 1150 to 1250 It was the time that great cathedrals were being built in Gothic architecture The cathedral of Notre Dame was a very famous example The music of this time was called Ars antique It used a system of rhythms called rhythmic modes Gradually a new way of writing was used This was called Ars nova The most famous composer of this time was Guillaume de Machaut He developed a kind of composition called the isorhythmic motet He wrote a lot of songs called chansons Other types of song were called rondeau ballade and virelai 

Composers who were born at the end of the Middle Ages such as John Dunstable Guillaume Dufay and Gilles Binchois are often thought to belong to the next period in music history the Renaissance period

The neolithic is the youngest part of the Stone Age The word neolithic comes from two words in Greek neo meaning new and lithic meaning stone The neolithic period is the time when farming was invented and when people started caring for animals such as cows sheep and pigs The neolithic starts at different times in different places since not everyone started farming at the same time After the neolithic period comes the Bronze Age

A crotchet or quarter note is a note played for one fourth of a whole note Quarter notes are written as a filled in oval note head and a straight flagless stem The stem usually points up if it is below the middle line of the stave or down if it is on or above the middle line

When beginners start to learn to play an instrument they are often taught that one crotchet lasts for one beat That is because they are learning pieces with simple time signatures It is however important to remember that other note lengths can also be treated as one beat depending on the time signature

Burzum is a Black metalDark ambient one man band from Bergen Norway The band was formed in 1991 by Varg Vikernes He is serving a prison sentence for the murder of Mayhem guitarist ystein Aarseth and arson of churches

John Collins is a Scottish footballer He is currently the manager of Charleroi Collins played for Celtic in the early 1990s 

The Norwegian black metal band Mayhem was founded in 1984 by guitarist ystein Aarseth bass guitarist Jrn Stubberud and drummer Kjetil Manheim The band name is taken from the Venom song Mayhem with Mercy During the early years the band used either session vocalists Messiah or Maniac for livestudio commitments and played either instrumentally or with Necrobutcher or Euronymous on vocals during rehearsals

By late 1987 both Manheim and Maniac had left the band their positions were filled temporarily by members of Vomit before vocalist Dead and drummer Hellhammer took over in 1988

Dead committed suicide in 1991 by shooting himself in the mouth with a shotgun after cutting his wrists with a knife The shells were given to him by Varg Vikernes who knew that Dead used to practice with a shotgun in the forest close to the house where the members of Mayhem lived His body along with a suicide note saying Excuse all the blood was discovered in his room Euronymous took some pictures of the suicide scene A legend was born and it was said that Euronymous had cooked and eaten pieces of Deads brain It was also said that fragments of Deads skull had been collected and made into necklaces that both Euronymous and Hellhammer wore as a tribute to Dead Of course it is doubtful that the truth was as macabre as people would like to believe regarding the cannibalism but it is a confirmed fact that necklaces were made and that pictures were taken

With the media and police attention following Deads suicide Necrobutcher decided to leave the band Dead was replaced by Occultus ex singer of Thyabhorrent and partner of Euronymous in the Helvete shop He sang and played bass in Mayhem for a few months but soon left With the bands need for musicians Varg Vikernes joined as bassist and even participated in De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas album

On August 10th 1993 Varg Vikernes murdered Euronymous in his apartment with Snorre W Ruch acting as an accomplice Their relationship before the murder was tense as their friendship and musical relationship started going downhill Vikernes who had started to play bass in Mayhem killed him due to a number of alleged reasons over a girl jealousy of Euronymouss position in the Inner Circle Euronymous owing him money Euronymous not releasing Burzums albums on time Euronymous was found in his underwear with stab wounds inflicted with a knife Varg was rumoured to try and outdo the murder Faust of Emperor committed At his trial Vikernes came into court with his long hair made into pigtails and denying his involvement in Euronymouss death He giggled and laughed throughout the trial He was convicted of the murder and was sentenced to 21 years in prison When police arrested Vikernes he was found with over 150 kilograms of stolen dynamite and alleged plans to destroy Nidarosdomen a large Christian church in Trondheim on a religious holiday Although Varg Vikernes has a different story to the reasons for killing Euronymous

After the trial Euronymouss parents asked Hellhammer to remove the bass lines that Varg had recorded He told them he would record new bass lines himself but the truth is that he didnt know how to play the instrument so the album remained the same featuring Varg on it Other rumours about Occultus playing the new bass lines are also false he never played a note with the band during his time in Mayhem according to Hellhammer

Their gigs featured heavy atmospheric effects such as severed pig heads impaled on wooden spikes Deads clothes were buried daysweeks before the show and were exhumed decayed soiled and full of insects Pieces of rotting meat were thrown into the audience and given to people to devour or rip on the spot Dead ravens were placed in a bag so Dead could continually smell decay and death Members were also noted to cut themselves onstage

Further information can be found in the book Lords Of Chaos and the documentary Once Upon A Time In Norway

Interesting fact Euronymous is responsible for getting many nowadays famous bands into black metal andor influenced them to change their musical style from death metal to black metal Hes considered to be responsible for sparking the whole Norwegian black metal movement and making it what it is today

Despite once playing in the strongly anti Christian band Mayhem early vocalist Kittil Kittilsen left the music scene around 2000 and became a fundamentalist Christian and warns people of the dangers of playing in a rockpop band regardless of what the lyricsideology is about

Renaissance music is European music written from about the year 1400 to 1600 This section of time is called the Renaissance a word which means rebirth The Renaissance comes between the Middle Ages and the Baroque times

Putting music into time sections does not mean that there were quick changes of type Music changed slowly Early Renaissance music was similar to Medieval music Slowly music writers started to try new ideas A lot of medieval church music had become very hard with lots of rules about rhythms and clashes of notes to make dissonances A lot of Renaissance composers wrote music which was smoother and more gentle The music was still polyphonic with each voice having a share of melody Music was starting to become less modal and more tonal By the time the Baroque period started composers were using a system of major and minor keys like we do today

In church music composers wrote many masses and motets The 16th century also saw the birth of the madrigal secular songs which were often about love The madrigal started in Italy and became very popular for a short while in England from the 1280s There were lots of other secular songs such as the chanson canzonetta and villanelle Songs were often accompanied by a flute Music was an essential part of civic religious and courtly life in the Renaissance The rich interchange of ideas in Europe as well as political economic and religious events in the period 14001600 led to major changes in styles of composing methods of disseminating music new musical genres and the development of musical instruments The most important music of the early Renaissance was composed for use by the churchpolyphonic masses and motets in Latin for important churches and court chapels By the end of the sixteenth century however patronage was split among many areas the Catholic Church Protestant churches and courts wealthy amateurs and music printingall were sources of income for composers

An important development during the Renaissance was music notation Many musicians wrote books about music theory They are useful for us because they tell us how music sounded in those days and what people thought about it Music started to be written on a music stave with five lines There were still no barlines in early Renaissance music Notes were written with white note heads eg the minim was at one time the shortest note that could be written Only later did crochets and quavers come in This does not mean that music was slow in those days it was just the way it was written

Key signatures had not yet been invented Sharps and flats were sometimes shown by accidentals Very often however the performers were expected to know or even decide for themselves the sharps and flats

Another very important discovery at this time was music printing Music printing started in Italy in the mid 16th century It soon spread to other countries It now became possible for a lot of people to buy music and sing and play it for themselves

In the early 15th century there was a group of composers known now as the Burgundian School Guillaume Dufay was the most famous Their music sounded a little bit like medieval music 

Towards the end of the 15th century a style of polyphonic sacred music had been developed that can be heard in the masses of Johannes Ockeghem and Jacob Obrecht Ockeghem even composed one piece in which all the parts develop from one idea which was used as a canon

In the 16th century composers started to write music with a clear beat and regular pulse These included Josquin des Prez and others from the Franco Flemish School The was a Roman school to which the famous Italian Giovanni da Palestrina belonged His way of writing polyphony has been a model for that style for many centuries Music students still have to study Palestrina technique Although church music at this time is mainly polyphonic it also has homophonic passages where the voices sing the same words together This helps to make important words really clear

In Venice from about 1534 until around 1600 a polychoral style developed Choirs were separated singing from different parts of the church often from galleries This grand music sounded beautiful in big churches such as the Basilica San Marco di Venezia These composers are often called the Venetian School Andrea Gabrieli and later his nephew Giovanni Gabrieli wrote this kind of music and later Claudio Monteverdi who started in the Renaissance and lived into the Baroque period

The change to the Baroque musical style happened around 1600 This was the time when opera was invented This needed a new style of composing The composer Monteverdi wrote in the Renaissance style until about 1600 when he changed to the Baroque style

Musica ficta is a term used in medieval and Renaissance music It means that when musicians play or sing music they put in accidentals which are not written in the music

In those days music used modes instead of the modern system of major and minor keys Sometimes the music would not sound right unless a note was sharpened or flattened For example to go down from the note B to an F would have sounded bad so the F would need to be an F sharp The composer who wrote the music down might not bother to put the sign for F sharp He would expect the performer to know that it should be an F sharp and not an F This is what is called musica ficta

The question mark is a punctuation mark that is used at the end of a sentence when asking a question

The symbol is thought to come from the Latin qustio meaning question which was shortened to Qo The uppercase Q was written above the lowercase o and this mark was turned into the symbol that we use today

Another guess about where question mark comes from says that it comes from the 9th century when it was a point followed by the curved part written slanted

Some writers put a space between the end of their sentence and the question mark This is thought to come from a French practice and is called French spacing In French a space is always put before question marks exclamation marks colons and semicolons In English however using this space is thought of as bad form The Oxford English Dictionary does not encourage it Some English books do have these spaces but are often a very thin space which are not full spaces but an attempt to make the words easier to read

In computing the question mark character is represented by ASCII code 63 and is located at Unicode code point U003F The full width equivalent is located at Unicode code point UFF1F

An electrical circuit is a path which electrons from a voltage or current source follow Electric current flows in a closed path called an electric circuit The point where those electrons enter an electrical circuit is called the source of electrons The point where the electrons leave an electrical circuit is called the return or earth ground The exit point is called the return because electrons always end up at the source when they complete the path of an electrical circuit The part of an electrical circuit that is between the electrons starting point and the point where they return to the source is called an electrical circuits load

Electrical circuits usually use alternating current sources The load of an electrical circuit may be as simple as the wiring for a house with outlet boxes to which electrical appliances like refrigerators televisions or microwave ovens can be connected as loads But the loads for electrical circuits can also be quite complicated such as the load upon the output of a hydroelectric power generating station

Electronic circuits usually use low voltage direct current sources The load of an electronic circuit may be as simple as a few resistors capacitors and a lamp all connected together to create the flash in a digital camera Or an electronic circuit can be complicated connecting thousands of resistors capacitors and transistors to create the microprocessors that make computers possible

Electrical and electronic circuits can be complicated Making a drawing of the connections to all the component parts in the circuits load makes it easier to understand how circuit components are connected Drawings for electronic circuits are called circuit diagrams Drawings for electrical circuits are called wiring diagrams Circuit diagrams and wiring diagrams are usually drawn by skilled draftsmen and then printed But they can also be simple pencil sketches drawn by technicians or other workers

Wiring and circuit diagrams use special symbols recognized by everyone who uses the drawings The symbols on the drawings show how components like resistors capacitors inductors motors outlet boxes lights switches and other electrical and electronic components are connected together The diagrams are a big help when workers try to find out why a circuit does not work correctly

The current flowing in an electrical or electronic circuit can be suddenly increased when a component part fails The increase in current can cause serious damage to other components in the circuit Or the failure can create a fire hazard To protect the other components or to prevent a fire hazard a device called a circuit breaker can be wired into a circuit The circuit breaker will open or break the circuit in which it is installed when the current in that circuit becomes too high

The standard return for electrical and electronic circuits is the earth ground When an improperly designed electrical or electronic device fails it may open the return circuit to the earth ground The user of the device could become a part of the devices electrical circuit by providing a return path for the electrons through the users body instead of the circuits earth ground When the users body becomes part of an electrical circuit the user can be seriously shocked or even killed by electrocution

To prevent the danger of electrical shock and the possibility of electrocution ground fault interrupt devices detect open circuits to earth ground in attached electrical or electronic devices When an open circuit to earth ground is detected the GFI device immediately opens the voltage source to the device GFI devices are similar to circuit breakers but are designed to protect humans rather than circuit components

Huldrych Zwingli or Ulricus Zuinglius was the leader of the Protestant Reformation in Switzerland and founder of the Swiss Reformed Churches Separately from Martin Luther Zwingli arrived with similar final beliefs He did this by studying the Bible from the point of view of a humanist scholar Zwinglis father was named Ulrich Zwingli also and his mother was named Margaret Meili Zwingli had 2 sisters and 7 brothers

Zwingli was born in Toggenburg Wildhaus St Gallen Switzerland to an important family of the middle class 

Zwinglis Reformation was supported by the judge and people of Zrich It led to major changes in the lives of the people and state matters in Zrich

Zwingli was killed at Kappel am Albis in a battle against the Roman Catholic cantons of Switzerland

20th century classical music is classical music written during the last century During earlier periods of music history composers from different countries wrote in styles which were often quite similar For example composers in the Classical music period had fairly similar ideas about what forms to use what instruments should be used in orchestras or how to write good tunes

Classical music from the 20th century is extremely varied There are lots of different schools as lots of composers had their own ideas about how to compose in ways that were different from what had been done before A lot of these genres had names ending in ism there was serialism Expressionism Neoclassicism Impressionism as well as jazz world music and folksong and later on electronic music and then Minimalism and even post modernism

The names of periods in history were usually given to them many years afterwards For example the term Middle Ages was not used until long after the Middle Ages had finished It is difficult to know what to call the period we live in now In music people often talk about Modern Music meaning any music written after 1900 We also talk about Contemporary Music meaning more or less the same thing Now that the 21st century has started some musicians are starting to talk about 20th century music and a period called Contemporary Music

This article will discuss classical music written from 1900 to the present day

Many European composers at the beginning of the 20th century felt that the system of tonality had been used for so long that it was time to do create a new approach and try something different Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky were two of the most important composers at that time and they had very different ideas about how to compose music 

Schoenbergs music became very atonal Eventually he developed what he called twelve tone music This was atonal music which was organized by putting the notes of a musical idea in a particular order which could be changed in many ways during the piece This way of organizing music is called serialism Many composers were influenced by Schoenberg especially Alban Berg and Anton von Webern

Stravinsky came from Russia He was inspired by Russian culture He wrote some music for a ballet called Rite of Spring This music was very new It had very irregular rhythms which the dancers found very difficult to dance to at first It also used polytonality Later on Stravinsky was inspired by music from the 18th century He used it but made changes to it adding dissonant notes and strange chords This is called neoclassicism Stravinskys music seemed to many people to be the opposite of serialism but in his last years Stravinsky started to use serialism as well

In France a movement called Impressionism was popular with painters Composers were very interested in these paintings Claude Debussy wrote music which is often called Impressionistic The ideas of clear tonality are often deliberately blurred He uses interesting chords just for the sound that they make He used the whole tone scale and pentatonic scale and was inspired by Javanese music Maurice Ravels music is sometimes similar although he developed his own style Later French composers include Olivier Messiaen who used a system of new scales which he called Modes of limited transposition He was also interested in music from around the world and he also used bird song in his music

While all this was happening there were some composers who continued to write in a style which was basically Romantic Edward Elgar s music is often described as Edwardian Other British composers of the time were also inspired by English folkmusic ie Ralph Vaughan Williams George Butterworth Roger Quilter and Gerald Finzi Frederick Delius wrote Romantic music which was also quite Impressionistic The Russian Sergei Rachmaninoff and the German Richard Strauss continued to write in a Romantic style until their deaths in the 1940s The Finnish composer Jean Sibelius and the Dane Carl Nielsen wrote great symphonies which were still in a tonal style and in Italy Puccini was writing operas in a Romantic style often called verismo

In Russia which became the Soviet Union after the 1917 Revolution composers were not allowed to be experimental It was difficult for them because they had to please the politicians who told them that their music should reflect Socialist realism The great tradition of writing symphonies continued with Sergei Prokofiev and Shostakovich

The Hungarian composer Bla Bartk developed a modern style influenced by folk music from his country and other East European countries His music is often quite neoclassical for example the famous Concerto for Orchestra

In the mid 20th century a group of composers known as the Darmstadt School continued to write music which was based on serialism This included Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen Many of them including both Boulez and Stockhausen also experimented with electronic music The term Avant Garde is often used to describe their music It means music that is new and modern

In America jazz was a big influence on classical composers George Gershwins music is half way between jazz and classical Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein used jazz elements in their music In Europe many composer used ideas from jazz eg Maurice Ravel and Kurt Weill Other American composers were more modern and experimental eg Charles Ives and John Cage who is famous for using a prepared piano

Around the 1960s some composers thought that a lot of music was getting too complicated Music of the avant garde school such as Edgard Varse Elliott Carter Milton Babbitt was becoming too difficult for people to understand People found it too mathematical and intellectual They wanted music with feeling and emotion A group of composers developed a style called Minimalism which uses music based around a simple idea which repeats itself again and again but gradually changes Steve Reich Philip Glass Terry Riley John Cage and to some extent John Adams all used minimalist techniques It was a reaction against music that had become too complicated

While all these different schools of thought were coming and going there were still some composers who managed to keep to a more traditional path and find new ways to use tonality in their music The greatest figure in British music was Benjamin Britten who was an eclectic composer  Two other great composers were Michael Tippett and William Walton who each developed their own style  In America there were composers such as Samuel Barber Roy Harris and Alan Hovhaness In Germany Paul Hindemith was one of the most important composers Like Kurt Weill he often wrote music which had a political purpose but Weills music is more jazz inspired

In music dynamics means how loud or quiet the music is

In written music the dynamics are shown by letters which stand for Italian words for the dynamic levels They are listed in the table below Notice that piano is pronounced the Italian way

 

  

   Use more than two ps or fs to show that the music is very very quiet or very very loud Tchaikovsky sometimes used five ps or fs though only up to three are normally found in sheet music

Dynamic levels are not something that can be measured Exactly Exactly how loud mp should be depends on several things what is happening in the music the instrument the size of the room in which the music is being played etc The important thing is that dynamic levels should be correct in relation to one another

Some composers are very precise about writing the dynamics they want Others leave a lot to the performer to decide Historically composers several centuries ago such as Bach only wrote occasional dynamic marks Even Mozart only wrote a few mostly p and f By the 19th century composers were writing dynamics in much more detail in their music

Sometimes accents are shown by marks similar to dynamic marks Sforzando means a strong sudden accent and is abbreviated as sf sfz or fz The notation fp means a sforzando followed immediately by piano

The terms crescendo and diminuendo mean a gradual getting louder or softer They can also be shown by signs known as hairpins A hairpin opening out is a crescendo one which closes is a diminuendo

For a quick change in dynamics molto cresc and molto dim are often used For slow changes poco a poco cresc and poco a poco dim are used

Grana Padano is a kind of hard cheese It is a kind of parmesan cheese The name comes from the noun grana which refers to the distinctively grainy texture of the cheese and the adjective Padano which refers to the river Po

Grana Padano was created by the Cistercian monks of Chiaravalle They used ripened cheese as a way of preserving extra milk By the year 1477 it was regarded as one of the most famous cheeses of Italy Today this product is made in the regions of Piedmont Lombardy and Veneto and in the province of Trento

Like Parmigiano Reggiano Grana Padano is a semi fat hard cheese which is cooked and ripened slowly It is produced by curdling the milk of grass fed cows The cows are milked twice a day the milk is left to stand and then partially creamed It is produced all year round and the quality can vary seasonally as well as by year

A wheel of Grana Padano is cylindrical with slightly convex or almost straight sides and flat faces It measures 35 to 45 cm in diameter and 15 to 18 cm in height It weighs 24 to 40 kg The rind which is thin is white or straw yellow

The North American Free Trade Agreement is a trade agreement between Mexico the United States and Canada The agreement was signed by US President George HW Bush Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Mexican President Carlos Salinas on December 17 1992 in San Antonio Texas and took effect on January 1 1994 It removed taxes on products traded between the United States Canada and Mexico It also protects copyright patents and trademarks between those three countries It was updated with the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation which helped set more environment regulations and helped reduce pollution It was also updated with the North American Agreement for Labor Cooperation which helped people fight for better labor conditions

Since it took away taxes between products traded between the US Canada and Mexico Mexico has been buying more products from the US It saved US companies on the cost of selling stuff to Mexico and it saved Mexican companies on the cost of buying things from US companies 

A benefit of the bill is that labels on stuff exchanged between the three countries come in French English and Spanish That way Mexicans and Americans who speak Spanish can read the Spanish label Americans and Canadians can read the English label and Canadians who speak French can read the French label

NAFTA also encourages more immigration from Mexico to the US Since small businesses can no longer be protected by tariffs many small business owners in Mexico cannot compete with the prices of subsidized products from the US and therefore many of them have gone under As a result many Mexicans have gone to the US looking for work The human rights organization EZLN a revolutionary Mexican grass roots movement is a stark opponent of NAFTA and points out how its provisions only make the economic situation worse for the poorest in Mexico and better for multi national corporations

Objectivity in science means that scientific measurement can be tested independent from the individual scientist who proposes them 

To be properly considered objective the results of measurement must be communicated from person to person and then demonstrated for third parties as an advance in understanding of the objective world Such demonstrable knowledge would ordinarily confer demonstrable powers of prediction or technological construction

To avoid the variety in subjective interpretation of quantifying terms such as green hot large considerable and negligible scientists strive where possible to eliminate human senses by use of standartized measuring tools and mechanicalelectronic measuring instruments for performing the actual measuring process eliminating much of the perceptive variability of individual observers The results of measurements are expressed on a numerical scale of standard units  so that everybody else understands them the same way Where data must need be used the ideal is to use hard objective criteria for assigning the classifications such that different classifiers would produce the same assignments

Many times the chance to get a new song issued as an A side creates competition between members of bands or teams of songwriters John Lennon and Paul McCartney of the Beatles tried to write better songs than each other to get more A sides than the other George Harrison also a Beatle rarely had his songs chosen for singles but had a hit with Something for the band 

In the days of vinyl singles broken wikt linkroyaltyroyalties for both A and B sides were paid equally Many listeners never played B sides more than once and radio focused on A sides Many people who made recordings knew this and used it to earn extra money from sales or to promote other music they made Phil Spector sometimes used short broken wikt linkjam sessionjam sessions by his studio band as B sides to singles he produced 

Michael Nesmith of the Monkees wanted his songs to appear on Monkees singles He would settle for B sides if he could not get an A side Don Kirshner who oversaw the bands early music wanted the B sides to come from other songwriters who worked for him Nesmith and Kirshner disagreed and it caused tension for the Monkees and their company

Records that include more than two or three songs are usually called EPs and may include four or more distinct songs but not as many as on an album

Objectivity is a significant principle of journalistic professionalism 

Objectivity may mean fairness disinterestedness factuality and nonpartisanship The term has not only a single meaning because journalists and the public use it in these different ways In many countries advocacy journalism is considered as a legitimate sort of professional journalism

Few journalists would make a claim to total neutrality or impartiality However most try to keep distance from their own personal biases in their news work In Discovering the News sociologist Michael Schudson argues that the belief in objectivity is a faith in facts a distrust in values and a commitment to their segregation In the United States an objective story is typically considered to be one that steers a middle path between two poles of political rhetoric 

Journalism without any bias as if one just came to Earth from another planet and had no opinions about our behavior or ways is rarely practiced although some argue it would lead to radical changes in reporting

Sharia is the body of Islamic law The term means way or path it is the legal framework within which the public and some private aspects of life are regulated for those living in a legal system based on Muslim principles of jurisprudence

Sharia deals with all aspects of day to day life including politics economics banking business law contract law sexuality and social issues 

There is not a strictly codified uniform set of laws that can be called Sharia It is more like a system of several laws based on the Quran Hadith and centuries of debate interpretation and precedent

Sharia law is divided into three main sections

See muamalat laws according to 5 major schools of jurisprudence and The Majallah

In accordance with the Quran and several hadith theft is punished by imprisonment or amputation of hands or feet depending on the number of times it was committed and depending on the item of theft However before the punishment is executed two eyewitnesses under oath must say that they saw the person stealing If these witnesses cannot be produced then the punishment cannot be executedIn addition there are several conditions related to the theft stolen items and circumstances All of these must be met under the scrutiny of judicial authoritycite quran538

In accordance with hadith stoning to death is the penalty for married men and women who commit adultery In addition there are several conditions related to the person who commits it that must be met One of the difficult ones is that the punishment cannot be enforced unless there is a confession of the person or four male eyewitnesses who each saw simultaneously the penis of the man inside the vulva of the woman All of these must be met under the scrutiny of judicial authority For unmarried men and women the punishment prescribed in the Quran and hadith is 100 lashes

There are two festivals that are considered Sunnah

Rituals associated with these festivals are

Islamic law does not present a comprehensive list of pure foods and drinks However it sanctions

The prohibition of dead meat is not applicable to fish and locusts Also hadith literature prohibits beasts having sharp canine teeth birds having claws and tentacles in their feet Jallalah tamed donkeys and any piece cut from a living animal

In most interpretations of Sharia conversion by Muslims to other religions is strictly forbidden and is termed apostasy Muslim theology equates apostasy to treason and in most interpretations of sharia the penalty for apostasy is death

In many Muslim countries the accusation of apostasy is even used against non conventional interpretations of the Quran The severe persecution of the famous expert in Arabic literature Prof Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd is an example of this In some countries Sunni and Shia Muslims often accuse each other of apostasy The current civil strife in Iraq is explained by many in terms of the extremely harsh religious opposition between Sunnis and Shias in Iraq



Wadowice is a town in Poland in the mountainous range known as Zakopane region 30 miles southeast of Krakow

A piano duet is a piece of music written for two people to play at one piano It is often called Piano 4 hands

To play piano duets the two players sit with one person on the right and the other person on the left The person on the right is called Primo and the person on the left is called Secondo

Piano duet music is usually printed with the Secondo part on the left hand page and the Primo part on the right hand page Occasionally it is printed with the two parts underneath one another

Playing piano duets is great fun and an excellent way to become a better musician Like all group music making each player has to learn to listen and adapt to what is going on in the other part Sometimes one player will have to take away his or her hand quickly so that the other player can play the same note immediately afterwards Sometimes the players have to cross their hands

A lot of the time the primos part may have both hands written in the treble treble clef and the secondos part may have both hands written in the bass clef This can sometimes be confusing at first

The pedalling is usually done by the secondo player This is because pedalling is very much about keeping chords going and it is the secondo who usually has the chords which give the harmony because these are in the lower part

There are lots of piano duets available for people to play Some of these are simple ones written for beginner pianists Some are written by the great composers

Some pieces that are really supposed to be played by an orchestra have been arranged for piano duet In some cases the composer himself made this arrangement Examples from famous composers include Stravinskys Rite of Spring which is extremely hard to play and Maurice Ravels suite Ma Mre lOie

Some very famous piano duets which were originally written in this form include several sonatas by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart several pieces by Franz Schubert including a Fantasia in f minor Gabriel Faurs Dolly Suite Debussys Petite Suite and Georges Bizets Jeux dEnfants

Some works are written for two people to play together using two pianos These are usually called piano duos Examples include Mozarts Sonata in D major K448 the Sonata op 34 by Johannes Brahms who started to write this first as a piano concerto then a piano duo before eventually turning it into a piano quintet and the Suite op 17 by Rachmaninoff Most piano duos are very hard to play and need very good pianists Piano concertos can be played on two pianos with one player playing the solo part and the other playing the orchestras music

There is also a small repertoire of pieces for three people to play at one piano This is called Piano six hands These pieces are often fun pieces which are not too hard to play although there are examples of serious pieces  see the separate wiki article The three people need to be good friends because it is a bit of a squash The player at the bottom ought to do the pedalling but it may be easier for the middle player to do it

Music described as piano six hands is for three pianists at one piano as distinct from piano duet which is music for two pianists at one piano and from piano trio which is music for piano violin and cello Not much music has been written for this combination although there are several arrangements of music originally written for other forces

Compositions include 5 pieces by Percy Grainger Sergei Rachmaninoffs Romance and Valse Alfred Schnittkes Hommage Carl Czernys op17 and 741 Jean Crass mes denfants Paul Robinsons Pensees and Monmartre various pieces by German composer Armin Fuchs Bulgarian composer Tomislav Baynovs Metrorhythmia 1 John Pittss Are You Going Greek composer Dionysis Boukouvalass Fantasy on a theme by Steve Reich and Canadian composer Paul Frehners Slowdown

Rice wine is a word some people use to talk about alcoholic drinks The word is badly chosen though True wine is made by fermenting grapes and perhaps other fruit In rice wine the starch in the rice is first changed into sugar This sugar is then fermented This process is more like the fermentation as it is done in beer 

The rice wines made in this manner have more alcohol in them than normal wines Beers on the other hand usually have 48 alcohol in them

Alcopops are alcoholic drinks They are also known as Ready to drink Flavored Alcoholic Beverage or Flavored Malt Beverage They are usually available in bottles or cans They contain about the same amount of alcohol as a beer Usually they are very sweet so that the alcohol can not be tasted 

There are two different kinds of this drinks In Europe they are usually spirits mixed with lemonade like vodka with lemon juice or rum with fruit juice In the US they tend to be beers which taste very sweet

Because they are very sweet alcopops tend to be more popular among young people Since the fact that they contain alcohol is usually not obvious from the taste these drinks are considered to be dangerous for young people by many countries These have either raised the taxes on the drinks or they have outlawed the sale of these drinks to people under a certain age

Pedalling in music means the art of using the pedals on musical instruments

There are several musical instruments which have pedals for various reasons

The piano has at least two pedals large concert grand pianos always have three The pedal on the right makes the sound sustain This is because it makes the dampers come off the strings When the player plays some notes the strings that are hit by the hammers carry on vibrating until the player takes his or her foot off the pedal Some of the other strings even start to vibrate as well

The pedal on the left makes the sound quieter It is called the una corda pedal This is because in the early days of the piano the una corda pedal made all the hammers move up so that a hammer would only hit one string for each note instead of three On modern pianos the hammers actually hit two strings instead of three They also tend to hit the string at a point where the hammer is softer away from the little grooves that get worn in the hammer head On an upright piano the hammers move closer to the strings so that they do not hit them so hard

On pianos which have a middle pedal any note or chord that the player is holding down will be sustained but any more notes he plays afterwards will not be affected This can be nice in some modern music where a chord can be held while other notes can be played very short

On pipe organs there is a pedalboard with pedals which play notes in the same way that the fingers are playing notes An organ pedalboard usually has two and a half octaves of notes These are low notes written in the bass clef An organist has to learn to play with the feet at the same time as with the hands He uses the toes or the heels of his shoes It is even possible to play four notes at once but this is very difficult and usually found in some modern French music

There are seven pedals on a concert harp Each pedal can be in a high middle or low position The strings of the harp can be thought of like the white notes of a piano tuned to naturals Each pedal will change one of the letter named notes eg the pedal on the left changes all the Ds to D flat or D sharp From left to right the pedals operate the Ds Cs Bs Es Fs Gs and As

Pedal timpani are timpani with a pedal which will tighten or loosen the drumhead This will make the note go up or down in pitch It is a fairly new invention Composers in the Classical music period never had pedal timpani Their timpani always had to be tuned by hand using the taps around the side Composers like Bla Bartk wrote for pedal timpani

Modern harpsichords often have pedals which change the sound in the same way that stops on an organ change the sound In earlier harpsichords the sound was more often changed by pushing in or pulling out hand stops

Alcoholism is the medical condition of people who often drink too much alcohol Some people who suffer from alcoholism feel that they have to drink alcohol even when it causes health and social problems Alcoholism means addiction to alcohol People who suffer from it are called alcoholics As the condition goes on those who suffer from it change their habits obtaining alcohol and consuming it becomes more important Very often other interests disappear Many alcoholics do not think they have a problem with drinking alcohol With time they better support bigger quantities and their personality changes

The Second Sino Japanese War was a major war fought between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan It is a part of World War II

The Second Sino Japanese War refers to the war that began when Japan justified its invasion of China in 1931 by the Manchurian Incident with more numerous incidents that grew into a full scale war from the Marco Polo Bridge Incident where Japanese officers claimed being attacked by Chinese troops near the Chinese city Beiping Through the bombing of Pearl Harbour by the Japanese this war bacame became part of the larger arena of WW II in 1941 known as the China Burma India theatre The invasion of China was the result of the increased dependency of Japan on raw materials to feed its heavy industry by colonizing more of Asia and of a rise in the military and in nationalism in general During the Japanese campaign in China the KMT and the CCP nominally cooperated to resist Japan but for the most part continued to fight amongst each other as well In 1931 Japan began to occupy China starting in the northeast in 1937 Beiping was occupied and then Nanjing and finally the industrial cities to the south Chiang moved his capital from Nanjing to Chongqing and began a tactic of using space to trade for time and effectively spread the Japanese lines out too thin Despite heavy losses on both sides 1940 marks the beginning of the end of the Japanese dominance and marks the effective halting of Japanese advances The consequences of this war were great Japans inability to quickly and decisively win the war against China heavily compromised her ability to fight the war in the Pacific against the Allied forces and undoubtly contributed to the eventual loss of the war In China the war tended to solidify the popular base of support for the Chinese Communist Party and hastened the collapse of the Republic under Chiang in 1949

In anatomy the term ligament usually means fibrous tissue that connects bones to other bones

In this use a ligament is a short band of tough fibrous connective tissue composed mainly of long stringy collagen fibres Ligaments connect bones to other bones to form a joint They do not connect muscles to bones that is the function of tendons Some ligaments limit the mobility of articulations or prevent certain movements altogether 

Ligaments are only slightly elastic when under tension they gradually lengthen This is one reason why dislocated joints must be set as quickly as possible if the ligaments lengthen too much then the joint will be weakened Athletes gymnasts dancers and martial artists perform stretching exercises to lengthen their ligaments making their joints more supple The consequence of a broken ligament can be instability of the joint Not all broken ligaments need surgery but if surgery is needed to stabilise the joint the broken ligament can be joined

A county is the Polish second level unit of administration equivalent to a county district or prefecture in other countries A county is part of a larger unit called a voivodship

Most Polish counties are named after their capital city or county seat If a county seat has a double barreled name as with Makw Mazowiecki the county may become either Makw County or Makw Mazowiecki County Due in all but the first case to the existence respectively of two double barreled county seats with the identical noun name the corresponding adjectives bielski grodziski ostrowski and tomaszowski each denote two distinct counties

Some Polish urban communes constitute administrative entities called the urban county similar in local administration and self governance to land counties An average county comprises 5 8 communes The largest urban county in terms of population and area is the city of Warsaw 

The history of Polish counties goes back to the second half of the 14th century They remained the basic units of territorial organization in Poland then in the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth until the latters total dismemberment by its neighbors in 1795 

In the 19th century the county continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire and as the Polish equivalent of the German Kreis in the German governed Grand Duchy of Pozna 

After Poland regained independence in 1918 the county again became the basic territorial unit throughout Poland Powiats were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodships but were reintroduced in 1999 There are now 314 land counties and 65 urban counties more formally municipalities with county status

Oba Chandler was born in Cincinnati the state of Ohio He was the fourth child in a family of five children His parents were Oba Chandler Sr and Margaret Johnson At the age of 10 Chandlers father Oba Chandler Senior hanged himself in the Chandler familys basement This upset Oba so much that he jumped into his fathers grave during the funeral in 1957 while gravediggers were covering the coffin with dirt Afterwards Obas life spun out of control and he was arrested many times and had been arrested 20 times by the time he was a teenager As an adult he was charged with a long list of crimes like having fake money burglary kidnapping and armed robbery Chandler would also father a total of eight children before his arrest the latest one being Whitney born in February 1989 with his wife at the time Debra Chandler Between May and September of 1991 Chandler worked as an informant for the US customs Tampa office at the same time as Tampa police investigated the Rogers family triple murder

Joan Rogers and her two daughters Michelle and Christe left their family dairy farm on May 26 1989 in Willshire for a vacation in Florida  They had never before left the state of Ohio On their last day in Florida they became lost and drove into Tampa to ask for directions to the nearest hotel in a store they came across Oba Chandler and asked him It is thought that he saw the Ohio state car license plates on Joans car and used that as means to ask the family to join him out for a boat trip later

The womens bodies were discovered floating in the Tampa Bay on June 4 1989 with bound hands and feet with concrete blocks tied to their necks and duct tape over their mouths The first body was found floating over the Sunshine Skyway bridge when a sailboat on its way home to Tampa after a trip to Key West had just crossed under the Sunshine Skyway when many people on board saw an object in the water They soon realized it was a dead body of a female Soon another body was found and yet another third body was also dragged out of the bay within an hour All three bodies had been tied and gagged and had concrete blocks tied around their necks Autopsies thought the women had been tossed into the bay while still alive

The Rogers women where identified a week after their bodies where found in the bay A hotel maid had discovered that a hotel room had stood unused for several days And when the reports about the murders started to leap into the media the hotel decided to contact investigators in the case Soon it stood clear that it was indeed the families room after fingerprints where matched to those of the victims some snaphots from a camera was also discovered in the room which showed where the family had traveled and also a last shot over Tampa Bay This photo was taken just minutes before the Rogers women went out to meet Oba Chandler to go on a boat ride out on the bay

The case remained unsolved and cold for several years partly due to the volume of tips pouring in to the police who investigated the crime Chandler would not be arrested for the murders until September 24 1992 His handwritten directions and palmprint on a brochure found in the Rogers vehicle along with a description of his boat written by Jo Rogers on the brochure were the primary clues that led to his being named a suspect Also authorities had posted the handwriting from the brochure on billboards which was historic as it was used for the first time in an attempt to find the unknown killer and this led to a tip from a former neighbor who was able to provide a copy of a work order that Chandler had written A handwriting analysis conclusively matched the two

The Rogers women were all buried on June 13 1989 after a funeral service at the Zion Lutheral Church in their hometown of Willshire Ohio About 300 people among them family and friends of the victims attended the service Numerous police officers were also present to keep all news media and crews out of the church during the funeral service this because of the huge media interest for the case by media at the time Chandler was tried and found guilty of the murders and sentenced to death on November 4 1994 After sentencing the jury forewoman commented regarding the death sentence that They need to do this swiftly The man is a mutation of a human being and he needs to be destroyed In July 2008 it was revealed that Chandler was on Floridas short list of executions 

Profiling experts believe that Chandler may have killed previously based on the speculation that a first time killer would not be experienced or bold enough to abduct and kill three woman at once Chandler remains a suspect in a 1982 murder of a woman found floating off Anna Maria Island he is also a suspect in a rape case concerning a Canadian women weeks before the Rogers womens murder However Chandler has never been charged with other murders Chandler got an Institutional Adjustment disciplinary report on December 15 2001 for disobeying orders in prison All of Chandlers appeals since his 1994 conviction have been denied the latest one in May 2007 Author Thomas French in 1998 won the Pulitzer prize for his article series Angels Demons which told the story of the murders

Oba Chandler was executed on November 15 2011 with an lethal injection at 425 pm in Florida State Prison in Raiford Florida

Origami is a traditional Japanese art of paper folding It uses many techniques and various objects can be created The object is made of origami paper which is specially made for folding and staying in shape Many dictionaries and television shows suggest that origami is only paper cranes waterbombs and paper planes But many new models and creatures have been made because new folding techniques have allowed this 

When the Japanese first folded origami they used only one piece of paper A different kind of origami called modular origami uses many small pieces that are the same which are combined to form one large model Also many mathematical shapes can be made with origami

The beginnings of origami is not clear Paperfolding started in China in the 1st or 2nd century It finally came to Japan in the 6th century Instead of making models that looks exactly like things the first origami models only looked similar to things People often folded models and gave them to other people for good luck For example Shinto nobles celebrated weddings with sake in glasses decorated with origami butterflies which gave good luck to the bride and groom 

There were also independent paperfolding traditions in other countries like Germany and Spain The earliest evidence of paperfolding in Europe is a picture of a boat in 1490 There was also a paper box from 1440 Finally in 1845 Kan no mado was written and it was the first book of origami models 

Recently people have become more interested in origami In 1954 Japanese paperfolder Akira Yoshizawa created rules to explain how to fold origami models His instructions on paperfolding are now used in all countries

Peter Engel who is a well known paperfolder says the best paper for origami is thin and crisp and absolutely square Pre cut origami paper is sold in many colors sizes and patterns Duo paper or paper with different colors on each side is used by paperfolders because it makes areas of different color on the finished model There are also special papers like textured metallic and patterned

Many people like to make their own paper Engel describes a process shown to him by Robert Lang that is a sandwich of aluminum foil and two pieces of tissue paper In this method two pieces of paper are pasted to each side of the aluminum foil Many people like origami because there is almost always paper Copy paper napkins wallpaper index cards and even paper money can be used to make interesting and unique models 

Many paperfolders prefer to use a flat surface to fold models on but others like the Japanese fold in the air Traditional paperfolders believe that only the hands should be used when folding but many modern folders use other tools when folding Tweezers and paper clips can be used to make very small folds Some folders use rulers or other flat tools to make sharper creases in the models

New types of origami have been made because more people are making origami models 

Pureland origami is origami with one rule only one fold can be made at a time British paperfolder John Smith started pureland origami for inexperienced paperfolders or for people with poor motor skillsfactdateJuly 2010 Hard folds like the inside reverse fold are not allowed in pureland origami

Statement has several meanings

Items two three and four have something in common They refer to more than words and sentences They claim correctness in substance as in a witness box or a police statement Item five guarantees accuracy and item one is merely a synonym for speaking

In philosophy and logic a statement is a sentence which declares that something meaningful is either true or false Here sentence refers to grammar while statement refers to its content Statements are therefore abstract logical things Statements are similar or identical to propositions In Aristotelian logic a proposition is a particular kind of sentence one which affirms or denies a predicate of a subject Aristotelian propositions take forms like All men are mortal and Socrates is a man

Many modern philosophers take the view that statement and proposition are synonyms or ought to be

In theology salvation can mean three related things

A polyhedron is a geometrical shape It has flat faces and straight edges Usually it is defined by the number of faces or edges 

Mathematicians do not agree on what makes a polyhedron 

Usually polyhedra are named by the number of faces they have The first polyhedra are the tetrahedron which is made of four triangles pentahedron hexahedron and heptahedron

A pentagon is a polygon with 5 edges

A Calendar date is a way to refer to a certain day in a calendar With the calendar date and the calendar the exact day can be identified With a different calendar the same calendar date may refer to a different day This can be seen easiest when comparing the Julian calendar with the Gregorian calendar 

Calendar dates are important to refer to events One example may be Easter In the Middle Ages it has been fixed that Easter is to be the first Sunday that is the 14th day after the spring equinox 

Most calendar systems have a date format that has three parts the day of a certain month the month and the year Sometimes the week is added 

The Iranian calendar   also known as Persian calendar or the Jalli Calendar is a solar calendar It is currently used in Iran and Afghanistan It is observation based rather than rule based Each year starts on the vernal equinox as precisely determined by astronomical observations from Tehran and Kabul This makes it more accurate than the Gregorian Calendar

The current Iranian Calendar year is 1387 AP

A tendon is a tough band of tissue that connects muscle to bone It is built to withstand tension Tendons are similar to ligaments except that ligaments join one bone to another Tendons and muscles work together They can only create a pulling force

The beginning of a tendon is where it connects to a muscle Collagen fibers from the inside of the muscle are the same as those of the tendon A tendon inserts into bone at an enthesis At this point the collagen fibers are changed into bone tissue Tendons can not create any pulling force of their own The tendons transfer the movement of muscles They can create an elastic force if stretchedTendons are part of the human body often connected to joints

Coffee substitutes are products that try to taste like coffee The idea for using them is to have a drink that tastes like coffee but has no caffeine in it The main reasons for making coffee substitutes are medical and economic In World War II acorns were used to make coffee however it tasted foul It was also hard to get In the American Civil War there was a similar story 

For the stimulating property to which both tea and coffee owe their chief value there is unfortunately no substitute the best we can do is to dilute the little stocks which still remain and cheat the palate if we cannot deceive the nerves The Southern Banner 1865

Grain coffee and other substitutes can be made by roasting or decocting various organic substances

Some ingredients used include almond acorn asparagus barley and malt beech nut beetroot carrot chicory root corn cotton seed dandelion root fig boiled down molasses okra seed pea persimmon seed potato peel rye sassafras nut sweet potato

Chicory has been sold commercially on a large scale since around 1970 and it has become a mainstream product It was widely used during the American Civil War on both sides

The Croatian language is spoken mainly in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina throughout the countries and surrounding countries of Europe Croatian grammar is grammar of Croatian language As Croatian language is three dialectal in its basics here are presented both histories and present states of all three dialects of which consists Croatian language 

List of Croatian language grammar books shows that codification of Croatian language in its grammars is rich and starts from beginning of 17th century From 1604 to 1836 there were 17 grammars most of them dominantly tokavian other Kajkavian Grammar of Bartol Kai described supradialectal form of Ikavian tokavian with akavian admixture in 19th century Croatian language already have grammar dominantly based on tokavian in Nova ricsoslovnica illiricka of ime Starevi and Grammatik der illyrischen Sprache of Ignjat Alojzije Brli although it is not formally so Not only before 19th century Croatian language used three dialects almost equally but orthography of same dialect differed on Adriatic coast to that used near Hungarian border as one was under influence of Italian other of Hungarian language All grammars of above period use three accents acute grave and circumflex Starevis grammar is exception as it uses system of four accents In 19th century Ljudevit Gaj proposed new letters from Czech accepted were letters  and from Polish for other phonems accepted were digraphs ie lj nj and d later dj or gj was changed to 

Croatian language uses Latin script of 30 letters and one diphthong ie or ije and such system is in Croatian called gajica name came from Ljudevit Gaj Letter order is in Croatian called abeceda as first 4 letters are spelled a be ce de For writing foreign names and words also in some professions Croatian language uses letters which do not belong to gajica like X x Yy ipsilon and others

In Croatian nouns change form depending on the composition of the sentence This is called declension Declension has been proved the most difficult to master for people who are learning Croatian It is very complicated and time consuming to explain it and because of that we will use simpler techniques in this course However many languages have noun and pronoun declension including English In English though only pronoun declension remained through the course of years Let us start by explaining all of the seven Croatian grammatical cases The technique that is most frequently used in determining grammatical cases is by asking yourself a question when you are trying to figure out which case a noun should be in In Croatian grammatical cases are called padei and pade 

The question you will ask yourself here is Where is Kreimir going And the answer is that hes going to school By looking at the table below you will see that the question where is used for the Locative case Grammatical case The question you should ask yourself when determining the grammatical case Example

Determine the grammatical case of the underlined nouns in the following sentences

Croatian nouns are divided into three genders The masculine feminine and neuter gender To know a nouns gendre is very important because it affects all the words that are tied to the noun such as adjectives Such thing does not exist in English but do not get discouraged There is a way of telling what gendre a noun is without memorizing it for each and every one A gendre is determined by the nouns ending See the table below It is also vital to know that nouns retain their gender in plural For instance the noun ene is of the feminine gender and not neuter which would be easy to think because the word ends with the letter e 

Determine the gender of the following nouns Krov dolina papir staklo panj igra brak jaje hitac iskra stablo ljuljaka zelje karton

Croatian verbs have two grammatical aspects the perfective and imperfective The perfective aspect depicts an action that has already been finished or done with The imperfective aspect depicts an action that is still going or underway So each verb in its infinitive form can be written in 2 ways in its perfective and imperfective aspect The table below is showing 5 verbs both in their perfective and imperfective aspects

In Croatian there are seven grammatical tenses They can be divided in two ways By the time they take place in and by their complexity Simple tenses consist of only 1 word while complex tenses consist of 2 or even 3 words because they also consist of auxiliary verbs Also some grammatical tenses cannot be formed with both grammatical aspects they work with only

Determine the tenses of the underlined verbs

The Croatian week starts with Monday and ends with Sunday unlike weeks from some other countries where Sunday is the first day and Saturday the last

The term Christian Church Catholic Church or One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church as it was called by 110 AD refers to the universal company of believers It means every person who has ever accepted or ever will accept the Christian Faith The idea is that all these people together make up one body called the Church The Church is not thought of by Christians as an ordinary human organisation It is thought of as being part of Gods way to bring people close to him The Church was begun by Jesus in the 1st century AD It is called The Christian Church because Jesus was called The Christ 

Churches as Christian organisations were begun by Jesus followers Today there are many churches in the sense of church organisations The different organised churches are called Christian denominations 

The main Christian beliefs are held by all major Christian denominations These beliefs are often said aloud by Christian people in a statement of faith which is called the Creed The Roman Catholic Orthodox Lutheran Anglican Communion and other Protestant churches all believe that God is the creator and eternal father of all things that Jesus was the Christ and son of God who died to save people from the punishment for their sins and that the Holy Spirit is Gods gift to help and comfort Christian people Christians believe that these are three parts of One God

There are many other beliefs that are different between different denominations These differences have sometimes caused arguments and have caused the organised church to split into denominations The different opinions are called controversies 

The English word church comes from the Greek meaning Masters or Lords In modern English the word church is used for both a church building and the Christian Church throughout the world 

In 381 AD at the a meeting of bishops known as the First Council of Constantinople the Nicene Creed that was used at the time was changed to include a description of the Church The words that were added to the Nicene Creed are One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church This important addition describes what the four most important things that Christians were to believe about the Christian Church 

These are the four words that are used in the Nicene Creed 

One important controversy is simply the definition of the Christian or Catholic Church To some degree this controversy comes from the Nicene Creed with its words One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church which means universal church Many denominations believe that all denominations are part of a world wide Christian Church and think that the most important thing is the common faith and not a common organisation or tradition

For many hundreds of years the Roman Catholic Church has regarded itself as the only Christian Church and has called itself the Catholic church In other words only those people who were within the organisation of the Roman Catholic Church were believed to belong to the Universal Church In the 20th century this view began to change and in the late 20th century there was a strong movement within parts of the Roman Catholic Church to reach out to other denominations The Eastern Orthodox Church has thought of itself in the same way but in the late 20th century there has been much more discussion between the Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Lutheran and Anglican Churches Some smaller denominations such as Jehovahs Witnesses also believe that they are the one and only true Christian Church 

Church could mean

A religious denomination is a subgroup within a religion that has a common name tradition and identity

The term is often used for several Christian denominations for example Eastern Orthodoxy Catholicism and the many sorts of Protestantism like Baptist Methodist Episcopalian and Pentecostal 

It is also used for the four branches of Judaism and less often for the two main branches of Islam

In Hinduism the major deity or philosophical belief functions as the identifier of a denomination and typically each has distinct cultural and religious practices The major denominations include Shaivism Shaktism Vaishnavism Smartism and Halumatha

The word denomination is used for a large group of Christian people right across the world who use the same name the same sort of organisation and have the same beliefs Christianity is divided into five main groups These groups all branched out at different dates from the Early Christian Church founded by the followers of Jesus The splits generally happened because they could not agree on cetain beliefs or practices The groups then divided into smaller groups Each group that has its own separate name is a denomination The word denomination means having a name 

Worldwide Christianity is divided into five major groups of Churches

Each of these five has important subdivisions There are also other groups that are not mentioned here

The Protestant branch of Christianity is much more divided up than any of the others All the many divisions of Protestantism are not shown on the diagram Each separate Protestant Church is called a denomination While the Roman Catholic Church looks to a single earthly leader the Pope and has similar beliefs right across the world the Protestant denominations do not look to a single leader and sometimes have beliefs that are very different from each other 

Many Christian denomination see themselves as part of the worldwide Church which includes other denominations as well Some denominations such as the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches and some Protestant Churches believe that they are the only true Christian church 

Some denominations have beliefs which almost all the other denominations would disagree with very strongly These beliefs are called heresy by the other churches 

There were some movements considered heresies by the early church which do not exist today and are not generally referred to as denominations Examples include the Gnostics the Ebionites and the Arians The greatest divisions in Christianity today however are between Eastern Orthodoxy Roman Catholicism and various denominations formed during and after the Protestant Reformation There also exists in Protestantism and Orthodoxy various degrees of unity and division

Comparisons between denominational churches must be approached with caution For example in some churches congregations are part of a larger church organization while in other groups each congregation is an independent autonomous organization This issue is further complicated by the existence of groups of congregations with a common heritage that are officially nondenominational and have no centralized authority or records but which are identified as denominations by non adherents Study of such churches in denominational terms is therefore a more complex proposition

Numerical comparisons are also problematic Some groups count membership based on adult believers and baptized children of believers while others only count adult baptized believers Others may count membership based on those adult believers who have formally affiliated themselves with the congregation In addition there may be political motives of advocates or opponents of a particular group to inflate or deflate membership numbers through propaganda or outright deception

This article cannot give precise information about the size of any Christian denomination but it tries  following the article in the English Wikipedia  to give information about the relative size of denominations That cannot be exact either but will be of interest nevertheless

Christendom or the Christian world in the widest sense means Christianity as a territorial phenomenon That means those countries where most people are Christians and by that are part of Christendom 

People have used term Christendom for the medieval and renaissance understanding of the Christian world as one single Body of Christ with Christ as the head  With the rise of Modernity and the Reformation during the early 16th century the understanding changed to a modern idea of a tolerant and diverse society that consists of many different communities

A creed is a statement or confession of belief usually religious belief or faith The word comes from the Latin credo for I believe It is sometimes called symbol that means a token by which persons of like beliefs might recognize each other

It is likely that the earliest creed of Christianity that deserves the title in full is the Apostles Creed The Apostles Creed seems to have been formulated to resist Gnosticism it emphasizes the birth physical death and bodily Resurrection of Jesus Christ It reads

The Nicene Creed is clearly derived from the Apostles Creed and represents an elaboration of its basic themes The most important additions to this creed are much more elaborate statements concerning Christology and the Trinity Christians today probably use the Nicene Creed most widely followed by the Apostles Creed

The Jewish faith recognizes a single creed called the Shmah or Shema Yisrael a statement of faith in strict unitarian monotheism the belief in one God This creed is embodied in a single prayer recited twice a day Hear O Israel the Lord is our God the Lord is One also translated as Hear O Israel the Lord is our God the Lord is unique or alone

In Hebrew    

This is pronounced phonetically in Hebrew Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad

The most basic attempt to put the religion of Islam in a brief statement of doctrine is the shahada the proclamation that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His prophet  

More detailed credal declarations of Islamic dogma constitute aqidah

The six Sunni articles of belief are

Also from the Aqidah of the Salaf is the belief that the faith consists of speech and action and that it increases and decreases This differs from the Murjiah a sect who uphold the belief of Irjaa to hold that sins major and minor do not affect the faith and that faith neither increases nor decreases  

And they uphold the belief that the Quran is the Speech of Allah His Revelation and Light It is not created since the Quran is from Allah and that which is from Allah is not created One of the attributes of Allah is his Speech Since His attributes have been with Him eternally His Speech cannot be created and therefore the Quran is not created According to the Salaf debating about it is disbelief It is not denied except by a Jahmee A Jahmee is one who denies Allahs attributes

A creed is a statement of belief usually religious

Creed may also refer to

Military

Fictional

The shahadah is the Islamic creed It means to testify or to bear witness in Arabic The shahadah is the Muslim declaration of belief in the oneness of God and in Muhammad as his final prophet Recitation of the shahadah is one of the Five Pillars of Islam for Muslims and is said daily

The Shahada derived from the root Shahida he witnessed means to know and believe without suspicion as if witnessed The Shahada is the Muslim declaration of belief in the oneness of Allaah and acceptance of Muhammad as Allaahs final Messenger

The Shahada of the Sunni is        I witness that   no other deity is worthy of being worshipped besides Allaah  and I witness that  Muhammad is his slave

The Shahada of the Shiia is the same thing except that they add   meaning that they bear witness that Ali is Allaahs representative Allaah almightys message to all nations is the same message except for witnessing that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah This testimony of faith       only occurred after the Prophet Muhammad was sent and before him it was Eissa and the testimony of faith at that time to those people was and the same thing for Musas people

Of all the Prophets that were sent only five of them as mentioned in the Quran were Messengers of Allaah sent to every existing creature and the rest were prophets who were sent only to their people These five Messengers are

As for the followers of Muhammad being the last of all nations because of him being the last of all Messengers and the Quran being the last of all books this puts all creatures who hear of Allaah and Muhammad on the target to embrace Islam Furthermore it is important to know that no one may embrace Islam until he makes Shahada and no one may make Shahada until he believes in After the person believes in all three sections of the Tawheed with a firm belief he can then witness that there is no other God worthy of being worshipped other than Allaah and that Muhammad is indeed his final Messenger

      

According to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church Purgatory is the final purification of the elect All who die in Gods grace and friendship but still imperfectly purified are indeed assured of their eternal salvation but after death they undergo purification so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven 

 IT IS CHRISTMAS DAY THAT THE GREATEST NUMBER OF SOULS LEAVE PURGATORY 

 In Purgatory there are different levels the lowest is close to hell and the highest gradually draws near to Heaven It is not All Souls Day but Christmas that the greatest number of souls leave Purgatory

There are in Purgatory souls who pray ardently to God but for whom no relative or friend prays on earth God makes them benefit from the prayers of other people

It happens that God permits them to manifest themselves in different way close to their relatives on earth in order to remind men of the existence of Purgatory and to solicit their prayers to come close to God who is just but good

The majority of people go to Purgatory Many go to hell A small number go directly to Heaven 10 JANUARY 1983

Perhaps the best known instance of purgatory in the arts is Dantes Purgatorio the second book of his Divine Comedy Likewise the Ghost in William Shakespeares Hamlet may also presuppose a belief in purgatory 

William Blake was an English poet visionary painter and printmaker During his lifetime he was not very well known Today Blakes work is thought to be important in the history of both poetry and the visual arts His most famous poem is And did those feet in ancient time which more than 100 years later was put to music by Hubert Parry The hymn is called Jerusalem 

Blake was voted 38th in a poll of the 100 Greatest Britons organized by the BBC in 2002

An institution is social structure in which people cooperate and which influences the behavior of people and the way they live 

An institution has a purpose Institutions are permanent which means that they do not end when one person is gone An institution has rules and can enforce rules of human behavior The word institution can be used in two ways It can mean a very broad idea or a very specific one For example 

Institutions in the broad sense are found in every society The way that each institution works is different in different cultures Some important institutions are 

Some societies have many institutions in the specific sense These societies have an organised government schools hospitals churches clubs armies markets courts and places for entertainment Some societies have very few of these things but this does not mean that there are no institutions The way in which the people relate to each other may have just as many controls as in a society with schools markets and a government An example of a society that has lots of specific institutions is Western Europe An example of a society with very few specific institutions is the society of the Australian Aboriginal people before the 20th century

Historians look at institutions to find differences between eras or periods They sometimes judge political and military events by the effect that they had on institutions 

In biology races are distinct populations within the same species with relatively small morphological and genetic differences 

The populations are ecological races if they arise from adaptation to different local habitats or geographic races when they are geographically isolated 

If sufficiently different two or more races can be identified as subspecies which is an official biological taxonomy unit below species 

If not they are called races which means that a formal rank should not be given to the group or taxonomists are unsure whether or not a formal rank should be given 

According to Ernst Mayr a subspecies is a geographic race that is sufficiently different taxonomically to be worthy of a separate name 

The key lime is a shrub that grows to a size of about 5 metres in height It has many thorns It produces a fruit that is yellow when it is ripe This fruit is preferred by bartenders to mix cocktails They prefer this lime rather than the Persian lime 

The plant originally came from Southeast Asia where it is native It was spread to the Middle East Crusaders took it to Europe and North Africa Spanish explorers took it to the West Indies This included the Keys in Florida In 1926 a hurricane destroyed most of the population of commercially grown limes in region The Persian lime was reintroduced then

Some of the original shrubs grew wild amongst others in the Florida Keys It then became apparent that the originally introduced shrubs had modified their fruits These were darker green than the original Persian limes they also had a thicker skin

The term Modern Times is used in history to describe the period of time immediately following the Early Modern Times It means something else than the term Modernity 

Modernity on the other hand describes large scale developments of society Modernism describes an art movement Neither applies to political social or series of events since either the fin de sicle or World War I in a strict sense

Some events show a new way of perceiving the world The concept of modernity interprets the general meaning of these events and seeks explanations for major developments Historians analyse the events taking place in Modern Times ie since the so called Middle Ages

Within the Early Modern Age some events shaped the world immensely

The phenotype of an organism is roughly the characters of an organism 

It does not mean just what you can see on the surface Rather it means anything which can be made visible by suitable means For example blood groups are definitely a part of the phenotype However they are not visible just by looking at a person

In biology the phenotype is distinguished from the genotype This was proposed by Wilhelm Johannsen in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organisms heredity and what that heredity produces The distinction is similar to that proposed by August Weismann who distinguished between germ plasm and somatic cells

The phenotype is important because is exposed to natural selection

Phenotypes are determined partly by genes and are influenced by environmental factors So knowing the genome of an organism does not give an exact prediction of its phenotype

The interaction between genotype and phenotype has often been conceptualized by the following relationship

The term phenotype must include characteristics that can be made visible by some technical procedure Another extension adds behaviour to the phenotype since behaviours are also affected by both genotypic and environmental factors

The idea of the extended phenotype has been developed by Richard Dawkins to mean all the effects a gene has on the outside world that may influence its chances of being inherited These can be effects on the organism carrying the trait the environment or other organisms For instance a beaver dam might be considered a phenotype of beaver genes the same way beavers powerful incisor teeth are phenotype expressions of their genes Dawkins also cites the effect of an organism on the behaviour of another organism as an example of the extended phenotype

The Key lime is a citrus fruit Its Latin name is Citrus aurantiifolia or Citrus x aurantiifolia Swingle It is also known as the Mexican lime West Indian lime or Bartenders lime It is a shrub that grows to about 5m in height 

Its fruit is 25 5 cm in diameter The fruit is yellow when ripe but usually it is picked green It is smaller seedier has a higher acidity a stronger aroma and a thinner rind than that of the more common Persian lime It is valued for its unique flavor compared to other lime The key lime usually has a more tart and bitter flavor It is perhaps most distinguished as an ingredient in the Key lime pie 

C aurantiifolia is a shrubby tree that grows to 5 m with many thorns Dwarf varieties are popular with home growers and can be grown indoors in winter in colder climates The trunk rarely grows straight with many branches that often originate quite far down on the trunk The leaves are ovate 259 cm long They resemble orange leaves The flowers are 25 cm in diameter They are yellowish white with a light purple tinge on the margins Flowers and fruit appear throughout the year but are most abundant from May to September refdescriptiona refdescriptionb

C aurantiifolia originally came from Southeast Asia It was introduced through the Middle East to North Africa and Europe during the Crusades Spanish explorers then took it to the West Indies contemporaneously with Columbus then tropical and sub tropical North America including Mexico Florida and later California refpatha The English name lime was derived from the Persian name Limu in this course Key would seem to have been added some time after the Persian lime cultivar became more important commercially in the United States This was after the hurricane of 1926 The hurricane destroyed most US C aurantiifolia plants Some plants growing in the wild in the Keys survived the hurricaneref1926a Since the North American Free Trade Agreement came into effect many Key limes are grown in Mexico and Central America They are also grown in Texas and California

The Age of Discovery or Age of Exploration was a period from the early 15th century and continuing into the early 17th century during which European ships traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners

They were in search of trading goods such as gold silver and spices In the process Europeans met peoples and mapped lands previously unknown to them Among the most famous explorers of the period were Christopher Columbus Vasco da Gama Pedro lvares Cabral John Cabot Yermak Juan Ponce de Len Juan Sebastian Elcano Bartholomeu Dias Ferdinand Magellan Willem Barentsz Abel Tasman Jean Alfonse Jacques Cartier Samuel de Champlain Willem Jansz and Captain James Cook 

Persian Lime also known as Tahiti lime or Bearss lime is a kind of citrus fruit It is the primary citrus fruit grown commercially in the US It is sold simply as a lime The fruit is about 6 cm in diameter Very often it has slightly nippled ends It is usually sold quite green although it yellows as it reaches full ripeness It is larger thicker skinned and less aromatic than the key lime The key lime is grown more often worldwide The Persian lime is bigger than the key lime and has fewer seeds The plant is also hardier and has no thorns on the bushes The fruit also has a longer shelf life 

Persian limes are less acidic than key limes and do not have the bitterness that lends to the key limes unique flavour Persian limes are sold primarily in six sizes known as 110s 150s 175s 200s 230s and 250s They are grown primarily in Florida in the US The Persian lime became more important when key lime orchards were wiped out by a hurricane in 1926 Persian lime orchards themselves were devastated by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 Large numbers of Persian limes are grown processed and exported every year primarily from Martnez de la Torre Veracruz Mexico to the American European and Asian markets US Persian lime imports from Mexico are handled mostly through McAllen Texas

The Kaffir lime also known as kieffer lime makrut or magrood is a citrus fruit native to Indonesia It is widely grown worldwide as a backyard shrub People usually grow it for its fruit the lime The leaves are used for cooking Vegetable oil obtained from the leaves is used to make perfumes 

The plant is a very thorny bush with aromatic leaves The oil obtained from the rind of the fruit can be used as an insecticide The plant is well suited to being grown in a container The green lime fruits are different from other limes because of their bumpy and rough exterior They are also quite small about 4 centimetres wide The leaves are shaped like an hourglass The leaves and the leaf shaped stem are widely used in the cuisine of Cambodia Thailand and Laos

Citrus x hystrix leaves are also popular in Cambodia but less so in Vietnam Malay Burmese and Indonesian cuisines use them sporadically with chicken and fish 

The leaves can be used fresh or dried and can be stored frozen 

Although the most common product of the Citrus x hystrix tree is its leaves the juice and rinds of the small dark green gnarled fruit are used in traditional Indonesian medicine 

As for the zest it is widely used in creole cuisine and to impart flavor to arranged rums in the Runion island and Madagascar

Other names for Citrus x hystrix

The Oxford Companion to Food recommends that the name kaffir lime should be avoided in favor of makrut lime because Kaffir is an offensive term in certain cultures and also has no clear reason for being attached to this plant However kaffir lime appears to be much more common

Medina IPAmdin is a city in the Hejaz region of western Saudi Arabia It is the capital of Al Madinah Province It is the second holiest city in Islam and the burial place of its prophet Muhammad

Medina currently has a population of more than 1300000 people The city was originally known as Yathrib but later its name was changed to Madnat al Nab or Al Madnah al Munawwarah The short form Madnah simply means city Madina is the second holiest city of Islam after Mecca 

Medina is very important to Muslims This is because the Prophet Muhammad is buried in a mosque known as Masjid e Nabawi or The Mosque of The Prophet The Mosque was built on a site next to Muhammads home Muslims believe FactdateFebruary 2007 that Prophets must be buried at the very same place that they die Accordingly Muhammad was buried in his house The tomb later became part of the mosque when it was expanded by the Umayyad Caliph Al Walid I The first mosque of Islam is also located in Medina It is known as Masjid Quba

Like Mecca the city of Medina only permits Muslims to enter The haram of Medina is much smaller than that of Mecca though Many facilities on the outskirts of Medina are open to non Muslims In Mecca the area closed to non Muslims extends well beyond the limits of the built up area Both cities numerous mosques are the destination for large numbers of Muslims on their annual pilgrimage Hundreds of thousands of Muslims come to Medina each year to visit the Tomb of Prophet and to worship at mosques in a unified celebration Muslims believe that praying once in the Mosque of the Prophet is equal to praying at least 1000 times in any other mosque

The citron is a species of citrus fruit It usually has a thick rind and small sections Originally the tree came from Southeast Asia Today it is mainly grown in Sicily Morocco Crete and Corsica as well as Puerto Rico The tree can grow to a size of about 3 metres The fruit can grow to a size of about 25 cm in length and about 4 kg in weight The pulp of the fruit is hardly ever used The rind is used It is made into an additive for cooking Jam can also be made from the rind The rind is also used to make vegetable oil which is used for perfumes

Generally it is eaten preserved or in bakery goods such as fruitcakes In some cultures it is made into a fruity tea Pliny the Elder states that in his time the citron could only be grown in Media and Persia The Romans tried to transport it into the Roman Empire in tightly packed pots but failed according to Pliny There is evidence however which shows it was cultivated in the Mediterranean during Plinys lifetime Zohary and Hopf believe this tree was first domesticated in India They think that its wild forms along with those of the mandarin and pomelo were the original citrus species

The citron has many names in different countries one popular reference is Cedrat which is the French name for the fruit Theophrastus referred to the citron as the Persian or Median Apple and the fruit later came to be known as the Citrus Apple Pliny calls the tree the Assyrian or the Median apple Other citrus crops were not introduced to the Mediterranean basin until Islamic times

In many languages other than English a normal lemon is called a citron and a Lime is called a limon Although the East Asian citrus fruit yuzu is sometimes called a citron it is actually a separate species Citrus junos 

The citron fruit is slow growing The citron tree is typically grown from cuttings that are two to four years old the tree begins to bear fruit when it is around three years old The fruit is oblong in shape and sometimes as much as six inches in length Its skin is thick somewhat hard fragrant and covered with protuberances the pulp is white and subacid 

In Plinys time the fruit was never eaten but its intense perfume was used penetrating clothes to repel noxious insects 

In Hebrew the citron is known as the etrog It is one of the Four Species used during the holiday of Sukkot each fall The role of the citron in that holiday was portrayed in the Israeli movie Ushpizin Citrons that have been bred with lemon are not kosher for use as part of the Four Species

In South Indian cuisine especially Tamil cuisine citron is widely used in pickles and preserves In Tamil the unripe fruit is referred to as narthangai which is usually salted and dried to make a preserve The tender leaves of the plant are often used in conjunction with chili powder and other spices to make a powder called narthellai podi literally translating to powder of citron leaves Both narthangai and narthellai podi are usually consumed with thayir sadam

In Korea it is used to create a syrupy tea where the slices of whole fruit are eaten with the sweet tea The fruit is thinly sliced and soaked or cooked in honey or sugar to create a chunky syrup This syrupy candied fruit is mixed with hot water as a fragrant tea where the fruit at the bottom of the cup is eaten as well Often perserved in the syrup for the cold months Yuja tea served as a source of fruit in winter It is also popular in Taiwan where it is known as 

Citric acid is a weak organic acid It can be found in citrus fruits It acts like a preservative It is also used to add a sour taste to foods and soft drinks In the European Union it is known as E 330 as a food additive

Carl Wilhelm Scheele was the first who could extract citric acid from lemons in 1782 The substance was probably known to alchemists perhaps with a different name The Arabian alchemist Geber is said to have discovered citric acid in the 9th century Citric Acid contains 6 Carbon atoms 8 Hydrogen atoms and 7 Oxygen atoms Its chemical formula is C6H8O7

Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan known also by his Latinised name Geber was a Persian prominent chemist alchemist pharmacist philosopher astronomerastrologer physician and physicist He has also been widely referred to as the father of chemistry Ibn Hayyan is widely credited with the introduction of the experimental method into alchemy and with the invention of numerous important processes still used in modern chemistry today such as the syntheses of hydrochloric and nitric acids distillation and crystallisation His original works are highly esoteric and probably coded though nobody today knows what the code is On the surface his alchemical career revolved around an elaborate chemical numerology based on consonants in the Arabic names of substances and the concept of takwin the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory

Carl Wilhelm Scheele a German Swedish pharmaceutical chemist born in Stralsund Western Pomerania Germany was the discoverer of many chemical substances most notably discovering oxygen before Joseph Priestley and chlorine before Humphry Davy

Other combinations of piano with two instruments are often called by the featuring wind instrument For example Mozart wrote a trio for piano clarinet and viola which is usually called a clarinet trio Brahms wrote a trio for piano violin and French horn which is usually called a horn trio

Music for three people to play at one piano is called music for piano six hands

Haydn Mozart and Beethoven all wrote several piano trios for the traditional combination of piano violin and cello Beethovens last piano trio has the nickname Archduke because it was written for the Archduke Rudolph Franz Schubert wrote two beautiful piano trios

In the Romantic period some of the best piano trios were written by Felix Mendelssohn Antonn Dvok Csar Franck and Pyotr Tchaikovsky

In the 20th century Maurice Ravel and Dmitri Shostakovich each wrote a famous piano trio

Alfred Cortot Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals were world famous musicians who played and recorded piano trios in the early 20th century During the second half of the 20th century the Beaux Arts Trio were the best known group Today there are many young musicians who play piano trios including three Japanese sisters called the Fujita Piano Trio who play a lot of their music all from memory

An Austrian pastry is named after him the Grillparzertorte

Johann Georg Albrechtsberger was an Austrian composer organist music theorist and music teacher He is most known today because he was Beethovens teacher for a time

From the age of seven Albrechtsberger was a choirboy He had lessons in organ and music theory As an adult he had several jobs in churches in small towns He became Kapellmeister at St Stephens Church Vienna in 1793 This was the best job for a church musician in the empire

Albrechtsberger wrote hundreds of compositions He wrote most of them before he got the job in Vienna He wrote in a classical style Albrechsberger enjoyed doing things with music which were not normally done He would ask string players to tune their strings in different ways He would also write slow movements with muted strings As well as classical sonatas he wrote lots of fugues Several people including Mozart thought of him as the greatest organist in the world

Albrechtsberger was a very important music teacher Joseph Haydn thought he was the best teacher in Vienna He was very interested in contrapuntal music of the Baroque period He copied many fugues by Bach and other composers

When Beethoven was a young man he had some composition lessons from Joseph Haydn When Haydn was going to travel to England for several months he asked Albrechtsberger to teach Beethoven while he was gone These lessons took place from 1793 to 1795 A few years later Albrechtsberger said about Beethoven that he learned absolutely nothing and will never accomplish anything decent Beethoven said that Albrechtsberger was a musical pedant However Beethoven still studied Albrechtsbergers books on music theory The string quartets which Beethoven wrote near the end of his life show the influence of Albrechtsberger

Fidelio is an opera in two acts by Ludwig van Beethoven It is Beethovens only opera The German libretto is by Joseph Sonnleithner based on a French story The opera tells how Leonore disguised as a prison guard called Fidelio rescues her husband Florestan from death in a political prison

Fidelio is an example of a rescue opera a type of opera which was popular at the time The hero has to fight against cruel people in order to rescue a lover It was written at the time of the French Revolution At this time ideas about freedom and peace were being talked about by everyone and this led to wars all over Europe The famous Prisoners Chorus is a song for freedom just like the last movement of his Ninth Symphony

Beethoven spent some time working on the opera before he was completely happy with it The first time it was performed it was a three act opera called Leonore There were a lot of French military officers in the audience and they thought they were being criticised In 1806 it was performed again with two acts and a new overture But arguments between Beethoven and the theatre management meant there were no more performances Eight years later Beethoven revised his opera again This time it was called Fidelio and it was a great success It has remained a famous opera ever since

The setting is a Spanish state prison a few miles from Seville in the late 1700s

Jaquino is a prison guard He wants to marry Marzelline the daughter of Rocco who is the warden of the prison But Marzelline has just fallen in love with someone she thinks is a man called Fidelio Actually Fidelio is a woman who has dressed up as a man so that she can get into the prison where her husband Florestan is a prisoner She is pretending to return Marzellines love so that she can find a way of rescuing Florestan Rocco says he is happy for Marzelline to marry Fidelio Fidelio says she will help Rocco with his job of looking after the prisoners Rocco says she can do this but there is one prisoner she is not allowed to guard He has been locked up alone for two years Leonore thinks it may be her husband but she is not sure

Don Pizzaro the military governor of the prison hears that the prison is going to be looked at by inspectors who make sure that the prison is being properly managed He knows that he should not have locked Florestan up so decides to kill him before the inspection starts He asks Rocco to dig the grave so that he can get rid of the body quickly Rocco does not want to do this but has to agree

Leonore lets the prisoners have a walk in the garden  Rocco tells Leonore that he must help him dig the grave Rocco is very cross that the prisoners are walking in the garden but Rocco says they should be allowed because it is the Kings name day Rocco says they should be locked up again

Florestan sits alone in his cell  In his mind he imagines an angel who looks like his wife who his telling him to come to Heaven

Leonore goes with Rocco to the prisoner She is still not sure whether it is her husband She gives him some bread When Pizarro comes he gets ready to kill Florestan but Leonore stands between them and tells Pizarro she will shoot him if he comes nearer A trumpet is heard playing a fanfare because the Minister is arriving

Outside the prison the Minister says that all the prisoners are now free He is horrified to find Florestan among the prisoners because he is his friend The crowd ask for Pizarro to be punished Leonore frees her husband from his chains and the crowd say that she is a great heroine

Beethoven made several changes to the opera at different times This included writing four different overtures They are called Leonore 1 Leonore 2 Leonore 3 and Fidelio The overture Fidelio is the one that is normally heard now at the beginning of the opera Leonore 2 was the overture performed at the first performance in 1805 Leonore 3 composed in 1806 is the most famous of the overtures Leonore 1 may have been written in 1805 or it may have been intended for a performance in 1807 in Prague which never took place Sometimes the Leonore 3 overture is played during Act II between the two scenes However many people think it does not work dramatically there It is usually heard today as a separate concert piece The overture Fidelio was composed for performances of the opera in 1814

Fr Elise is the popular title of the Bagatelle in A minor for piano by Ludwig van Beethoven It is one of the most popular pieces of piano music in the world Many young pianists want to learn to play it

We do not know who Elise was It might have been a lady called Therese whom Beethoven wanted to marry in 1810 but she did not want to marry him The piece was not published until 1865 a long time after Beethovens death

The piece is in rondo form There is a main section which comes three times Between these three sections there are two other sections so the form of the piece can be described as 

The main section has a time signature of 38 It is based on arpeggios which flow from one hand to the other This is the section that many beginner pianists try to play The two middle sections are harder to play at the correct speed They have fast scales arpeggios and left hand demisemiquavers

Teplice is a small town in Bohemia the western area of the Czech Republic Teplice is a famous spa town where in earlier times lots of famous people went for holidays to improve their health Goethe Beethoven Chopin Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner all stayed there

A symphony is a piece of music for orchestra Beethoven wrote nine symphonies This one the last one he wrote is very unusual because the last movement also has singing in it there are four soloists and a choir This is why it is known as the choral symphony It is a very long work lasting more than an hour This too was unusual

This symphony has four movements The first movement is in sonata form The second and third movements come the other way round from the usual order the second movement is the scherzo and the third movement is the slow movement It is a theme and variations The last movement sets the words of a poem by Friedrich Schiller a famous poet who had only recently died The poem was called Ode an die Freude The poem has a strong message to all mankind it is about living in peace and harmony together It was written at the time of the French Revolution when these ideas were becoming very important in Europe

The main tune of the last movement is one of the best known tunes in the world Many children like to play it on instruments because the first part of the tune only uses five notes When the tune comes the first time in the symphony it is played by the cellos and double basses

The Ode to Joy was adopted as Europes National anthem in 1972 with an official arrangement for orchestra written by Herbert von Karajan

Beethoven had been interested in Schillers famous poem since he was young In 1817 he started to write the first two movements of the symphony In 1822 he decided to use Schillers poem in the symphony Most of the rest of the symphony was written in 1823 and he finished it in 1824 It was first performed in May of that year Beethoven conducted the performance The story is told that he wondered why the audience were not applauding when it had finished They were applauding but Beethoven was deaf so he could not hear Someone made him turn round and he saw that people were applauding enthusiastically

The class names are combined with one number and one English character such as 7B There are about 40 students in each class from Form 1 to Form 5 1A and 1B are remedial classes whereas 1C to 1E perform better in exams The classes are mixed when students go into Form 2 or Form 3

All Form 3 students have to choose their subjects after finishing their year In Form 4 and 5 A and B are arts classes C is commercial class D and E are science classes with the students and class teachers being together in the same class in both Form 4 and 5

After the HKCEE some students study in Form 6 Each class in Form 6 and 7 has about 30 students The class A is an art class and B is a science class

Each Form forms a House with its own chairman and committee members elected by the students in the own Form Each House has its own colour such as black blue or red just like the students PE uniform The forms from the same colours form some cheering teams during the sports days

There are 2 sports days every year The sports days take places on the Yuen Wo Road Sports Ground Besides the various types of sports competitions there are competitions among the cheering teams The swimming gala is held every year with the Pui Ying Secondary School It takes place on the Hong Kong Island or Sha Tin District alternatively every two years

Students in the school take parts in many external competitions in many fields such as music sports debates writings mathematics and other academic competitions One of the most notable competitions is the Hang Lung Mathematics Award The schools HLMA team got an Honourable Mention in 2004 and a Special Commendation in 2006

The Student Union was established in November 1994 Its election activity is held in November every year It helps the school setting new school rules and improves students lives It organises activities such as blood donation days and ball game competitions

It is formed by some teachers social worker and psychologist to teach students how to have a true value

It helps students plan for their future by giving them information about different study opportunities and the world of work

Some students may be naughty so there are some prefects catching the naughty students

The school library has over 20000 books available to students Every year there are about 100 school librarians The book borrowing system was changed from man power only into computer system in 2001 The location of it was moved to the new wing building of the school in 2005 It organises Reading Day every year

A heuristic is a way to solve a problem It is better than chance but does not always work It is part of experience common sense rule of thumb Trial and error is the simplest heuristic but one of the weakest Since a heuristic is not certain to get a result there are always exceptions

Sometimes heuristics are rather vague look before you leap is a guide to behaviour but think about the consequences is a bit clearer Sometimes a heuristic is a whole set of stages When doctors examines a patient they go through a whole set of tests and observations They may not find out what is wrong but they give themselves the best chance of succeeding

In Computer science a heuristic is a kind of algorithm Algorithms are written to get a good solution to a problem A heuristic algorithm might usually find pretty good solutions but there is no guarantee or proof that the solutions are correct The time it takes to run the algorithm is another consideration

Here are a few other commonly used heuristics from Polyas 1945 book How to Solve It

ImageKnapsacksvgthumbright250pxExample of a packing problem This is a one dimensional Knapsack problem which boxes should be chosen to maximize the amount of money and keep the overall weight under 15 kg A multi dimensional problem could consider the density or dimensions of the boxes the latter a typical packing problem

One example where heuristics are useful is a kind of packing problem The problem consists of packing a number of items There are rules that need to be respected For example each item has a value and a weight The problem now is to get the most valuable items with the least weight possible Another instance is fitting a number of differently sized items into a confined space like the trunk of a car

To get the perfect solution to the problem all possibilities must be tried This is often not a good option as trying them takes a long time and on average half the possibilities must be tried until a solution is found So what most people will do is to start with the biggest item fit it in and then try to arrange the other items around it This will give a good solution most of the time There are cases however where such a solution is very bad and another technique must be used 

Therefore this is a heuristic solution 

In mathematics a Mersenne number is a number that is one less than a power of two

A Mersenne prime is a Mersenne number that is a prime number The exponent n must be prime too This however is not sufficient Many mathematicians prefer the definition of a Mersenne number where n has to be a prime number

For example 31 25 1 and 5 is a prime number so 31 is a Mersenne number and 31 is also a Mersenne prime because it is a prime number But the Mersenne number 2047 211 1 is not a prime because it is divisible by 89 and 23 And 24 1 15 can be shown to be composite because 4 is not prime

Throughout modern times the largest known prime number has very often been a Mersenne prime Most sources restrict the term Mersenne number to where n is prime as all Mersenne primes must be of this form as seen below

Mersenne primes have a close connection to perfect numbers which are numbers equal to the sum of their proper divisors Historically the study of Mersenne primes was motivated by this connection in the 4th century BC Euclid demonstrated that if M is a Mersenne prime then M2 is a perfect number In the 18th century Leonhard Euler proved that all even perfect numbers have this form No odd perfect numbers are known and it is suspected that none exist

It is currently unknown if there is an infinite number of Mersenne primes Most mathematicians who have studied the question think there are an infinite number of Mersenne primes Carl Pomerance Samuel S Wagstaff Jr and Hendrik Lenstra developed a formula which they think should say about how many Mersenne primes there are under a given number

For example 25 1 11111 in binary

The first four Mersenne primes were known to the Ancient Greeks They are 3 7 31 and 127 The next 8191 was discovered in 1456 Some people like trying to find big primes Since there are tricks to finding Mersenne primes quickly the largest primes known are usually Mersenne primes

Solar radiation is the energy given off by the sun in all directions When this energy reaches the earths surface it is called insolation

Solar radiation gives out light and heat to the earth in the form of electromagnetic waves It has different wave lengths Radiation such as ultraviolet radiation X rays and visible light have short wave lengths Infrared radiation has a long wave length

The atmosphere affects the amount of solar radiation received When solar radiation travels through the atmosphere some of it is absorbed by the atmosphere Some of it is scattered to space Some of it is reflected by clouds About 47 of it reaches the Earths surface

Insolation is the solar radiation that reaches the earths surface It is measured by the amount of solar energy received per square centimetre per minute

Insolation affects temperature The more the insolation the higher the temperature

In any given day the strongest insolation is received at noon

Factors affect insolation

The longer the duration of daylight the more the insolation received

Granule is a generic term used for a small particle or grain The generic term is used in a lot of contexts

In cell biology a granule can be any structure barely visible by light microscopy The term is most often used to describe a secretory vesicle

A group of leukocytes called granulocytes contain granules and play an important role in the immune system The granules of certain cells such as Natural killer cells contain components which can lead to the lysis of neighboring cells 

The granules of platelets are classified as dense granules and alpha granules

The cytosol is the internal fluid of the cell and a part of cell metabolism occurs here 

Proteins within the cytosol play an important role in signal transduction pathways and glycolysis 

Cytosol mostly consists of water dissolved ions small molecules and large water soluble molecules It contains about 20 to 30 protein

Normal human cytosolic pH is 70 whereas the pH of the extracellular fluid is 74

The texture of cytosol being described as granular can be attributed to the fact that in order to study the texture an electron microsope must be used which requires a process of dehydration prior to study

Marble is a metamorphic rock that developed from limestone Most of the material is calcite It is often used for sculpture as a building material and for many other purposes 

The word marble is also used for other stones that can be polished well and for ball shaped objects used for child games 

Faux marble or faux marbling is a wall painting technique that imitates the color patterns of real marble Marble dust can be combined with cement or synthetic resins to make reconstituted or cultured marble

Places named after the stone include Marble Arch London the Sea of Marmara Indias Marble Rocks and the towns of Marble Minnesota Marble Colorado and Marble Hill Manhattan New York The Elgin Marbles are marble sculptures from the Parthenon that are on display in the British Museum They were brought to Britain by the Earl of Elgin

Some historically important kinds of marble named after the locations of their quarries include

White marbles like Carrara in Italy Royal White and Beijing White in China have been prized for sculpture since classical times This preference has to do with the softness and relative isotropy and homogeneity and a relative resistance to shattering Also the low index of refraction of calcite allows light to penetrate several millimeters into the stone before being scattered out resulting in the characteristic waxy look which gives life to marble sculptures of the human body

In the construction trade the term marble is used for any massive crystalline calcitic rock useful as building stone For example Tennessee Marble is really a massive highly fossiliferous gray to pink to maroon Ordovician dolostone known as the Holston Formation by geologists

Colorless marbles are a very pure source of calcium carbonate which is used in a wide variety of industries Finely ground marble powder is a component in paints toothpaste and plastics calcium carbonate can also be reduced under high heat to calcium oxide which has many applications including being a primary component of most cements

Marble is dense with a good range of colors It can be carved or shaped and is strong and many think it beautiful

Fan fiction or fanfiction is a name for fiction created by fans instead of the original author

Fanfiction writers take fictional characters and settings from fictional stories that were created by other people and write original stories about them People write fan fiction for a many different book television series or movie fandoms

When fanfiction first began it was often only published in fan magazines Today fanfiction like many fandom activities can be usually found on the internet This has created many fanfiction communities People in these communities post their fanfiction and receive feedback from other community members

There is also fan art which is often drawings or other visual art based on a fandom

The Three Laws of Robotics are three rules which Isaac Asimov thought would be programmed into robots The rules assume robots will be human type machines able to walk about and do things The laws are presented in his Robot series of short stories and novels

The first mention of the laws is in Asimovs short story Runaround 

Later Asimov added the Zeroth Law A robot may not harm humanity or by inaction allow humanity to come to harm the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this

According to the Oxford English Dictionary the passage in Asimovs short story Liar that mentions the First Law is the earliest recorded use of the word robotics Asimov was not aware of this at the time he assumed the word already existed by analogy with mechanics hydraulics and other similar terms denoting branches of applied knowledge

The Three Laws form a theme in his Robot series and the other stories linked to it as well as his Lucky Starr series of science fiction for children Other authors working in Asimovs fictional universe have adopted them and references appear in science fiction and other genres Technologists in the field of artificial intelligence have speculated upon the role the Laws might have in the future

An electromagnetic wave is a wave in space with electric and magnetic parts 

Electromagnetic radiation is classified into types according to the frequency of the wave these types include in order of increasing frequency radio waves microwaves terahertz radiation infrared radiation visible light ultraviolet radiation X rays and gamma rays In some technical contexts the entire range is referred to as just light 

A grenade is a weapon that is meant to do heavy destruction that is to destroy things Some different types of grenades

Hand held grenades are grenades used by the infantry There are three main types one which gives a big powerful blast to destroy bunkers another which starts fires and another which contains shrapnel to hurt enemy soldiers A hand held grenade is usually shaped like an egg with a metal arm on its top and a ring When you pull out the ring the arm flips up and ignites a fuse The user then has a few seconds to throw it and take cover usually about 5 seconds It explodes on impact and is very deadly

An early type of hand held grenade was a iron ball filled with gunpowder and with a long fuse that its user must light up with a match before throwing The German army used stick grenades during World War One and World War Two

The most commonly used grenade and it comes in all sizes from 50mm cannons against aircraft to 105mm shots in tanks to up to 50cm or more mounted on great battleships or coastal fortresses It works the same way as a gun but instead of just a lead bullet the shell is packed with explosives like TNT An artillery grenade can do a lot of damage when it explodes

Airplane ammo grenades are used in machine cannons mounted on either warplanes or gunships It is the same shape as a normal shot but much bigger It consist of a tube with an ignition mechanism in its rear which throws out the shell very quickly The shell is loaded with TNT or any other type of explosive

Nathuram Vinayak Godse born at Baramati Pune District India was the man who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi

Nathuram Godse was born on May 19 1910 His father was Vinayak Vaman Rao Godse his mother Lakshmi His father was a fifteen rupee a month employee of the post office 

Godse dropped out of high school and became an activist with the Hindu Mahasabha The Hindu Mahasabha had initially backed Gandhis campaigns of civil disobedience against the British government But Godse and his mentors later rejected Gandhi They felt that Gandhi was sacrificing Hindu interests in an effort to please minority groups They blamed Gandhi for the Partition of India which killed hundreds of thousands of people

The immediate motive for the assassination is usually ascribed to Gandhis January 13 1948 decision to fast to the death unless the Indian central government reversed a decision to withhold the transfer of 55 crore rupees to the government of Pakistan The transfer had been specified in the partition agreement but the Indian government had refused to complete it complaining of continued Pakistani rebel occupation of disputed parts of Kashmir

The Indian government immediately reversed its decision to withhold the funds which infuriated Godse and his fellow Hindu radicals

It is far from clear whether or not the decision to assassinate Gandhi was taken by Godse alone or whether he had consulted with other Mahasabha members or even received their help in carrying out the assassination The Mahasabha resolutely denied all complicity and Godse took full responsibility However many critics believe that Godse did not act alone 

Godse assassinated Gandhi on January 30 1948 approaching him during the evening prayer bowing and shot him three times at close range

The categorical imperative is an idea that Immanuel Kant had about ethics An imperative is something that one must do The categorical imperative says that we should act in ways that we can wish that every person would act Kant thought that another way of saying the same idea is to say that we should treat other persons as persons and not as tools that can help us in some way It comes into Absolutism because it is based on duty and a universal law 

Kant thought that this idea is the basis to treat other people in the right way

Glycolysis is a metabolic process in most organisms It is the first stage in cellular respiration It allows both aerobic and anaerobic respiration 

Glycolysis is thought to be the archetype of a universal metabolic pathway It occurs with variations in nearly all organisms both aerobic and anaerobic The wide occurrence of glycolysis shows that it is one of the most ancient known metabolic pathways

Glycolysis has ten intermediate compounds catalysed by ten different enzymes Only the broad outline is described here

The metabolism of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate is started by energy from 2 ATP molecules

The second half of glycolysis is known as the pay off phase by the net gain of the energy rich molecules ATP and NADH Since glucose leads to two triose sugars in the preparatory phase each reaction in the pay off phase occurs twice per glucose molecule This yields 2 NADH molecules and 4 ATP molecules leading to a net gain of 2 NADH molecules and 2 ATP molecules from the glycolytic pathway per glucose molecule

Summary 2ATP  4ATP 2NADH H 2 pyruvate

Cells performing aerobic respiration synthesize much more ATP but not as part of glycolysis These further reactions use the pyruvate from glycolysis 

Eukaryote aerobic respiration produces about 30 additional molecules of ATP for each glucose molecule Glycolysis through anaerobic respiration is the main energy source in many cells

In psychology an archetype is a model of a person personality or behavior 

In the analysis of personality the term archetype is often broadly used to refer to

But in a strict linguistic sense an archetype is merely a defining example of a personality type In this sense mother figure can be considered an archetype and instances can be found in various female characters with distinct personalities

Archetypes have been present in mythology and literature for hundreds of years The use of archetypes to analyze personality was advanced by Carl Jung early in the 20th century The value in using archetypal characters in fiction derives from the fact that a large group of people are able to unconsciously recognize the archetype and thus the motivations behind the characters behavior

The word archetype appeared in European texts as early as 1545 It derives from the Latin noun archetypum via the Greek noun arkhetypon and adjective arkhetypos meaning first moulded The Greek roots are arkhe  typos

A prototype is an original type form or instance of some thing serving as a typical example basis epitome or standard for other things of the same category Some prototypes are used to find defects

Prototypes are build for different reasons there are different kinds of prototypes

Archetype can mean

Flies in the genus Microdon are different from most other flies because they are myrmecophiles which means they live in ant colonies There are more than 350 species of Microdon in the world The most Microdon live in the tropics 30 species live in North America

Microdon adults are very hairy and look like bees They are 8 to 15 mm long The antennae are almost as long as the flys face These flies have black or pale hairs and their bodies are either black or metallic green or blue

The larvae of Microdon flies look strange They are very round and look like stout little slugs At first scientists thought they were mollusks and scale insects They move slowly

Adult Microdon flies do not hover around flowers such as many other flies instead they remain close to the ant colonies where they grew up

Larvae may be found very deep in ant nests Some Microdon larvae eat ant larvae others are scavengers which means they eat dead plants or insects in the ant colony Most Microdon larvae can only live in the colony of one kind of ant

Not much is known about Microdon flies because their larvae live in ant nests where it is difficult to see them

A pattern is an idea a concept or a model The model is usually abstract and can then be applied to the domain where it is used Pattern matching is checking if a certain pattern is present Many patterns can directly be recognised by the senses 

Some patterns are based on the fact that there are repetitions that a certain thing occurs over and over again An example of a simple pattern might be the tiling of a floor For example lots of bathrooms have a paisley or floral tiling pattern on the floor In Computer science Design patterns are model solutions for problems that occur very often

In Mathematics there are many different patterns For example the Fibonacci sequence is a complex type of pattern There are some simple ones like

1 2 4 8 16 

In this pattern the next number is the product of the previous number multiplied by 2 Basically a mathematical pattern is a sequence of numbers which follows one rule

A shield is the name used to refer to any object or force used to block something

The oldest shield known was a device used to block hand weapons and arrows The shield has been constructed differently over time even animal hides were used and the size and weight were largely different as well

In the Middle ages Kite shields were commonly used The Kite shield is a shield in the form of a kite Because of the lack of mobility due of the kite shields weight kite shields were given up for more mobility and two handed weapons The Buckler was a shield with a round shape It was commonly used as a replacement for the heavy Kite shields

Shields were used even after gunpowder weapons the shield is still used by police and army forces today Many shields now in days are usually made from advanced material as well as electronics Shields also vary from not only hand helds but clothing such as vests and in a way boots and gloves

The future of shields have varied from multiple ideas and fiction usually force fields and energy shields

A kite shield is a Middle Age shield in the shape of a kite The kite shield was used by many knights and people for protection but was given up for two handed weapons and more mobility The efficiency of the kite shields shields shape came into action when cavalry combat occurred useful to protect most of the body from the shoulders down to the feet giving the knight more options in combat

The Socialist Party is one of the largest political parties in France It replaced the French Section of the Workers International in 1969 It is one of the social democratic parties 

It first won power under the Fifth Republic with Franois Mitterrands victory at the 1981 presidential election The partys candidate for the 2007 presidential election Sgolne Royal was defeated by Nicolas Sarkozy by about 53 to 47

After the failure of the Paris commune French socialism was figuratively beheaded Its leaders were killed or exiled Frances first socialist party the Federation of the Socialist Workers of France was founded in 1879 

In 1899 the participation of Millerand in Pierre Waldeck Rousseaus cabinet caused a debate about socialist participation in a bourgeois government Three years later Jaurs Allemane and the possibilists founded the French Socialist Party while Guesde and Vaillant formed the Socialist Party of France Then in 1905 during the Globe Congress the two groups merged in the French Section of the Workers International Jaurs became the party leader

The French socialists were strongly pacifist but following the assassination of Jaurs in 1914 they were unable to resist the wave of militarism which followed the outbreak of World War I

The Socialists suffered a severe split over participation in the wartime government of national unity In 1919 the anti war socialists were heavily defeated in elections In 1920 during the Tours Congress the majority and left wing of the party broke away and formed the French Section of the Communist International This party joined the Third International that was founded by Lenin The right wing led by Lon Blum kept the old house and remained in the SFIO 

In 1934 the Communists changed their line and the three parties came together in the Popular Front which won the 1936 elections and brought Blum to power as Frances first Socialist Prime Minister 

After the liberation of France in 1944 the SFIO had a coalition with a powerful Communist Party and the Christian Democratic MRP This alliance did not survive the Cold War Blum proposed the construction of a Third Force with the center left and the center right against the Gaullists and the Communists However his candidate to lead of the SFIO Daniel Mayer was defeated by Guy Mollet

Mollet was supported by the left wing of the party Paradoxically he spoke a Marxist language without questioning the alliance with the center and the center right He was Prime Minister at the head of a minority government in 1956 The SFIO returned to opposition in 1959 

The SFIO did not nominate a candidate for the 1965 election Consequently it supported the candidacy of Franois Mitterrand a former minister of the Fourth Republic who had been a conservative then an independent of the left He was resolutely anti Gaullist He obtained an honourable result and faced De Gaulle in an unexpected second ballot He thus appeared as the leader of the non Communist left

In order to exist between the Communist Party leading the left and the Gaullist Party leading the country the SFIO Radicals and left wing republican groups created the Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left under Mitterrands leadership

In 1969 the SFIO was replaced by the Socialist Party It was joined by pro Pierre Mends France clubs and left wing republican groups During the Issy les Moulineaux Congress Alain Savary was elected First Secretary with the support of his predecessor Guy Mollet He proposed an ideological dialogue with the Communists

Two years later pro Franois Mitterrand clubs joined the party Mitterrand defeated the Savary Mollet duo by proposing an electoral programme with the Communists 

In 1981 Mitterrand defeated the conservative Valry Giscard dEstaing to become the first socialist elected President of France by universal suffrage 

The PS lost the majority in the French National Assembly in 1986 forcing Mitterrand to cohabit with the conservative government of Jacques Chirac Nevertheless Mitterrand was re elected President in 1988 with a moderate programme entitled united France He proposed neither nationalisations nor privatisations He chose as Prime Minister the most popular and moderate of the Socialist politicians Michel Rocard His cabinet included 4 center right ministers but it was supported by only a plurality in the National Assembly elected in June 1988 

During his second term Mitterrand focused on foreign policy and European construction 

In opposition the PS reconstructed a coalition with the other left wing forces the PCF the Greens the Left Radical Party and the MDC This Plural Left gained the 1997 legislative election and Jospin became Prime Minister of the third cohabitation

His policy was broadly progressive but had little to do with socialism as traditionally understood The Aubry laws reduced the working time to 35 hours a week A universal medical cover was instituted However the policy of privatization was pursued 

On April 21 2002 Jospin was eliminated at the first round of the presidential election 

In the 2004 regional elections the Socialists had a major comeback In coalition with the former Plural Left they gained power in 20 of the 22 metropolitan regions and in the four overseas regions In fact it benefited from a sanction vote against the right 

On December 1 2004 59 of the members of the Socialist Party decided to approve the proposed European Constitution However several well known members of the Party including Laurent Fabius and left wingers Henri Emmanuelli and Jean Luc Mlenchon asked the voters to vote no in the 29 May 2005 French referendum on the European Constitution at which the proposed Constitution was rejected 

For the 2007 presidential election many potential candidates appeared Franois Hollande Laurent Fabius Dominique Strauss Kahn Jack Lang Martine Aubry and Sgolne Royal who was favourite according to the polls 

On November 16 2006 the members of the Socialist Party chose Sgolne Royal to be their candidate with a majority of 60 Her challengers Strauss Kahn and Fabius obtained 21 and 19 respectively

After obtaining 25 of the vote in the first round of Frances presidential elections Sgolne Royal qualified for the second round of voting but lost to Nicolas Sarkozy on May 6 2007

Anomie means a condition when a person has no standards or values

In context with society or government it means social unrest

The word comes from Greek namely the prefix a without and nomos law The original meaning of anomie was against or outside the law 

In contemporary English the word anomie can mean not only normlessness but also anarchy mile Durkheim and later theorists meant with anomie a reaction against or a retreat from the regulatory social controls of society and is a completely separate concept from anarchy which is an absence of effective rulers or leaders

In Albert Camuss existentialist novel The Stranger the protagonist Meursault struggles to construct an individual system of values as he responds to the disappearance of the old He exists largely in a state of anomie as seen from the apathy evinced in the opening lines Aujourdhui maman est morte Ou peut tre hier je ne sais pas 

Dostoevsky whose work is often considered a philosophical precursor to existentialism often expressed a similar concern in his novels In The Brothers Karamazov the character Dimitri Karamazov asks his atheist friend Rakitin without God and immortal life All things are lawful then they can do what they like Raskolnikov the anti hero of Dostoevskys novel Crime and Punishment puts this philosophy into action when he kills an elderly pawnbroker and her sister later rationalizing this act to himself with the words it wasnt a human being I killed it was a principle

On Hermann Hesse s Der Steppenwolf we can also find a very clear picture of anomie The protagonist affirms that the men of the Dark Ages did not suffer more than those of the Classical Antiquity and vice versa It is rather those who live between two times those who do not know what to follow that suffer the most In this token a man from the Dark Ages living in the Classical Antiquity or the opposite would undergo a gulping sadness and agony

Fog is mist when it is very thick It may appear on land or sea It usually lowers visibility When fog forms at high levels it creates a cloud called stratus When the air chills moisture will turn to fog 

Fog is made up of tiny water droplets or in very cold conditions ice crystals When seen on a high speed camera it looks like hundreds of small water droplets moving through the air These water droplets make up the fog or mist There are many types of fog such as evaporation fog advection fog radiation fog and upslope fog The thickness of fog varies depending on the atmosphere temperature weather and location

The 1983 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active Atlantic hurricane season ever recorded The season officially started on June 1 1983 and ended on November 30 The seaon had only a total of 4 named storms which was less than half of the average number of storms in a season In addition it was the least active season since ACE recording began in 1950

The most strongest and deadliest storm of the season was Hurricane Alicia which hit Texas causing great destruction and killing 21 people directly The damages it brought totaled up to be 2 billion

Chantal travelled northeast over open waters missing the island of Bermuda before weakening and being destroyed by a frontal system on September 15 As Chantal never made landfall no damage or fatalities were reported that was related to the storm However Chantal created giant waves that were 3040 ft high across the East Coast of the United States 

Overall damage turned out to be light with only minor beach erosion and flooding along parts of the Virginian coastline

The table on the right shows the ACE for each storm in the season ACE means the measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have higher ACEs ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 35 knots or tropical storm strength The 1983 season had a cumulative ACE of 1686 which is extremely below normal and currently the least active season on record since 1914 which had an ACE rating of 253

In Egyptian mythology Sekhmet was the goddess of fire and war She had the head of a lioness and the body of a woman In her former life she was Hathor She was married to Ptah the god of healing They balanced each other It was believed that her breath created the desert

Sekhmet had the head of a lioness and a body of a woman She was usually depicted with a sun disc on top of her head Many historians argue if she was from Sudan since lions were plentiful there When she was seated she usually held the ahnk of life but when she was standing she held a papyrus scepter the symbol of Lower Egypt 

Sekhmets breath represented a hot desert wind and her body was the glare of the midday sun She was created when Hathor came down to earth to take vengeance on man Sekhmet became the destructive eye of the sun and a solar goddess and was named Eye of Ra The ancient Egyptians knew that the sun could bring life but also death Her name translates as The Powerful One Sekhmet used her power destructively and brutally

People were afraid of Sekhmet because along with her healing and protective powers she was also a destructive and retaliating The ancient Egyptians believed that the Seven Arrows of Sekhmet would bring bad luck so they used many charms and spells to protect themselves The was the Book of the Last Day of the Year which they recited over a piece of cloth and wore around their neck at the end of the year This was considered to be a dangerous time On the first day of the New Year people would exchange amulets in the form of Sekhmet to keep the goddess happy

Sekhmet had an unusual form of worship She was worshipped evenly with her husband Ptah and her son Nefertem Her main cult center was in Memphis Many priests recited complicated prayers used to avert the rage of Sekhmet A well known prayer was called The Last Day of the Year and it was chanted while wearing a piece of cloth around ones head The last day of the year was considered to be a dangerous period for the people because Sekhmet usually attacked then

Sekhmet was the Egyptian goddess of war and destruction She was bloodthirsty out of control and the Egyptians thought she represented natural disasters Her husband Ptah and her son Nefertem were closely worshipped Sekhmet was known as the lady of life and the lady of terror In one myth Sekhmet terrorized the country of Egypt crazy and thirsty for blood Re the sun god sent many swift footed messengers to outsmart the female killing machine The messengers gathered iron ore from the island of Elephantine and mixed it with beer to make a red bloody substance They spread it over the fields and Sekhmet in her rage drank it She fell back and later turned into Hathor the goddess of love

Sekhmets main cult center was located in Memphis When Amenemhat officially moved the capital of Egypt to Itjtawy her cult center moved too Her large similarity to Hathor brought the special erection of dual temples where citizens could worship Sekhmet and Hathor Hundreds of statues were set up during the reign of Amenhotep III At their bases they emphasize Sekhmets savagery and brutal myths

Heterodoxy means a position that is not within the standards of orthodoxy or to put it precisely any opinions or doctrines at variance with an official or orthodox position As an adjective heterodox is used to describe a subject as characterized by departure from accepted beliefs or standards 

In the Eastern Orthodox Church the term is used to refer to Christian churches not belonging to the Eastern Orthodox communion but have no positions that are as different from those of Orthodox Christianity to thought to be as false as heresy

Heterodoxy in the Roman Catholic Church in a similar way means views that differ from strictly orthodox views but retain sufficient faithfulness to the original doctrine to avoid heresy 

Many Roman Catholics profess some heterodox views either on doctrinal or social issues For example the orthodox Catholic position on unbaptized infants is that their fate is uncertain and the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God A heterodox Catholic might profess the belief that unbaptized infants are offered the option to accept or deny salvation by God at their judgment The belief is not orthodox as the Church does not profess a belief as to what happens to unbaptized infants however it is also not heresy as the Church accepts that such a scenario might be possible By contrast a denial of the doctrine of Original Sin or Papal Infallibility  would be labeled heretical

The term heterodox is occasionally used by some Christians to refer to themselves when they are in disagreement with orthodox understandings The heterodox Christians remain in the tradition and attempt a constructive dialog around issues with which they disagree

The Hourglass Dolphin is small and wide compared to other dolphins It only lives in the very cold waters of the Antarctic It was hardly ever seen until a drawing was made of it in 1820 Only 6 Hourglass dolphins have been examined by scientists Boats do not usually go where they live The average water temperature they live in is 01 03 degrees Celsius Their life span is unknown but probably close to other dolphins of its class so probably around 27 to 46 years 

The Hourglass Dolphin is black and white and for this reason was called the sea cow On each side there is a white patch that looks a little like an hourglass shape That is how it got its name and hence the common name of the dolphin An adult is about 18 m in length and weighs 90 120 kg Males are probably smaller and lighter than females but we do not know for sure If you are where it lives in is easy to tell from other dolphins There is only one other dolphin that is as small in the area Hourglass Dolphins usually stay in groups of 5 10 Once a group of 60 was recorded They like to ride the bow of boats There are usually Fin Whales with them It is thought they eat small fish crustaceans and squid They have conical teeth probably used to crack the shells of crustaceans 

The Hourglass Dolphin stays around the Antarctic Some have been seen from the south of New Zealand and Chile We think there are at least 140000 of them

The Giant salamanders are large aquatic amphibians 

They live in brooks and ponds in the eastern United States and in China and Japan

Cryptobranchids are large fat salamanders with folds of skin along their flanks These help increase the animals surface area allowing them to absorb more oxygen from the water 

Their metamorphosis from the larval stage is incomplete so that the adults retain gill slits and lack eyelids They can reach a size of 2 meters in length 

Chinese Giant Salamanders have lived as long as 75 years in captivity The Chinese giant salamander eats aquatic insects fish frogs and also crabs and shrimps 

They hunt mainly at night and as they have poor eyesight use sensory nodes on their head and body to detect tiny changes in water pressure allowing them to find their prey

During mating season these salamanders will travel upstream After the fertilization of the eggs the male will guard them for at least six months At this point the offspring will live off their noticeable stored fat until they are ready to hunt Once ready they will hunt as a group rather than individually

Scientists at Asa Zoo in Japan have recently discovered that the male salamander will spawn with more than one female in his den Sometimes the male Den Master will also allow a second male into the den but the reason for this is unclear

Modes of limited transposition are a kind of musical scale They were used by the French composer Olivier Messiaen

Major scales have twelve different transpositions This means that a major scale can start on any of the twelve notes There are also twelve different transpositions of the minor scale Each transposition is a different combination of notes

A chromatic scale only has one transposition This means that a chromatic scale can start on any note each time it is the same combination of notes

Messiaen was fascinated by scales that only had a few transpositions For example the whole tone scale which rises by a whole tone each time has two transpositions It can start for example on a C so that the notes are C D E F G A C It can start on a C so that the notes are C D F G A B C Transposing this up another semitone starting on D would give D E F G A C D which is exactly the same combination of notes as the first one The whole tone scale was used by many composers including Glinka Liszt and especially Debussy Messiaen called it the first mode of transposition

Messiaens second mode also called the octatonic scale rises by alternating semitone tone semitone tone etc Messiaen used this scale a great deal not just in his tunes but in the chords that he used ie melodically and harmonically

The third mode rises by a pattern of tone semitone semitone It has four transpositions

The other four modes each have a total of six transpositions

Messiaen liked these modes because there is no note which sounds like the starting note All the notes sound equal He described them as having the charm of impossibilities

Olivier Messiaen was a French composer and organist He is the most famous French composer of the mid 20th century and one of the most important and original composers of his time He was a brilliant organist and played the organ at the church of La Trinit in Paris for over 60 years He wrote music for orchestra piano and organ most of which is very difficult to play He was also a great music teacher who taught several young students who became well known composers eg Pierre Boulez Yvonne Loriod Karlheinz Stockhausen George Benjamin and Iannis Xenakis

Messiaen started to compose when he was seven years old When he was given the score of Debussys opera Pellas et Mlisande he could imagine the music in his head and he knew he wanted to be a composer He went to the Paris Conservatoire when he was 11 His teachers included some famous composers such as Paul Dukas Maurice Emmanuel Charles Marie Widor and Marcel Dupr He was appointed organist at the church of La Trinit in Paris in 1930 a post he held until his death 

When World War II broke out Messiaen was made a prisoner of war in 1940 While he was held in a Silesian camp he composed a work which was to become a very famous piece of chamber music the Quatuor pour la fin du temps for piano violin cello and clarinet He composed for these instruments because they were the instruments available The piece was first performed by Messiaen and fellow prisoners to an audience of 5000 inmates and prison guards

When he was free again in 1941 Messiaen became professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatoire He composed 20 pieces for piano which are called Vingt regards sur lenfant Jsus He wrote a book about the way he composed called Technique de mon langage musical

Messiaen soon became famous for his teaching and was invited to teach in other countries such as Germany Hungary and the United States He became interested in the rhythms of Greek and Hindu music 

His first wife died in 1959 and he remarried in 1961 He also became very interested in birdsong and spent a lot of time with his wife in the country with a tape recorder recording birdsong He imitated the birdsong in his music especially in piano pieces called Oiseaux exotiques and the Catalogue doiseaux

Messiaen wrote a lot of organ music which he performed himself One very popular work is called Transports de joie It is one of four pieces called LAscension A much longer work consisting of nine movements is the La Nativit du Seigneur The last movement of this piece is a toccata called Dieu parmi nous It has become a favourite piece for organists to play at recitals or after Christmas carol services

Messiaen wrote a long piece for orchestra called the Turangalla Symphony It was first performed in Boston in 1949 with Bernstein conducting The French government commissioned a piece called Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum which was dedicated to people who had died in the two world wars It was performed in the Sainte Chapelle in Paris and then in Chartres Cathedral in 1965 in the presence of General Charles de Gaulle In 1966 Messiaen became professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire

His visit to the Grand Canyon inspired him to write a ten movement orchestral piece called Des Canyons aux toiles which was first performed in 1974 in New York

Messiaen had been asked in 1971 to write an opera for the Paris Opra At first he did not want to start such a large work but in 1975 he was persuaded to accept the commission and began work on his Saint Franois dAssise It took him several years to compose It was performed in 1983 Messiaen said that he preferred to call it a spectacle instead of an opera 

Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire in 1978 In 1987 he was given the highest rank the Grand Croix of the Lgion dhonneur

Messiaen was in a lot of pain near the end of his life He needed operations on his back He still managed to finish a piece called clairs sur lau del which was first performed by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra six months after the composers death Messiaen had also been composing a concerto for four musicians he felt particularly grateful to his wife Loriod the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich the oboist Heinz Holliger and the flautist Catherine Cantin This was nearly finished when Messiaen died and Yvonne Loriod orchestrated the last movement with advice from George Benjamin

Messiaen said of himself that he was a composer and rhythmician He meant by this that rhythm was very important in his music He taught himself all about Greek metres although he did not speak the Greek language He liked rhythms which use odd numbers Very often a bar of his music may have one extra semiquaver so that there might be 17 semiquavers in a bar He studied Hindu rhythms and found ways of changing the rhythms during the music He was very influenced by the rhythms in Stravinskys famous piece The Rite of Spring

Messiaens harmonies are very individual He was fascinated by scales which can only be transposed in two or three different ways He called these scales modes of limited transposition

Messiaens music is full of different sounds He wrote extremely well for large orchestras and for the organ using different instruments or organ sounds in very original ways eg in Chronochromie for large orchestra and Mditations sur le mystre de la Sainte Trinit a work which uses styles from his earlier period together with birdsong Messiaen had synesthesia which meant that music often made him think of particular colours In his orchestra Messiaen often used an instrument called the ondes Martenot which was a kind of electronic keyboard instrument His sister in law Jeanne Loriod was a famous player of the ondes Martenot Messiaen was also influenced by Indonesian gamelan music For a short time he experimented with total serialism 

In some of his later works such as the La Transfiguration de notre Seigneur Jsus Christ for choir of 100 voices seven instrumental soloists and large orchestra composed in the late 1960s he used a simpler musical language which has helped it to become very popular 

Messiaen was a devout Roman Catholic all his life His religion was a very important influence on his life and music

Simplified Chinese is one of the two commonly used forms of writing Chinese languages As its name shows it is a more simple form of writing compared to traditional Chinese

Simplified Chinese was first put to public use in 1964 by the Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong along with many other educational changes in hopes that the majority of Chinese then illiterate would be able to read and write The concept was one of many steps put forward to eventually change Chinese into a Japanese like language with a phonetic alphabet similar to the Zhuyin system developed in 1912 which was replaced by Pinyin in China in 1958 but still used in Taiwan today The second set of even more simplified Simplified Chinese was put into place first in 1978 then in 1984 and both times met with strong opposition because it created more problems due to the merging of too many characters with different meanings

Traditional characters are used in Taiwan Hong Kong and Macau while people living in Mainland China Singapore and Malaysia use simplified Chinese for their writings

Simplified Chinese although widely enforced and used today in China have no solid proof of actually aiding in learning Chinese while in Taiwan Hong Kong and in Chinese communities overseas Traditional Chinese flourished with no literacy problems It has raised issues in 2009 when a Chinese official Pan Qing Lin addressed the issue and proposed to abolish Simplified Chinese but was later rejected see here

Traditional Chinese is one of the two commonly used forms of writing Chinese languages It is made up of more complex characters compared to the other form of writing named simplified Chinese

Traditional characters are used in Taiwan Hong Kong and Macau while people living in Mainland China Singapore and Malaysia use simplified Chinese for their writings

Plate tectonics is a theory of geology It has been developed to explain large scale motions of the Earths lithosphere This theory builds on older ideas of continental drift and seafloor spreading 

Dissipation of heat from the mantle is the original source of energy driving plate tectonics Exactly how this works is still a matter of debate The driving forces of plate motion continue to be active subjects of on going research

The outermost part of the Earths interior is made up of two layers The lithosphere above includes the crust and the rigid uppermost part of the mantle 

Below the lithosphere is the asthenosphere Although solid the asthenosphere can flow like a liquid on long time scales Large convection currents in the asthenosphere transfer heat to the surface where plumes of less dense magma break apart the plates at the spreading centers The deeper mantle below the asthenosphere is more rigid again This is caused by extremely high pressure

Ocean lithosphere varies in thickness Because it is formed at mid ocean ridges and spreads outwards it gets thicker as it moves further away from the mid ocean ridge Typically the thickness varies from about convert6kmmi thick at mid ocean ridges to greater than convert100kmmi at subduction zones 

Continental lithosphere is typically about convert200kmmi thick though this also varies considerably between basins mountain ranges and stable cratonic interiors of continents The two types of crust also differ in thickness with continental crust being considerably thicker than oceanic

The lithosphere consists of tectonic plates There are eight major and many minor plates The lithospheric plates ride on the asthenosphere These plates move at one of three types of plate boundaries

Earthquakes volcanic activity mountain building and oceanic trench formation occur along plate boundaries The lateral movement of the plates varies from

Tectonic plates can create mountains earthquakes volcanoes mid oceanic ridges and oceanic trenches depending on which way the plates are moving

Depending on how they are defined there are usually seven or eight major plates

The lithosphere is the solid shell of the planet Earth That means the crust and the the part of the upper mantle that behaves elastically on time scales of thousands of years or greater 

Under the lithosphere there is the asthenosphere the weaker hotter and deeper part of the upper mantle This part can flow 

The lithosphere provides a conductive lid atop the convecting mantle as such it affects heat transport through the Earth

There are two types of lithosphere

The lithosphere is divided into tectonic plates which move gradually relative to one another 

Oceanic lithosphere thickens as it ages and moves away from the mid ocean ridge This thickening occurs by conductive cooling which converts hot asthenosphere into lithospheric mantle and causes the oceanic lithosphere to become increasingly dense with age Oceanic lithosphere is less dense than asthenosphere for a few tens of millions of years but after this becomes increasingly denser than asthenosphere 

When a continental plate comes together with an oceanic plate at a subduction zones the oceanic lithosphere always sinks beneath the continental 

New oceanic lithosphere is constantly being produced at mid ocean ridges and is recycled back to the mantle at subduction zones As a result oceanic lithosphere is much younger than continental lithosphere the oldest oceanic lithosphere is about 200 million years old while parts of the continental lithosphere are billions of years old 

Another distinguishing characteristic of the lithosphere is its flow properties Under the influence of the low intensity long term stresses that drive tectonic motion the lithosphere responds essentially as a rigid shell and thus deforms primarily through brittle failure whereas the asthenosphere is heat softened and accommodates strain through plastic deformation

The asthenosphere is part of earths mantle It is about 100 km to 350 km under the surface It is the lower part of the upper mantle and behaves as a hot viscous liquid

It consists of hot weak material that can be deformed like silly putty That means it is capable of gradual flow It is under the lithosphere

Carlo Airoldi was an Italian marathon runner famous for walking to the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens Greece

Airoldi was born in Origgio near Saronno He competed in sporting contests in the Varese Later he competed at the national and international level In 1892 he won the Lecco Milano and the Milano Torino He became famous very quickly He was one of the best marathon runners of his time In September 1895 he won the Milano Barcellona marathon He won 2000 pesetas for his victory

Airoldi wanted to participate in the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens Greece But he did not have many to get to Athens He received some money from La Bicicleta a popular magazine of the time Airoldi decided to run his way to Athens He would need to cover seventy kilometres a day to arrive on time The magazine covered the stages of his journey They also provided him with food and water

Airoldi first went from Milan to Split with no problems In the next stage Airoldi planned to run along the Croatian coast through Kotor and Corfu However he fell and hurt his hand during the journey He had to spend two days resting himself He was told not to cross Albania on foot He decided to take an Austrian boat to Patras Then he would go to Athens on foot 

Airoldi finished his 28 day journey to Athens However he was not allowed to compete in the marathon The head of the Olympic committee said that he was a professional athlete and could not compete Officials in Italy sent telegrams to the official but Airoldi was still not allowed to compete Italians felt that Airoldi was not allowed to compete because Greeks wanted to win the marathon Airoldi did not accept the final decision He then challenged the marathon winner Spiridon Louis to a race However Louis never accepted Airoldis offer

Back in Italy Airoldi tried to beat Spiridon Louiss record He did not succeed He continued to race in Lombardy and Switzerland After he finished racing he moved to South America

Abidjan is the largest city and former capital of Cte dIvoire It is the commercial and banking center of Cte dIvoire as well as the de facto capital Yamoussoukro is the official capital The city is located in bri Lagoon It is built on many peninsulas and islands which are connected by bridges There are an estimated 4 to 5 million people living in the metropolitan area

The city grew after the construction of a new wharf in 1931 It was made the capital of the French colony located there in 1933 In 1983 Yamoussoukro was made the capital of the country but most government offices and foreign embassies are still in Abidjan

Accra is the capital city of Ghana It has a population of about 1970400 The city is Ghanas largest city It is also the administrative communications and economic center of the country The main economic activities in Accra are financial and government services communications construction transportation and agriculture Most of Ghanas ability to make build things is in the capital area 

Accra was founded by the Ga people in the late 1600s The word Accra comes from the word Nkran meaning ants This is because of the many anthills seen in the countryside around Accra During part of its history Accra was a very important place for trade with the Portuguese The Portuguese built a fort in the town Many other countries also built forts at Accra during the 17th century These countries included Sweden the Netherlands France the United Kingdom and Denmark

The location that is Accra today grew into a large town around the original Ga town As the city grew the British Danish and Dutch forts and the small communities that formed around the forts were made added to the city

In 1877 at the end of the second Anglo Asante War Accra replaced Cape Coast as the capital of the British Gold Coast colony After a railroad was built between Accra and the inland locations of mines and farms Accra became the economic center of Ghana Large areas of the city were destroyed by earthquakes in 1862 and 1939 but the city rebuilt around a seaport and later a brewery Each time it rebuilt the city was made larger

The Accra Riots in 1948 started people in Ghana fighting for independence This led to the Ghanas independence from the United Kingdom and it becoming a country in 1957

Today Accra is one of the richest and most modern cities in the African continent It has a high quality of living by African standards

Csar Franck was a composer organist and music teacher of Belgian and German origin who lived in France He was one of the great musicians of his time He was organist at the church of Sainte Clotilde in Paris for more than 30 years and he taught many talented young musicians Most of the music for which he is famous was composed when he was already quite old

Csar Franck was born in Lige a town which is now in Belgium His father came from near the German Belgian border and his mother was German Because his father wanted him to be a concert pianist he was sent to study at the conservatoire in Liege before going to the Paris Conservatoire in 1837 In 1842 his father made him come back to Lige so that he could practise for his career as a virtuoso pianist He went back to Paris in 1844 and stayed there for the rest of his life He told his father he did not want to be a concert pianist This made his father very angry

During his first years in Paris Franck made his living by teaching and playing the organ In 1848 he married His parents came to the wedding although they were still angry with him for not wanting to be a pianist 

In 1858 he became organist at a new church called Saint Clotilde Basilica He stayed there for the rest of his life He decided to improve his organ playing in particular in the use of pedals and in improvisation At that time changes were being made in France to the pipe organ Aristide Cavaill Coll was a very famous organ builder He built an organ for Saint Clotilde Basilica and Franck gave the first recital on the new instrument in December 1859 Franck became famous for the way he improvised on the organ after the services However for many years he did not compose much

Franck was becoming known as a teacher of organ and composition His group of pupils became known as the bande Franck They included Henri Duparc who introduced him to Alexis de Castillon Franck became organ professor at the Paris Conservatoire The students he taught included Vincent dIndy Ernest Chausson and Louis Vierne His organ works especially the Grande Pice Symphonique were some of the best organ pieces to come from France in over a century They helped to prepare for the French symphonic organ style which was to include many famous composers from the late 19th century onwards people such as Vierne Charles Marie Widor and Marcel Dupr 

In 1872 he wrote an oratorio Rdemption It was not a success when it was first performed but this was mainly due to the instrumental parts which had been badly copied and by the famous conductor Edouard Colonne who conducted it very badly The work became popular years later after Franck had died

Franck was now starting to compose the works which made him really famous He wrote a very large oratorio called Les Batitudes Later he wrote a Piano Quintet and the symphonic poems Le chasseur maudit and Les Djinns His piano music included Prlude choral et fugue and the Variations symphoniques In 1885 he was awarded the cross of the Legion dhonneur A year later he became president of the Societe Nationale de Musique He wrote a Violin Sonata and a Symphony which are probably his two most famous compositions now

In 1890 Franck was knocked down by a horse tram while crossing the road He died shortly afterwards although he still managed to compose his Trois chorals for organ just before he died

Many of Francks works use cyclic form a way of making a long work with several movements sound like one piece by making the main theme or themes come back in later movements He wrote in a Romantic style which was partly influenced by the music of Wagner and Liszt Franck had big hands and when he wrote for the piano he often made the pianist play chords with very wide stretches 

He remains famous for just a small number of compositions written in his last years One of his best known shorter pieces is the motet Panis Angelicus which was originally written for tenor solo but is more often heard sung by a soprano or treble

Earths mantle is the 1800 mile thick shell making up about 84 of Earths volume It is over the Earths iron rich core which takes up about 15 of Earths volume

Past episodes of melting and volcanism at the outer levels of the mantle have produced a very thin crust of crystallized melt products near the surface where we live The gases evolved during the melting of Earths mantle have a large effect on the composition and size of Earths atmosphere 

A thin crust the upper part of the lithosphere surrounds the mantle and is about 5 to 75 km thick There are two main zones in the upper mantle The uppermost mantle plus overlying crust are relatively rigid and form the lithosphere an irregular layer with a maximum thickness of perhaps 200 km of which the uppermost mantle is 120 to 50 km thick

Below the lithosphere the upper mantle becomes notably more plastic It is called the asthenosphere and is composed of flowing rock in the state of plasticity about 200 km thick and the lowermost part of the lithosphere composed of rigid rock about 50 to 120 km thick 

The inner mantle is much thicker than the upper mantle It is under great pressure and so is thicker and flows less easily 

The chemical composition of the mantle is heavily biased towards three elements Oxygen 448 by weight Magnesium 228 Silicon 215 Compounds are oxides silica SiO2 46 magnesium oxide MgO 378

In 2007 a team of scientists on board the RRS James Cook went to an area of the Atlantic seafloor where the mantle has no crust covering The anomaly is mid way between the Cape Verdes Islands and the Caribbean in the Atlantic Ocean at or near the Mid Atlantic Ridge It is about three kilometres under the ocean surface and covers thousands of square kilometres

These places are called Oceanic Core Complexes and it is now known that there are more of them

Dakar is the capital city of Senegal It is on the countrys Atlantic coast on the western edge of Africa The city is a trade seaport for items leaving Africa Dakar has a population of 1030594 people The metropolitan area has about 245 million people living in it

The National Assembly of Senegal and Senegal Presidential Palace are in Dakar

The area that is now Dakar was first settled around the 15th century In 1444 Portuguese created a colony there By 1536 the colony was being used to as part of the slave trade Between 1588 and 1677 the area was fought over by many countries During this time it was under the control of the Portuguese Dutch English and finally the French

In 1857 the French built a military base here This base was called Dakar It was made the capital of French West Africa in 1902 Dakar was one of the major cities of the French Empire during this time It was very important in terms of trade military and communications to the empire until World War II 

The city was the capital of the Mali Federation from 1959 to 1960 It then became the capital of Senegal

IRCAM stands for Institut de Recherche et Coordination AcoustiqueMusique It is an institute in Paris for composing electronic music IRCAM is housed underneath the Pompidou Centre which is a very large building devoted to the arts and named after the former French president Georges Pompidou 

In 1970 Georges Pompidou asked the composer Pierre Boulez to start an institution for music research Boulez was in put in charge of the institute It was opened in 1977 Composers were able to work there composing music without having to finish pieces by any particular date They were given plenty of time to experiment Many modern composers such as Harrison Birtwistle Jonathan Harvey and George Benjamin have worked there or were influenced by the music that was being composed there Today musicians working in IRCAM continue to provide many interesting new ideas in electronic music

Yaound is the capital city of the Republic of Cameroon It is the second largest city in the country after Douala

Yaound was founded in 1888 by German traders It was created to be used as a base for the ivory trade and an agricultural research station The city was under the control of Belgian troops during World War I After the war it became the capital of French Cameroon It has remained the capital of the Republic of Cameroon until the present day

Asmara is the capital city of Eritrea It is the largest settlement in the country Asmara has a population of about 579000 people Textiles and clothing meat beer shoes and ceramics are the major industrial products of the city

Asmara grew from four villages founded in the twelfth century It is said that there were four clans living in the Asmara area The women of these tribes told them men to join together to fight bandits who had been attacking the area After they defeated the bandits a new name was given to the place Arbaete Asmara This name in the Tigrinya language meant the four females united Arbaete was later dropped and the name was made Asmara

In 1889 Asmara became an Italian colony It was made the capital of the country in 1897 The city was damaged during earthquakes in 1913 and 1915 During the 1930s the Italians made many chances to how Asmara looked Many new buildings were created during this time This buildings were built in the same style as Italian buildings This gave Asmara the look of an Italian city Today many of the buildings and stores in Asmara still have Italian names 

During World War II after the defeat of Italy in Africa Asmara was under British rule In 1952 the United Nations placed the country and Asmara under Ethiopian control In the 1960s the Eritrean people started fighting for independence from Ethiopia This war lasted until 1991 Asmara was given back to the Eritrean people on May 24 1991

Lom is the capital city of Togo Lom is the administrative and industrial center of the country The city is also the main port of Togo The city exports coffee cocoa copra and palm kernels The population of the city was estimated as around 700000 people in 1998 It is estimated that more than 1 million people live in Lom area at that time

Lom is on the Gulf of Guinea It is in the south west of Togo on the border between Togo and Ghana Things to see in the city include Lom Grand Market the Togo National Museum in the Palais de Congrs a fetish market Lom Cathedral beaches and the former wharf

The city was founded in the eighteenth century by the Ewe people In 1882 the village known then as Bey Beach became a major trading center for the British

Bey Beach became the capital of Togo when the German rulers moved the capital from Aneho in 1897 The city then grew quickly until it was taken by the French Army in 1914 during World War I

The Alpine Newt is an amphibian It is a Salamander The alpine newt is one of five newts in Germany

Early in the year Alpine Newts mate During that time the males have a blue color on their backs Their sides have black and white stripes Their belly has a blue stripe During the mating season early in the year the males exhibit blue colouring on their backs their flanks are stippled black and white and on the belly are marked with a blue stripe Their crest has yellow and black spots The females are more camouflaged They are a kind of grey with less visible spots on the back

The belly side of both sexes is bright orange to vermilion and always unmarked The biggest of the males can reach up to nine and the females up to twelve centimeters in length After the mating season older specimens have a darker almost black velvety skin

The Alpine newt typically lives in forests with good access to water in hilly to mountainous regions They are mostly absent in forest poor areas They often occur  in thick deciduous forests as well as parland and natural gardens Outside the spawning season the Alpine Newt is a land animal During the day it stays in all kinds of undergrowth but during the mating season in cool water After the adults come out of winter dormancy the Alpine Newts immediately take themselves to the spawning pools

The spread of the alpine newt is constricted to Central Europe and parts of mountainous Southern Europe as well as an isolated area on the Iberian Peninsula

There is also some introduced wild populations in the UK

After a steep decrease in the Alpine Newt population in the 1960s 70s they have apparently recovered their numbers a little bit Surveillance in the surrounding area of Cologne pointed particularly toward an increase in alpine newt numbers whereas the numbers of newts in breeding pools seemed to decline In home gardens newts are settling in pools in which there can be a high reproduction rate If fish are maintained in these ponds the population even in larger ponds will be completely wiped out However a small pool of 150 litres volume had more than 60 Alpine Newt larvae of different sizes contained within it at the beginning of July 2003 They were likely spawned from just one female

The Alpine Newt has been usually placed into the Triturus genus Garca Pars et al split the genus Triturus into three and placed the Alpine Newt into its own genus Mesotriton Also the subspecies T a inexpectatus was elevated to species status However this split has not been completely accepted yet Originally 9 subspecies of the Alpine Newt were recognized

A differential equation is a mathematical equation that involves variables like x or y as well as the rate at which those variables change Differential equations are special because the solution of a differential equation is itself a function instead of a number 

If a differential equation only involves x and its derivative the rate at which y changes then it is called a first order differential equation A higher order differential equation has derivatives of other derivatives If there are more variables than just x and y then it is said to be a partial differential equation Sometimes something in the world will obey several differential equations at the same time These are said to be modeled by coupled differential equations

Some differential equations can be solved exactly and some cannot Sometimes one can only be estimated and a computer program can do this very fast Although they may seem overly complicated to someone who has not studied differential equations before the people who use differential equations tell us that they would not be able to figure important things out without them Most scientists and engineers take at least one course in differential equations while in college Some mathematicians devote their career to investigating differential equations that are difficult to solve

Differential equations are used in many fields of science since they describe real things

The type system is central to all taxonomy in botany and zoology The point is to fix each name to a particular specimen This is to make clear what is meant by the names Thus genus and species names are attached to a particular specimen There is also a written description published in a listed journal together with an illustration The idea is that what one person means by the names should be the same as what another person means by the names

According to a precise set of rules laid down by the ICZN and the ICBN the scientific name of every taxon is almost always based on one particular specimen or in some cases specimens Types are usually physical specimens that are kept in a museum or herbarium research collection Failing that an image of an individual of that taxon has sometimes been designated as a type

So a type is one particular specimen of an organism to which the scientific name of that organism is formally attached In other words a type is an example that serves to show the defining features of that particular taxon

A type description must include a diagnosis and an indication of where the type specimen or specimens are deposited for examination

My Otome is an anime made by the Sunrise Inc This is similar to My HiME as My Otome has the same characters but even they have different personalities 

In the future people live in planet Earl Machines called nanomachines still keep the technology from the past Nanomachines are used to give power to Otomes who train in a school called Garderobe academy The Garderobe academy train Otomes to become Meister Otomes who protect their Masters  usually royal people of different kingdoms in Earl 

A woman called Rena Searrs is an Otome who had lost her powers because of having a baby She fights to protect her Master a king from Windbloom and hangs her necklace to the daughter of the king floating her away in a casket at a river 

14 years later Arika Yumemiya goes to Garderobe to become an Otome like her mother who she does not know very much about She enters the school and when she finds many things which disturb her from being an Otome because of her past she tries to bear it with her cheerfulness This story is about how Arika will begin to understand the meaning of being an Otome and how she will save the world from the legendary Harmoniums power

This is the list of My Otomes fictional words or phrases

Otomes are powerful girls of Earl a future planet Otomes are given money for 100 soldiers because they are as strong as 100 soldiers put together They train in a school called Garderobe and when they graduate they become Meisters Otomes can only materialise when their master kisses their earring

Otomes can also become one of the Five Pillars who do not need masters to materialise

When a royal person makes a contract with an otome he or she becomes the master of the otome Otomes can only materialise if the Master kisses them The Master has to share a life with his or her otome so when the otome dies the Master dies and when the Master dies the otome dies

The Five Pillars are the five otomes who use the Shinsou so they do not need a master 

The Shinsou is a source who makes the Five Pillars materialise There is only one Shinsou

A Nanomachine is a machine from the past which puts a Robe inside the otomes bodies so that the Robe shows when they materialise An earring connects to the Nanomachines But the Nanomachine has a weakness to males semen This means that if a otome has sex with a male she will not be able to materialise any more and will stop becoming otomes because she lost her power

When a Master kisses an otomes earring the otome can materialise because the Nanomachine absorbs the heat from the Masters lips absorbing the Masters power This is why a Master must share a life with the otome

Nano means small so Nanomachine means a machine which puts things into the bodys small cells

A gem is a jewel which the Master and otome can use to make a contract with each other There are two same gems one for the Master on his or her ring and one for the otome for her earring From then on the earring on the otomes are kissed by their Masters to materialise

Materialise

Material means an object and materialise means that a hidden object has shown itself In My Otome materialising is when the Robe inside the Otomes are released so that they can fight

A Slave Monster is an evil robot which is controlled by a Slave Master

Like a Master a Slave Master shares a life with its protector Instead of otomes they have a Slave Monster and they do not need a contract to materialise them as Slave Monsters do not materialise The Slave Master has to call the Slave Monster by using the Slave Crystal and give a pledge to the God of Wisdom that they believe in his wisdom and to call out a loyal slave for them A Slave Master must always listen to the Slave leader who is John Smith in My Otome

A Slave Crystal is a diamond shaped crystal To call out a Slave Monster a Slave Master must put blood into the crystal by pushing his or her thumb to the crystal and pledging

Thought is the operation of the brain in conscious activity It may or may not be goal directed aimed at solving specific problems It is not the only way brains operate Behaviour may occur as a result of instinct and the adaptive unconscious may solve problems without a person being aware

Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind mental events mental functions mental properties consciousness and their relationship to the physical body particularly the brain The mind body problem ie the relationship of the mind to the body is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind although there are other issues that have to do with the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the real body

The mind body problem has to do with the explanation of the relationship that exists between minds or mental processes and bodily states or processes The main aim of philosophers working in this area is to determine the nature of the mind and mental statesprocesses and howor even ifminds are affected by and can affect the body 

Our perceptual experiences depend on stimuli which arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world and these stimuli cause changes in our mental states ultimately causing us to feel a sensation which may be pleasant or unpleasant Someones desire for a hat for example will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain what he or she wants The question then is how it can be possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties A related problem is to explain how someones propositional attitudes can cause that individuals neurons to fire and his muscles to contract in exactly the correct manner These comprise some of the puzzles that have confronted epistemologists and philosophers of mind from at least the time of Ren Descartes

The Everglades is a wide and flat tropical river and mangrove swamp in the southern part of Florida near the city of Miami 

The Everglades are covered by many plants and a lot of animals live in the Everglades It is the only place in the world that crocodiles and alligators live together

The Everglades are a National Park and a UNESCO World Heritage Site

The Everglades National Park is a national park in the US state of Florida which protects the southern 25 percent of the original Everglades It is the largest subtropical wilderness in the United States and is visited on average by one million people each year 

It is the third largest national park in the lower 48 states after Death Valley and Yellowstone It has also been declared an International Biosphere Reserve a World Heritage Site and a Wetland of International Importance It is one of only three parks in the world to appear on all three lists 

Unlike most US national parks Everglades National Park was created to protect a fragile ecosystem instead of safeguarding a unique geographic feature The Everglades are wetlands created by a slow moving river originating in Lake Okeechobee fed by the Kissimmee River and flowing southwest at about convert25mikm per day into Florida Bay The park protects an interconnected network of marshland and forest ecosystems that are maintained by natural forces Thirty six species designated as threatened or protected live in the park including the Florida panther the American crocodile and the West Indian manatee The park protects the largest US wilderness area east of the Mississippi River It is the most significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds in North America and contains the largest mangrove ecosystem in the western hemisphere More than 350 species of birds 300 species of fresh and saltwater fish 40 species of mammals and 50 species of reptiles live within Everglades National Park All of South Floridas fresh water which is stored in the Biscayne Aquifer is recharged in the park 

Less than 50 percent of the Everglades which existed before drainage remains today Populations of wading birds dwindled 90 percent from their original numbers between the 1940s and 2000s The diversion of water to South Floridas still growing metropolitan areas is the Everglades National Parks number one threat In the 1950s and 1960s convert1400mikm of canals and levees 150 gates and spillways and 16 pumping stations were constructed to direct water toward cities and away from the Everglades 

Low levels of water leave fish vulnerable to reptiles and birds and as sawgrass dries it can burn or die off which in turn kills apple snails and other animals that wading birds feed upon Populations of birds fluctuate in 2009 the South Florida Water Management District claimed wading birds across South Florida increased by 335 However following three years of higher numbers The Miami Herald reported the same year that populations of wading birds within the park decreased by 29 

The west coast of Florida relies on desalinization for its fresh water the need for water is too great for the land to provide

Hello Community 

We have worked hard and come up with over 15000 articles in this project Some are shorter some longer but most that survive the first few days have a reason to be here Of course some of the articles are generally easier to understand and better written than others this is directly related to how much editing has been done to them 

In order to show to the world that some articles are better than others other Wikipedia projects have developed the idea of featured article This idea wants to say exactly what I have written above that the article is better than others 

As some of you may know this is my third posting to that effect I have come up with a list of things a very good article should have This list can be talked about by any named editor There is also a discussion about the first few articles that have a chance of being very good

So if anyone of you gets bored enough please tell your opinion vote for the articles or tell us about other such articles that you think should be very good  Eptalon 1856 28 May 2007

This might be discussed previously but I think I like to bring it to your attention now In the other Wikipedias there is a policy about writing sourced information in a way However in Simple English Wikipedia we face lots of articles which basically contain a translatedsimplified text based on what is found on other wikipedias

Articles being written from scratch do need to cite sources to show the validity of the content and to give the reader a way to read more about each aspect of the issue Articles being imported from another Wikipedia like English Wikipedia still need to cite their sources for the same reason and because there is no guarantee what is found on En WP is correct How would a reader feel if he reads incorrect statements in Diabetes mellitus which are there only because they were translated from a version of enDiabetes mellitus which contained the wrong information

So all in all I think we should reinforce the necessity of citing sources for example by translating the required RULES from En WP Your comments are appreciated Huji 1825 30 May 2007

Secularism also called Secularity or is the idea of something being not religious or not connected to a church An example in government is since many countries made it a law to be a part of one religion the First Amendment was put in the United States Constitution by founding fathers like Thomas Jefferson to make sure that religion and government stayed separate This means that anyone can choose to practice or not practice any religion they want and the government cannot make them be a part of a religion if they do not want to

It includes about 20 major volcanoes among a total of over 4000 separate volcanic vents

Twelve volcanoes in the arc are over 10000 ft in elevation and the two highest Mount Rainier and Mount Shasta exceed 14000 ft By volume the two largest Cascade volcanoes are the broad shields of Medicine Lake Volcano and Newberry Volcano which are about 145 mi and 108 mi respectively Mount Garibaldi and Glacier Peak are the only two Cascade volcanoes that are made exclusively of dacite

The volcanism in the arc began about 37 million years ago however most of the present day Cascade volcanoes are less than 2000000 years old The most recent major catastrophic eruption in the arc was at Mount St Helens on May 18 1980

The major volcanoes within the arc include Mount Silverthrone Mount Meager Mount Cayley Mount Garibaldi Mount Baker Glacier Peak Mount Rainier Mount St Helens Mount Adams Mount Hood Mount Jefferson Three Sisters Broken Top Mount Bachelor Newberry Volcano Mount Thielsen Mount Mazama Mount McLoughlin Medicine Lake Volcano Mount Shasta ShastinaMount Tehama and Lassen Peak

Subtropical Storm Andrea was the first named storm and first subtropical cyclone of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season It was made on May 9 three weeks earlier than when the 2007 season was supposed to start Andrea started from a non tropical rain weather area off the coast of Daytona Beach Florida After staying close to the same area on May 10 Andrea weakened into a subtropical depression after coming near to dry air and wind shear and on the next day the National Hurricane Center stopped looking at the storm and stopped giving out advisories

The storm made bad surf along the beach areas from Florida to North Carolina Andrea killed a total of 6 people not in a direct way and 5 of those deaths happened when Andrea was extratropical before being a subtropical storm

Andrea was the first tropical storm to form before the official start of the season since Tropical Storm Ana from the 2003 season which formed on April 2003 The storm was also the first named storm to form in the month of May since Tropical Storm Arlene from the 1981 season

Subtropical Storm Andrea formed out of an area of a kind of strong non tropical rainy place that slowly moved around the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of South Carolina After becoming stronger a bit more and having the National Hurricane Center look at the storm closely it was named Andrea on May 9 after the NHC discovered that the system had a closed low level spinning and looked subtropical

The storm did little more than stay near the same place before it became weak and turned into a subtropical depression after coming in contact with dry air and wind shear both things which weaken tropical and subtropical cyclones Andrea then died out off the coast of Florida on May 11 after collapsing because of bad weather conditions for the storm

The extratropical system that would later be Andrea created high waves that made the National Weather Service give a High Surf Advisory at the coastlines between Florida and North Carolina Almost right after the NHC called the storm Andrea it also gave out Tropical Storm Watches to Florida and Georgias coast But the NHC those stopped giving out advisories after Andrea weakened into a depression Also a gale warning was given out for much of the South Carolina coastline

Andrea was known to have killed a total of 6 people while 5 of the people killed happened before Andrea became a subtropical storm Also the storm only made small damages between the Florida and the North Carolina coast

A force field is a field of energy that usually blocks something The force field is common in science fiction and fantasy stories The ideal of a force field may be from the vector field thought it resembled the warding spells the protective magic that was claimed to be used by shamans from long ago

The plasma window is a real live object that resembles the force field it provides a separation between vacuum and gas There is only one true ideal of creating a force shield using an electric field to change the way metallic items move although no power is known to be powerful enough to do this

A shaman is a kind of medicine man who practices shamanism Shamans were believed to be able to talk to the spirit world usually animal spirits The job of the shamans are believed to be is healing weather control or any other supernatural stuffs In some tribes shamanism is important such as the Yanomamis

A Plasma window is a field of plasma that fills an area of space It is similar to a force field The area is created by using magnetism to hold the plasma in place With current technology this area of space is quite small It is in the shape of a flat planes inside a cylinder

As plasma increases in temperature it becomes thicker At a high enough temperature plasma can is thick enough to separate a vacuum from normal atmosphere Plasma does not stop radiation for example lasers from moving through it Because of this scientists can use a plasma window to create an area of vacuum while still letting radiation to move through it This is needed because certain types of radiation can only be created in a vacuum but scientists need to use the radiation on things that are found in a normal atmosphere

The Plasma Window was created at Brookhaven National Laboratory by Ady Hershcovitch It was patented in 1995 Other creations using the same idea as the plasma window include the Plasma Valve

The Plasma Valve is related to a plasma window It was created a year after the plasma window The plasma Valve is a layer of gas inside a special shell A ring around the shell holds a vacuum A breach in the ring can be very bad but technology lets scientists shut off the machine in time before anything happens

A plasma window is usually created at temperatures of 15000 kelvin The only limit to the windows size is the amount of energy needed to create it A window needs 20 kW of energy for every inch in size

Plasma windows will glow in different colors depending on the gas used to create the plasma

Titus Macchius Plautus wrote plays in Ancient Rome Many people just call him Plautus He was probably born in Sarsina around 254 BC His comedies are among the earliest works of Latin literature that has not been lost He is also one of the earliest writers of musical theater

Little is known about Plautus early life When Plautus was young he built stages for plays He also helped change the scenes This might be when he started to love the theatre People noticed that he was a talented actor He called himself Macchius and Plautus Tradition also says that after some time he made enough money to start working in the shipping business He started something but he was not successful He then is said to have worked as someone who worked with his hands He learned about Greek drama particularly the New Comedy of Menander in his free time His studies led to his plays being shown The plays were first shown between c 205 BC and 184 BC Plautus comedies are mostly adaptations of Greek plays for Roman people They are usually based on the works of the Greek playwrights

H M Tolliver talks about the state gods of Rome and what their importance was in the Theatre of Plautus These gods were an important part of the Romans lives in Plautus time  people were supposed to worship them Tolliver tells us that the gods were not exactly like the gods worshipped today They were worshipped but also stood as a national symbol State religion also served as a political tool If the gods supported a bad leader the people should too

Plautus is sometimes accused of teaching the public indifference and mockery of the gods Any character in his plays could be compared to a god Whether to honour a character or to mock him these references were demeaning to the gods These references to the gods include a character comparing a mortal woman to a god or saying he would rather be loved by a woman than by the gods Pyrgopolynices from Miles Gloriosus in bragging about his long life says he was born one day later than Jupiter In Pseudolus Jupiter is compared to Ballio the pimp It is not uncommon either for a character to scorn the gods This can be seen in Poenulus and Rudens

Usually the only characters that scorn a god are those of low standing like a pimp Plautus perhaps does this to further demoralize the characters Soldiers often bring ridicule among the gods Young men meant to represent the upper social class often make fun of the gods in their remarks Parasites pimps and courtesans often praise the gods with little ceremony Tolliver argues that drama both reflects and foreshadows social change It is likely that there was already much skepticism about the gods in Plautus time Plautus did not make up or encourage irreverence to the gods but used the ideas of his time The state controlled stage productions and Plautus plays would have been banned had they been too risky

Gnaeus Naevius was another Roman playwright of the late third century BC He wrote tragedies and even founded the fabula praetexta in which he dramatized historical events He fought in the First Punic War and his birth therefore is placed around the year 280 BCE His first tragedy took place in 235 BCE Plautus would have been living at the exact time as Naevius but began writing later Naevius is most famous for having been imprisoned by the Metelli and the Scipiones two powerful families of the late third century Naevius imprisonment and eventual exile is a case of state censorship This fear of censorship may have influenced Plautus choice of what he wrote about and how he wrote about it

While hundreds of plays have been attributed to Plautus name the canon consists of 20 surviving plays To be able to use a more diverse set of characters he developed what is called a stock character He sometimes used typical situations where these characters could be used as well He always used the same kinds of stock characters especially if he could amuse the audience As Walter Juniper wrote Everything including artistic characterization and consistency of characterization were sacrificed to humor and character portrayal remained only where it was necessary for the success of the plot and humor to have a persona who stayed in character and where the persona by his portrayal contributed to humor

For example in Miles Gloriosus the titular braggart soldier Pyrgopolynices only shows his vain and immodest side in the first act while the parasite Artotrogus exaggerates Pyrgopolynices achievements Artotrogus creates more and more ludicrous claims that Pyrgopolynices agrees to without question These two are perfect examples of the stock characters of the pompous soldier and the desperate parasite that appeared in Plautine comedies 

In this way Plautus could greatly simplify complex characters and give the audience what it wanted The audience to whose tastes Plautus catered was not interested in the character play instead it wanted humor that was easy to understand by many people Stock setups offered such humor Plautus used puns he played with words or he gave the words another meaning Usually the humorous characters in Plautine plays are of low social standing This helps the comedy overall because lower class characters were often taken less seriously and had to be less careful what they said

Mount Edziza located 38 km southeast of Telegraph Creek British Columbia Canada is a potentially active volcanic complex in the Stikine Volcanic Belt It is a shield volcano that began erupting about 10 million years ago with continued activity until about 1340 years ago

It is made up of a lot of cinder cones and blocky lava flows that still keep their first forms This is the second biggest area of volcanic activity in the northern Stikine Volcanic Belt as well as in Canada The complex includes the Mount Edziza Plateau a big volcanic plateau made of mostly basaltic lava flows with four big stratovolcanoes built on top of the plateau

A lot of eruptions have happened in the last 10000 years including Desolation Mess Lake Snowshoe lava fields Kana Cone Eve Cone Cinder Cliff Icefall Cone Ridge Cone Williams Cone and Walkout Creek Many of the volcanic features in the volcanic complex are protected as part of Mount Edziza Provincal Park one of the bigger provincial parks in British Columbia

Deomys 

Lophuromys 

Uranomys 

Deomyines share no morphological characteristics that can be used to separate them from other muroids Subtle aspects of the third upper molar have been suggested though This subfamily is united solely on the basis of shared genetic mutations These conclusions have demonstrated good statistical support using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA as well as DNA DNA hybridization 

Because of the lack of physical characteristics that supportthis group it is very possible that the subfamily as it is currently recognized could grow bigger Many of the genera currently placed in Murinae or Dendromurinae have never been included in a molecular phylogenetic analysis There are potential surprises awaiting when they are

All genera are found in Africa suggesting the deomyines may have originated there The spiny mice Acomys spp are also found in Asia

There are currently 4 genera and 36 species included in the Deomyinae

Acomys cahirinus  Cairo Spiny Mouse

Acomys chudeaui  Chudeaus Spiny Mouse

Acomys cilicicus  Asia Minor Spiny Mouse

Acomys cineraceus  Grey Spiny Mouse

Acomys dimidiatus

Acomys ignitus  Fiery Spiny Mouse

Acomys johannis  Johans Spiny Mouse

Acomys kempi  Kemps Spiny Mouse

Acomys louisae  Louises Spiny Mouse

Acomys minous  Crete Spiny Mouse

Acomys mullah  Mullah Spiny Mouse

Acomys nesiotes  Cyprus Spiny Mouse

Acomys percivali  Percivals Spiny Mouse

Acomys russatus  Golden Spiny Mouse

Acomys seurati  Seurats Spiny Mouse

Acomys spinosissimus  Spiny Mouse

Acomys subspinosus  Cape Spiny Mouse

The term spiny mouse refers to any species of rodent within the genus Acomys They are usually called Spiny mice in English They look like mice of the genus Mus Spiny mice are small mammals with bare scaled tails Their coats have unusually stiff guard hairs that work the same way as the spines of a hedgehog These stiff hairs are why they are called the spiny mouse

Even though they look like members of the genus Mus scientists thhink that the African spiny mice may be more closely related to gerbils than to common mice

African spiny mice originated in the deserts of Africa They are often kept as exotic pets in other parts of the world particularly Western nations such as the United States In the pet trade they are commonly called Egyptian spiny mice or more simply spiny mice Though these animals are like pet mice and rats the tail of a spiny mouse is much more delicate The spiny mouse should never be picked up by its tail and should be handled with care to avoid a degloving injury

Because of their desert origin spiny mice need warm temperatures and should be kept around 80 degrees Farenheit These animals are very social and should always be housed in groups when possible As spiny mice are prone to obesity it is important to provide a big space and a complex environment to encourage exercise They need constant attention and should NEVER be housed in a cage smaller than 4X4 ft

Gestation length is between 38 and 42 days Litters are normally 2 to 3 pups but females may have up to 6 pups in a single litter Other females within the social group may help in the birthing process and look after the pups Pups are born with their eyes open and covered in fur They will begin to leave the nesting area at about 3 days of age Pups are weaned around 5 to 6 weeks and reach sexual maturity at about 6 to 9 weeks A female can become pregnant at any time in the year and may have up to 12 litters in a year Spiny mice can live for 4 to 5 years

Anglicanism is the term used for the doctrine religious belief faith system practice and principles of the Church of England and other Anglican churches The term at its broadest includes those who have accepted the work of the English Reformation as embodied in the Church of England or in the offshoot Churches which in other countries have adhered at least substantially to its doctrines its organization and its liturgy

The term Anglican derives from a Medieval Latin phrase dating to at least 1246  ecclesia anglicana meaning the English Church The noun Anglican is used to describe the people institutions and churches as well as the liturgical traditions and theological concepts developed by the state established Church of England and the Anglican Communion a theologically broad and often divergent affiliation of thirty eight provinces that are in communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury

The pocket gophers are burrowing rodents of the family Geomyidae These are the true gophers Several ground squirrels of the family Sciuridae are often called gophers as well They are not true gophersthough The name Pocket Gopher on its own is used for a number of subspecies of the family Pocket gophers despite being largely a pest are a symbol of the US state of Minnesota sometimes called The Gopher State

Pocket Gophers are widely distributed in North America extending into Central America

Gophers are heavily built and most are moderately large They usually weigh a few hundred grams A few species reach weights approaching 1 kg Most gophers have brown fur which often closely matches the color of the soil in which they live Their most characteristic feature is their large cheek pouches The pocket in their name comes from these pouches These pouches are fur lined and can be turned inside out They extend from the side of the mouth well back onto the shoulders They have small eyes and a short hairy tail which they use to feel around tunnels when they walk backwards

All pocket gophers are burrowers They are larder hoarders and their cheek pouches are used for transporting food back to their burrows Gophers can collect large hoards Their presence is unambiguously announced by the appearance of mounds of fresh dirt about 20 cm in diameter These mounds will often appear in vegetable gardens lawns or farms as gophers like moist soil They also enjoy feeding on vegetables For this reason some species are considered agricultural pests They may also damage trees in forests Although they will attempt to flee when threatened they may attack other animals including cats and humans and can inflict serious bites with their long sharp teeth

There has been much debate among taxonomists about which races of pocket gopher should be recognised as full species and the following list cannot be regarded as definitive

Some sources also list a genus Hypogeomys with one species but this genus name is normally used for the Malagasy Giant Rat which belongs to the family Nesomyidae

Florentiamyidae 

Although they do not look similar gophers are joined with kangaroo rats into a common superfamily This is widely agreed Overall morphology the fossil record sequence analysis and biogeography all support this relationship

Modern geomyoids are mostly restricted to North America but some have extended their range into South America since the Great American Interchange Fossil taxa are known from throughout Laurasia

Some authorities consider the geomyoids related to squirrels beavers and mountain beavers

Other authorities consider geomyoids may be related to mice jerboas and perhaps dormice

The family of rodents that include kangaroo rats kangaroo mice and rock pocket mice is the Heteromyidae family Most heteromyids live in complex burrows in the deserts and grasslands of western North America Some species within the Heteromys and Liomys genera are also found in forests and can be found down as far as northern South America They feed mostly on seeds and other plant parts which they carry in their cheek pouches to their burrows

Although they are very different in physical appearance the closest relatives of the heteromyids are pocket gophers in the Geomyidae family

A kangaroo mouse is either one of the two species of jumping mouse native to the deserts of the Southwestern United States Most of them can be found in the state of Nevada The name kangaroo mouse refers to the species extraordinary jumping ability as well as its habit of bipedal locomotion The two species are

Both species of kangaroo mouse live in sandy desert ecosystems They forage for seeds and vegetation amongst the scrub brush of their native habitat The Dark Kangaroo Mouse is also known to feed occasionally on insects and carrion Interestingly the mouse never drinks water instead deriving it metabolically from the foods it eats The kangaroo mouse collects food and maintains large stocks in their burrows These burrows are excavated to a length of between 3 and 8 feet The burrow the entrance to which the mouse covers during daylight hours is also used to raise litters of between 2 and 7 young The Pale Kangaroo Mouse burrows only in fine sand while the Dark Kangaroo Mouse prefers fine gravelly soils but may also burrow in sand or sandy soil Kangaroo mice are nocturnal and are most active in the two hours following sunset They are believed to hibernate during cold weather

The kangaroo mice are closely related to the kangaroo rats which belong to the same subfamily Dipodomyinae

Perognathus is a genus of pocket mouse Like other members of their family they are more closely related to pocket gophers than to true mice

Chaetodipus is a genus of pocket mouse Like other members of their family such as pocket mice in the genus Perognathus they are more closely related to pocket gophers than to true mice

Sometimes members of the genus Chaetodipus are placed in the genus Perognathus

Zarbon is a character in Dragonball Z

Zarbon is a powerful warrior who values beauty and his looks above all else He first shows up in the Namek saga and is shown to be one of Friezas top two henchmen Little is known about the character other than his pride and his long history with Vegeta His long green braided hair tiara and earrings might mean he was a high class prince He also wears a very long cape as well as leg and arm warmers Along with his choice of clothing he wears the common armor that most of Friezas men have including the shoulder pads and a blue scouter He is very vain and he considers himself to be of high standard 

Zarbon has the ability to transform into a reptilian beast With brute strength and ferocity his second form is much uglier than his first form Upon transforming his size increases as well as his muscular build and his skin becomes covered with what appear to be scales like a reptile Its clear that he finds this transformation ugly as it not only offends his general love of beauty but also takes away his attractive form In essence he is both a beauty and a beast

In a speculative storyline written for the made for television Dragon Ball Z Special 1 Bardock The Father of Goku set before the events of the Dragonball series Zarbon appears to have acted primarily as Friezas advisor It was Zarbon who is shown to have advised Frieza that it would be wise to wipe out the entire Saiyan race before they posed a threat He is depicted as being beside Frieza as he killed King Vegeta and destroyed Planet Vegeta

Zarbon is first seen in the anime and manga when he accompanies Lord Frieza and Dodoria to the Planet of Namek in search of the Dragonballs which Frieza desires so that he can wish for immortality Zarbon helps in the collection of most of the Dragonballs mercilessly slaughtering Namekians who seek to keep the Dragonballs hidden After Vegeta and the separate group of Gohan Krillin and Bulma show up there are some scuffles that leave Dodoria dead Zarbon is the only remaining top henchman of Frieza and is sent to find another Namekian village but instead comes face to face with Vegeta Vegeta overpowers him at first but when Zarbon realizes his life is threatened he surprises Vegeta by transforming into his significantly more powerful  and ugly  form This allows him to easily beat Vegeta who he leaves for dead

After returning to Frieza he is ordered to go back and retrieve Vegeta because he had hidden a Dragonball Zarbon does this bringing Vegeta to Friezas medics for treatment of his wounds However Vegeta soon escapes with Friezas dragonballs after being healed Ordered to find the Saiyan Prince or face death himself Zarbon again sets out in search of Vegeta This time the Prince finds him and the two battle while Krillin and Bulma look on Zarbon eventually transforms but his power is not enough to defeat a healed Vegeta and he is killed in the battle

Zarbon has appeared as a playable character in numerous video games some of which include Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi Dragon Ball Z Budokai and Ultimate Battle 22 In Dragon Ball Z Super Sonic Warriors 2 he is a support type character

He is not only a playable character in Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2 but he has his own storyline in the main story mode of the game entitled Beautiful Treachery Upon hearing of the power of the Dragon Balls he hatches a plan to steal them and wish for eternal beauty This plan mainly revolves around forcing Krillin to assist him killing Dodoria and distracting Frieza with a surprise visit from his brother Cooler He even gets to fight alongside Goku when his plan goes wrong In the end the battle between Frieza and Cooler destroys the planet tragically taking Zarbon despite the effects of his wish with it

In an issue of Beckett Anime a Beckett magazine publication Zarbon was voted as one of the top five greatest henchmen of all anime and was the only character from Dragon Ball Z on the list

Dodoria is a character in Dragonball Z

Dodoria is a large round alien warrior appearing to be overweight by human standards He has protruding spikes on his arms and head He also wears the common armor that most of Lord Friezas men have including the shoulder pads and a green scouter

Before the events of Dragon Ball Z Dodoria was always by Friezas side along with Zarbon He witnessed the killing of King Vegeta and the destruction of planet Vegeta Before the destruction of Planet Vegeta he and a group of his elites were sent to eradicate Bardock and his team of fighters He was successful in killing most of the team but left Bardock alive after using a powerful mouth blast on him Both Frieza and Zarbon looked down upon him for carelessly leaving him alive

Dodoria accompanied his master Frieza and his comrade in battle Zarbon to the green Planet Namek in search of the Namek Dragonballs While searching in a village for a Dragonball Dodoria killed a few villagers but before he could kill Dende he was attacked by Krillin and Gohan He pursued them but they escaped after Krillin used a blinding attack called Solar Flare Dodoria then launched an attack over a large area which lead him to believe that he had killed them On his way back he was ambushed by Vegeta who easily overpowered him Dodoria tried to bargain with Vegeta by telling him the secret of the destruction of Planet Vegeta but he did not care Vegeta killed him during his attempted escape He only cameos again during the movie Fusion Reborn and in the Super Android 17 Saga when people from Hell are able to escape He is killed again both timesIn addition he also loses his scouter while searching for Vegeta

Dodoria uses his brute force to overwhelm his opponents He has the generic powers that many other Dragon Ball characters share including the ability to throw numerous exceptionally powerful rapid blasts He can also emit blasts from his mouth as well most commonly known as mouth blasts The most noticeable trait that Dodoria has is his ability to throw his weight around He is extremely fast in spite of his weight He can perform multiple spins and aerial strikes regardless of his size

Dodoria has appeared as a playable character in many video games some of which include Dragon Ball Z Budokai Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi and Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2 He is also in Dragon Ball Z Super Sonic Warriors 2 but only as a support type character

Frieza is a fictional character in Dragon Ball Z

Frieza is one of the strongest aliens in Dragon Ball Z He enjoys at invading other planets Frieza is very mean person who thinks he is very strong He has destroyed planets without caring He will even kill his own servants Frieza is always trying to get more power Because of this he ends up fighting the heroes of Dragon Ball Z so he can get the Dragon Balls The Dragon Balls are magical balls that can grant wishes

Frieza is what the creator Akira Toriyama thought monsters looked like in his childhood

Friezas name is a pun on all things relating to the cold with family members introduced later following his example As his name ends in a short a vowel the characters name is typically spelled with an a at the end However during FUNimations dubbing of Dragon Ball Z the English writers went with the spelling of Frieza This has led to some conjecture over it US released video games and the English dub use Frieza while the Japanese language subtitles on FUNimations DVDs and the Viz translation of the manga uses Freeza

Frieza spies on Vegeta during his mission on Earth and learns that there are Dragon Balls on Planet Namek He wants to get them and wish that he would never die so Frieza uses his soldiers to try and steal the Dragon Balls from the Namekians After Cui Dodoria and Zarbon three of Friezas soldiers are beaten by Vegeta he sends the Ginyu Force his strongest men to get the Dragon Balls and destroy the Saiyan enemy They almost win but Goku comes to Namek and quickly defeats them 

While trying to learn how to summon Porunga the namekian dragon Frieza is confronted by Nail the strongest of the Namek warriors Frieza defeats Nail effortlessly leaving him to die after discovering that dende has ran to the Z fighters to tell Krillin and Gohan how to use the dragon balls Enraged the great tyrant follows in pursuit of the heroes only to be faced with a much more powerful Vegeta who is now capable of matching Friezas current strength

Spurred on by Vegeta Frieza unveils his second form allowing him to defeat Vegeta and critically injure Krillin taunting Gohan with his friends limp body Before he can finish them off Piccolo joins the battle  roughly even in abilities to Frieza thanks to a splendid fusion with the dying Nail The heroes are able to regroup Dende healing them one after another Frieza himself is seriously wounded for the first time Krillin is able to chop off a portion of his tail using a Destructo Disk

Having difficulty contending with Piccolo Frieza again transformed unlocking more of his power and enabling him to lay waste to his opponent Finally he unveiled his true form stressing that he intended to give his foes the pleasure of observing it before they died As his first act Frieza murders Dende who had been healing the heroes before brutally beating Vegeta Just as Frieza was about to slay Vegeta the healed Goku arrives on the battlefield ready to fight Frieza Vegeta believing that Goku had finally become a full fledge Super Saiyan taunts Frieza even though he Vegeta is too badly beaten to even stand Frieza proud of his past accomplishments smirks before sending a Death Beam through the Saiyan Princes heart Teetering on the brink of death Vegeta is able to tell the newly healed Goku of Friezas genocide of the Saiyan race imploring him to take revenge on behalf for all Saiyans As Vegeta finishes his plea to Goku he dies Goku saddened by Vegetas death buries him and vows to finish Frieza Goku and Frieza then spar with Frieza realizing that his opponent is the son of the Saiyan that gave him such trouble years before Goku and Frieza are an even match for awhile until Frieza reveals that he had only been fighting at a mere fraction of his full power Frieza then increases to 50 and easily gains the upper hand against Goku with Goku struggling to keep up

Goku is eventually able to heavily wound Frieza using a Spirit Bomb calling on the energies of the entire planet Namek

Believing the warlord dead the heroes take the time to relax not noticing that Frieza had emerged from the blasts crater Frieza retaliates by mortally wounding Piccolo and murdering Krillin Already bordering on the edge of his rage Frieza killing Krillin pushes Goku over it his rage exploding causing Frieza to inadvertently create what he had always feared A Super Saiyan

In the ensuing battle Frieza and Goku trade blows but as the fight progresses Friezas power gradually diminishes with the repeated punishment In frustration Frieza sends a Death Ball into the core of the planet starting a chain reaction that would destroy Namek in five minutes Frieza unleashes 100 of his power Frieza is now able to launch a huge assault against the surprised Goku who had not expected Friezas power to be as high as it is Goku and Frieza face off and eventually after a very long battle Goku gets the battle under his control and calls off the fight claiming it would be pointless to continue Frieza losing strength rapidly and Goku already having humbled the tyrant Humiliated Frieza refuses to relent attacking Goku with two Tsuibi Kienzan As Goku dodges the attacks Frieza ironically becomes distracted long enough to be vivisected by his own attack

Barely clinging to life but desperate to survive Frieza begs and begs for mercy which Goku hesitantly provides Friezas arrogance refuses to allow him to be beaten and saved by a Saiyan monkey and he expends what little energy he has left to attack Goku Overcome with anger Goku fires a Ki blast that consumes both Frieza and his attack seemingly ending Friezas reign over the universe 

Unbeknownst to Goku Frieza survived the destruction of Namek Able to do nothing more than breathe Frieza floated in the planets debris kept company only by his thoughts of how the universes conqueror had been thoroughly beaten by a Saiyan His father King Cold had crews search the area not believing his son to have been killed by something as insignificant as the explosion of a planet What could be found of Frieza was salvaged his missing limbs and face reconstructed with cybernetic enhancements Scarred and bitter  though feeling stronger than he had before Friezas first thought upon rehabilitation is revenge on those who sullied him

Frieza beats Goku to Earth Despite his ill intentions towards Earth and all who lived there Frieza notes Its a good planet on first viewing ref Frieza orders his henchmen to find and slaughter its inhabitants with Frieza keen on killing his enemys friends himself However his army is torn apart by the blade wielding fighter Future Trunks Frieza dismisses his challenger as an insolent child and pays him almost no heed until the boy reveals himself as another Super Saiyan

Dumbstruck Frieza makes several different efforts to kill Trunks each of which is parried easily He then plays his trump card in the form of a Death Ball ten times the size of the one that destroyed Planet Namek Even this is nonchalantly brushed away until a mortified Frieza causes it to detonate with another shot of ki Thinking him to be destroyed by the assault both the father and son are stunned when Trunks fires the Burning Attack out of nowhere Fuming Frieza becomes oblivious to his opponents position and is surprised and sliced in half by the Saiyan youth before being cut to pieces and blown to dust

After his death Frieza makes numerous cameo appearances throughout the remainder of the series from Hell including observing Gokus fight with Buu alongside other defeated villains from the series

In Dragon Ball GT he teams up with Cell to act as a distraction for Goku while a horde of villains from the Z Fighters past escape Hell Frieza traps Goku in the next world but even allied with Cell he is eventually defeated and remains in Hell 

Over time Friezas power became so great that his body could not comfortably contain it and a series of physical transformations were developed that limit his actual strength While changing shape from his first form each alteration builds on the previous In all Frieza demonstrated four transformed states each with increasing power

In his first form Frieza is a relatively short humanoid albeit with a large chestnut shaped skull with two horns He also has a tail with a spiked end as well as having three talon like toes He wears the same upper body armor that many of his subordinates are shown to wear and while traveling often gives the appearance of weakness by exclusively using his hoverchair for transportation leaving his henchmen to do his dirty work

His second form is similar in appearance to the first except much larger both in height and muscle mass Frieza claiming to have nearly doubled his power in this state He also grows longer horns which now instead of protruding sideways from his skull curve sharply upwards into near right angles His armor cannot contain his form and shatters leaving him with a new white natural armor covering his chest and shoulders In this form he somewhat resembles his father King Cold

Friezas third form is again more brutish with an extremely elongated skull His facial features contort and change with his nose melding into his mouth to form a crude beak His original horns recede and more now erupt in pairs along the length of his head He walks and stands with a slight hunch as if the strain of supporting his head was too much for even Friezas own body to bear This form vaguely resembles a Xenomorph from the Alien movies

Drastically differing from his previous transformations in his final form Frieza instead regresses becoming shorter and less bulky his horns and spikes disappear and his physique becomes streamlined His skin becomes pure solid white with purple sections on his head shoulders forearms chest and shins

Frieza is also able to attain 100 power greatly increasing his muscle mass At 100 this is literally the peak of Friezas potential and the maximum amount of power his body can output his muscle mass becomes engorged compared to his previously sleek frame However due to the strain on his body he can not fight at full capacity for long slowly weakening whether he is dealing or receiving damage

Physically ruined while caught in the Planet Nameks explosion after his defeat what remained of the still living Frieza was salvaged and rebuilt with cybernetic enhancements by scientists under the order of King Cold The whole of the lower half of his body and right side of his face are replaced with scarring and metal accouterments covering what little was left of his organic self These enhancements allowed him to exceed the limits of power imposed by his fully organic form though how much more powerful it made him is unknown

Despite the clerical origin of many of its authors Medieval Latin should not be confused with Ecclesiastical Latin There is no real consensus on the exact boundary where Late Latin ends and Medieval Latin begins Some scholars have their surveys of it begin with the rise of early Christian Latin in the middle of the 4th century others around the year 500

Honeydew is a liquid sugar that aphids and some scale insects make when they eat plant sap Honeydew is very sticky

To eat plant sap the aphid or scale insect pushes its mouth parts into the plant Plant sap is under pressure inside the plant The pressure inside the plant pushes the sap into the insect Sometimes the pressure is so great that the sap is forced out of the rear of the insect This is how honeydew is made The honeydew then drops from the insect and makes a sticky layer on the plant

Honeydew on plants can cause sooty mould which is white and appears as powder on the plant

Honeydew is collected by some insects such as some wasps and bees Some honey bees make honeydew into a dark strong honey called honeydew honey Honeydew honey is valuable in parts of Europe and Asia because people think it can be used as a medicine

Ants collect honeydew from aphids Many ants even harvest the honeydew directly from the aphids This helps the aphids because the ants chase predators such as lady beetles away from the aphids

The term Ecclesiastical Latin means the Latin language that is used in documents of the Roman Catholic Church and in its Latin liturgies It is not a distinct language or dialect but only the Latin language used for ecclesiastical purposes because the same language can be used also for commercial or other purposes

The Church issued the dogmatic definitions of the first seven General Councils in Greek and even in Rome Greek remained at first the language of the liturgy and the language in which the first Popes wrote The Holy See is not obliged to use Latin as its official language and in theory could change its practice

But Latin has the advantage that the meaning of its words have less likelihood of changing radically from century to century This helps to ensure theological precision and orthodoxy Accordingly recent Popes have reaffirmed the importance of Latin for the Church and in particular for those undertaking ecclesiastical studies

Mate is a traditional drink in some countries in South America especially in Argentina Paraguay and Uruguay It is also common in parts of Chile Brazil Lebanon and Syria The drink which contains caffeine is made by an infusion of dried leaves of yerba mate It is usually drunk with friends and served in a hollow calabash gourd with a Bombilla a special metallic drinking straw The straw is also called a bomba in Portuguese and a masassa in Arabic It is traditionally made of silver The gourd is known as a mate or a guampa In Brazil it called a cuia Even if the water comes in a very modern thermos the drink is traditionally drunk from mates or cuias There are now modern tea bag type infusions of mate called mate cocido which have been sold in Argentina for many years They are drunk froma cup They are sold under such trade names as Cruz de Malta and in Brazil under the name Mate Leo

Like other brewed herbs yerba mate leaves are dried chopped and ground into a powder called yerba The bombilla is both a straw and a sieve The end which is place in the drink is wider with small holes or slots that let the brewed liquid in but block the chunky matter that makes up much of the mixture A modern bombilla uses a straight tube with holes or spring sleeve to act as a sieve Bombilla means light bulb in Spanish but locally it is little pump or straw

Mate is made differently in different places with many arguments about which way is the best In nearly all methodsthe gourd is nearly filled with yerba and hot water is added

The most common way to make mate involves a careful arrangement of the yerba in the gourd before adding hot water The gourd is filled one half to three quarters of the way with yerba Extra herbs may be added for either health or flavor benefits This is most often done in Paraguay where people get herbs from a local yuyera The mate is used as a base for their herbal infusions When the gourd is filled the preparer typically grasps it with their full hand They cover the opening and roughly seal it with their palm Then the mate is turned upside down and shaken vigorously but briefly and with gradually decreasing force in this inverted position causing the finest most powdery particles of the yerba to settle toward the preparers palm and the top of the mate

Once the yerba is settled the mate is carefully brought to a near sideways angle with the opening tilted just slightly upward of the base The mate is then shaken very gently with a side to side motion This further settles the yerba inside the gourd so that the finest particles move toward the opening and the yerba is layered along one side The largest stems and other bits create a partition between the empty space on one side of the gourd and the lopsided pile of yerba on the other

After arranging the yerba along one side of the gourd the mate is carefully tilted back onto its base minimizing further disturbances of the yerba as it is re oriented to allow consumption Some avalanche like settling is normal but is not desirable The angled mound of yerba should remain with its powdery peak still flat and mostly level with the top of the gourd A layer of stems along its slope will slide downward and accumulate in the space opposite the yerba

All of this careful settling of the yerba ensures that each sip contains as little particulate matter as possible creating a smooth running mate The finest particles will then be as distant as possible from the filtering end of the bombilla With each draw the smaller particles would inevitably move toward the bombilla but the larger particles and stems filter much of this out A sloped arrangement provides consistent concentration and flavor with each filling of the mate

Now the mate is ready to receive the bombilla Many people choose to pour warm water into the mate before adding the bombilla while others insist that the bombilla is best inserted into dry yerba Wetting the yerba by gently pouring cool water into the empty space within the gourd until the water nearly reaches the top and then allowing it to be absorbed into the yerba before adding the bombilla allows the preparer to carefully shape and pack the yerbas slope with the bombillas filtering end which makes the overall form of the yerba within the gourd more resilient and solid Dry yerba on the other hand allows a cleaner and easier insertion of the bombilla though care must be taken so as not to overly disturb the arrangement of the yerba Such a decision is entirely a personal or cultural preference The bombilla is inserted with your thumb on the upper end of the bombilla at an angle roughly perpendicular to the slope of the yerba so that its filtering end travels into the deepest part of the yerba and comes to rest near or against the opposite wall of the gourd

Now the yerba may be brewed If the bombilla was inserted into dry yerba the mate must first be filled once with warm water as above then be allowed to absorb it completely Treating the yerba with cool water before the addition of hot water is essential as it protects the herb from being scalded and from the chemical breakdown of some of its desirable nutrients Hot water may then be added by carefully pouring it as with the cool water before into the cavity opposite the yerba until it reaches almost to the top of the gourd when the yerba is fully saturated Care should be taken to maintain the dryness of the swollen top of the yerba beside the edge of the gourds opening

Once the hot water has been added the mate is ready for drinking It may be refilled many times before becoming washed out and losing its flavor When this happens the mound of yerba can be pushed from one side of the gourd to the other allowing water to be added along its opposite side this revives the mate for additional re fillings

Mate is traditionally drunk in a particular social setting such as family gatherings or with friends One person assumes the task of server Typically the cebador fills the gourd and drinks the mate completely to ensure that it is free of particulate matter and of good quality The server subsequently refills the gourd and passes it to the next drinker who likewise drinks it all without thanking the server The ritual proceeds around the circle in this fashion until the mate becomes lavado typically after the gourd has been filled about ten times or more depending on the yerba used When one has had his fill of mate he or she politely thanks the cebador passing the mate back at the same time 

The drink has a pungent taste like a cross between green tea and coffee with hints of tobacco and oak Some drinkers like to add sugar or honey creating mate dulce instead of sugarless mate amargo It is considered bad for the gourd to be used for mate dulce so it is normal for households with drinkers of both kinds to have two separate gourds

Traditionally natural gourds are used though wood vessels bamboo tubes and gourd shaped mates made of ceramic or metal are also common Gourds are commonly decorated with silver sporting decorative or heraldic designs with floral motifs

Both the wood vessels and the gourds must undergo curing to get a better taste before being used for the first time and to ensure the long life of the gourd Typically to cure a gourd the inside is first scraped with the tip of a bombilla to remove loose gourd particles Mate herb and hot water is added next and the mixture poured into the gourd The mixture is left to sit overnight and the water is topped off periodically through the next 24 hours as the gourd absorbs the water Finally the gourd is scraped out emptied and put in sunlight until completely dry

It is common for a black mold to grow inside the gourd when it is stored Some people will clean this out others consider it an enhancement to the mate flavor

The Guaran people started drinking mate in the region that now includes Paraguay southern Brazil and north east Argentina The Guaran have a legend that says that the Goddesses of the Moon and the Cloud came to the Earth one day to visit it but they instead found a Yaguaret that was going to attack them An old man saves them and in compensation the Goddesses gave the old man a new kind of plant from which he could prepare a drink of friendship

There is another drink that can be prepared with specially cut dry leaves very cold water and optionally lemon or another fruit juice called terer It is very common in Paraguay Drinking and harvesting of Mate started in Paraguay in pre Hispanic times

In Brazil the traditional mate or cuia is usually big with a corresponding large hole In Uruguay and Argentina the mate is small and has a small hole and people sometimes add sugar for flavor In Bolivia and Peru mate de coca is often sipped instead of ordinary mate

In Uruguay there is even a national law that prohibits drinking mate while driving because it caused many accidents of people getting scalded with hot water while driving For the same reason there is also a forbidden to drink mate sign in all public transportation buses 

In Uruguay and in the northeast of Argentina it is not uncommon to see people walking around the streets toting a mate and a thermos with hot water In Montevideo Uruguays capital it is possible to see some construction worker drinking mate while riding his bicycle early in the morning on his way to work In some parts of Argentina gas stations sponsored by yerba mate producers provide free hot water to travellers specifically for the purpose of drinking during the journey There are disposable mate sets with a plastic mate and bombilla and sets with a thermos flask and stacking containers for the yerba and sugar inside a fitted case

In Brazil traditionally prepared mate is known as chimarro although in areas near the border with Uruguay the word mate is also used Nowadays in Brazil mate is often toasted with sugar and prepared in a similar manner to tea a custom that originated in Paraguay Supermarkets restaurants and fast food chains sell tea bags and prepacked iced tea packages and bottles In Argentina mate cocido is made with a teabag or leaves and drunk from a cup or mug with or without sugar and milk

At the beginning of the 21st century most urban Chileans are not mate drinkers but travel narratives such as Maria Grahams Journal of a Residence in Chile 20038 show that there is a long history of mate drinking in central Chile Many rural Chileans drink mate in particular in the southern regions particularly Chilo and Magallanes perhaps due to the influence of neighboring areas of Argentina 

In some areas of the Middle Eastern countries of Syria and Lebanon it is also common to drink mate The custom of drinking mate came from Arab emigrants from South America Syria is the worlds biggest importer of yerba mate in the world importing 15000 tons of yerba mate a year

According to a major retailer of mate in San Luis Obispo California by 2004 mate had grown to about 5 of the overall natural tea market in North America Bottled iced mate is widely available in California

Bears are a group of large mammals They form the family Ursidae in the order Carnivora

The word bear could also mean

Yerba mate Ilex paraguariensis is a species of holly native to subtropical South America It grows in Argentina southern Paraguay western Uruguay and southern Brazil 

The yerba mate plant is a shrub or small tree It can grow up to 15 meters tall The leaves are evergreen 711 cm long and 355 cm wide They have a serrated margin The flowers are small greenish white with four petals The fruit is a red berry 46 mm diameter 

The infusion called mate is prepared by steeping dry leaves of yerba mate in hot water rather than boiling water like black tea or coffee It is slightly weaker than coffee and much gentler on the stomach Drinking mate with friends from a shared hollow gourd with a metal straw is an extremely common social practice in Argentina Uruguay Paraguay southern Chile eastern Bolivia and Brazil and also Syria and Lebanon

Brewed yerba tastes a lot like vegetables herbs and grass It is similar to that of some varieties of green tea Many consider the flavor to be very agreeable but it is generally bitter if steeped in boiling water It is therefore made using hot but not boiling water Unlike most teas it does not become bitter and astringent when steeped for extended periods and the leaves may be infused several times Additionally one can purchase flavored mate in many varieties

In Brazil a toasted version of mate known as ch mate or mate tea is sold in teabag and loose form and served sweetened in specialized shops either hot or iced with fruit juice or milk An iced sweetened version of toasted mate is sold as a soft drink with or without fruit flavoring The toasted variety of mate has less of a bitter flavor and more of a spicy fragrance It is more popular in the coastal cities of Brazil as opposed to the far southern states where it is consumed in the traditional way

Similarly a form of mate is sold in Argentina Uruguay and Paraguay in tea bags to be drunk in a similar way to tea This is known in Spanish as mate cocido or cocido In Argentina this is commonly drunk with breakfast or as part of merienda often with a selection of facturas It is also made by heating yerba in water and straining it as it cools

The pronunciation of yerba mate in standard Spanish is ra mate The Rioplatense dialect spoken in most of Argentina turns the first sound in yerba into a postalveolar fricative consonant giving ra in regions closer to Buenos Aires gradually blending into ra as one goes farther from the city and eventually to dra around Mendoza The word hierba is Spanish for grass or herb yerba is a variant spelling of it which is quite common in Argentina Mate is from the Quechua mati meaning cup Yerba mate is therefore literally the cup herb

The Portuguese name is erva mate rva mati and is also used to prepare the drinks chimarro or terer While the tea is made with the toasted leaves these drinks are made with green ones and are very popular in the south of the country The name given to the plant in Guaran language of the indigenous people who first cultivated and enjoyed yerba mate is kaa which has the same meaning as yerba

In English speaking countries the spelling used is yerba mat instead of yerba mate as in Spanish indicating that the pronunciation is not the same as the much more common English word mate by analogy with words of French origin such as caf and other words whose distinguishes their pronunciation from otherwise identically spelled English words such as rsum and resume Linguistic prescriptivists regard this usage as erroneous a case of hypercorrection Purely descriptive linguists regard this sort of usage as a natural evolution of the language

The plant is grown mainly in South America more specifically in Northern Argentina Paraguay Uruguay and southern Brazil The Guaran are reputed to be the first people who cultivated the plant the first Europeans to do this were Jesuit missionaries who spread the drinking habit as far as Ecuador

When the yerba is harvested the branches are dried sometimes with a wood fire imparting a smoky flavor Then the leaves and sometimes the twigs are broken up

There are many brands and types of yerba with and without twigs some with low powder content Some types are less strong in flavor and there are blends flavored with mint orange and grapefruit skin etc

Mate contains xanthines which are alkaloids in the same family as caffeine theophylline and theobromine well known stimulants also found in coffee and chocolate Mate also contains elements such as potassium magnesium and manganese Caffeine content varies between 03 and 17 of dry weight

Mate products are sometimes marketed as caffeine free alternatives to coffee and tea and said to have fewer negative effects This is often based on a claim that the primary active xanthine in mate is mateine erroneously said to be a stereoisomer of caffeine Mateine is an official synonym of caffeine in the chemical databases 

Researchers at Florida International University in Miami have found that yerba mate does contain caffeine but some people seem to tolerate a mate drink better than coffee or tea This is expected since mate contains different chemicals from tea or coffee

From reports of personal experience with mate its physiological effects are similar to more widespread caffeinated beverages like coffee tea or guarana drinks Users report a mental state of wakefulness focus and alertness reminiscent of most stimulants but often remark on mates unique lack of the negative effects typically created by other such compounds such as anxiety diarrhea jitteriness and heart palpitations

Reasons for mates unique physiological attributes are beginning to emerge in scientific research Studies of mate though very limited have shown preliminary evidence that the mate xanthine cocktail is different from other plants containing caffeine most significantly in its effects on muscle tissue as opposed to those on the central nervous system which are similar to those of other natural stimulants Mate has been shown to have a relaxing effect on smooth muscle tissue and a stimulating effect on myocardial tissue

Mates negative effects are anecdotally claimed to be of a lesser degree than those of coffee though no explanation for this is offered or even credibly postulated except for its potential as a placebo effect Many users report that drinking yerba mate does not prevent them from being able to fall asleep as is often the case with some more common stimulating beverages while still enhancing their energy and ability to remain awake at will However the net amount of caffeine in one preparation of yerba mate is typically quite high in large part because the repeated filling of the mate with hot water is able to extract the highly soluble xanthines extremely effectively It is for this reason that one mate may be shared among several people and yet produce the desired stimulating effect in all of them

In vivo and in vitro studies are showing yerba mate to exhibit significant cancer fighting activity Researchers at the University of Illinois found yerba mate to be rich in phenolic constituents and to inhibit oral cancer cell proliferation 

On the other hand a study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer showed a limited correlation between oral cancer and the drinking of hot mate Given the influence of the temperature of water as well as the lack of complete adjustment for age alcohol consumption and smoking the study concludes that mate is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans 

An August 11 2005 United States patent application cites yerba mate extract as an inhibitor of MAO activity the maximal inhibition observed in vitro was 4050 A monoamine oxidase inhibitor is a type of antidepressant so there is some data to suggest that yerba mate has a calming effect in this regard

In addition it has been noted by the US Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine that yerba mate can cause high blood pressure when used in conjunction with other MAO inhibitors 

Guarana or Guaran Paullinia cupana is a shrub or small tree in the Sapindaceae family It is native to Venezuela and northern Brazil The seed of the Guaran fruit is a stimulant with thermogenic and diuretic properties

The guaran fruits color ranges from orange to red and contain black seeds which are partly covered by white arils The color contrast when the fruit has been split open has been likened to eyeballs this has formed the basis of a myth

Guaran plays an important role in Tupi and Guaran Brazilian culture The name guaran is derived from the Tupi Guarani word waran These tribes believed it was magical a cure for bowel complaints and a way to regain strength They also tell the myth of a Divine Child that was killed by a serpent and whose eyes gave birth to this plant

Guaran is mainly used as an ingredient in soft drinks and energy drinks It is also used as a dietary supplement generally to promote weight loss In addition it may be an ingredient in other foods

Beverages In addition to other chemicals the guaran plant contains caffeine theophylline and theobromine Water extracts of the guarana plant are central nervous system stimulants due to the content of these alkaloids Energy drink manufacturers typically add synthetic caffeine or caffeine derived from coffee decaffeination though many advertise natural caffeine from the seeds of guaran 

Brazil produces several brands of soft drink from guaran extract that contain no added caffeine Each differs greatly in flavour some have only a slight guaran fruit taste In Brazil sales of guaran drinks are even greater than that of cola drinksFactdateMay 2007 They are typically fizzy and sweet with a very fruity aftertaste Most guaran drinks are produced in Brazil and consumed locally or in nearby countries such as Paraguay Major brands include Guaran Antarctica Guaran Schin from Schincariol and Guaran Brahma from AmBev Kuat and Guaran Jesus a local Brazilian brand named for the druggist that formulated it Many local producers also create drinks not for export

Studies involving guaran show benefits to cognitive function They have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration or any similar government agencies In the United States guaran holds a GRAS status ie generally regarded as safe and must be labeled as not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease

The Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics published a study in June 2001 This study shows an average 112 pound weight loss in a group taking a mixture of yerba mate guaran and damiana compared to an average 1 pound loss in a placebo group after 45 days

A university study in Brazil of guaran extract showed a platelet aggregation decrease of up to 37 of control values and a decrease of platelet thromboxane formation from arachidonic acid of up to 78 of control values This study may be significant to stroke and heart attack risk reduction because when excess thromboxane formation occurs an arterial blood clot can develop resulting in a heart attack or ischemic stroke

A separate 1997 study of guarans effects on the physical activity of rats showed increased memory retention and physical endurance when compared with a placebo

Other studies have shown antioxidant antibacterial and fat cell reduction properties in guaran  

Although side effects of guaran are rare drugscom recommends When considering the use of herbal supplements consultation with a primary health care professional is advisable Additionally consultation with a practitioner trained in the uses of herbalhealth supplements may be beneficial and coordination of treatment among all health care providers involved may be advantageous Drugscom also advises not to mix guaran with ephedrine

Guaran seeds consist of mostly reddish vegetable fiber and resin with a small amount of oil and water Guarana contains different amounts of caffeine theobromine theophylline and other alkaloids compared to coffee tea mate or cocoa 

Engrish is a word that is used to talk about types of the English language with grammar mistakes in them Engrish can be found in East Asian countries and also many places in other places where a lot of East Asians live Engrish has been found on many things from poorly translated signs menus and manuals to strangely worded advertisements food items and strange t shirt slogans Engrish also sometimes happens when a word or sentence is badly translated on the Internet 

The name Engrish comes from the fact that some languages such as Japanese do not have separate sounds for R and L

In the religion of Hinduism the animal called a cow is thought to be sacred or very holy Most Hindus respect the cow for her gentle nature which represents the main teaching of Hinduism non injury The cow also represents ghee and strength Hindus worship the cow The cow is very honored in society and most Hindus do not eat beef By honoring this gentle animal that gives more than it takes Hindus honor all creatures

It is evidently known that the cow was sacred and forbidden in the Hindu diet as was all slaughter and violence for food from ancient Vedic times Therefore reverence for cows can be found in all the religions major texts 

The cow gives milk and cream yogurt and cheese butter and ice cream ghee and buttermilk The milk of a cow is believed to refine a person The ghee from the milk is used in ceremonies and in preparing religious food Cow dung is used as fertilizer as a fuel and as a disinfectant in homes Modern science states that the smoke from cow dung is a powerful disinfectant and is good against pollution The cows urine is also used for religious ceremonies as well as for medical reasons

To the Hindu the cow represents all other creatures Hindus believe that all living creatures are sacredmammals fishes birds The cow is more a symbol of the Earth It always gives and feeds representing life and the support of life Honoring the cow inspires in people the virtues of gentleness and connectedness with nature The cow takes nothing but water grass and grain while it gives of its milk as does the liberated soul give of his spiritual knowledge 

In the Hindu tradition the cow is honored garlanded and given special feedings at festivals all over India most importantly the annual Gopashtama festival Its nature is represented in Kamadhenu the divine wish fulfilling cow In India more than 3000 institutions called Gaushalas care for old and infirm cows The gift of a cow is applauded as the highest kind of gift 

One can measure the greatness of a nation and its moral progress by the way it treats its animals Cow protection to me is not mere protection of the cow It means protection of all that lives and is helpless and weak in the world The cow means the entire subhuman world Mahatma Gandhi

The cows have come and have brought us good fortune In our stalls contented may they stay May they bring forth calves for us many colored giving milk for Indra each day You make O cows the thin man sleek to the unlovely you bring beauty Rejoice our homestead with pleasant lowing In our assemblies we laud your vigor Rig Veda In the Rig Veda cows represent wealth and joyous Earthly life Several hymns refer to ten thousand and more cattle

In Hinduism a murti usually means an image in which the Divine Spirit is expressed Hindus call the presence of God into the image so that they can communicate with him and receive his blessings

Murtis sometimes are abstract but almost always stone or metal images of God in a human like form like Shiva or Ganesha Rama or Krishna Saraswati or Kali Murtis are made according to strict prescriptions and then installed by highly trained priests through a ceremony The priests can then call on God in the image daily

Murtis in Hindu temples and shrines are a mystical form of communication with God and devas This is similar to our ability to communicate with others through the telephone One does not talk to the telephone rather the telephone is a way to interact with another person Without the telephone one could not have a conversation across long distances and without the sanctified image in the temple one cannot easily talk with the Deity

The image or murti of worship is a focus for prayers although Hindus can see God is in all things in stone and water fire air and ether in the enlightened person of a satguru and inside their own soul Some temples do not have any murti in the sanctum but a symbolic diagram Some Hindu branches reject the worship of images

In Hinduism one of the highest achievements is when one goes beyond the need of all form and symbol This is the yogis goal obtained through meditation In this way Hinduism is one of the least image oriented of all the religions of the world However Hinduism is also one of the religions that uses more symbols to represent God in preparation for getting beyond them

Image worship appears to be an intelligent mystical practice shared by all of the worlds great religions All religions have their symbols of holiness the Christian cross or statues of Mother Mary and Saint Theresa the holy Kaaba in Mecca the Sikh Adi Granth enshrined in the Golden Temple in Amritsar the Arc and Torah of the Jews the image of a meditating Buddha the totems of indigenous and Pagan faiths and the artifacts of the holy men and women of all religions Any Christian respects the Bible and considers it sacred His book and the Hindus murtis are similar in this way 

Critics of image worship consider this practice idolatry People who practice idolatry believe that God is the material object itself Instead Hindus worship murtis to call on the presence of the spiritual God and then communicate with him 

Virtual memory is the memory management technique which is a recent trend of technology used in computers Computers run software This software will need computer memory to run and do what it needs to do Most computers in use today can do more than one thing at a time they run more than one application This is known as multiprocessing 

In this case all the programs or applications that are running on the computer at a time share its resources A computer does not have more processors or main memory just because more programs run on it

Virtual memory is the idea that the application sees a block of memory of a given size The application can use this memory as it sees fit This block of memory is virtual in the sense that it comes from different parts Some of it may be in the main memory of the computer but some may also be on disk The CPU has a special part called Arithmetic Logic Unit which does some of the translations between application memory and system resources Modern operating systems also do a part of this work

When a program tries to access a block of memory that is not in system memory that program is stopped and the block is loaded into system memory What was in that part of the system memory is written to disk This is usually called paging

Certain computer systems such as embedded systems do not use virtual memory because they need a very fast response time or one that always stays the same One of the problems is that with virtual memory it is difficult to predict the response time An application that uses a part of memory which needs to be loaded from disk will have a different response time from one that does not Therefore virtual memory concept is not used in embedded systems

The Bolshoi Theatre is a world famous theatre and opera company in Moscow Russia which gives performances of ballet and opera It is in the centre of Moscow near the Kremlin

History of the building 

In 1776 the history of the Bolshoi  Theatre began when Empress Catherina II allowed Prince Pyotr Urusov to run theatrical performances That theatre burned down and a new one was built in 1825 That one burnt down too but it was rebuilt and reopened in 1856 After that no important repairs were made to the building for 150 years By the beginning of the 21st century it was in a very bad state and in danger of falling down Major repairs were started in 2005 and the work should be completed by the end of October 2011 When it is finished the theatre should look just as it did at the time of the tsars with embroidered silk tapestry and the tsars sign replacing the communist hammers and sickles The total cost of the rebuild will be around 400 million which is 16 times what they originally said it would cost

The theatre is lucky to survive at all At the time of the Communist Revolution the Bolsheviks thought the theatre represented the old tsars and everything that had been bad in Russia They wanted to demolish it Then they started to use it for their meetings Lenin and Stalin both gave speeches there The operas that were performed had to be ones that did not criticize the Soviet Union in any way

A Guild is an association of craftspeople They come from Europe and were born in the XI century Several people in the same craft or trade got together and formed a guild That way it was easier for them to stand up for their interests for example in politics They maybe watched other people who did the same job to make sure that they did not cheat any customers The earliest guilds were probably formed in India around 3800 BC Being a member of a guild was a privilege which had to be gained

Guilds were common place in the cities of the Middle Ages After that around 1700 to 1800 their influence lessened Jean Jacques Rousseau and Adam Smith were very very much opposed to the idea of guilds They believed that guilds hindered economic development and free trade

The town grew up from Anglo Saxon times around a Palace belonging to the Archbishop of Canterbury In 1276 the archbishop allowed a weekly market to take place nearby and this date is taken as the founding of the town The town grew in the eighteenth century as a stage coach stop on the way to the popular seaside town of Brighton from London In the nineteenth century railways put the town only 15 minutes from London by fast train and it grew 23 times in terms of the number of people living there between 1801 and 1901

Addington is a village in the London Borough of Croydon in south London Addington is home to many historical sites in Croydon like Croydon Palace and the Addington Palace St Marys Church is also in Addington and is known for the cross commemorating five archbishops in the foreground Before the tram system was introduced in 2000 connections to the town were very short with only a few buses to Croydon 

The reputation of Addington is not good People see it as run down and not very nice meaning that a lot of people from elsewhere in London try to avoid it New Addington is a town close by to Addington Once there was only one school in the village and all the children went to it now that school has been demolished

The coat of arms of a country is a symbol that the country uses for itself The coat of arms of India is the symbol of India formally called as National emblem It has four Indian lions standing on a circle The idea for this coat of arms was taken from the Sarnath Lion Capital that was built by an Indian emperor named Ashoka Its a pillar in the city named Sarnath Ashoka built it around 250 BCE using a single piece of polished sandstone The symbol is invariably used on all types of currency notes and coins of India In the two dimensional view of this symbol one can only see three lions facing left right and straight The fourth one remains hidden behind the three

The lions represent royalty and pride The wheel beneath the lions called the Ashoka Chakra represents truth and honesty The horse and the bull probably stand for the hardworking people of India There are four Ashoka Chakras in total around the emblem and two horses and bulls each The verse written below Satyamev Jayate is a very popular and revered saying in the ancient language Sanskrit It can be divided phonetically into three words  Satyam which means truth Ev or aev that is only and Jayate which means wins or won The whole verse can be translated as Only the truth will win or wins This verse describes the power of honesty and truth in society and religion You can lie to your friends family even your God but you cannot lie to yourself Your conscience will forever be stained

Al Askar or the Askariyya MosqueShrine is a Sha Muslim holy site It is located in the Iraqi city of Samarra Samara is 60 miles from Baghdad It is one of the most important Shite mosques in the world It was built in 944 Its dome was destroyed in February 2006

The remains of the tenth and eleventh Sha Imms Al l Hd and his son Hassan al Askar known as the two Askars rest at the shrine It stands next to a shrine to the Twelfth or Hidden Imm Muammad al Mahd The Askariyya Shrine is also known as the Tomb or Mausoleum of the Two Imms the Tomb of Imms Al l Hd and Hassan al Askar and al Hadhratu l Askariyya

Also buried inside the Mosque are the remains of Hakimah Khatun sister of Al l Hd and of Narjis Khatun mother of Muammad al Mahdi

Time magazine reported at the time of the Al Askari Mosque bombing that al Askari is one of Shiite Islams holiest sites Only the shrines of Najaf and Karbala are more important Even Samarras Sunnis hold al Askari in high esteem The expression to swear by the shrine is routinely used by both communities

The Imms Al l Hd and Hassan al Askar lived under house arrest in the part of Samarra that had been Caliph al Mutasims military camp As a result they are known as the Askariyyn They died and were buried in their house on Ab Ahmad Street near the mosque built by Mutasim A later tradition attributes their deaths to poison

The shrine around their tombs was built in 944 by the Hamdanid governor Nasr ad Dawla It became a focus for pilgrims It was developed and rebuilt several times in following centuries including in particular by Arslan al Basasiri around 1053 and by Caliph an Nasr li Dn Allh in 1209

Nasir ad Din Shah Qajar undertook the latest remodelling of the shrine in 1868 with the golden dome added in 1905 Covered in 72000 gold pieces and surrounded by walls of light blue tiles the dome was a dominant feature of the Samarra skyline It was approximately 20 metres in diameter by 68 metres high

Hathor was an Egyptian goddess She was a cow goddess and was associated with the Milky Way She was the daughter of Ra

There are still remains of Hathors temple in Dendara Egypt Dendara was her most well known Her temple is 37 miles away from Luxor It is thought that the temple of Hathor was built and decorated between the second century BCE and the first century CE It had two intricately designed columned halls with the head of the goddess Hathor engraved in to each of them Additionally several shrines were built on the flat roof of the temple There was also an enclosed sacred lake where the priests and patients would bath in order to heal themselves and become pure There was sacred treasure hidden in two underground rooms near the sanctuary At her temple people would pray to her for good wealth Over all Hathor was a busy goddess as were most of the other gods and goddesses

Hathor is the goddess of love beauty dancing music and fertility Hathor is one of the main goddesses Hathor means House of Horus Before Hathor was the nice goddess she was the goddess of destruction There was a myth that Ra ordered Hathor to go out to eat the people But days past and Ra wanted Sekmet to stop but Sekmet was enjoying it So Ra died beer red and scattered it all over the land And then Sekmet saw it and drank it all and got drunk After she drank it she slept for three days and when she woke up and she didnt want to eat human flesh any more and thats how she became one of the nice goddesses After she became a new goddess she had a new makeover

Hathor appeared in four different forms In human form Hathor had a cow head with two cow horns She was represented as a cow because cows were highly valued animals She wore a menat which was a special necklace A menat is heavy a beaded necklace with a crescent shape in the front and a tall mushroom shaped piece in the back In one of her animal forms she was a cow with an ankh An ankh was the symbol of life Hathors another animal form was a fierce lion The last animal form is a roaring lion Hathors symbol was a cow with a sun disc The ancient Egyptians drew her as the sky of the Milky Way Hathors titles include the Golden One the Lady of Song the Mistress of Maidens and the Lady of the Sycamore

Santorini is a Greek island The capital is Thira Santorini is 63 miles from the island of Crete The total population is 13600 Santorini is a caldera Human presences on the island seem to have existed since the middle of the 3rd millennium BC The excavations at Akrotiri have confirmed that human activity on the island continued until the eruption of the volcano around 1500 BC which entirely buried the island beneath very thick layers of pozzuolona At that point all traces of human activity vanished from the island until the end of the 13th century BC 

According to Herodotus the island was initially called Strongyle Then later because of its beauty it was named Kalliste The Phoenicians settled in Kalliste and after the Phoenicians the Lacedaemonians arrived and renamed the island after their leader Theras In the 9th century BC Thera became an important stopping point of that era in the travel routes between the East and the West The Phoenician alphabet was adopted at this time for writing in the Greek language Interestingly though the conservative Therans did not follow the cultural development of their counterparts in the other Cycladic islands At about 630 BC the Therans reached the north coast of the African continent where they founded Cyrene the only Theran colony From as early on as the 6th century BC Thera had its own coinage During the Classical period in Greece 5th and 4th century BC Thera did not play any significant role in the events of that Hellenic time During the Peloponesian War Thera sided with Sparta as expected In Hellenistic times the islands strategic position made Thera an important base for the war campaigns in the Aegean of the successors to Alexander the Great 

During the Roman Empire Thera was little more than a small insignificant island However when Christianity reached the island early an organized church was established by the 4th century AD The island had neither political nor military significance in Byzantine times although Alexius I Comnenus 1081  1118 founded the church of the Panagia Episkopi at Gonia After the fall of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade 1204 the Duchy of Naxos was founded and Thera became the seat of one of the four Catholic Bishops of the Duchy The name Santorini was given at that time by the Crusaders named after a small chapel of Agia Irini Santa Irene which some say was at Perissa and others say it was at Riva on Therasia 

In the years under Frankish rule 1207  1579 Santorini experienced the development of a thriving cotton cultivation and viticulture but the island suffered as much from piratical raids as it did from the rivalries between the local Latin rulers as well as the Duke and the Sultan 

The Turkish dominion 1579  1821 resulted in the abolition of piracy and the development of international trade The Santorinians created close contacts with the great harbours of the Eastern Mediterranean where they founded important communities 

In 1821 Santorini with its shipping power took part in the fight for independence from the Turks and in 1830 the island became part of the independent Greek state Up until the beginning of the 20th century shipping textiles tomato production and viticulture were all flourishing markets but the change from sail to steam driven ships and the relocation of the islands factories to mainland Greece had a negative effect on the islands economy After the 1956 earthquake there was a huge decrease in the population resulting in an economic catastrophe Towards the end of the 1970s however tourism began to develop bringing economic relief to the island The present day crescent shape of the island is a consequence of the activity of the volcano in prehistoric times The island itself owes its very existence to the volcano 

The last huge eruption of the volcano dates back 3600 years to the late Bronze Age Thirty million cubic meters of lava in the form of pumice and ash were blown to a height of up to 36 kilometers above the island Pumice deposits dozens of meters thick buried one of the most prosperous pre historic settlements of that period feeding the myth of the lost Atlantis 

The mild activity of the volcano after this major eruption continues into the present building up two small islands within the caldera Palea and Nea Kameni These islands represent the volcanos most recent activity 

The marvelous dry climate and continuous sunshine create year around conditions which are perfect for observation photographs and videos under an extraordinary variety of natural lights and colours that give the visitor the exceptional advantage of reaching the interior of the volcano by boat

Aside from Rome the archiepiscopal See of Mainz which was also of electoral and primatial rank is the only other Western see that bears the title of Holy See although this usage is less common

The Pope governs the Church through the Roman Curia The Roman Curia consists of the Secretariat of State nine Congregations three Tribunals 11 Pontifical Councils and a complex of offices that administer church affairs at the highest level The Secretariat of State under the Cardinal Secretary of State directs and coordinates the Curia The current incumbent Tarcisio Cardinal Bertone is the Holy Sees equivalent of a prime minister Archbishop Dominique Mamberti Secretary of the Section for Relations With States of the Secretariat of State acts as the Holy Sees foreign minister Bertone and Mamberti have been named in their respective roles under by Pope Benedict XVI in September 2006

Among the most active of the major Curial institutions are the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith which oversees church doctrine the Congregation for Bishops which coordinates the appointment of bishops worldwide the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples which oversees all missionary activities and the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace which deals with international peace and social issues

The Holy See is especially active in international organizations and is a member of the following groups

The Holy See is also a permanent observer of the following groups

The Holy See is an observer on an informal basis of the following groups

The Holy See sends a delegate to the Arab League in Cairo It is also a guest of honour to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe

Tawaret was a goddess in ancient Egyptian mythology She was the demon wife of Apep the first god of evil She was often shown as a hippopotamus Because female hippos are aggressive to protect their young pregnant women wore amulets of Tawaret to protect their pregnancies

Seshat was the ancient Egyptian idea of knowledge shown as a goddess She became the goddess of writing astronomyastrology architecture and mathematics When Thoth became the god of wisdom Seshat was seen as his daughter or sometimes as his wife In art she was shown as a woman with a stylised papyrus plant above her head This symbolised writing since the Egyptians wrote on a material that came from papyrus

Apep in Egyptian mythology was an evil demon He was associated with darkness and chaos He was often shown as a snake

Apeps name was often incorrectly defined as he who was spat out It was said that he had been formed by Neith who had been the god of the ancient waters in the Ennead from a length of spit she had spat at Nu the god of the ancient waters in the Ogdoad Some subsequent commentators speculated that Apep must have been an earlier creator and chief god thus explaining why he had so much anger towards Ra

It was believed that Ra each night passed into Duat and then battled with Apep always winning except for certain days in which Ra is momentarily devoured what the Egyptians saw as an eclipse

Instead of being worshipped he was done the exact opposite and spat upon Models would be made of wax and clay and then burnt spat upon and defaced

Apep was a fifty foot long snake He was black orange and a little bit green Apep was very strong He symbolized darkness stormsnightunderworld and death In ramses 6th tomb they showed a picture of him he had 9 headsrepresenting the souls he killed 

Prefix notation is a mathematical notation It is a way to write down equations and other mathematical formulae Prefix notation is also known as Polish notation The notation was invented by Jan ukasiewicz in 1920 He wanted to simplify writing logic equations

When prefix notation is used no grouping elements are needed

With prefix notation the function is noted before the arguments it operates on 

Nephthys was known as the goddess of mourning She was also one of the nine gods When Nephthys became the goddess of mourning she also became a friend and protecter of the dead Nephthys was important in Ancient Egyptian culture because Egyptians considered the afterlife to be very important She always stood at the head of the coffin that would take the dead to the underworld with outspread wings Nephthys explained the nether world for the Ancient Egyptians by protecting and caring for the dead When people died their Ba would be tested by 40 gods Many of the gods met up with Nephthys This is a small list of gods and goddesses

 Nephthys had many siblings Her parents were Geb the god of the earth and Nut the goddess of the sky She was the sister of Isis Osiris and twin of Seth She was married to Seth even though she did not like him She wanted to have a baby but Seth who was the god of death could not have them Soon she left Seth and pretended to be Isis Isis was married to Osiris Isis and Nephthys had a strong relationship Then Nephthys had a baby with Osiris pretending to be Isis

Nephthys was seen wearing a slender sheath dress On her crown were the hieroglyphs of her name She could be seen with the hieroglyph symbol of life the ankh in her hand She was usually seen at the head of a coffin Some Egyptians saw Nephthys with blue skin and others saw her with tan skin

Nephthys was the goddess of mourning Nephthys usually means lady of mansion or mistress of the house but it can also mean good sister friend of the dead joyful one or sister of the gods

The Ramesside Pharaohs were particularly devoted to Sets prerogatives and in the 19th Dynasty a temple of Nephthys called the House of Nephthys of Ramesses Meriamun was built or refurbished in the town of Sepermeru midway between Oxyrhynchos and Herakleopolis on the outskirts of the Fayyum and quite near to the modern site of Deshasheh Here as Papyrus Wilbour notes in its wealth of taxation records and land assessments the temple of Nephthys was a specific foundation by Ramesses II located in close proximity to the precinct of the enclosure of Set To be certain the House of Nephthys was one of fifty individual land owning temples delineated for this portion of the Middle Egyptian district in Papyrus Wilbour The fields and other holdings belonging to Nephthyss temple were under the authority of two Nephthys prophets and one waab priest of the goddess 

While certainly affiliated with the House of Set the Nephthys temple at Sepermeru and its apportioned lands clearly were under administration distinct from the Set institution The Nephthys temple was a unique establishment in its own right an independent entity According to Papyrus Wilbour another House of Nephthys of Ramesses Meriamun seems to have existed to the north in the town of Su closer to the Fayyum region Interestingly yet another temple of Nephthys seems to have existed in the town of Punodjem The Papyrus Bologna records a complaint lodged by a prophet of the temple of Set in that town regarding undue taxation in his regard After making an introductory appeal to Re Horakhte Set and Nephthys for the ultimate resolution of this issue by the royal Vizier the prophet laments his workload He notes his obvious administration of the House of Set and adds I am also responsible for the ship and I am responsible likewise for the House of Nephthys along with a heap of other temples 

While the House of Nephthys in Punodjem is not explicitly said to be a foundation of Ramesses II it may be that Ramesses II founded a series of temples of Nephthys in order to complement the larger establishments dedicated to her spouse much in the same way that the smaller temple of Nefertari at Abu Simbel was complementary to the Great Temple at Abu Simbel In the roster provided by Papyrus Wilbour no other divine consort boasted a land owning temple of their own within any particular town dominated by a male god Apparently Nephthys was deemed quite important enough to merit her own independent sanctuaries In any event as Nephthys of Ramesses Meriamun the goddess and her shrine were under the particular endorsement of Ramesses II The foundations of the Set and Nephthys temples at Sepermeru finally were discovered and identified in the 1980s and the Nephthys temple was no mere chapelrather it was a notable self sustaining temple complex within the Set enclosure Likewise there can be little doubt that a cult of Nephthys existed in the temple and great town of Herakleopolis north of Sepermeru A near life sized statue of Nephthys boasts a curiously altered inscription The basalt image originally was stationed at Medinet Habu as part of the cultic celebration of the Pharaonic Sed Festival but obviously was transferred at some point to Herakleopolis and the temple of Herishef therein The cult images inscription originally pertained to Nephthys Foremost of the Sed Festival in the Booth of Annals but was re inscribed or re dedicated to Nephthys Foremost of the Booths of Herakleopolis

Anuket was the first ancient Egyptian goddess of the Nile river in areas like Elephantine Island at the start of the Niles journey through Egypt and in nearby parts of Nubia Her temple was built at the Island of Seheil 

Since the god Khnum and goddess Satis were thought to be the gods of the source of the Nile Anuket was believed to be their daughter The Egyptians believed that the two tributaries in her area of the Nile were her arms Because tributaries move quickly she became associated with fast moving things like arrows and the gazelle 

In art she was usually shown as a gazelle or with a gazelles head and sometimes had a headdress of feathers

When the Nile started its annual flood the Festival of Anuket began People threw coins gold jewelry and precious gifts into the river thanking Anuket for the life giving water The taboo that was held in several parts of Egypt of not eating fish which were considered sacred was lifted during this time

The Proto Indo European language is the hypothetical common language that was spoken before the Indo European languages developed 

There are several competing hypotheses about when and where PIE was spoken

The idea that there was such a language was supported by the fact that in 1927 Jerzy Kuryowicz discovered some of the phonemes one supposed to be Proto Indo European in Anatolian 

There is no direct evidence of PIE because it was never written All PIE sounds and words are reconstructed from later Indo European languages using the comparative method and the method of internal reconstruction The asterisk is used to mark reconstructed PIE words such as wdr water wn dog or tryes three Many of the words in the modern Indo European languages seem to have derived from such protowords via regular sound changes

Other long vowels may have appeared already in the proto language by compensatory lengthening  r l m n

Shortly before 1986 Waldheim published an autobiography During his campaign to become president in 1986 it became public that some statements in that biography were not true These were about his past Waldheim was an officer for Germany in the Second World War There was a commission of several historians who looked at the issue They did find that Waldheim had behved as he should have done He did not commit any War crimes However in his role of an officer he must have known about the deportation of about 40000 Jews into concentration camps These transports as well as the shooting of soldiers were a clear breach of law

Because of this he was not allowed to travel to the United States any more

In 1990 he had a success Saddam Hussein held several foreigners as hostages at the start of the Second Gulf War When Waldheim heard this he personally went to Baghdad Through talks he could get Saddam to release the Austrian and the Swiss hostages

A hypothesis is something that can explain a event It can propose or suggest how two events relate to each other The term comes from the Greek hypotithenai meaning to put under or to suppose The scientific method requires that a scientific hypothesis can be tested Scientists sometimes create hypotheses on events that have been seen before or on extensions of scientific theories

At first educated people often referred to an idea or to an approach to math that made hard math easier as a hypothesis when used this way the word did not necessarily have any specific meaning Cardinal Bellarmine gave a well known example of the older sense of the word in the warning issued to Galileo in the early 17th century that he must not treat the motion of the Earth as a reality but merely as a hypothesis

In common usage in the 21st century a hypothesis refers to a idea that needs to be tested A hypothesis needs more work by the researcher in order to check it A tested hypothesis that works may become part of a theory or become a theory itself Normally scientific hypotheses have the form of a mathematical model

Observation is an activity of an intelligent living being which senses and assimilates the knowledge of a phenomenon in its framework of previous knowledge and ideas 

Observation is more than the bare act of observing To perform observation a being must observe and seek to add to its knowledge

Observations that come from self defining instruments are often unreliable  Such observations are hard to reproduce because they may vary even with respect to the same stimuli Thus they are not of much use in exact sciences like physics which require instruments which do not define themselves It is thus often necessary to use various engineered instruments like spectrometers oscilloscopes cameras telescopes interferometers tape recorders thermometers etc and tools like clocks scale that help in improving the broken wikt linkaccuracyaccuracy quality and utility of the information obtained from an observation 

The accuracy and tremendous success of science is primarily attributed to the accuracy and objectivity of observation of the reality that science explores

Scientific method refers to techniques for investigating phenomena acquiring new knowledge or correcting and integrating previous knowledge To be termed scientific a method of inquiry must be based on gathering observable empirical and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning A scientific method consists of the collection of data through observation and experimentation and the formulation and testing of hypotheses

Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another identifiable features distinguish scientific inquiry from other methodologies of knowledge Scientific researchers propose hypotheses as explanations of phenomena and design experimental studies to test these hypotheses These steps must be repeatable in order to dependably predict any future results Theories that encompass wider domains of inquiry may bind many hypotheses together in a coherent structure This in turn may help form new hypotheses or place groups of hypotheses into context

Among other facets shared by the various fields of inquiry is the conviction that the process be objective to reduce a biased interpretation of the results Another basic expectation is to document archive and share all data and methodology so they are available for careful scrutiny by other scientists thereby allowing other researchers the opportunity to verify results by attempting to reproduce them This practice called full disclosure also allows statistical measures of the reliability of these data to be established

The scientific process is iterative At any stage it is possible that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process Failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a scientist to re define the subject they are considering Failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject Failure of the experiment to produce interesting results may lead the scientist to reconsidering the experimental method the hypothesis or the definition of the subject

Other scientists may start their own research and enter the process at any stage They might adopt the characterization and formulate their own hypothesis or they might adopt the hypothesis and deduce their own predictions Often the experiment is not done by the person who made the prediction and the characterization is based on experiments done by someone else Published results of experiments can also serve as a hypothesis predicting their own reproducibility

East Sutton is a parish about 6 miles South East of Maidstone in Kent England

East Sutton is small by number of houses but it is in a large area East Sutton is home to a womens prison a council estate of 16 houses and the church of St Peters and Saint Pauls

A city hall or town hall is the headquarters of a city or towns administration and usually houses the city or town council its associated departments and their employees It is also usually the base of the city town borough or county mayor 

In North America a hall is labeled a city or town hall depending on the size of the municipality it serves City halls are usually found in larger cities and town halls in smaller urban areas

In the United Kingdom Australia New Zealand Hong Kong and many Commonwealth countries town hall is the more common term During the 1960s many of the older town halls were replaced by Civic centres The civic centre was a functional building offices of the council only without the art gallery or hall for cultural activities which were a feature of many of the older town halls

County hall is used for the headquarters of County council administrations

A spectrometer is an optical instrument used to measure properties of light over a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum 

The independent variable is usually the wavelength of the light The variable measured is most often the lights intensity but could also for instance be the polarization state A spectrometer is used in spectroscopy for producing spectral lines and measuring their wavelengths and intensities Spectrometer is a term that is applied to instruments that operate over a very wide range of wavelengths from gamma rays and X rays into the far infrared 

In general any particular instrument will operate over a small portion of this total range because of the different techniques used to measure different portions of the spectrum Below optical frequencies the spectrum analyzer is a closely related electronic device

A shield volcano is a large volcano with shallowly sloping sides The name derives from a translation of Skjaldbreiur an Icelandic shield volcano whose name means broad shield from its resemblance to a warriors shield 

Shield volcanoes are formed by lava that flows easily Consequently a volcanic mountain having a broad profile is built up over time by flow after flow of relatively fluid basaltic lava issuing from vents or fissures on the surface of the volcano Many of the largest volcanoes on Earth are shield volcanoes 

The largest is Mauna Loa on the Big Island of Hawaii Shield volcanoes can be so large they are sometimes considered a mountain range such as the Ilgachuz Range and the Rainbow Range both of which are located in Canada These shield volcanoes formed when the North American Plate moved over a hotspot similar to the one feeding the Hawaiian Islands called the Anahim hotspot There are also shield volcanoes for example in Washington Oregon and the Galapagos Islands The Piton de la Fournaise on Reunion Island is one of the more active shield volcanoes on earth with one eruption per year on average

Shield volcanoes are known to form on other planets The largest known mountain in the solar system Olympus Mons on Mars is a shield volcano thought to be extinct Shield volcanoes on Mars are higher and much more massive than those on Earth However we do not know if they will erupt again or when

On Earth because of plate tectonics hotspot volcanoes eventually move away from the source of their magma and the volcanoes are individually less massive than might otherwise be the case Shield volcanoes usually occur along constructive boundaries or above hotspots However the numerous large shield volcanoes of the Cascade Range of northern California and Oregon are over a more complex environment

A caldera is a volcanic feature formed by the collapse of land following a volcanic eruption They are often confused with volcanic craters The word caldera comes from the Portuguese language meaning cauldron

Sometimes people say that their computer has a bug when something is wrong with it The problem is usually caused by a computer virus which has infected their computer and is making it slow or do different things

Telephone tapping or wire tappingwiretapping is when somebody listens to another persons telephone calls They usually use a listening device called a bug to listen to and record the conversation so that another person can then listen to it later

Pentecostalism is a movement within Evangelical Christianity that places special emphasis on the direct personal experience of God through the baptism of the Holy Spirit as shown in the Biblical account of the Day of Pentecost Pentecostalism is similar to the Charismatic movement but developed earlier and separated from the mainstream church Charismatic Christians at least in the early days of the movement tended to remain in their respective denominations

There are three basic streams of Pentecostal churches The majority believe that one must be saved by believing in Jesus as Lord and Savior for the forgiveness of sins and to be made acceptable to God Pentecostals also typically believe like most other evangelicals that the Bible has definitive authority in matters of faith To this first group speaking in tongues is the sign of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit and is not related to a persons salvation This majority group believes that the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is a supernatural empowerment for ministry that only comes upon someone after they have become a Christian The other two groups fall under an bibleverseActs238 based salvation message which says that a person needs to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and then receive the Holy Spirit In that understanding receiving the Holy Spirit is necessary for salvation and includes speaking in tongues Of the Acts 238 based churches they fall into four categories of Jesus Name First United or Oneness Pentecostals which baptize in Jesus name only and those that baptize in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost

Because many Pentecostal denominations come from Methodism and the Methodist Holiness Movement Pentecostal soteriology is generally Arminian rather than Calvinist believing that the ability to believe in Jesus is a power of the human free will

See also List of Christian denominations by number of members This list indicates that there may be 150 million Pentecostals The largest Pentecostal denominations are

While not as large as some of the above organizations the following have made quite an impact on Pentecostalism

The Basic Roman spelling of English is a 2002 proposal for regular English spelling It is based on five principles

The Basic Roman system serves no particular standard of English pronunciation Instead it gives one way to spell the different varieties of English The system uses 22 Roman letters to represent the set of English phonemes considered by JC Wells The letters j q w and x are not used

By way of illustration the following reference text by V Yule is given in traditional spelling and in Basic Roman

A more elaborate version of the system is the Extended Basic Roman spelling of English which uses also the letters j and w and has two specific two letter combinations for the English voiced and voiceless dental fricatives The above sample text would appear in Extended Basic Roman as follows

The Extended Basic Roman is close to one to one phoneme grapheme correspondence paving the way to a pronunciation respelling for English by means of the closely related Roman Phonetic Alphabet for English

The Roman Phonetic Alphabet for English is a system based on the Extended Basic Roman spelling of English It includes two pairs of stress marks which disambiguate words which share the same spelling but have different meanings This is to get a one to one phonemegrapheme correspondence The system has certain similarities to the systems of the NBC Handbook of Pronunciation the Carnegie Mellon version of Arpabet alphabet and the World Book Dictionary

Primary stress is indicated by the mark respectively in the case of and r Secondary stress is shown by and respectively Stress marks are placed before the syllables concerned

By way of illustration the following reference text by V Yule is given in traditional English spelling and in Roman Phonetic Alphabet transcription

In Egyptian mythology Wadjet was the goddess of childbirth and children She was often shown in art as a cobra She was the protector of lower Egypt Later she became the protector of kings

Buto or Butos or Butosos was the later Greek name for an ancient Egyptian city 95 km east of Alexandria in the Nile Delta of Egypt It is the modern Kem Kasir

Buto originally was two cities Pe and Dep which merged into one city that the Egyptians named Per Wadjet The goddess Wadjet was its local goddess often represented as a cobra and she was considered the patron deity of Lower Egypt 

The city was an important site in Ancient Egypt since more than ten thousand years Archaeological evidence shows that Upper Egyptian culture replaced the Buto culture at the delta when Upper and Lower Egypt were unified 

The Greek historians told that town was celebrated for its temple and oracle of the goddess Wadjet They also told that at Buto there was also a sanctuary of Horus

A scribe is an ancient occupation A scribes job involved reading and writing especially during the Renaissance Being a scribe meant writing letters and historical records for kings nobility and temples Later it changed into being clerks public servants journalists accountants and lawyers Today there are no scribes but there are still authors and writers 

The Ancient Egyptian scribe was an important job Ancient Egypt also had its painters and artisans who decorated tombs buildings furniture statues and other relics with pictures and hieroglyphics In Ancient Egypt only males could be scribes This was so in many civilisations because most official positions were exclusively male

The scribes had to be able to write not only the hieroglyphs but also the hieratic script and they had to know arithmetic They used a type of paper called papyrus made from reeds and wrote with reed pens and ink

Ascension is a Christian holiday The word ascension means going up According to the story told in the Bible Jesus ascended to heaven with his apostles The holiday is celebrated forty days after his resurrection The story tells that Jesus body went to heaven and that in heaven he sits at the right hand side of God the Father

Ascension Day is officially celebrated on a Thursday However not all countries hold the feast on this day The feast is one of the ecumenical feasts All Christians celebrate this feast much like Easter and Pentecost It is a very important feast in the calendar of the Christian Church 

The Epistle to the Romans is a book from the Bible which was written about the year 56 or 57 In it Paul describes Christ as in heaven and in the abyss This seems to be the earliest Christian reference to Jesus in heaven 

One of the most important texts about the Ascension is in the Acts of the Apostles bibleverse nbActs11 11 According to the two source hypothesis it is also the earliest There Jesus is taken up bodily into heaven forty days after his resurrection The text says that the apostles saw this happening Before going into heaven Jesus gave a speech called the Great Commission in which he said that he would return In the Gospel of Luke the Ascension takes place on Easter Sunday evening The Gospel of John talks about Jesus returning to the Father In 1 Peter Jesus has ascended to heaven and is at Gods right side Ephesians refers to Jesus ascending higher than all the heavens First Timothy describes Jesus as taken up in glory The traditional ending in the Book of Mark includes a short version of what Luke had said about the resurrection It describes Jesus as being taken up into heaven and sitting at Gods right hand The way that Christs Ascension is described is similar to the general description of his welcome in heaven a description that comes from Hebrew scripture The picture of Jesus rising bodily into the heavens fits in with the old traditional idea that heaven was above the earth

There are texts that are not in the Bible that also speak about ascension for example Pistis Sophia In his text Against Heresies Irenaeus tells about the Gnostic view that the Ascension happened eighteen months after the Resurrection The apocryphal text known as the Apocryphon of James describes the teachings of Jesus to James and Peter 550 days after the resurrection but before the ascension This text suggests an even longer period The recently discovered Nag Hammadi Gospel of Thomas like the canonical Gospel of Matthew does not mention the Ascension

The feast of the Ascension has been celebrated for many centuries Although we do not have anything in writing about it before the beginning of the fifth century St Augustine says that it is of Apostolic origin and he speaks of it in a way that shows that all Christians celebrated it long before his time

Christs ascension is mentioned in the original Nicene Creed This text has been important to Christians ever since it was made in 325 It is included in the Mass It is also mentioned in the Apostles Creed It is important for Christian belief because it shows that Jesus humanity was taken into Heaven Ascension Day is one of the chief feasts of the Christian year There is plenty of evidence that shows that the feast dates back at least to the later 300s

The canonical story of Jesus ascending bodily into the clouds is different from the gnostic tradition by which Jesus was said to transcend the bodily world and return to his home in the spirit world It also contrasts with Docetic beliefs by which matter is basically evil and Jesus was said to have been pure spirit

Scholars of the historical Jesus think that New Testament accounts of Jesus resurrection were stories that were invented by the apostolic era Christian community Some describe the Ascension as a convenient way to disagree with ongoing appearance claims in the Christian community

The Religion of ancient Egypt had followers for over three thousand yearsCitation needed until the Egyptian people turned to Coptic Christianity and Islam

At the beginning there were five different religious groups of people in Egypt Each groups had different beliefs and were based in different places

During the history of Egypt the beliefs changed with the leader When someone rose in power their belief system rose as well The new beliefs would combined with the beliefs that were already there This happened even after the end of the ancient Egyptian civilization as it is known today An example of this might be the New Kingdom During its time the gods Ra and Amun became Amun Ra Joining to create one god is usually referred to as syncretism 

The Egyptians believed that in the beginning the universe was filled with the dark waters of chaos The first god Re Atum came from the water Re Atum spat and this created the gods Shu and Tefnut The world was created when Shu and Tefnut gave birth to two children Nut and Geb Humans were created when Shu and Tefnut went walking in the darkness and got lost Re Atum sent his eye to find them After finding them his tears of joy turned into people

Nut and Geb had sex When Shu heard about this he did not want them to be together He became the air between the sky and ground He also said that the pregnant Nut could not give birth Nut begged Thoth to help Thoth gambled with the moon god Khonsu He won five more days to be added to the 360 day year Nut had one child on each of these days Osiris Isis Set Nephthys and Horus the Elder

Osiris was the king of Egypt His brother Seth murdered him and became the king After killing him Seth tore the body of Osiris into pieces Isis rescued the pieces She wanted to bury the pieces under the temple After Seth became king he was fought by Horus Osiriss son Seth lost and was sent to the desert Seth became the god of very bad storms Osiris was mummified by Anubis and became God of the dead Horus became the new king In ancient Egypt it was believed that the pharaohs were Horuss descendants

The ancient Greeks believed that their gods and goddesses were the anscestors of the Egyptian gods and goddesses In ancient Greek Mythology when the titan Typhon was set free all of the Greek gods fled to Egypt In Egypt many of the gods made themselves turn into animals to hide themselves from Typhon They reproduced and the Egyptian gods and goddesses were born

Egypt had a developed view of the afterlife with rituals for preparing the body and soul for a peaceful life after death Beliefs about the soul and afterlife focused mainly on preserving the body This was because they believed that the ka was still living in the body after death and it was important for the ka to be reunited with the ba the spirit or soul to form the akh This meant that embalming and mummification were done in order to preserve the persons identity in the afterlife Originally the dead were buried in reed coffins in the hot sand which caused the remains to dry quickly and then were buried Later they started constructing wooden tombs and the long process of mummification was developed by the Egyptians around the 4th Dynasty All soft tissues were removed and the cavities washed and packed with natron then the outer body was buried in natron as well

After coming out of the natron the bodies were coated inside and out with resin to preserve them then wrapped with linen bandages embedded with religious amulets and talismans In the case of royalty this was usually then placed inside a series of nested coffins The outer layer of the coffins was a stone sarcophagus The intestines lungs liver and the stomach were preserved separately and stored in canopic jars protected by the Four sons of Horus Other creatures were also mummified sometimes thought to be pets of Egyptian families but more likely they represented the gods They left the heart in place because they thought it was the home of the soul

The Book of the Dead was a series of almost two hundred spells represented as texts songs and pictures written on papyrus They were individually customized for the dead They were buried along with the dead to make their passage into the underworld easier After a person dies their soul is led into a hall of judgment in Duat by Anubis and the deceaseds heart which was the record of the morality of the owner is weighed against a single feather representing Maat A heart that weighed less than the feather was considered a pure heart This resulted in a good outcome A heart heavy with guilt and sin from ones life weighed more than the feather and so the heart would be eaten by Ammitpart crocodile part lion and part hippopotamus If the outcome was good the dead are taken to Osiris god of the afterlife in Aaru but the if the out come was bad the demon Ammit destroyed their heart leaving the owner to remain in Duat

A short time of monotheism happened when Akhenaten was pharaoh He focused the religion on the Egyptian sun god Aten The Aten is usually shown as a sun disk with rays coming out of all sides Akhenaten built a new capital at Amarna with temples for The Aten Akhenatens religion only lasted until his death The old religion was quickly restored by Tutankhamun Akhenatens son by his wife Kiya

While most historians say this period is monotheistic some researchers do not They say that people worshipped the royal family as gods who got their divine power from the Aten In one picture Akhenaten is shown with his wife Nefertiti with three of their 6 daughters sitting under the beams of the Aten This point of view is mostly ignored by historians Some researchers say that Akhenaten or some of his viziers were Moses or Joseph from the Bible

After the fall of the Amarna dynasty the original Egyptian was the main religion until the development Coptic Christianity and later Islam even though the Egyptians continued to have relations with the other monotheistic cultures Egyptian mythology put up surprisingly little resistance to the spread of Christianity This is sometimes explained by saying that Jesus was originally a syncretism based mainly on Horus with Isis and her worship becoming Mary

In Botany an annual plant is a plant that usually germinates flowers and dies in one year True annuals will only live longer than a year if they are prevented from setting seed Some seedless plants can also be considered annuals even though they do not flower

In gardening annual often refers to a plant grown outdoors in the spring and summer and surviving just for one growing season Many food plants are or are grown as annuals including most domesticated grains Some perennials and biennials are grown in gardens as annuals for convenience particularly if they are not considered cold hardy for the local climate Carrot celery and parsley are true biennials that are usually grown as annual crops for their edible roots petioles and leaves respectively Tomato sweet potato and bell pepper are tender perennials usually grown as annuals

Ornamental annuals are often called bedding plants Annuals are often used in gardens to provide splashes of color as they tend to have a longer season of bloom than hardy herbaceous perennials 

Examples of true annuals include corn lettuce pea cauliflower watermelon bean zinnia and marigold

Summer annuals sprout flower and die within the same springsummerfall The lawn weed crabgrass is a summer annual

A pea although treated as a vegetable in cooking is botanically a fruit the term is most commonly used to describe the small spherical seeds or the pods of the legume Pisum sativum This was the original model organism used by Gregor Mendel in his early work on genetics 

The name is also used to describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae like the pigeon pea the cowpeaand the seeds from several species of Lathyrus

P sativum is an annual plant It is a cool season crop planted in winter The average pea weighs between 01 and 036 grams The species is as a fresh vegetable but is also grown to produce dry peas like the split pea These varieties are typically called field peas

P sativum has been cultivated for thousands of years the sites of cultivation have been described in southern Syria and southeastern Turkey and some argue that the cultivation of peas with wheat and barley seems to be associated with the spread of Neolithic agriculture into Europe

It is a cool season vegetable crop The seeds may be planted as soon as the soil temperature reaches 10 C with the plants growing best at temperatures of 13 C to 18 C They do not thrive in the summer heat of warmer temperate and lowland tropical climates but do grow well in cooler high altitude tropical areas Peas grow best in slightly acid well drained soils

Several varieties of P sativum have been bred Widely cultivated examples include

Fresh peas are often eaten boiled and flavored with butter andor spearmint as a side dish vegetable Salt is also commonly added to peas when served Fresh peas are also used in pot pies salads and casseroles Pod peas are used in stir fried dishes particularly those in American Chinese cuisine Pea pods do not keep well once picked and if not used quickly are best preserved by drying canning or freezing within a few hours of harvest

Dried peas are often made into a soup or simply eaten on their own In Japan and other Southeast Asian countries including Thailand Taiwan and Malaysia the peas are roasted and salted and eaten as snacks In the UK marrowfat peas are used to make pease pudding a traditional dish In North America a similarly traditional dish is split pea soup

In Chinese cuisine pea sprouts are commonly used in stir fries and its price is relatively high due to its agreeable taste

Some forms of etiquette require that peas be only eaten with a fork and not pushed onto the fork with a knife 

A biennial plant is a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its lifecycle In the first year the plant grows leaves stems and roots then it enters a period of dormancy over the colder months Usually the stem remains very short and the leaves are low to the ground forming a rosette Many biennials require a cold treatment before they will flower The next springsummer the stem of the biennial plant becomes much longer The plant then flowers produces fruits and seeds before it finally dies There are far fewer biennials than either perennials or annuals

Under extreme climatic conditions a biennial plant may complete its lifecycle in a very short period of time This is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were exposed to cold conditions before they were planted in the ground This behaviour leads to many normally biennial plants being treated as annuals in some areas Flowering can be induced in some biennials by application of the plant hormone gibberellin but this is rarely done commercially

From a gardeners perspective a plants status as annual biennial or perennial often varies based on location or purpose Biennials grown for flowers fruits or seeds need to be grown for two years Biennials that are grown for edible leaves or roots are grown as annuals eg beets Brussels sprouts cabbage carrots celery parsley and Swiss chard If a normally biennial plant is grown in extremely harsh conditions it is likely to be treated as an annual because it will not survive the winter cold Conversely an annual grown under extremely favourable conditions may have highly successful seed propagation giving it the appearance of being biennial or perennial Some short lived perennials may appear to be biennial rather than perennial True biennials flower only once while many perennials will flower every year once mature

Examples of biennial plants are parsley Lunaria silverbeet sweet William colic weed and carrot The pansy is a biennial often grown as an annual Plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed eg foxglove stock and hollyhock

Biennials may be kept alive longer than two years under environmental conditions that prevent them from flowering Biennial sugar beet was prevented from flowering by not giving it the cold treatment required for flowering It was kept alive in a greenhouse for 41 months

51st state is sometimes a joke term in American politics and sometimes a realistic one that talks about a land that is not a part of USA but people think about adding to the United States and making it the 51st state Sometimes 51st state is said not as a joke Usually it is a joke about Canada because Canada is right next to America and both countries are English speaking There have been tries by people in the United States to get Canada to join them Canada has never taken up these offers Before the year 1959 when Alaska and Hawaii became states the word the 49th state was used 51st State sometimes is about countries that seem to be controlled by the United States

The term is used in Canada and other countries to show that they think there is a bad US influence on the world In Europe and Australia people who think their culture has become too much like Americas culture sometimes use the term 51st state about their own countries In Europe it can also mean Iceland because the USA is a very important country in Icelandic politics and economy Finland because American culture is very popular in Finland or Great Britain because people speak English language both in the USA and Great Britain

The term 51st state can also mean non Americans who like American culture and act like Americans or a non American politician who is a supporter of the United States especially its foreign politics

Places in the United States that are not states right now that might become the 51st state are Puerto Rico Washington DC Guam the US Virgin Islands or the Northern Marianas The most serious proposals for forming 51 or even 52 states are those for dividing the most populous stateof California into two or even three states giving that area either four or six seats in the US Senate rather than just two as is the present situation plus more efficient local administrations

Some regions of the USA that include land that is now in two different states and might become a new state include the State of Jefferson and the State of Lincoln Eastmost Washington State plus the northern panhandle of Idaho A move has also been proposed to separate the westmost one fourth of Nebraska from that state but to add that to Wyoming rather than to create an entirely new state This region is actually much closer to Cheyenne Wyoming the capital city than it is to its current capital of Lincoln Nebraska

Mogadishu has had 16 years of fighting between militias This is because the government of Somalia fell in 1991 

Trade between the people in the Mogadishu area with other areas along the Indian coast of Africa started as early as the 1st century Muslim traders from the Arabian Peninsula came to the area during the 10th century Because of trade with them Islam spread through Somalia The Portuguese tried to take control of the city but failed In 1871 Barghash bin Said the sultan of Zanzibar controlled the city 

In 1892 Ali bin Said let Italy use the city Italy bought the city in 1905 They made Mogadiscio the capital of Italian Somaliland The Italians took control of the area around the city in 1936 after heavy resistance British forces that were in Kenya during World War II captured Mogadishu on February 26 1941 The British ruled until they gave Italy control of the city again in 1952 Somalia became independent in 1960 with Mogadishu as its capital

Rebel forces entered and took the city in 1990 They forced President Mohamed Siad Barre to resign and leave the country in January 1991 He went to Lagos Nigeria Some of the rebels said that Ali Mahdi Muhammad was the new president Others said that Mohamed Farrah Aidid was president A group of United States Marines landed near Mogadishu on December 9 1992 They were the first part of the United Nations peacekeeping forces during Operation Restore Hope to go to the country 

Mogadishu is a commercial and financial center for Somalia The economy got better after the Somali Civil War but there are still problems Because there is no government there is free trade without taxes or regulatory costs This makes businesses not cost as much as it does in other places Businesses have hired armed militias to have security This is causing less violence in the city

The main industries of the city include making food and beverages as well as textiles The main textile is cotton The main market many different types of goods from food to electronic items

Mogadishu has the most port traffic of any port in Somalia It is still a major seaport However there is much piracy around Somalias coastal areas This makes trade risky

The Maghen Abraham Synagogue is the oldest synagogue in Beirut capital of Lebanon A synagogue is where Jews go to pray But this synagogue is old and no one used it for long But people in Beirut can still see it in Wadi Abu Jamil the place where Lebanese Jews used to live Today some Lebanese Jews are trying to repair the synagogue so that they can use it again

This synagogue was very important to Jewish Lebanese in the early twentieth century It was built in 1925 It was then named after the son of Abraham Sason Also it was used as a place to stay for illegal travelers Some of the people who traveled without legal papers stayed in the synagogue while going to Palestine Today it is now called Israel 

In 1976 a year after the civil war began Joseph Farhi took the Torah scrolls from the synagogue to Geneva Most of them were sent to Sephardic synagogues in Israel

Israel attacked its enemies in Lebanon This brought anger by other people towards Lebanese Jews Lebanese Jews became targets to Islamic militant groups since 1984 But even during the fighting Yasser Arafats PLO forces and the Christian Phalangists did protect Wadi Abu Jamil during the 1982 Lebanon War But the presence of Palestine Liberation Organization forces in the area brought Israeli attacks that damaged the synagogue itself

B amblyops is the only species within its genus which in turn is the only genus within the family Bentheuphausiidae All the 85 other species of krill known are classified in the family Euphausiidae

B amblyops can be found in the northern Atlantic Ocean It occurs in latitudes south of 40 N and also in the southern seas of the Atlantic in the Indian Ocean and in the Pacific It is a bathypelagic krill that lives in deep waters below 1000 m It is distinguished from the Euphausiidae by several morphological features The features most easily used to tell it apart are that the animals are not bioluminescent and that their first pair of pleopods is not modified as copulatory tool organs Also their eyes are smaller than those of the Euphausiidae Adults reach a length of 4 to 5 cm

The Malacostraca are the largest subgroup of crustaceans They include decapods stomatopods and krill There are 22000 members in this group It represents two thirds of all crustacean species The first malacostracans appeared in the Cambrian periodfactdateApril 2009

The classification of crustaceans is currently being debated Some think Malacostraca is a class and others think it is a subclass

Malacostraca have heads with six segments They have a pair of antennules and a pair of antennae They also have mouthparts There are appendages near the mouthparts called maxillipeds They have five pairs of walking legs The first pair is formed like a pincer There are eight thoracic segments There are six abdominal segments They are used for swimming Members of Malacostraca have compound stalked or sessile eyes They have a two chambered stomach and a centralized nervous system

Class Malacostraca Latreille 1802 

The decapods or Decapoda are an order of crustaceans within the class Malacostraca Many familiar groups such as crayfish crabs lobsters prawns and shrimp can be found in this order Most decapods are scavengers  they eat dead plants and animals

As their name suggests all decapods have ten legs These are the last five of the eight pairs of thoracic legs characteristic of crustaceans The front three pairs are used as jaws and are called maxillipeds The others are pereiopods In many decapods however one pair of legs has large pinching claws the claws are called chelae so those legs may be called chelipeds More legs are found on the abdomen Each segment can carry a pair of two branched pleopods The last of them form part of the tail fan and are called uropods

Classification within the order Decapoda depends on the structure of the gills and legs and the way in which the larvae develop This allows to split them into two suborders Dendrobranchiata and Pleocyemata Prawns make up the Dendrobranchiata The other groups including true shrimp are the Pleocyemata

The following classification follows Martin and Davis with some changes based on more recent structural and molecular studies

Order Decapoda Latreille 1802

Kanji is one of the three forms of Japanese writing A kanji is an ideogram that is a kind of simple picture It is a symbol of an idea such as an object thing or quality

Kanji ideograms were taken about 2000 years ago from Chinese characters and many were gradually changed The word kanji means Han characters 

There are two other systems used to write in Japanese These systems are called Hiragana and Katakana They show how a word is pronounced because each character stands for a syllable Each kanji could also be written in kana indeed they are in childrens books or books for foreigners learning Japanese 

Many words in Japanese can have more than one meaning eg hana can mean nose or flower but the kanji character for each is quite different However each kanji character can have several different pronunciations according to which meaning is intended

Kanji was originally written to look like what it means thus the Japanese symbol for mouth is and looks like a mouth Another word means mountain The Japanese have Kanji for many words Many can be shown with just one Kanji but sometimes two Kanji characters are combined to make new words such as mountain mouth meaning a cave

Kanji is often combined with hiragana to show the grammatical meaning of the word In English this would be done with endings eg act action etc

Many kanji characters can be pronounced in two different ways according to whether the word stands alone or whether it is combined with another word The kun reading is based on Japanese pronunciation the on reading is based on Chinese pronunciation For example on its own is yama When it is combined with another word or name it is pronounced san eg Fuji san

Kanji characters are classed on the basis of how many brush strokes they are made of The simplest kanji have one stroke and the most complex may have up to 23 strokes

There are many different Kanji the exact number is not known but it is around 50000 However not all 50000 are taught in schools The government of Japan has set up a 1945 basic Kanji list that those learning the language ought to know They are the ones most commonly used in newspapers and magazines along with street signs and store signs Kanji takes many years to learn By the end of his school years a pupil should know about 1850 Kanji A university graduate would need to know about 3000 If someone does not know the Kanji for a word they can write it in Kana and it will be understood but it is not the proper way to write it

A libretto is the text which are set to music to make an opera A libretto can also be the words for an oratorio cantata mass or a musical The person who writes the libretto is called a librettist The word libretto is an Italian word which means little book

Sometimes a composer writes his own libretti but usually a composer likes to have a librettist who can write the words for him so that he can set them to music

Some libretti are original stories by the librettist but very often they are based on a book by another writer

In the 18th century Metastasio was a very famous librettist Many of his libretti were set several times by different composers Another 18th century librettist was Lorenzo da Ponte who wrote the libretti for three of Mozarts greatest operas as well as for many other composers In the 19th century Eugne Scribe wrote a very large number of libretti that were set to music by composers such as Meyerbeer Auber Bellini Donizetti Rossini and Verdi Two French writers called Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halvy wrote a large number of opera and operetta libretti for the composers Jacques Offenbach Jules Massenet and Georges Bizet Arrigo Boito who wrote libretti for among others Giuseppe Verdi and Amilcare Ponchielli composed two operas of his own Hugo von Hoffmansthal wrote libretti for Richard Strauss

Wagner and Tippett are two composers who wrote their own libretti

Usually a libretto is written before the music but sometimes composers wrote some of the music first and then looked for words to go with it Composers such as Mikhail Glinka Alexander Serov Rimsky Korsakov Puccini and Mascagni all did this sometimes

Musicals usually have lyrics and a separate book Sometimes these two are by different authors eg the musical Fiddler on the Roof has a composer a lyricist and the writer of the book

Alternatively the median of an even sized list is sometimes defined as either of the two middle elements the choice being either always the smallest one always the largest one or randomly choose between the two This alternative definition has two important advantages it guarantees that the median is always a list element and it guarantees that the median exists for any ordinal valued data On the other hand when one of the choices or is taken the median of a sample will be biased which is an unwanted property of a statistical estimator Definition does not have that disadvantage but is more difficult to implement and additionally has the disadvantage that the same list of values does not have a well defined deterministic median

Median and mean are different in several ways Mean is a better measure in many cases because many of the statistical tests can use mean and standard deviation of two observations to compare them while the same comparison cannot be performed using the medians

On the opposite median is a better statistical measure in some cases where the variance of the values is not important and we only need a central measure of the values If the maximum value of a set of numbers changes while the other numbers of this set are kept the same the mean of this set of numbers changes but the median does not

One of the other advantages of median is that it can be calculated sooner when we are studying survival data For example a researcher can calculate the median survival of patients with a kidney transplant when half the patients participated in his study die in contrast if he wants to calculate the mean survival he must continue the study and follow all of the patients until their death

Suppose you want to know how many jelly beans most people in the room have Lets say there are five people in the room

The results change a lot when you have a bigger range of numbers Lets imagine a different group of five people

In this second case the mean gives you a poor understanding how how many jelly beans most people have The median gives you a better idea of the number of jelly beans most people have If you wanted to divide up the number of jelly beans equally however you would use the mean

In statistics the mode is a number Very often samples of data are collected These might be measurements of some kind In this context the mode is the value that occurs most often Unlike the median and the mean the mode is not necessarily unique There might be several different values that occur the same number of times

Bread is now much sweeter than it was in the Middle Ages because a lot of corn syrup or honey is used

A statistical hypothesis test is a method used in statistics to answer a question based on some data

A statistical test works out a number which relates the information to the question This is compared to other numbers The critical value is the number which the test would give if the question was true So if the statistical test gives a number close to the critical value probably the answer to the question is true But if the test gives a number very different from the critical value probably the answer is false

In mathematics a Ramanujan prime is a prime number that satisfies a result proven by Srinivasa Ramanujan It relates to the prime counting function

The numbers 2 11 17 29 41 are first few Ramanujan primes In other words

Bertrands postulate states that if n 3 is an integer then there always exists at least one prime number p with n p 2n 2 

This statement was first made in 1845 by Joseph Bertrand Bertrand verified his statement for all numbers in the interval 2 3 106

His statement was completely proven by Pafnuty Chebyshev in 1850 For this reason the postulate is also called the Bertrand Chebyshev theorem or Chebyshevs theorem Srinivasa Ramanujan gave a simpler proof Ramanujan later used that proof when he discovered Ramanujan primes In 1932 Paul Erds published a simpler proof using the Chebyshev function 

Paul Erds also Pl Erds in English Paul Erdos or Paul Erds was a famous Hungarian born mathematician He worked with hundreds of mathematicians on problems in combinatorics graph theory number theory classical analysis approximation theory set theory and probability theory

Because he wrote so many articles friends created Erds number Erds has a number of 0 and his direct collaborators were given the number 1 Their collaborators were given a number of 2 an so on 

The Erds number was most likely first defined by Casper Goffman a mathematician whose Erds number is 1

The Erds number honors the Hungarian mathematician Paul Erds Erds was one of the most prolific mathematical writers He worked with many mathematicians 

Paul Erdss number is 0 Anyone who directly worked with Paul Erds has an Erds number of 1 Anyone who works with those collaborators who have an Erds number of 1 have an Erds number of 2 The chain continues like that

Energy efficiency is using less energy to provide the same level of energy service An example would be insulating a home to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve the same temperature Another example would be installing fluorescent lights andor skylights instead of incandescent bulbs to attain the same level of illumination So efficient energy use is achieved primarily by means of a more efficient technology rather than by changes in individual behaviour

Energy conservation is using less energy to achieve a lesser energy service and usually involves a change in behavior Examples would be heating a room less in winter or driving less or working in a less brightly lit room 

As with other definitions the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy but both are important in environmental and economic terms This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels

Crater Lake is a caldera lake in the US state of Oregon It is the main attraction of Crater Lake National Park It is famous for its blue color and clear water The lake partly fills a nearly 4000 feet deep caldera that was formed by the collapse of the volcano Mount Mazama This happened about 7700 years ago

There are no rivers flowing into or out of the lake the evaporation is compensated for by rain and snowfall at a rate such that the total amount of water is replaced every 250 years

John Wesley Hillman was the first European to discover Crater Lake He named the lake Deep Blue Lake The lake was renamed at least three times as Blue Lake Lake Majesty and lastly Crater Lake

Crater Lake is known for its famous piece of driftwood named the Old Man of the Lake It is a tree that has been moving up and down in the water for more than 100 years Due to the cold water of the lake the tree has been well preserved

While having no native fish population the lake was stocked up with various fish between the years of 1888 and 1941 Several species of fish are still in the lake to this day

Driftwood is wood that has been washed onto the shore of a sea river or lake by winds tides waves or man

In some waterfront areas driftwood is a major broken wikt linknuisancenuisance However the driftwood provides shelter and food for birds fish and other aquatic species as it floats in the ocean Gribbles shipworms and bacteria decompose the wood and gradually turn it into nutrients that are reintroduced to the food web Sometimes the partially decomposed wood washes ashore where it also shelters birds plants and other species Driftwood can become the foundation for sand dunes

Driftwood can be

According to Norse mythology the first humans Ask and Embla were formed out of two pieces of driftwood an ash and an elm by the god Odin and his brothers Ve and Vili 

Driftwood carried by Arctic rivers was the main or sometimes only source of wood for some Inuit and other Arctic populations living north of the tree line until they came into regular contact with European traders 

Many people use driftwood as parts of decorative furniture or other art forms and it is a popular element in the scenery of fish tanks

Highways come in many different designs They can include many lanes of traffic a median between lanes of opposing traffic and access control Highways can also be as simple as a two lane road

In many countries these roads are numbered to easily tell them apart These numbered highways are usually called routes The United States includes a system called the Interstate Highway system controlled by AASHTO where major northsouth routes are odd numbered and eastwest are even numbered In Canada routes that are in the 400s are freeways In China types of routes are separated by the first letter of the route G for national road S for provincial road and Y for rural roads

Gribbles bore into wood and plant material for broken wikt linkingestioningestion as food The cellulose of wood is digested most likely with the aid of cellulases produced by the gribbles themselves The most destructive species are Limnoria lignorum L tripunctata and L quadripunctata

According to an expert they are the only animals able to make a cellulase to dissolve plant cell walls Other animals that eat plant fibres make use of bacteria in their gut to produce the enzyme Gribbles do not This has led some biologists to think of biofuels

Kumho Tire Co v Carmichael applied the Daubert standard to expert testimony from non scientists

Patrick Carmichael was driving his minivan on July 6 1993 when the right rear tire blew out One of the passengers in the vehicle died and others were severely injured Three months later the Carmichaels sued the manufacturer of the tire claiming that the tire was defective and the defect caused the accident The Carmichaels case rested largely on testimony from a tire failure expert

The tire failure expert relied on features of tire technology that the manufacturer did not dispute as well as background facts about the particular tire on the Carmichaels van The experts conclusion that a defect in the tire caused the accident rested on certain observations about the tire that Kumho Tire vigorously disputed Kumho also disagreed with certain aspects of the tire experts methodology and asked the federal district court hearing the case to exclude it under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence

The district court took its cue from Daubert v Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals which had solidified a gatekeeping role for trial judges in admitting expert testimony Under Daubert certain factors contribute to the reliability and hence the admissibility of expert testimony one of which is the general validity of the experts methods The district court found the tire experts methods not to be scientifically valid and hence excluded his testimony This meant that Kumho Tire would prevail The Carmichaels appealed to the Eleventh Circuit

The Eleventh Circuit reversed the district courts ruling in favor of Kumho Tire It reasoned that Daubert was expressly limited only to scientific expert testimony and did not apply to skill or experience based observation The tire experts testimony rested on observation and experience and so the Eleventh Circuit reasoned the district court should have made a different ruling based on Rule 702 without the Daubert gloss Kumho Tire asked the Supreme Court to review whether Daubert applied solely to scientific evidence

Mulatto is a word referring to a person who is born to one Black parent and one Caucasian parent The term may be considered offensive or rude to some because of its origin The term is also used to refer to a light brown color because of a mulattos skin color Many people prefer terms such as biracial and of mixed race over mulatto

Water polo is a sport played in the water with a ball It is based on a similar game polo The objective of the game is to get the ball into the goal more than the opposing team

Water polo is a team game Two teams play a match which consists of four periods named quarters The length of each period is usually between 5 to 8 minutes but because the amount of time spent on fouls or out throws is not counted in the quarter time an average quarter lasts around 12 minutes real time

Each team consists of six field players and one goalkeeper Water polo players need to be skilled in swimming ball handing skills reflexes and awareness

Fishsticks or fish fingers are a type of food probably invented in the United Kingdom They are made of a whitefish like cod that is battered and breaded They are often eaten with tartar sauce cocktail sauce or ketchup Fishsticks are popular with children and their parents as an easy to prepare finger food that is somewhat healthy for kids

Fishsticks first came about as a result of the invention of the plate froster in 1929 the first quick freezer To ensure rapid freezing food needed to be in slim rectangular broken wikt linkslabslabs A suitable candidate for this freezing method was fishsticks broken wikt linksliverslivers cut from large fish then dipped in bread crumbs for frying

In Britain in the 1950s most of the herring catch was pickled and exported to other North European countries In an attempt to make herring more appealing on the home market companies tried to present it in a new way creating herring fishsticks called herring savouries and were tested on the market against a bland control product of cod sticks sold as fish fingers Shoppers in Southampton and South Wales showed an overwhelming preference for the cod Cod fishsticks were first produced in Great Yarmouth and introduced in Britain on 26 September 1955 They became immensely popular after television advertising began in 1956 To this day fish sticks are a favorite food among children

On modern production lines headless fish are processed through a machine that removes a fillet from each side of the backbone The fillets then pass over a wheel and a blade that separates the skin from the flesh Machine filleting leaves a few pin like bones in the fillet so the flesh containing the bones is cut out

Fillets are formed into frozen blocks A conveyor sends the blanks through batter and breadcrumbs doubling the thickness of the fishstick Then each is passed through a hot vegetable oil bath for about one minute to seal the coating and allow the fishstick to be grilled or fried Then the fishstick is frozen again with the center reaching 4F 20C in less than 20 minutes After packaging it is stored at 18F 28C ready for distribution

Cornell Haynes Jr is an American rapper He his better known as his stage name Nelly He won three Grammy Awards in 2003

A boy band is a type of musical group with three or more young male singers Usually the singers are able to perform as dancers as well Most singers in boy bands do not play musical instruments Boy bands usually perform pop or RB music

Some of the most popular boy bands include the following

In music a solo is a song or a section of a song that is performed by one person This could be a performance with one musical instrument A solo can also be a song that is sung by a single performer

Similar to a solo in music a dance solo is when a dancer performs a dance alone This is different from a two people dancing together or a group of people dancing together in a synchronized way

A person who performs a solo song or dance is called a soloist

Antarctic krill is a species of krill that lives in the Antarctic waters of the Southern Ocean They are shrimp like and belong to the invertebrates 

They live in large schools called swarms Sometimes these swarms have a density of 1000030000 individual animals per cubic meter 

They feed directly on very small phytoplankton so they can use the energy that the phytoplankton originally got from the sun in order to sustain their life in the open ocean They grow to a length of 6 cm weigh up to 2 g and can live for up to six years They are a key species in the Antarctic ecosystem and are in terms of biomass probably the most successful animal species on the planet

In aquaria krill have been observed to eat each other 

The cubic metre is the SI unit of volume It is the volume of a cube with edges one metre in length In the United States it is spelled cubic meter

Other names are stre and kilolitre spelled broken wikt linkkiloliterkiloliter in the United States

1 cubic metre equals

A cubic metre of pure water at the temperature of maximum density and standard atmospheric pressure has a mass of 1000 kg or one tonne At 0 C the freezing point of water it is slightly less 999972 kg

It is sometimes abbreviated cu m m3 m3 or m3 when superscript characters or markup are not availableaccessible

Abbreviated CBM in the freight business and MTQ in international trade

It serves both developed and developing countries and acts as a neutral forum where all nations meet as equals FAO is also a source of knowledge and information and helps developing countries and countries in transition modernize and improve agriculture forestry and fisheries practices ensuring good nutrition and food security for all

A colorimeter is a device used for measuring colours or colorimetry It measures the absorbance of different wavelengths of light in a solution It can be used to measure the concentration of a known solute

Different chemical substances absorb different wavelengths of light When the concentration of the solute is higher it absorbs more light in a specific wavelength This is known as the Beer Lambert law

The most important parts of a colorimeter are

Different filters are used to select the wavelength of light which the solution absorbs the most This makes the colorimeter more accurate Solutions are usually placed in glass or plastic cuvettes The usual wavelengths used are between 400 and 700 nanometers If it is necessary to use ultraviolet light then the lamp and filters must be changed

The output of the colorimeter may be shown in graphs or tables by an analogue or digital meter The data may be printed on paper or stored in a computer It either shows the amount of light which is absorbed by the solution or the amount of light which has passed through the solution

Limburg is the southern most province of Netherlands Its capital is Maastricht It is the one and only province in the Netherlands which has hills It also is a very old province the capital city Maastricht is over 2000 years old Also the Limburgish people do not speak Dutch but they speak their own dialects These dialects  especially the ones in the South of Limburg  are famous because the normal Dutch people find it difficult to understand These dialects have many influences from German and French

Limburger cheese comes from this region

Mount Cayley is an eroded stratovolcano It is 11 km southeast of Callaghan Lake and 24 west of Whistler British Columbia Canada It is part of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt which is a segment of the Cascade Volcanic Arc

A scenario of an eruption of Mount Cayley shows how western Canada is vulnerable to an eruption The scenario is based on past activity in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and involves both effusive and explosive eruptions The scenario impact is largely a result of the concentration of vulnerable infrastructure in valleys

In 2003 Catherine Hickson a scientist with the Geological Survey of Canada was one of the three scientists to report on the hypothetical eruption at Mount Cayley The first signs of activity at the volcano would probably be enlarged seismic activity in and close to the mountain Flooding would turn out to be a huge issue for the community of Squamish and could eventually overrun parts of Highway 99

The Mount Cayley volcanic field is named after Mount Cayley

Limburg is a name used for different concepts

Limburger cheese is made in both regions

Limburg is a province of Belgium It lies in Flanders It is the eastermost Flemish province It has common borders with the Netherlands and the Belgian provinces of Lige Flemish Brabant and Antwerp Its capital is Hasselt People officially speak Dutch there

Limburgs name comes from the fortified castle town known as Limbourg located on the river Vesdre in the Ardennes This is now the Walloon province of Lige

Limburg is crossed by the Albert Canal It has historically been an important coal mining area

Limburg is a medieval city in the Belgian province of Lige It was founded in the 11th century

In 2007 its population was 5644

It is located at 50 37 North 05 56 East

Limburg an der Lahn is a German town and the capital of the Kreis Limburg Weilburg in the west of Hesse

Stinky could mean

An illusion is a distortion of how things seem to be It shows how the brain normally arranges sorts and explains stimulation of the senses Illusions can change the way reality seems to be In general they are shared by most people Illusions can happen with all five senses Some illusions happen because of disorders

An illusion is different from a hallucination a halucination is sensing something which is not real but an illusion is interpreting what we sense wrongly

They are the most known and understood The brain doesnt understand information the eye takes in The brain makes wrong guesses about what the eye sees

They are illusions that are heard The person listening hears sounds that arent really there or sounds that cant really happen A Shepard tone is an auditory illusion

They are when a person feels something that isnt there or something that shouldnt be there but feels like it is This happens sometimes when a person loses his arm The person still feels like the arm is there They might want to scratch the arm or the arm might hurt them This can happen with any limb of the body and it is called the phantom limb

Charcoal is a carbon containing substance made from wood naturally black and powdery Charcoal is made from wood by heating it in airless space in high temperature The wood will not burn but instead turn into charcoal The by product of making charcoal is tar and turpentine

People use it for different things such as cooking on a barbecue grill and in painting

Brose Baskets Bamberg is a basketball club in Bamberg Germany In 2005 2007 and 2010 it has won the BBL and in 1992 and 2010 it has won the German Cup 

The Armenian Revolutionary Federation is an Armenian political party founded in Tiflis in 1890 by Christapor Mikaelian Stepan Zorian and Simon Zavarian The party works in Armenia and in countries where the Armenian diaspora is active notably in Lebanon and the ethnically Armenian dominated de facto Republic of Nagorno Karabakh 

The Armenian Revolutionary Federation History Museum was created during an official ceremony Friday 2007 at Yerevans Kristapor Mikaelian Center with the partys leaders and supporters on hand to mark this momentous occasion

Opened in 1946 the ARF History Museum was in Paris and during the years has collected more than 3000 artifacts describing the partys history After the ARFs return to Armenia the museum and the ARF archives have been sent to Armenia

Giro Manoyan is one of the leaders of ARF

Christapor Mikaelian also known by his noms de guerre Hellen Topal and Edward was one of the three founders of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation along Stepan Zorian and Simon Zavarian also part of Armenian national liberation movement

Rosdom was born in the village of Agulis in Goghtn now part of Nakhchivan Azerbaijan He graduated from the Professorial academy of Tiflis and also attended the University of Moscow where he met Simon Vratsian another co founder of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation 

Varasdates or Varazdat was an Armenian prince who succeeded his uncle King Papes as King of Armenia in 374

Following the murder of King Papes Valens sent Varazdat a nephew of Pap a young man highly reputed for his mental and physical gifts to hold the Armenian throne Shapur II having failed on the battlefield now proposed to Valens in 375 that Armenia be divided between the two powers The Emperor rejected the proposal but sent Victor Magistrianus to the Persian King to discuss the question This emissary was cozened into exceeding the bounds of his authority and agreeing to the Persian proposal In the meantime the internal condition of Armenia was imperiled through friction between King Varazdat and the nakharars culminating in the assassination of Musel Mamikonian the leader of the latters party Manuel the son of Musel took up arms against the King and compelled him to flee from Armenia in 378 after four years of reign Varazdats life was saved but the country was thrown into confusion The Persians took advantage of the turmoil and invaded Armenia but their occupation was a short lived one Shapur II died in 379 and the Persians evacuated in haste Manuel the dynamic Mamikonian had rallied a formidable national force for action 

The Adana massacre happened in Adana Province in the Ottoman Empire in April 1909 A religious ethnic clash in the city of Adana amidst governmental upheaval resulted in a series of anti Armenian pogroms throughout the district Reports estimated that the massacres in Adana Province resulted in 20000 to 30000 deaths

Adana is the capital of Adana Province in Turkey According to the 2000 census with 1130710 inhabitants it is the fifth most populous city of Turkey The 2006 estimate of Adanas population is 1271894 

For most Turkish people the word Adana associates with Kebab algam cotton oranges and very hot weather in the awareness that Adana also embodies more than just these 

In fact Adana is also named among the 25 European Regions of the Future for 20062007 by Foreign Direct Investment Magazine Chosen alongside Kocaeli for Turkey Adana scored the most points for cost effectiveness against Kocaelis points for infrastructure development while Adana and Kocaeli tied on points for the categories of human resources and quality of life 

In October of 1937 Dominican dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina ordered the execution of the Haitian population living within the borderlands with Haiti The violence resulted in the killing of 17000 to 35000 Haitian civilians over a span of approximately five days This would later become known as the Parsley Massacre

Trujillo had made his actions for the Haitian community clear in a short speech given at a dance held in his honor on October 2 1937 in Dajabn statingcquoteFor some months I have traveled and traversed the frontier in every sense of the word I have seen investigated and inquired about the needs of the population To the Dominicans who were complaining of the depredations by Haitians living among them thefts of cattle provisions fruits etc and were thus prevented from enjoying in peace the products of their labor I have responded I will fix this And we have already begun to remedy the situation Three hundred Haitians are now dead in Bnica This remedy will continue

A heat pump is a machine that moves heat from one place to another

A refrigerator is a heat pump It moves heat from the inside to the outside This keeps the food inside cold so it will not spoil

An air conditioner is a heat pump It moves heat from the inside of a building to the outside

A Peltier device is a heat pump It moves heat from one side to the other by means of an electric current

Some buildings are heated with heat pumps also In the winter the heat pump moves heat from the outside to the inside Sometimes this works better than heating with a radiator

Usually heat flows from a hot place to a cold place according to the second law of thermodynamics Heat will not move from a cold place to a warmer place by itself Because of this a heat pump must use extra energy to move the heat This is sort of like pumping water uphill

Most heat pumps use electric motors to provide energy Some heat pumps use heat energy supplied by a flame or an electric heater

Most heat pumps use a refrigeration cycle A refrigeration cycle uses a fluid which moves through tubes and carries the heat The fluid is called a refrigerant During the refrigeration cycle the refrigerant changes from a liquid to a gas and back to a liquid

When the refrigerant changes from a liquid to a gas it gains heat energy This is just like boiling When the refrigerant changes from a gas back to a liquid it loses heat energy

The heat pump is set up so that the refrigerant gains heat from one place that will be cooled and moves it to another place that will be warmed

A heat pump forces the refrigerant to change from a gas to a liquid It uses a compressor to do this Often an electric motor drives the compressor The compressor compresses the refrigerant and this makes it change from a gas to a liquid When the refrigerant changes from a gas to a liquid it also gives up some of the heat that it has been carrying

At the other end of the cycle the refrigerant boils again It changes from a liquid to a gas But it needs heat to do this When it takes up heat from its surroundings it cools them down So where the refrigerant is changing from a liquid to a gas it feels cooler

This is the complete cycle from the cooling side to the heating side On the cooling side heat is taken up to boil the refrigerant from a liquid to a gas Then the fluid moves to the heating side There the compressor forces the refrigerant back to a liquid again This makes it give up its heat So heat has moved from the cooling side to the heating side Then the cycle repeats

If the cooling side is the inside of a refrigerator it gets cold

If the cooling side is the inside of a building and the warming side is the outside of the building the inside of the building gets cold This is how an air conditioner works

If the cooling side is the outside of the building and the warming side is the inside of the building this is how a heat pump can heat a building during the winter

The second law of thermodynamics means that entropy increases In other words over time differences in temperature pressure and density tend to even out

This law is valid only in a physical system that is isolated from the outside world Entropy is a measure of how far along this evening out process has come

The most common wording for the second law of thermodynamics is essentially due to Rudolf Clausius

There are many statements of the second law which use different terms but are all equivalent  Another statement by Clausius is

Heat cannot of itself pass from a colder to a hotter body

An equivalent statement by Lord Kelvin is

A transformation whose only final result is to convert heat extracted from a source at constant temperature into work is impossible 

The second law is only applicable to macroscopic systems The second law is actually a statement about the probable behavior of an isolated system As larger and larger systems are considered the probability of the second law being practically true becomes more and more certain For any isolated system with a mass of more than a few picograms the second law is true to within a few parts in a million

In a general sense the second law says that temperature differences between systems in contact with each other tend to even out and that work can be obtained from these non equilibrium differences but that loss of heat occurs in the form of entropy when work is done Pressure differences density differences and particularly temperature differences all tend to equalize if given the opportunity This means that an isolated system will eventually come to have a uniform temperature A heat engine is a mechanical device that provides useful work from the difference in temperature of two bodies

An air conditioner is a system or machine that removes heat from an area using a cycle in which heat is moved out of the area where it is hot 

In construction a complete system of heating ventilation and air conditioning is referred to as HVAC Its purpose in the home or in the car is to provide comfort during hot days and nights 

The 19th century British scientist and inventor Michael Faraday discovered that compressing and liquefying ammonia could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate 

In 1842 Philippines physician Dr John Gorrie used compressor technology to create ice which he used to cool air for his patients He hoped eventually to use his ice making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings He even thought of centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities 

Air conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into comfort and process 

Comfort applications aim to provide an indoor environment that remains relatively constant in a range preferred by humans despite changes in external weather conditions or in internal heat loads 

Process applications aim to provide a suitable environment for a process being carried out regardless of internal heat loads and external weather conditions Although often in the comfort range it is the needs of the process that determine conditions not human preference Process applications include

In both comfort and process applications not only is the objective to control temperature but other factors including humidity air movement and air quality

 Air Conditioning System Basics and Theories 

In the refrigeration cycle a heat pump transfers heat from a lower temperature heat source into a higher temperature heat sink Heat would naturally flow in the opposite direction This is the most common type of air conditioning A refrigerator works in much the same way as it pumps the heat out of the interior into the room in which it stands

This cycle takes advantage of the universal gas law PV nRT where P is pressure V is volume R is the universal gas constant T is temperature and n is the number of moles of gas

The most common refrigeration cycle uses an electric motor to drive a compressor In an automobile the compressor is driven by a pulley on the engines crankshaft with both using electric motors for air circulation Since evaporation occurs when heat is absorbed and condensation occurs when heat is released air conditioners are designed to use a compressor to cause pressure changes between two compartments and actively pump a refrigerant around A refrigerant is pumped into the cooled compartment where the low pressure causes the refrigerant to evaporate into a vapor taking heat with it In the other compartment the refrigerant vapour is compressed and forced through another heat exchange coil condensing into a liquid rejecting the heat previously absorbed from the cooled space

Air conditioning has no greater influence on health than heatingthat is to say very littlealthough poorly maintained air conditioning systems can occasionally promote the growth and spread of microorganisms such as Legionella pneumophila the infectious agent responsible for Legionnaires disease Air conditioning can have a positive effect on sufferers of allergies and asthma

In serious heat waves air conditioning can save the lives of the elderly Some local authorities even set up public cooling centers for the benefit of those without air conditioning at home

A branch is a part of a tree

Branch or branching could also mean

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed The law forms the basis of the principal of conservation of energy It follows from the law that when machines use energy the machines convert the energy from one kind energy to another Energy cannot be created and never goes away Energy just changes its form People can use the changes to do work that is useful

The law means that the total energy of the universe is a constant However energy can be transferred from one part of the universe to another 

The most common wording of the first law of thermodynamics used by scientists is

Because of this ambiguity it is very important in any discussion involving the first law to explicitly establish the sign convention in use

In physics the conservation of energy means that the total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant although it may change forms eg friction turns kinetic energy into thermal energy In thermodynamics the first law of thermodynamics is a statement of the conservation of energy for thermodynamic systems In short the law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be created or destroyed it can only be changed from one form to another such as when electrical energy is changed into heat energy 

From a mathematical point of view the energy conservation law is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time energy conservation is a result of the empirical fact that the laws of physics do not change with time itself Philosophically this can be stated as nothing depends on time per se

was conserved so long as the masses did not interact He called this quantity the vis viva or living force of the system The principle represents an accurate statement of the approximate conservation of kinetic energy in situations where there is no friction 

Meanwhile in 1843 James Prescott Joule independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments In the most famous now called the Joule apparatus a descending weight attached to a string caused a paddle immersed in water to rotate He showed that the gravitational potential energy lost by the weight in descending was equal to the thermal energy gained by the water by friction with the paddle

Over the period 1840 1843 similar work was carried out by engineer Ludwig A Colding though it was little known outside his native Denmark

Both Joules and Mayers work suffered from resistance and neglect but it was Joules that perhaps unjustly eventually drew the wider recognition

The Lepidoptera are often split into the two groups butterflies and moths Butterflies are a natural monophyletic group They are often placed in the suborder Rhopalocera which includes Papilionoidea Hesperiidae and Hedylidae In this taxonomic scheme moths belong to the suborder Heterocera Other taxonomic schemes have been proposed the most common putting the butterflies into the suborder Ditrysia and then the super family Papilionoidea and ignoring a classification for moths None of the taxonomic schemes is perfect however and taxonomists commonly argue over how to define the obvious differences between butterflies and moths

The most obvious difference is in the feelers or antennae Most butterflies have thin slender filamentous antennae which are club shaped at the end Moths on the other hand often have comb like or feathery antennae or filamentous and unclubbed This distinction is the basis for the earliest taxonomic divisions in the Lepidoptera  the Rhopalocera and the Heterocera 

There are however exceptions to this rule and a few moths have clubbed antennae Some butterflies like Pseudopontia paradoxa from the forests of central Africa lack the clubbed ends The Hesperiids often have an angle to the tip of the antenna

Many moths have a frenulum which is a filament arising from the hindwing and coupling with barbs on the forewing The frenulum can be observed only when a specimen is in hand Some moths have a lobe on the forewing called a jugum that helps in coupling with the hindwing Butterflies however lack these structures

Most moth caterpillars spin a cocoon made of silk within which they metamorphose into the pupal stage Most butterflies on the other hand form an exposed pupa which is also termed a chrysalis 

However there are many exceptions to this rule for example the Hawk moths form an exposed chrysalis which is underground Gypsy moths sometimes form butterfly style pupae hanging on twigs or tree bark although usually they create flimsy cocoons out of silk strands and a few leaves partially exposing the chrysalis A few Skipper butterfly larvae also make crude cocoons in which they pupate exposing the pupa a bit The Parnassius butterfly larvae make a flimsy cocoon for pupation and they pupate near the ground surface between debris

Most butterflies have bright colours on their wings Nocturnal moths on the other hand are usually plain brown grey white or black and often with obscuring patterns of zigzags or swirls which help camouflage them as they rest during the day However many day flying moths are brightly coloured particularly if they are toxic A few butterflies are quite plain like the Cabbage White butterfly

Moths tend to have stout and hairy or furry looking bodies Butterflies on the other hand have slender and smoother abdomens Moths have larger scales on their wings These make them look more dense and fluffy Butterflies on the other hand have fine scales This difference is possibly due to the need for moths to conserve heat during the cooler nights whereas butterflies are able to absorb solar radiation

Most moths are nocturnal or crepuscular while most butterflies are diurnal There are however exceptions including the diurnal Gypsy moth and the spectacular Uraniidae or Sunset moths

Monophyly means common descent from a single ancestor Biologists have introduced a kind of taxonomy called cladistics The aim of this is to make biological classification fit what we know about the way organisms evolved

If there is a group made of a common ancestor and all its descendants that group is monophyletic 

Example all species in the genus Homo have come from the same ancestral form in the family Hominidae and no other descendants are known Thus the genus Homo is monophyletic 

If on the other hand it were discovered that Homo habilis had developed from a different ancestor from Homo sapiens and this ancestor were not included in the genus then the genus would be polyphyletic Since biologists by and large tend to prefer monophyletic groups in this case they would likely either split the genus or broaden it to include the additional forms

Example of polyphyletic group Sea slugs 

Sometimes taxonomists are frustrated fitting plant species into a monophyletic group because of polyploidy There is clear evidence that some polyploid plant species are of multiple origins For example Salsify the hybrid goats beard has formed as many as 20 times in eastern Washington

Also it can happen that hybrids between two close plant species undergo polyploidy and the polyploids continue as a new and distinct species Situations like this are outside the normal rules of descent and are dealt with by special decisions guided by the International Commission of Botanical Nomenclature

The order Lepidoptera is the second biggest order in the class Insecta It includes the butterflies moths and skippers Members of the order are called lepidopterans A person who collects or studies this order is called a Lepidopterist This order has more than 180000 species in 128 families and 47 superfamilies The order Coleoptera is the only order that has more species The name Lepidoptera comes from the Ancient Greek words broken wikt link and broken wikt link

Lepidopterans go through complete metamorphosis This means that they have a four parts of their life The first part is the egg The second part is the caterpillar or larva The third part is the pupa The last part is the adult or imago

The larvae have a tough head and a soft body They have mouths that are made to chew Some larvae are covered with hairs or other body extensions The larvae have three pairs of small legs on the thorax These legs are called true legs There are up to five pairs of bigger legs on the abdomen These legs are called prolegs Lepidopteran larvae can be confused with the larvae of sawflies The difference between Lepidopteran larvae and sawfly larvae is that Lepidopteran larvae have tiny hooks on their prolegs These hooks are called crochets Most larvae are herbivores but a few are carnivores and detritivores

Adults have two pairs of wings They are covered by small scales In some species the adults have very small wings or no wings at all This is more common in females Adults have antennae Some moths have antennae that look like feathers These feather like antennae are larger in males than females Adults have a mouth part called a proboscis It is made for broken wikt linksuckingsucking nectar from flowers Some adults do not have mouths and cannot feed Others have different mouths that are made to pierce and suck blood or fruit juices

Animals that are active during the day are called diurnal They hunt or feed during the day and sleep during the night Nocturnal animals do it the other way round

Scientists sometimes use the word crepuscular to describe nocturnal animals that are not active when it is very dark at night they are mostly active near dawn dusk and sometimes when the moon makes a lot of light

The Skippers are a group of insects in the order Lepidoptera classified in the superfamily Hesperioidea which includes only one family the Hesperiidae

Skippers differ in several important ways from the remaining butterflies which are classified in the superfamily Papilionoidea and the neotropical superfamily Hedyloidea Collectively these three groups of butterflies share several characteristics especially in the egg larval and pupal stage However skippers have the antennae clubs hooked backward like a crochet The other butterflies have club like tips to their antennae and hedylids have feathered or pectinate antennae which give them an even more moth like appearance than skippers Skippers also have generally stockier bodies than the other two groups with stronger wing muscles Hesperioidea is very likely the sister group of Papilionoidea and together with Hedyloidea constitute a natural group or clade

There are about 3400 species of Skippers They are usually classified in the following subfamilies

Note Some authorities treat the Giant Skippers as a separate family the Megathymidae but more modern classifications place them within the subfamily Hesperiinae in the family Hesperiidae

Many species of skippers look frustratingly alike For example some species in the genera Erynnis Hesperia and Amblyscirtes cannot currently be distinguished in the field by experts the only reliable method of telling them apart involving dissection and examination of the genitalia

Examples include

Energy conservation means to reduce the quantity of energy that is used for different purposes This practice may result in increase of financial capital environmental value national and personal security and human comfort

Individuals and organizations that are direct consumers of energy may want to conserve energy in order to reduce energy costs and promote economic political and environmental sustainability Industrial and commercial users may want to increase efficiency and thus maximize profit

On a larger scale energy conservation is an important element of energy policy In general energy conservation reduces the energy consumption and energy demand per capita This reduces the rise in energy costs and can reduce the need for new power plants and energy imports The reduced energy demand can provide more flexibility in choosing the most preferred methods of energy production

By reducing emissions energy conservation is an important method to prevent climate change Energy conservation makes it easier to replace non renewable resources with renewable energy Energy conservation is often the most economical solution to energy shortages

The US is currently the largest consumer of energy although at current levels of growth it is possible that in the future China could become the leading energy consumer The US Department of Energy categorizes national energy use in four broad sectors transportation residential commercial and industrial

Energy usage in the transportation and residential sectors is largely controlled by individual domestic consumers Commercial and industrial energy usage are controlled by businesses National energy policy has a significant effect on energy usage across all four sectors

The transportation sector includes all vehicles used for personal or freight transportation Of the energy used in this sector approximately 65 is consumed by gasoline powered vehicles primarily personally owned Diesel powered transport consumes about 20 and air traffic consumes most of the remaining 15

The oil supply crises of the 1970s spurred the creation in 1975 of the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy program which required auto manufacturers to meet progressively higher fleet fuel economy targets The next decade saw dramatic improvements in fuel economy mostly the result of reductions in vehicle size and weight These gains eroded somewhat after 1990 due to the growing popularity of sport utility vehicles pickup trucks and minivans which fall under the more lenient light truck CAFE standard 

In addition to the CAFE program the US government has tried to encourage better vehicle efficiency through tax policy Since 2002 taxpayers have been eligible for income tax credits for gaselectric hybrid vehicles A gas guzzler tax has been assessed on manufacturers since 1978 for cars with exceptionally poor fuel economy While this tax remains in effect it currently generates very little revenue as overall fuel economy has improved

Another focus in gasoline conservation is reducing the number of miles driven An estimated 40 of American automobile use is associated with daily commuting Many urban areas offer subsidized public transportation to reduce commuting traffic and encourage carpooling by providing designated high occupancy vehicle lanes and lower tolls for cars with multiple riders

In recent years telecommuting has also become a viable alternative to commuting for some jobs but as of 2003 only 35 of workers were telecommuters Ironically hundreds of thousands of American and European workers have been replaced by workers in Asia who telecommute from thousands of miles away

A vehicles gas mileage normally decreases rapidly at speeds above 55 miles per hour A car or truck moving at 55 miles an hour can get about 15 percent better fuel economy than the same car going 65 mph According to the US Department of Energy as a rule of thumb each 5 mph you drive over 60 mph is similar to paying an additional 021 per gallon for gas

The residential sector refers to all private residences including single family homes apartments manufactured homes and dormitories Energy use in this sector varies significantly across the country due to regional climate differences and different regulation On average about half of the energy used in the US homes is expended on space conditioning 

The efficiency of furnaces and air conditioners has increased steadily since the energy crises of the 1970s The 1987 National Appliance Energy Conservation Act authorized the Department of Energy to set minimum efficiency standards for space conditioning equipment and other appliances each year based on what is technologically feasible and economically justified 

Despite technological improvements many American lifestyle changes have put higher demands on heating and cooling resources The average size of homes built in the United States has increased significantly from 1500 ft in 1970 to 2300 ft in 2005 The single person household has become more common as has central air conditioning 23 of households had central air conditioning in 1978 that figure rose to 55 by 2001 

As a cheaper alternative to the purchase of a new furnace or air conditioner most public utilities encourage smaller changes the consumer can make to lessen space conditioning usage Consumers have also been asked to adopt a wider indoor temperature range

Energy usage in some homes may vary widely from these averages In most residences no single appliance dominates and any conservation efforts must be directed to numerous areas in order to achieve substantial energy savings However Ground Source Heat Pump systems are the more energy efficient environmentally clean and cost effective space conditioning systems available and can achieve reductions in energy consumptions of up to 70

Current best practices in building design and construction result in homes that are much more energy conserving than average new homes See Passive house Superinsulation Self sufficient homes Zero energy building Earthship Straw bale construction MIT Design Advisor Energy Conservation Code for Indian Commercial Buildings

Smart ways to construct homes such that minimal resources are used to cooling and heating the house in summer and winter respectively can significantly reduce energy costs

The commercial sector consists of retail stores offices restaurants schools and other workplaces Energy in this sector has the same basic end uses as the residential sector in slightly different proportions Space conditioning is again the single biggest consumption area but it represents only about 30 of the energy use of commercial buildings Lighting at 25 plays a much larger role than it does in the residential sector Lighting is also generally the most wasteful component of commercial use A number of case studies indicate that more efficient lighting and elimination of over illumination can reduce lighting energy by approximately fifty percent in many commercial buildings

Commercial buildings can greatly increase energy efficiency by thoughtful design with todays building stock being very poor examples of the potential of systematic energy efficient design Commercial buildings often have professional management allowing centralized control and coordination of energy conservation efforts 

Solar heat loading through standard window designs usually leads to high demand for air conditioning in summer months An example of building design overcoming this excessive heat loading is the Dakin Building in Brisbane California where fenestration was designed to achieve an angle with respect to sun incidence to allow maximum reflection of solar heat this design also assisted in reducing interior over illumination to enhance worker efficiency and comfort

The industrial sector represents all production and processing of goods including manufacturing construction farming water management and mining Increasing costs have forced energy intensive industries to make substantial efficiency improvements in the past 30 years For example the energy used to produce steel and paper products has been cut 40 in that time frame while petroleumaluminum refining and cement production have reduced their usage by about 25 These reductions are largely the result of recycling waste material and the use of cogeneration equipment for electricity and heating

The energy required for delivery and treatment of fresh water often constitutes a significant percentage of a regions electricity and natural gas usage In light of this some local governments have worked toward a more integrated approach to energy and water conservation efforts 

Unlike the other sectors total energy use in the industrial sector has declined in the last decade While this is partly due to conservation efforts its also a reflection of the growing trend for US companies to move manufacturing operations offshore

The usage of telecommuting by major corporations is a significant opportunity to conserve energy as many Americans now work in service jobs that enable them to work from home instead of commuting to work each day 

Cogeneration is the use of a heat engine or a power station to make both electricity and useful heat at the same time

Conventional power plants emit the heat created as a byproduct of electricity generation into the environment through cooling towers as flue gas or by other means Combined heat and power captures the byproduct heat for domestic or industrial heating purposes either very close to the plant or  especially in Scandinavia and eastern Europe  for distribution through pipes to heat local housing 

Byproduct heat at moderate temperatures can also be used in absorption chillers for cooling A plant producing electricity heat and cold is sometimes called regeneration or more generally polygene ration plant 

Cogeneration is a thermodynamically efficient use of fuel In separate production of electricity some energy is lost as waste heat but in cogeneration this energy performs useful work

Thermal power plants and heat engines in general do not convert all of their available energy into electricity In most heat engines a bit more than half is wasted as excess heat By capturing the excess heat CHP uses heat that would be wasted in a conventional power plant potentially reaching an efficiency of up to 70 compared with at most 40 for the conventional plants This means that less fuel needs to be consumed to produce the same amount of useful energy Also less pollution is produced for a given economic benefit

An exact match between the heat and electricity needs rarely exists A CHP plant can either meet the need for heat or be run as a power plant with some use of its waste heat

CHP is most efficient when the heat can be used on site or very close to it Overall efficiency is reduced when the heat must be transported over longer distances This requires heavily insulated pipes which are expensive and inefficient whereas electricity can be transmitted along a comparatively simple wire and over much longer distances for the same energy loss

A car motor becomes a CHP plant in winter when the reject heat is useful for warming the interior of the vehicle This example scores the point that deployment of CHP depends on heat uses in the neighbourhood of the heat engine

Cogeneration plants are commonly found in district heating systems of big towns hospitals prisons oil refineries paper mills wastewater treatment plants thermal enhanced oil recovery wells and industrial plants with large heating needs 

Quakenbrck is a small town in Lower Saxony It has about 13000 inhabitants

The dew point is the temperature where water vapour condenses into liquid water

All air holds different amounts of water vapour The dew point shows the amount of moisture in the air The higher the dew point is the higher the level of moisture in the air at a given temperature The dew point of humid air will be higher than the dew point of dry air

Condensation of water vapour starts when the temperature of air is lowered to its dew point and beyond The dew point like other measures of humidity can be found from measurement taken by a hygrometer

Podgorica is the capital of Montenegro It has about 135000 inhabitants

Compressor could mean

Other pages 

A gas compressor is a mechanical device that increases the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume Compression of a gas naturally increases its temperature 

Compressors are similar to pumps both increase the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe As gases are compressible the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas Liquids are relatively incompressible so the main action of a pump is to transport liquids

There are many different types of gas compressors The two primary categories are

The more important types in each of the four sub categories are discussed below

Centrifugal compressors use a vaned rotating disk or impeller in a shaped housing to force the gas to the rim of the impeller increasing the velocity of the gas A diffuser section converts the velocity energy to pressure energy They are primarily used for continuous stationary service in industries such as oil refineries chemical and petrochemical plants and natural gas processing plants Their application can be from 100 hp to thousands of horsepower With multiple staging they can achieve extremely high output pressures greater than 10000 psi 

Many large snow making operations use this type of compressor They are also used in internal combustion engines as superchargers and turbochargers Centrifugal compressors are used in small gas turbine engines or as the final compression stage of medium sized gas turbines

Diagonal or mixed flow compressors are similar to centrifugal compressors but have a radial and axial velocity component at the exit from the rotor The diffuser is often used to turn diagonal flow to the axial direction The diagonal compressor has a lower diameter diffuser than the equivalent centrifugal compressor

Axial flow compressors use a series of fan like rotating rotor blades to progressively compress the gasflow Stationary stator vanes located downstream of each rotor redirect the flow onto the next set of rotor blades The area of the gas passage diminishes through the compressor to maintain a roughly constant axial Mach number Axial flow compressors are normally used in high flow applications such as medium to large gas turbine engines They are almost always multi staged Beyond about 41 design pressure ratio variable geometry is often used to improve operation

Reciprocating compressors use pistons driven by a crankshaft They can be either stationary or portable can be single or multi staged and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines Small reciprocating compressors from 5 to 30 horsepower are commonly seen in automotive applications and are typically for intermittent duty Larger reciprocating compressors up to 1000 hp are still commonly found in large industrial applications but their numbers are declining as they are replaced by various other types of compressors Discharge pressures can range from low pressure to very high pressure In certain applications such as air compression multi stage double acting compressors are said to be the most efficient compressors available and are typically larger noisier and more costly than comparable rotary units

Rotary screw compressors use two meshed rotating positive displacement helical screws to force the gas into a smaller space These are usually used for continuous operation in commercial and industrial applications and may be either stationary or portable Their application can be from 3 hp to over 500 hp and from low pressure to very high pressure They are commonly seen with roadside repair crews powering air tools This type is also used for many automobile engine superchargers because it is easily matched to the induction capacity of a piston engine

A scroll compressor also known as scroll pump and scroll vacuum pump uses two interleaved spiral like vanes to pump or compress fluids such as liquids and gases The vane geometry may be involute archimedean spiral or hybrid curves They operate more smoothly quietly and reliably than other types of compressors

Often one of the scrolls is fixed while the other orbits eccentrically without rotating thereby trapping and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between the scrolls

A diaphragm compressor is a variant of the conventional reciprocating compressor The compression of gas occurs by the movement of a flexible membrane instead of an intake element The back and forth movement of the membrane is driven by a rod and a crankshaft mechanism Only the membrane and the compressor box come in touch with the gas being compressed

Diaphragm compressors are used for hydrogen and compressed natural gas as well as in a number of other applications

Air compressors sold to and used by the general public are often attached on top of a tank for holding the pressurized air Oil lubricated and oil free compressors are available Oil free compressors are desirable because without a properly designed separator oil can make its way into the air stream For some purposes for example as a diving air compressor even a little oil in the air stream may be unacceptable

Charless law says when a gas is compressed temperature is raised There are three possible relationships between temperature and pressure in a volume of gas undergoing compression

Since compression generates heat the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal The inter stage coolers cause condensation meaning water separators with drain valves are present The compressor flywheel may drive a cooling fan

For instance in a typical diving compressor the air is compressed in three stages If each stage has a compression ratio of 7 to 1 the compressor can output 343 times atmospheric pressure

Gas compressors are used in various applications where either higher pressures or lower volumes of gas are needed 

Cash is a form of liquid currency such as banknotes or coins There is usually different sorts in every country

In bookkeeping and finance cash can also refer to checks money orders cashiers checks bank drafts or travelers checks In all these forms the term indicates the most liquid form of assets which have a fixed value and can be easily converted to currency ready money For example wages or salaries paid as cash would in most countries normally be paid with checks or direct bank deposits which are trivially convertible to currency

Heating could mean

Heating devices or systems

A heat engine is a device that converts heat into mechanical motion that can be used to do work Many kinds of real heat engines have been invented like the internal combustion engine that drives cars and the steam engine that once powered ships and trains Scientists called thermodynamists study heat engines and how they work 

In engineering and thermodynamics a heat engine converts heat energy to mechanical work by using the temperature difference between a hot source and a cold sink Heat is transferred from the source through the working body of the engine to the sink and in this process some of the heat changes into work by using the qualities of the gas or liquid inside the engine 

There are many kinds of Heat engines Each has a thermodynamic cycle Heat engines are often named after the thermodynamic cycle they use like the Carnot cycle They often pick up everyday names such as gasolinepetrol turbine or steam engines 

Some heat engines may generate heat inside the engine itself Others may absorb heat from an external source Heat engines can be open to the air or sealed and closed off to the outside 

When scientists study heat engines they come up with ideas for engines that cannot actually be built These are called ideal engines or cycles 

Real heat engines are often confused with the ideal engines or cycles they attempt to mimic 

Typically when describing the physical device the term engine is used When describing the ideal the term cycle is used 

One could say that the thermodynamic cycle is an ideal case of the mechanical engine One could equally say that the model does not quite perfectly match the mechanical engine However much benefit is gained from the simplified models and ideal cases they may represent

In general terms the larger the difference in temperature between the hot source and the cold sink the more efficient the cycle or engine On Earth the cold side of any heat engine is limited to the air temperature of the place where the engine is 

Most efforts to improve the efficiency of heat engines goes into increasing the temperature of the heat source but at very high temperatures the metal of the engine begins to go soft

The efficiency of various heat engines proposed or used today ranges from 3 percent for the OTEC ocean power proposal through 25 percent for most automotive engines to 45 percent for a supercritical coal plant to about 60 percent for a steam cooled combined cycle gas turbine All of these processes gain their efficiency due to the temperature drop across them 

The least efficient OTEC uses the temperature difference of ocean water on the surface and ocean water from the depths a small difference of perhaps 25 degrees Celsius and so the efficiency must be low 

The most efficient the combined cycle gas turbine burns natural gas to heat air to nearly 1530 degrees Celsius a large temperature difference of 1500 degrees Celsius and so the efficiency can be very large when the steam cooling cycle is added 

Examples of everyday heat engines include the steam engine the diesel engine and the gasoline engine in an automobile 

The stirling engine is less common but is found in small models which can run off the heat of a hand

A common toy that is also a heat engine is the drinking bird All of these familiar heat engines are powered by the expansion of heated gases 

A bimetalic strip is a device that converts temperature into mechanical movement and is used in thermostats to control temperature It is a heat engine that does not use a liquid or gas

A thermodynamic cycle is a series of thermodynamic processes which returns a system to its initial state Properties depend only on the thermodynamic state and thus do not change over a cycle Variables such as heat and work are not zero over a cycle but rather depend on the process The first law of thermodynamics dictates that the net heat input is equal to the net work output over any cycle The repeating nature of the process path allows for continuous operation making the cycle an important concept in thermodynamics 

If the cyclic process moves clockwise around the loop then it represents a heat engine and W will be positive If it moves counterclockwise then it represents a heat pump and W will be negative

Two primary classes of thermodynamic cycles are power cycles and heat pump cycles Power cycles are cycles which convert some heat input into a mechanical work output while heat pump cycles transfer heat from low to high temperatures using mechanical work input 

Thermodynamic power cycles are the basis for the operation of heat engines which supply most of the worlds electric power and run almost all motor vehicles Power cycles can be divided according to the type of heat engine they seek to model The most common cycles that model internal combustion engines are the Otto cycle which models gasoline engines and the Diesel cycle which models diesel engines Cycles that model external combustion engines include the Brayton cycle which models gas turbines and the Rankine cycle which models steam turbines

In thermodynamics a thermodynamic system originally called a working substance is defined as that part of the universe that is under consideration A real or imaginary boundary separates the system from the rest of the universe which is referred to as the environment or surroundings A useful classification of thermodynamic systems is based on the nature of the boundary and the quantities flowing through it such as matter energy work heat and entropy A system can be anything for example a cylinder a solution in a test tube a living organism or a planet etc

In general a piston is a lubricated sliding shaft that fits tightly inside the opening of a cylinder Its purpose is to change the volume enclosed by the cylinder to exert a force on a fluid inside the cylinder to cover and uncover ports or some combination of these A rubber seal is sometimes used to keep the lubricate within the shaft Due to the constant motion of the machine this seal wears quickly and should be replaced with every servicing If the seal should break during usage there can be disastrous long lasting consequences for the machine 

There are two ways that a piston engine can transform combustion into motive power These are two stroke and four stroke

A single cylinder two stroke engine produces power every crankshaft revolution while a single cylinder four stroke engine produces power once every two revolutions Older designs of small two stroke engines produced more pollution than four stroke engines However modern two stroke designs like the Vespa ET2 Injection utilise fuel injection and are as clean as four strokes Large diesel two stroke engines as used in ships and locomotives have always used fuel injection and produce low emissions One of the biggest internal combustion engines in the world the Wrtsil Sulzer RTA96 C is a two stroke it is bigger than most two story houses has pistons nearly 1 metre in diameter and is one of the most efficient mobile engines in existence In theory a four stroke engine has to be larger than a two stroke engine to produce an equivalent amount of power Two stroke engines are becoming less common in developed countries these days mainly due to manufacturer reluctance to invest in reducing two stroke emissions Traditionally two stroke engines were reputed to need more maintenance Even though the simplest two stroke engines have fewer moving parts they could wear out faster than four stroke engines However fuel injected two strokes achieve better engine lubrication and cooling and reliability should improve considerably

A steam engine is another type of piston engine In most steam engines the pistons are double acting steam is alternately admitted to either end of the cylinder so that every piston stroke produces power

A banknote is a paper by which a bank promises to pay to the bearer on demand Along with coins banknotes make up the cash forms of all modern money Coins are generally used for lower valued monetary units and banknotes for higher values

Originally the value of money was determined by the value of the material the money was made of such as silver or gold However carrying around a lot of precious metal was cumbersome and often dangerous As an alternative banknotes would be issued In financial terms a note is a promise to pay someone money Banknotes were originally a promise to pay the bearer an amount of precious metal stored in a vault somewhere In this way the stored value backing the banknote could transfer ownership in exchange for goods or services

In Europe the first paper money consisted of paper coins issued in Protestant Leyden in the Netherlands during the Spanish siege of 1574 Over 5000 of the estimated 14000 residents of Leyden died mostly due to starvation Even leather was boiled and used to feed the people So to create currency the residents took covers and paper from hymnals and church missives and created paper planchets which were struck using the same dies that were previously used to mint coins 

The first proper European banknotes were issued by Stockholms Banco a predecessor of the Bank of Sweden in 1660 although the bank ran out of coins to redeem its notes in 1664 and ceased operating in that year

Emergency paper money hand written on playing cards was used in French Canada from 1685

In the early 1690s the Massachusetts Bay Colony was the first of the colonies to issue the permanently circulating banknotes The use of fixed denominations and printed banknotes came into use in the 18th century 

In the United States public acceptance of banknotes in replacement of precious metals was hastened in part by Executive Order 6102 This order carried the threat of a maximum 10000 fine and a maximum of ten years in prison for anyone who kept more than 100 of gold in preference to bank notes Similar measures were taken worldwide with similar results

A common cold is a viral infectious disease It affects the breathing like the nose and the throat A person who has a cold might sneeze cough or have a running nose Those things are called symptoms There is currently no way to cure a common cold There are drugs that can stop the symptoms though It is one of the most common diseases today

A good way to not get the disease is to wash hands often with soap Antibacterial soaps have no effect on the virus but the action of washing will scrub the viruses away

The virus can affect breathing and taste by swelling the blood vessels in your nose If the nose is blocked tasting food can become hard The virus can affect you in many ways

Some treatments for cold symptoms are

I perviously nominiated myself for adminship last June but I decided to re run for adminship Currently I have more than 2154 edits and has been in the simplewiki for a very long time My reasons to request for adminship are still similar as the ones I had in the past I am now more familiar with simplewikis policies than before and is one of simplewikis top 20 most active editors Cheers   Snake311 0544 23 September 2007

Candidates acceptance Self nominiation  Snake311 0545 23 September 2007

I feel more that perplexed reading this  also after looking at your deleted edits it appears that you have explanation of vote Unless I was not informed about the sysop vote being a cooptation one it should be forbidden to use such an argumentation ONaNcle 1903 28 September 2007

Nothing is forbidden in an explanation Explanations arent even needed She is saying that there are only a few times where he would have quick deleted a page himself I guess I dont otherwise understand what you mean   BrownE34 talk contribs 1932 28 September 2007

This is a very trustworthy user who I believe can do a much better job helping this Wikipedia with the Admin tools I once asked him to QD a page and relized he didnt so thats what made me Spiderpig0001 decide to nominate Barliner Spiderpig0001 Does whatever a spiderpig does 2302 21 September 2007

Candidates acceptance

Barliner was just nominated on September 15th He declined the nomination based on not meeting the guidelines Nothing has realy changed significantly in the week since then It is advisable to wait atleast a month before re nominating  Creol 0453 22 September 2007

Do you think you have sufficient knowledge of IP addresses proxies etc to be able to fulfil this role well Majorly 0014 19 September 2007

I would like to nominiate Barliner for adminship as he has been very helpful to the wiki by helping to improve many articles as well as creating many templates Out of his 2011 edits Barliner is very active in contribtuing to Wikipedia and is generous to other users He has also shown some potential to be qualified as a sysop and that I think he would not abuse sysop tools Peace   Snake311 0145 16 September 2007

Candidates acceptance No I would be happy to serve as administrator but I do not qualify under RfA guidelines as I only joined simple on July 28

Ends on September 7 2007

To all my fellow Wikipedians I am looking for access to the admins tools at the moment to make this a better place I am on here most days fighting vandals when I could be making good edits to the encyclopedia I am asking for the tools so I do not have to wait for a admin to come on to have vandal action taken and so I can better help everyone here I have 247 edits at this time and am prepared to do everything I am asked to do that is within policy Thank You  Spiderpig0001 Does whatever a spiderpig does 1228 31 August 2007

If I feel they are ready for the stress and insults thrown at them and Do you realise how dedicated you must be as an admin I know I didnt when I nominated myself Right now youre in the shallow half of the swimming pool As an admin you will be thrown into the deep end

Being an admin here isnt the same as what it was when I was promoted Back then it was what we advertised it as  extra tabs and maybe occasionally the odd email from users requesting help Now its difficult Administrators here now have to face insults and threats from all kinds of people and it is very stressful Imagine the worst people that target the English Wikipedia  they want to cause as much disruption as possible So they come over here to another English project that they can read and we only have 14 active admins rather than the hundreds that they have Administrators here have to try and spot these people before they can cause massive problems and it can be difficult sometimes Being an admin is definitely rewarding but ask yourself are you ready for it Archer7  talk 2316 23 August 2007

Zenwalk or Zenwalk Linux is a Linux distribution started by Jean Philippe Guillemin It was at first based on Slackware Since its creation the distribution has become very different from Slackware while still still being able to use its binary packages Zenwalk aims to be a Linux distribution with many uses by focusing on Internet applications multimedia and programming tools

The Zenwalk Project aims to create a Linux operating system that can be used on old and slow computers through the use of the latest software available for a stable release optimization for a specific processor architecture to increase execution speed and introduces a very powerful package management system with dependency resolution

There are four main versions of Zenwalk

Zenwalk is a distribution aimed at mainstream desktop use Designed to be a stand alone operating system it installs to the hard drive by way of a ncurses based installer It includes all of the officially released software packages that are deemed most useful for their tasks This collection may change with every release

Zenwalk Core is a Zenwalk system built with customization in mind Released with no X Window System binaries its aim is to allow a skilled user to build a system fit for his or her needs The projects lead developer is Emmanuel Bailleul

ZenLive is a Zenwalk system built on a Live CD design ZenLive follows the progress made by the full Zenwalk system closely thus mirroring the version number and attempts to stay true to the original distributions goals In addition it includes all of the necessary libraries and applications to develop and compile software a particularly rare feature in Live CD distributions Project members include Pierrick Le Brun creator Mauricio Tricoli project lead and Michael Verret artwork

Zenserver is a Zenwalk Core derived system specifically designed for servers The main goals are to create a secure reliable easy to use easy to configure expandable and dependable server operating system in the best Zenwalk tradition The distribution development team is led by Teran McKinney

There are currently four Zenwalk based distributions

In thermal physics thermal energy is the type of energy that has a system that increases with its temperature In thermodynamics thermal energy is the internal energy present in a system in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium because of its temperature That is heat is defined as a spontaneous flow of energy from one object to another caused by a difference in temperature between two objects so objects do not possess heat

In thermodynamics a thermodynamic system is said to be in thermodynamic equilibrium when it is in thermal equilibrium mechanical equilibrium radiative equilibrium and chemical equilibrium The local state of a system at thermodynamic equilibrium is determined by the values of its intensive parameters as pressure temperature etc Specifically thermodynamic equilibrium is characterized by the minimum of a thermodynamic potential

Thermodynamic potentials are very useful when calculating the equilibrium results of a chemical reaction or when measuring the properties of materials in a chemical reaction The chemical reactions usually take place under some simple constraints such as constant pressure and temperature or constant entropy and volume and when this is true there is a corresponding thermodynamic potential which comes into play Just as in mechanics the system will tend towards lower values of potential and at equilibrium under these constraints the potential will take on an unchanging minimum value The thermodynamic potentials can also be used to estimate the total amount of energy available from a thermodynamic system under the appropriate constraint

When expressed as a percentage the thermal efficiency must be between 0 and 100 Due to inefficiencies such as friction heat loss and other factors thermal efficiencies are typically much less than 100 For example a typical gasoline automobile engine operates at around 25 thermal efficiency and a large coal fueled electrical generating plant peaks at about 36 In a combined cycle plant thermal efficiencies are approaching 60

For example when 1000 joules of thermal energy is transformed into 300 joules of mechanical energy the thermal efficiency is 30

So for a boiler that produces 210 kW output for each 300 kW heat equivalent input its thermal efficiency is 210300 070 or 70 This means that the 30 of the energy is lost to the environment

The thermal efficiency is sometimes called the energy efficiency In the United States in everyday usage the SEER is the more common measure of energy efficiency for cooling devices as well as for heat pumps when in their heating mode For energy conversion heating devices their peak steady state thermal efficiency is often stated eg this furnace is 90 efficient but a more detailed measure of seasonal energy effectiveness is the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency

In physics mechanical work is the amount of energy transferred by a force Like energy it is a scalar quantity with SI units of joules Heat conduction is not considered to be a form of work since there is no macroscopically measurable force only microscopic forces occurring in atomic collisions In the 1830s the French mathematician Gaspard Gustave Coriolis coined the term work for the product of force and distance

A thermodynamic state is the macroscopic condition of a thermodynamic system as described by its particular thermodynamic parameters The state of any thermodynamic system can be described by a set of thermodynamic parameters such as temperature pressure density composition independently of its surroundings or history 

The parameters required to specify the state depend on the characteristics of the system There is an optimal ensemble of parameters that uniquely specify the state and all other parameters can be derived from these The state postulate says that the state of a simple compressible system is completely specified by two independent intensive properties

Thermal physics is the combined study of thermodynamics statistical mechanics and kinetic theory This umbrella subject is typically designed for physics students and functions to provide a general introduction to each of three core heat related subjects Other authors however define thermal physics loosely as a summation of only thermodynamics and statistical mechanics

Thermal physics generally speaking is the study of the statistical nature of physical systems from an energetic perspective Starting with the basics of heat and temperature thermal physics analyzes the first law of thermodynamics and second law of thermodynamics from the statistical perspective in terms of the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate In addition the concept of entropy is studied via quantum theory

A central topic in thermal physics is the canonical probability distribution The electromagnetic nature of photons and phonons are studied which show that the oscillations of electromagnetic fields and of crystal lattices have much in common Waves form a basis for both provided one incorporates quantum theory

Other topics studied in thermal physics include chemical potential the quantum nature of an ideal gas ie in terms of fermions and bosons Bose Einstein condensation Gibbs free energy Helmholtz free energy chemical equilibrium phase equilibrium the equipartition theorem entropy at absolute zero and transport processes as mean free path viscosity and conduction

There are two types of thermodynamic instruments the meter and the reservoir A thermodynamic meter is any device which measures any parameter of a thermodynamic system In some cases the thermodynamic parameter is actually defined in terms of an idealized measuring instrument For example the zeroth law states that if two bodies are in thermodynamic equilibrium with a third body they are also in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other This principle as noted by James Maxwell in 1872 asserts that it is possible to measure temperature An idealized thermometer is a sample of an ideal gas at constant pressure 

A thermodynamic reservoir is a system which is so large that it does not appreciably alter its state parameters when brought into contact with the test system 

It is important that these two types of instruments are distinct A meter does not perform its task accurately if it behaves like a reservoir of the state variable it is trying to measure If for example a thermometer were to act as a temperature reservoir it would alter the temperature of the system being measured and the reading would be incorrect Ideal meters have no effect on the state variables of the system they are measuring

Statistical mechanics is the application of probability theory which includes mathematical tools for dealing with large populations to the field of mechanics which is concerned with the motion of particles or objects when subjected to a force

It provides a framework for relating the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic or bulk properties of materials that can be observed in everyday life therefore explaining thermodynamics as a natural result of statistics and mechanics at the microscopic level In particular it can be used to calculate the thermodynamic properties of bulk materials from the spectroscopic data of individual molecules

This ability to make macroscopic predictions based on microscopic properties is the main asset of statistical mechanics over thermodynamics Both theories are governed by the second law of thermodynamics through the medium of entropy However entropy in thermodynamics can only be known empirically whereas in statistical mechanics it is a function of the distribution of the system on its micro states

Kinetic theory or kinetic theory of gases attempts to explain overall properties of gases such as pressure temperature or volume by considering their molecular composition and motion The theory basically states that pressure is not caused by molecules pushing each other away like earlier scientists thought Instead pressure is caused by the molecules colliding with each other and their container Kinetic theory is also known as kinetic molecular theory or collision theory

There are three main components to kinetic theory

Frik was an Armenian poet who lived in the 13th and 14th centuries at the time of Mongolian control over Armenia

Yeghishe Charents was an Armenian poet killed in Stalins purges

From 1904 to 1912 Yeghishe Soghomonian he was at school in Kars Amid the upheavals of the First World War and the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire he volunteered in 1915 for the Caucasian Front In 1917 1918 he was in Karin Erzurum during the bitter fighting Some of his experiences would later appear in his poetry Yeghishe Charents one of the nations favourite poets  a famous philanderer who apparently sought the USSR Kremlins favours  produced a now famous poem called The Message Its praise of Uncle Joe might grind the average set of teeth down to the gum it included the following A new light shone on the world It is only this sunlightWhich for centuries will stay alive And more of the same Undiscovered by the USSR Kremlins censors for many months however Charents had used the first letter of each line to frame a quite different message which read O Armenian people your only salvation is in the power of your unity Whoops Like the distant Mount Ararat it was a brave hopeless symbol as doomed as it was impressive Yeghishe Charents was disappeared by the NKVD in 1937 after being denounced by the architect Alexsandr Tamanyan  now hard at work building Yerevans new Stalinist opera house  the moment Yeghishe Charents schoolboy prank was spotted Then Alexsandr Tamanyan fell from the roof of his still unfinished opera house and even today Armenians  with their Arab like desire to believe in  the plot  ask the obvious questions

Kars is a city in northeast Turkey and is the capital of the Kars Province before at the head of a sanjak in the Turkish vilayet of Erzurum Population 8672 20891 54000 142145 130361

The early history of Kars is little known beyond that it had its own dynasty of Armenian rulers and was the capital of a region known as Vanand At some point in the 9th century it became part of the territory of the Armenian Bagratids For a short time Kars became the capital of their kingdom It was during this period that the Cathedral later known as the Church of the Apostles was built

Kars is a province of Turkey located in the northeastern part of the country It shares part of its border with the Republic of Armenia 

From 1878 until 1917 most of the present day Turkish province of Kars was part of the Russian oblast of Kars 

In 1919 and 1920 the province came under the control of the Democratic Republic of Armenia as the Vanand province Its territory was ceded to Turkey by the Soviet Union in the Treaty of Kars 

Kars province is divided into 8 districts each named after the administrative center of the district

There are 383 villages in Kars

Manvel Gamburyan is a mixed martial artist with a history in judo Manvel was chosen as a participant on the reality show The Ultimate Fighter 5 He fights on Jens Pulvers team Manny defeated Noah Thomas in the preliminary round

In May 1991 Manvels family relocated from Armenia to United States Shortly after his arrival Manvel began training in judo at Gokor Chivichyans Hayastan MMA Academy and quickly became one of the top judokas in the country winning junior nationals less than two years later He went on to win junior nationals eight times the junior Olympics once and was a member of the 2000 judo junior world team

Fanta is a yellow lemonade It was introduced in Germany in 1940 Fanta was created during World War II in Nazi Germany by the German Coca Cola bottling company Because of the war there was no shipping between Nazi Germany and the United States Therefore the German bottling plant could no longer get Coca Cola syrup The CEO of the plant Max Keith needed to do something to keep the plant going He came up with a fruit flavored drink made from whatever he could find Using apple fiber left over from cider presses and whey a byproduct from cheese manufacture Fanta was created and became quite popular The original German Fanta had a yellow color and a different flavor from that of Fanta Orange the exact flavor varied throughout the war depending on what ingredients were available

The name Fanta came during an employee contest to name the new beverage Keith told them to let their Fantasie run wild On hearing that salesman Joe Knipp spontaneously arrived upon the name Fanta

After the war Fanta was introduced to the United States by Coca Cola and in 1960 they bought the trademark Fanta Orange is the most popular Fanta flavor It is available in 180 countries In terms of volume Brazil is the largest consumer of Fanta in the world Fanta is more popular in Europe and South America than in the United States

There are over 70 different flavors worldwide Most of them are only available by region in some countries For example in Romania there is Fanta Shokata based on the traditional Romanian drink Socat This drink is made from elderflower In Switzerland and previously the Netherlands the local fruit blackcurrant is used to produce Fanta as well Some identical flavors have different names in different markets The classic orange for example was renamed Fanta Funky Orange in 2003 for the Nordic countries and Belgium while other countries retain the older Fanta Orange brand As of the year 2005 the Fanta brand has been connected with the word Bambaacha which is often seen in the Fanta commercials TaB diet Cola was originally produced by the Fanta division of Coca cola It was available in a variety of non cola flavors as well Later in 2005 Fanta branched out into new Fanta Zero varieties in Great Britain

In some non technical contexts or in jargon parameter may simply be a synonym for criterion

In mathematics statistics and the mathematical sciences parameters are quantities that define certain relatively constant characteristics of systems or functions 

Most commonly represented in general form other symbols carry standard specific meanings When evaluating the function over a domain or determining the response of the system over a period of time the independent variables are modulated while the parameters are held constant The function or system may then be reevaluated or reprocessed with different parameters to give a function or system with different behavior 

Loosely speaking the term parameter is used for an argument which is intermediate in status between a variable and a constant

Suppose that you and a friend are both working for the same boss making the same money working the same hours that the formula would become

In engineering the term parameter sometimes loosely refers to an individual measured item For example an airliner flight data recorder may record 88 different items each termed a parameter This usage is not consistent as sometimes the term channel refers to an individual measured item with parameter referring to the setup information about that channel

Speaking generally properties are those physical quantities which directly describe the physical attributes of the system parameters are those combinations of the properties which suffice to determine the response of the system Properties can have all sorts of dimensions depending upon the system being considered parameters are dimensionless or have the dimension of time or its reciprocal John D Trimmer 1950 Response of Physical Systems p 13

The term can also be used in engineering contexts however as it is typically used in the physical sciences

Agavaceae is a family of plants Many of these plants grow in dry hot climates Some grow in the desert Well known plants of this family are the agave yucca and Joshua tree The family includes about 550 600 species in around 18 genera It is widespread in the tropical subtropical and warm temperate regions of the world

It is not quite clear how large the family really is There are genera which some biologists leave out of the family This includes for example Cordyline and Dracaena which are sometimes separated off into a separate family Dracaenaceae Recent research has tended to incorporate these into a larger family Ruscaceae though Nolina Beaucarnea and Dasylirion are sometimes recognized as Nolinaceae or placed in Ruscaceae Conversely data from molecular systematics now suggest that Agavaceae should be broadened to include a number of genera previously classified elsewhere Among them are Chlorogalum Camassia and the family Anthericaceae This would enlarge the family with anything up to 22 genera The Angiosperm Phylogeny Groups APG II classification places Agavaceae along with a number of other families in an expanded family Asparagaceae However APG II allows the alternative of keeping some of these families including Agavaceae separate In this case it recommends expanding the family to include the genera currently classified in Anemarrhenaceae Anthericaceae Behniaceae and Herreriaceae Most references have retained Agavaceae as a family distinct from Asparagaceae Hesperocallis sometimes placed in its own family Hesperocallideaceae has recently been shown to be closely related and its inclusion in Agavaceae has been recommended

Some species are succulent In general Agavaceae leaves occur as rosettes at the end of a woody stem which may range from extremely short to tree like heights as in the Joshua tree The leaves are parallel veined and usually appear long and pointed often with a hardened spine on the end and sometimes with additional spines along the margins

Succulent plants are plants that have adapted to very dry climates They have adapted in such a way that they can store water either in their leaves stems or roots Very often they look different than plants that do not do this Their leaves may look more fleshy A very good example of succulents are the cacti Almost all cacti are succulents Not all succulents are cacti though Other plant families with this property are the agavaceae Azioaceae and Crassulaceae Other well known succulents are the Aloe and the Bottle tree

The term Oriental Orthodoxy means the group of Eastern Christian Churches that accept only the first three ecumenical councils the First Council of Nicaea the First Council of Constantinople and the Council of Ephesus and do not accept the dogmatic definitions of the Council of Chalcedon These Churches are also called Old Oriental Churches Oriental Orthodox churches are different from the churches that call themselves Eastern Orthodoxy

The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria is considered the spiritual leader of the Oriental Orthodox ChurchesfactdateApril 2009 The spiritual leadership is not understood in the same sense as among the Eastern Orthodox Churches to the Church of Constantinople but it is in the spirit of respect and honour for the Apostolic Throne of Alexandria It does not give any special rights to the Church of Alexandria

The schism between Great Church Orthodox and Catholic and the Oriental Orthodox Churches happened in the 5th century after the Council of Chalcedon

Lu Xun was a general in Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period in ancient China

He showed his skills by helping defeat Guan Yu with the Wei army Sun Quan saw his potential and promoted him to main strategist in the Wu army after the death of Lu Meng He showed his talents at Yiling where his tactics and fire attack lead Wu to victory He soon developed a name for himself when at Hefei castle his tactics crushed Wei and Cao Pi leaving only Shu and Liu Beis son Liu Chan alive who retreated and Wu gained full control of the land

The planet Jupiter has 63 moons 46 of these are less than 3km wide and probably used to be asteroids before Jupiters gravity pulled them in The four biggest moons are called the Galilean moons because they were discovered by the famous Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei These four are Io Europa Ganymede and Callisto They are roughly the same size as Earths moon some are a bit bigger some are smaller

Here is a list of all 63 of Jupiters moons It starts with those that go around Jupiter the fastest or have the shortest orbital period 

The planet Saturn has 53 named moons and another nine which are still being studied Many of the moons are very small 33 are less than convert10kmmi0lkoffabbron in diameter and 13 moons are less than convert50kmmi0lkoffabbron Many of the moons are named after Titans giants or minor Greek or Roman gods Some of Saturns moons are very large the moon Titan is bigger than the planet Mercury

This list of Saturns moons is in order of how long they take to orbit or go around Saturn

Vande Mataram is the national song of India It is not to be confused with the national anthem of India The lyrics were written by Bankim Chandra Chatterji in a mix of Sanskrit and Bengali The song was written in 1876 but published in 1882 The title means Long live the Motherland The first version of the Flag of India had  written on it 

Jana Gana Mana was chosen over Vande Mataram as the National Anthem of independent India in January 24 1950 although before this date Vande Mataram was treated as such Vande Mataram was rejected because Muslims offended by calling India Mother Durga equating the nation with Hinduism and by its origin as part of Anandamatha a book they felt had an anti Muslim message

Over thy branches and lordly streams

Clad in thy blossoming trees

Mother giver of ease

Laughing low and sweet

Mother I kiss thy feet

Speaker sweet and low

Mother to thee I bow 

Who hath said thou art weak in thy lands

When swords flash out in seventy million hands

And seventy million voices roar

Thy dreadful name from shore to shore

With many strengths who art mighty and stored

To thee I call Mother and Lord

Thou who saves arise and save

To her I cry who ever her foe drove

Back from plain and sea

And shook herself free

Thou art wisdom thou art law

Thou art heart our soul our breath

Though art love divine the awe

In our hearts that conquers death

Thine the strength that nerves the arm

Thine the beauty thine the charm

Every image made divine

In our temples is but thine

Thou art Durga Lady and Queen

With her hands that strike and her

swords of sheen

Thou art Lakshmi lotus throned

And the Muse a hundred tone

Pure and perfect without peer

Mother lend thine ear 

Rich with thy hurrying streams

Bright with thy orchard gleems

Dark of hue O candid fair 

In thy soul with jewelled hair 

And thy glorious smile divine 

Loveliest of all earthly lands 

Showering wealth from well stored hands 

Mother mother mine

Mother sweet I bow to thee

Mother great and free

This is a list of the 27 moons of Uranus They are listed by how long they take to orbit Uranus They are all named after characters created by William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope

Neptune has a total of 13 moons The largest moon is Triton which was discovered by William Lassell just seventeen days after Neptune was found Then it took one hundred years later to find the second moon Nereid

Most of Neptunes moons are named after sea nymphs

Neptune has a lot of moons who have unusual orbits Triton which is the largest moon of Neptune orbits in a retrograde orbit

Two moons Psamathe and Neso are also unusual because they have the largest orbits for any moons discovered in the solar system so far They take about 25 years to make one orbit and are 125 times farther than how our Moon orbits away from Earth

Many astronomers and scientists think that Neptunes inner moons were not original bodies that formed with Neptune but were instead remains of debris from Triton that slowly built up together Other scientists think that when Triton was captured by Neptune Tritons mass and odd orbit caused Neptunes original moons to be destroyed by gravity only to be reformed after Triton formed a stable orbit

While many astronomers also agree that Triton was not an original moon of Neptune some think that Triton was captured in a three body encounter What must have happened was that Triton was part of a binary pair1 with another unknown celestial body The pair was then captured by Triton survived and the other object being affected by Neptunes gravity

Another possible event had Halimede which was discovered in 2002 was thought to been originally a piece of Nereid when the moon was possibly hit with another object since both moons seemed to have the same gray colors Also Halimede was also calculated that the moon had a high chance of colliding with Nereid in the past

1Binary pairs are two astronomical objects orbiting closely to each other

The Neptunian moons are listed here by its orbital period from shortest to longest Triton which is not only massive enough for its surface to have collapsed into a sphere but is comparable in size to our own moon is highlighted in purple Irregular moons are shown in grey prograde in light grey and retrograde in dark grey

The picture at the right shows the orbits of Neptunes irregular moons discovered so far The eccentricity of the orbits is represented by the yellow segments with the inclination represented on Y axis The satellites above the X axis are prograde the satellites beneath are retrograde The X axis is labelled in Gm and the fraction of the Hill spheres radius

Given the similarity of their orbits it was suggested that Neso and Psamathe could have a common origin in the break up of a larger moon

Triton the biggest moon following a retrograde but a quasi circular orbit also thought to be a captured satellite is not shown Nereid on a prograde but very eccentric orbit is believed to be scattered during Tritons capture

Some asteroids also have the same names as moons of Neptune 74 Galatea 1162 Larissa

Note that Triton did not have an official name until the twentieth century Although the name was suggested in 1880 by Camille Flammarion it did not come into regular use until at least the 1930s Usually it was simply known as the satellite of Neptune

The king is the most valuable chess piece in a game of chess It can move left right up down or diagonally It can only move one square at a time When recording chess games king is shortened to K

The object of the game is to checkmate If a players king is attacked by an opponents piece it is called check The player with the attacked king must move so that the king is no longer in check If the king cannot do this it is in checkmate and that side loses the game

With a rook the king may make a special move called castling This is when the king moves two squares toward one of its rooks and then the rook is placed on the other side of the king Castling consists of moving the king two squares on its first rank toward either one of the first rooks then moving the rook onto the square over which the king crossed Castling is only allowed when the king nor the castling rook has moved already when no squares between them are occupied when the king is not in check and when the king will not move across or end its movement on a square that puts the king in check

If a players move places the opponents king under attack that king is in check and the player in check is made to stop the attack There are three possible ways to remove the king from check

If none of these three ways are possible the players king has been checkmated and the player with the checkmated king loses the game

A stalemate is when the player to move has no legal move but is not in check 

In the opening and middlegame the king will mostly not play an active role in the development of an attacking or defensive position Instead a player will usually castle and find safety on the edge of the board behind pawns In the endgame however the king may comes out of hiding to play an active role as an offensive piece as well as helping in the promotion of their remaining pawns 

In thermodynamics work is the quantity of energy transferred from one system to another without an accompanying transfer of entropy It is a generalization of the concept of mechanical work in mechanics In the SI system of measurement work is measured in joules The rate at which work is performed is power

Work ie weight lifted through a height was originally defined in 1824 by Sadi Carnot in his famous paper Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire Specifically according to Carnot

In 1845 the English physicist James Joule wrote a paper On the mechanical equivalent of heat for the British Association meeting in Cambridge In this work he reported his best known experiment in which the work released through the action of a weight falling through a height was used to turn a paddle wheel in an insulated barrel of water 

In this experiment the friction and agitation of the paddle wheel on the body of water caused heat to be generated which in turn increased the temperature of water Both the temperature change T of the water and the height of the fall h of the weight mg were recorded Using these values Joule was able to determine the mechanical equivalent of heat Joule estimated a mechanical equivalent of heat to be 819 ftlbfBtu The modern day definitions of heat work temperature and energy all have connection to this experiment

According to the First law of thermodynamics it is useful to separate changes to the internal energy of a thermodynamic system into two sorts of energy transfers Work refers to forms of energy transfer which can be accounted for in terms of changes in the macroscopic physical variables of the system for example energy which goes into expanding the volume of a system against an external pressure by driving a piston head out of a cylinder against an external force This is in contrast to heat energy which is carried into or out of the system in the form of transfers in the microscopic thermal motions of particles

The concept of thermodynamic work is slightly more general than that of mechanical work because it includes other types of energy transfers as well The electrical work required to move a charge against an external electrical field can be measured as can the work required to move heat against a temperature gradient Thermodynamic work need not have any mechanical component to be considered such

In thermodynamics the internal energy of a thermodynamic system or a body with well defined boundaries denoted by U or sometimes E is the total of the kinetic energy due to the motion of molecules and the potential energy associated with the vibrational and electric energy of atoms within molecules or crystals It includes the energy in all the chemical bonds and the energy of the free conduction electrons in metals 

The internal energy is a thermodynamic potential and for a closed thermodynamic system held at constant entropy it will be minimized

One can also calculate the internal energy of electromagnetic or blackbody radiation It is a state function of a system an extensive quantity The SI unit of energy is the joule although other historical conventional units are still in use such as the calorie for heat

Internal energy does not include the translational or rotational kinetic energy of a body as a whole It also does not include the relativistic mass energy equivalent E mc2 It excludes any potential energy a body may have because of its location in external gravitational or electrostatic field although the potential energy it has in a field due to an induced electric or magnetic dipole moment does count as does the energy of deformation of solids

The principle of equipartition of energy in classical statistical mechanics states that each molecular degree of freedom receives 12 kT of energy a result which was modified when quantum mechanics explained certain anomalies eg in the observed specific heats of crystals For monatomic helium and other noble gases the internal energy consists only of the translational kinetic energy of the individual atoms Monatomic particles of course do not rotate or vibrate and are not electronically excited to higher energies except at very high temperatures

From the standpoint of statistical mechanics the internal energy is equal to the ensemble average of the total energy of the system

A physical law scientific law or a law of nature is a scientific generalization based on empirical observations of physical behavior Empirical laws are typically conclusions based on repeated scientific experiments over many years and which have become accepted universally within the scientific community The production of a summary description of nature in the form of such laws is a fundamental aim of science

Laws of nature are distinct from the law either religious or civil and should not be confused with the concept of natural law Nor should physical law be confused with law of physics  the term physical law usually covers laws in other sciences as well

Some extremely important laws are simply definitions For example the central law of mechanics F dpdt is often treated as a mathematical definition of force Although the concept of force predates Newtons law there was no mathematical definition of force before Newton The principle of least action Schroedinger equation Heisenberg uncertainty principle causality and a few other laws also fall into this category

Pipe is a tube or hollow cylinder for the transport of fluid The terms pipe and tube can be used for the same objects Pipe is generally specified by the internal diameter whereas tube is usually defined by the outside diameter but may be specified by any combination of dimensions Tube is often made to custom sizes and may often have more specific sizes and tolerances than pipe The terms tube and tubing are more widely used in the USA and pipe elsewhere in the world

Both pipe and tube imply a level of rigidity and permanence whereas a broken wikt linkhosehose is usually portable and flexible

The Bacon number of an actor or actress is the number of degrees of separation they have from actor Kevin Bacon as defined by the game known as Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon It applies the Erds number concept to the movie industry The higher the Bacon number the farther away from Kevin Bacon the actor is

For example Kevin Bacons Bacon number is 0 If an actor works in a movie with Kevin Bacon the actors Bacon number is 1 If an actor works with an actor who worked with Kevin Bacon in a movie the first actors Bacon number is 2 and so forth

Zanzibar is the name of an archipelago in the Indian Ocean 2550 km off the coast of East Africa There are numerous small islands and two large ones Unguja and Pemba Island 

The archipelago was once the separate state of Zanzibar which united with Tanganyika to form Tanzania Zanzibar is a semi autonomous within the union with its own government 

The capital of Zanzibar located on the island of Unguja is Zanzibar City The citys old quarter known as Stone Town is a World Heritage Site

The people are mostly African Bantu with some asians of Indian origin

Zanzibar has its own government known as the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar It is made up of the Revolutionary Council and House of Representatives

the main Parties are the Chama Cha Mapinduzi and the Civic United Front Since the early 1990s the politics of the archipelago have been marked by repeated violent clashes between these two political parties

In October 2009 Zanzibar President Amani Karume met with CUF Secretary Seif Shariff Hamad at the State House to discus how to save Zanzibar from future political turmoil and to end the backlash between them a move which was welcomed by many people including the USA and political parties It was the first time CUF agreed to recognize Karume as the legitimate president of Zanzibar

The relationship between Zanzibar government and Tanzanian Mainland has not been good in recent years since Tanzania Prime Minister Mizengo Pindas remark about the Isles sovereignty He said that Zanzibar is not an independent country outside the Union Government within which it can only exercise its sovereignty

Members from both the ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi and the opposition Civic United Front disagreed with Mr Pindas interpretation and stand firmly in recognizing Zanzibar as a fully autonomous and full state The move was not recognized by the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania

In 2008 Tanzanian president Jakaya Kikwete tried to silence the debate when he addressed the nation in a live conference by saying that Zanzibar is a state internal but semi state international There the matter rests for the time being

A proposal to amend Zanzibars laws to allow rival parties to form governments of national unity was adopted by 664 per cent of voters after official results of a referendum which was held on July 31 2010

Zanzibar is 95 Islamic in religion and has been so for hundreds of years It was once part of the Persian Empire then under the Caliphate of Oman It was ruled by a Sultan 

Zanzibar was conquered by the British in the late 19th century The islands were involved in the Arab slave trade and the British conquest was an attempt to stop this They appointed puppet rulers and Zanzibar became a protectorate not a colony

Zanzibar gained independence on 10th December 1963 from the British

Zanzibars main industries are spices raffia and tourism Zanzibar is also the home of the endemic Zanzibar Red Colobus and the elusive Zanzibar Leopard The word Zanzibar probably derives from the Persian Zangi bar and it is also known as Zanji bar in Arabic Zanzibar is sometimes referred to as the Spice Islands a term that is more often used for the Maluku Islands in Indonesia Pemba Island is the only island apart from Zanzibar that still produces cloves on a major basis which is the primary source of spice income for the islands

The islands are poor and the economy is in trouble Zanzibaris are living a hard life compare to the mainland In 2000 the annual income per capita was US220

During May and June 2008 Zanzibar suffered a major failure of its electricity system which left the island without electricity for nearly a month Another blackout happened from December 2009 to March 2010 due to a problem with the submarine cables and the local plant This led to a serious and ongoing shock to the islands fragile economy which is heavily dependent on foreign tourism

Zanzibars economy is based primarily on the production of cloves the principal foreign exchange earner Exports have suffered with the downturn in the clove market 

The clove originally from the Moluccan Islands was introduced to Zanzibar by the Omani sultans in the first half of the XIX century Zanzibar mainly Pemba Island was once the worlds leading clove producer but annual clove sales have plummeted by 80 since the 1970s Zanzibars clove industry has been crippled by a fast moving global market and international competition 

Tanzanias failed experiment with socialism in the 1960s and 1970s when the government controlled clove prices and exports is also a factor Zanzibar now ranks a distant third with Indonesia supplying 75 of the worlds cloves compared to Zanzibars 7

Zanzibar exports spices seaweed and fine raffia It also has a large fishing and dugout canoe production

Tourism is a major foreign currency earner A number of new hotels and resorts having been built in recent years

The Government of Zanzibar legalized foreign exchange bureaux on the islands The effect was to increase the availability of consumer commodities The government has also established a free port area This stimulates trade and support services There is a management system for re exportation of goods

There is also a possibility of oil exploration in Zanzibar on the island of Pemba Oil would help boost the economy of Zanzibar but there have been disagreements about dividends between the Tanzanian mainland and Zanzibar the latter claiming the oil should be excluded in Union matters A Norwegian consultant has been sent to Zanzibar to investigate its oil potential

Construction is the process of erection or assembly of any building or infrastructure on a site In general there are three types of construction

Building construction is the process of adding structure to real property Industrial construction though a relatively small part of the entire construction industry is a very important component

The first buildings were huts and shelters constructed by hand or with simple tools As cities grew during the bronze age a class of professional craftsmen appeared Occasionally slaves were used for construction work In the middle ages these were organized into guilds In the 19th century steam powered machinery appeared and later diesel and electric powered vehicles such as cranes excavators and bulldozers

Infrastructure is the term used to describe the facilities which support modern human life

These are the main items water supply sewage plants housing roads cable networks food supply facilities schools hospitals airports community meeting places business and government buildings bridges railways In fact everything that modern life needs in the way of built facilities

Infrastructure is closely connected with standard of living and overpopulation Every time the population doubles it follows that the infrastructure must at least double often more than that If a country is poor and the highest population growth is in poor countries then its government cannot provide the needed infrastructure Standard of living drops and this may lead to other evils 

A ceremony is an activity performed at a special time Ceremonies may be done to celebrate an event or rite of passage

A chemical property is any aspect of a substance which is only seen by means of a chemical reaction 

This is different from a physical property which can be discovered without changing the substances chemical structure 

Chemical properties can be used for building chemical classifications They can be used to identify an unknown substance or to separate or purify it from other substances

A bass drum is a type of musical instrument called a drum It is a large drum makes low sounds and is frequently used in the common drum kit

A drum kit is a collection of drums cymbals and other percussion instruments that is used by a drummer in a musical group

A Drum Kit has

Other cymbals and drums can be added to the setup for a wider range of sounds like the Splash  a small cymbal around 1025 cm giving a distinct crash sound with a quick decay Also a China cymbal giving a oriental feel to beats and rhythms solos and fills it is like a crash cymbal just popped inside out with the screw and sponge holding it to the stand inside it so its like a shallow bowl shape The drummer can attach a tambourine to the spine of the hit hat so when he or her puts his or her foot down Cymbals can also have rivets inserted into them to give them a sizzling sound On the pedal the drummer gets the tambourine sound at the same time  same with hitting it with the Drum Stick  it gives the tambourine sound at the same time A Cow Bell can be attached to the top of the Bass Drum between the Snare and Floor Tom used in fills solos grooves and riffs and in rudimental studies

A drum stick or drumstick is a wooden stick that is used to hit percussion instruments to make sound There are many kinds of drumsticks Some sticks are made for certain instruments For instance a drum kit stick may look very different from a snare drum stick Weight length and tip size are all altering factors in a stick

A Khachkar or Khatchkar is a carved memorial stone found in Armenia

The best part is the cross with a crucifix with a rosette or sun disc below it The remainder is usually filled with patterns of leaves grapes or abstract knotwork patterns Occasionally it is surmounted by a cornice with biblical or saints characters

The most common reason for erecting a khachkar was for bad reasons  for the salvation of the soul of either a living or a dead person They were also removed for other reasons such as to praise a military victory construction of a church or as a protection from natural disasters

A lot of khachkars are in graveyards But Armenian gravestones take many other forms and only a small are khatchkars

Land Registry or Her Majestys Land Registry is a government office which started in 1862 It publicly records interests in land in England and Wales It answers to the Ministry of Justice

The office records the owner of land and legal rights over land It has recorded about half of the land in England and Wales and they request owners to record the rest

Persons make payments to the Land Registry to record land or for copies of the records The British Government does not make payments to the Land Registry

The Land Registry has 24 offices in England and Wales and a head office at Lincolns Inn Fields in London England It wants to shut the offices in York and Harrow

The head of the Land Registry is called the Chief Land Registrar and Chief Executive

In 1857 a government committee said there should be a record of land The Land Registry started after the Land Registry Act 1862 The failure of this law led to a new law in 1875 But this law was also a failure because persons could decide if they wanted to record their land and most persons decided not to In 1897 a new law forced persons in London to record their land when they sold it Step by step this law was applied to the rest of England and Wales by 1990 A new law the Land Registration Act 2002 modernised the law and made possible the electronic sale of land

The Odonata are an order of flying insects the dragonflies and damselflies Like most of the flying insects they evolved in the early Mesozoic era Their prototypes the giant dragonflies of the Carboniferous are no longer put in the Odonata They are now called Protodonata or Meganisoptera

The two suborders are easily distinguished by their eyes

There are other views on the classification of the Odonata but this is as much as anyone needs to know in order to enjoy this beautiful group of insects

All Odonata have aquatic larvae called nymphs and all of them larvae and adults are carnivorous The adults can land but not walk Their legs are specialised for catching prey

These insects characteristically have large rounded heads covered mostly by big compound eyes legs that catch prey in flight two pairs of long transparent wings that move independently and long abdomens They have two ocelli and short antennae The mouthparts are on the underside of the head and include simple chewing mandibles in the adult

Tritium is an isotope of hydrogen the lightest element Tritium has one proton and two neutrons making it heavier than ordinary hydrogen or its isotope deuterium Hydrogen does not have any neutrons only a proton The chemical symbol for Tritium is 3H or T

In nature tritium is made when cosmic rays hit nitrogen in the air Tritium made this way lasts for a very short time so this tritium is not used by people Instead people make lots of tritium in nuclear reactors so that they can make things from it

Tritium is important for nuclear fusion power Tritium is used with other types of Hydrogen to create electric power cleanly

Tritium is often used with phosphors to make glow in the dark key rings and sights on rifles Tritium makes the phosphors glow because it is radioactively unstable and gives energy to the phosphor so it can make light Before lots of tritium could be made people used radium to make things light up but this gave people cancer

Tritium is added to nuclear bombs to make them more powerful when they explode

Professional wrestling is a kind of sport It is different from other sports because it is a fixed sport Its actually dubbed Sports entertainment by the Pro wrestling world

The words professional wrestling mean to wrestle for money as a job Many of it participants use it as their life career like Ric Flair Wrestling is a sport where two people fight in a match They try to win by keeping the other down with grabbing or holding or various other moves to hurt an opponent long enough for one person to cover their opponent for about three seconds which is known as a Pin or Pinfall They can also win by putting an opponent into what is known as a submission to where if the opponent taps out thus says he quits and the wrestler wins Professional wrestling is not the same as real wrestling A pro wrestler can try to lift the other and throw him A pro wrestler can also hit the other with hands and feet or jump on him In professional wrestling the people only look like they are trying to fight But it is not real It is a kind of entertainment so the people watching have fun

Professional wrestling is done as a show like a play Many wrestlers will wrestle in many fights called matches They wrestle inside a wrestling ring which is a place with ropes around it The best wrestlers can win belts called championship titles to show that they are the best

The best pro wrestlers are also famous Some famous pro wrestlers are Bret Hart Shawn Michaels Rikidozan and The Rock

Many people like to watch professional wrestling on television or at the shows The United States Canada Mexico and Japan are countries that have a lot of professional wrestling

A company can make money by making professional wrestling shows The biggest company of professional wrestling is World Wrestling Entertainment also called WWE Every year they have a big wrestling show called WrestleMania

Spectrophotometry is the quantitative study of electromagnetic spectra A spectrophotometer measures either the amount of light reflected from a sample object or the amount of light that is absorbed by the sample object

In short the sequence of events in a modern spectrophotometer is as follows

There are two kinds of spectrophotometers single beam and double beam A double beam spectrophotometer compares the light intensity between two light paths One path containing a reference sample The other the test sample A single beam spectrophotometer measures the relative light intensity of the beam before and after a test sample is inserted A double beam machine makes comparison readings easier and more stable But a single beam machine can have measure a wider range of light frequencies Single beam machines have simple optical systems and are more compact When the spectrophotometer is built into another device only single beam machines will work

These machines depend on the beam of light being limited to just one frequency or wave length Spectrophotometers can use wave lengths from 200nm  2500nm Historically spectrophotometers use a monochromator containing a diffraction grating to produce the analytical spectrum The grating can either be movable or fixed The measurement is made at the other end of the beam by a detector If the machine has a single detector the grating can be scanned stepwise so that the detector can measure the light intensity at each wavelength In an alternative design a row of detectors are used These may be charge coupled devices or photodiode arrays In such systems the monochromator grating is fixed and the intensity of each wavelength of light is measured by a different detector in the array Additionally most modern mid infrared spectrophotometers use a Fourier transform technique to acquire the spectral information The technique is called Fourier Transform Infrared

In both single beam and double beam machines the light being measured is either passed through the sample or bounced off the sample When making transmission measurements the spectrophotometer quantitatively compares the fraction of light that passes through a reference solution and a test solution For reflectance measurements the spectrophotometer quantitatively compares the fraction of light that reflects from the reference and test samples Light from the source lamp is passed through a monochromator which diffracts the light into a rainbow of wavelengths and outputs narrow bandwidths of this diffracted spectrum Discrete frequencies are transmitted through the test sample Then the photon flux density of the transmitted or reflected light is measured by the sensor The transmittance or reflectance value for each wavelength of the test sample is then compared with the transmission values from the reference sample

Many older spectrophotometers must be calibrated by a procedure known as zeroing The absorbancy of a reference substance is set as a baseline value so the absorbancies of all other substances are recorded relative to the initial zeroed substance The spectrophotometer then displays absorbancy

Spectrophotometers can also measure luminescence For example the machine can shine ultraviolet light of one frequency on the sample This will excite the sample and make it glow The detectors can the measuring the light glowing from the sample at a different frequency

Forest Ontario is a town in Lambton County Ontario Canada About 3000 people live in the town It the biggest town in Lambton Shores The town was an important lumber town It even had its own train stop Forest is now a tourist attraction It has trails and camp facilities

Forest is located on land that was once dense forest When the Grand Trunk Railway was built the station for the town was named for the dense forest In 1859 the first post office was then named Forest

The industry of the town was first based on the large amount of fruit growing in the area There was once a canning factory and a basket factory in Forest In more recent years the town has become a dormitory community for the city of Sarnia and to a lesser extent London Ontario The large tourism area along the shores of nearby Lake Huron also helps local businesses Several small manufacturing plants supporting the automobile industry have also opened in the past few years

In 2001 the last year that Forest was a national census unit the town had a population of 2857 The average age of the people who live in Forest was about 42 This is five years older than the average for the entire province The average earnings of the people living in Forest was 27902 in the year 2000 In 2006 the local census unit was changed to the town of Lambton Shores Information for Forest itself is not available

Forest has a high school North Lambton Secondary School The school has a large gymnasium and cafeteria It also has access to washroom and meal preparation facilities Forest has two separate school systems It has a public school system Kinnwood Central Public School and a private school system St John Fisher Both systems have elementary schools

There are many recreational facilities in the town These include an enclosed arenacommunity center with baseball and soccer fields a lawn bowling club and public tennis courts There is also an agricultural society with grounds used for a fall fair and campsites A privately owned golf course is located in the town Forest Golf and Country Hotel There are also more than a dozen other golf courses within a convert20mikm0lkonabbron drive

Forest has a natural amphitheatre in the conservation area in the south part of the town Each year the people of the town act in a religious play called The Promise in this amphitheatre They have done the play since 1995 The stage of the amphitheatre is on a small island The audience sits on the surrounding hillsides

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that the more one knows about where a particle is right now the less one knows about how fast it is going and the direction that it is going This also works the other way around the more one knows about how fast the particle is going and the direction it is going the less one knows about where it is right now

In 1927 Werner Heisenberg became the first person to propose this This uncertainty principle helped to create the study of quantum mechanics 

In quantum physics the outcome of even the most perfect measurement of a system is not already a fact but instead is shown by a probability distribution The larger the related standard deviation is the more uncertain we might say what we are showing is for the system 

The uncertainty principle is often confused with the observer effect

An important part of quantum mechanics which shows itself in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is that no physical event can be described as a classic point particle or as a wave but rather the tiny event is best described in terms of wave particle duality Basically small bits of matter and small waves of energy are sometimes very hard to tell apart because they can act like both at the same time

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is caused by this 

A quantum mechanical particle wave is sort of like a sound wave When people try to measure the frequency of a sound wave they are trying to figure out how often something happens in a given amount of time That means theres basically no such thing as frequency in one single moment of time In order to be really have a sure frequency a signal has to be around for a long time In any finite amount of time the frequency band cannot be measured to arbitrary precision But lengthening the time means the wave repeats more times lessening the precision of the other measurement This is basically Maths version of the Uncertainty Principle

A lot of people get the Uncertainty Principle confused with the observer effect and a lot of people accidentally think that the Uncertainty Principle is caused by the observer effect The two are not actually related

The Observer Effect says that when you try to observe something you will always change something about it even if you do not want to That means that your measurement will never be exactly right People used to think that a thought experiment called Heisenbergs microscope proved that the Observer Effect makes the Uncertainty Principle happen 

The Observer Effect only happens when you observe something in order to measure it In quantum mechanics scientists do not have to observe a particle in order to understand it within a model In the models particles cannot have arbitrarily precise position and velocity regardless of whether they are measured or not

The Uncertainty Principle was developed as an answer to the question How does one measure the location of an electron around a nucleus

In the summer of 1922 Heisenberg met Niels Bohr the founding father of quantum mechanics and in September 1924 Heisenberg went to Copenhagen where Bohr had invited him as a research associate and later as his assistant In 1925 Werner Heisenberg laid down the basic principles of a complete quantum mechanics In his new matrix theory he replaced classical commuting variables with non commuting ones Heisenbergs paper marked a radical departure from previous attempts to solve atomic problems by making use of observable quantities only He wrote in a 1925 letter My entire meagre efforts go toward killing off and suitably replacing the concept of the orbital paths that one cannot observe Rather than struggle with the complexities of three dimensional orbits Heisenberg dealt with the mechanics of a one dimensional vibrating system an anharmonic oscillator The result was formulae in which quantum numbers were related to observable radiation frequencies and intensities In March 1926 working in Bohrs institute Heisenberg formulated the principle of uncertainty thereby laying the foundation of what became known as the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics

Albert Einstein was not happy with the uncertainty principle and he challenged Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg with a famous thought experiment we fill a box with a radioactive material which randomly emits radiation The box has a shutter which is opened and soon thereafter shut by a clock at a precise time thereby allowing some radiation to escape So the time is already known with precision We still want to measure the conjugate variable energy precisely Einstein proposed doing this by weighing the box before and after The equivalence between mass and energy from special relativity will allow you to determine precisely how much energy was left in the box Bohr countered as follows should energy leave then the now lighter box will rise slightly on the scale That changes the position of the clock Thus the clock deviates from our stationary reference frame and by general relativity its measurement of time will be different from ours leading to some unavoidable margin of error In fact a detailed analysis shows that the imprecision is correctly given by Heisenbergs relation

The term Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics was often used interchangeably with and as a synonym for Heisenbergs Uncertainty Principle by detractors who believed in fate and determinism and saw the common features of the Bohr Heisenberg theories as a threat Within the widely but not universally accepted Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics the uncertainty principle is taken to mean that on an elementary level the physical universe does not exist in a deterministic form but rather as a collection of probabilities or potentials For example the pattern produced by millions of photons passing through a diffraction slit can be calculated using quantum mechanics but the exact path of each photon cannot be predicted by any known method The Copenhagen interpretation holds that it cannot be predicted by any method not even with theoretically infinitely precise measurements

It is this interpretation that Einstein was questioning when he said I cannot believe that God would choose to play dice with the universe Bohr who was one of the authors of the Copenhagen interpretation responded Einstein dont tell God what to do Niels Bohr himself acknowledged that quantum mechanics and the uncertainty principle were counter intuitive when he stated Anyone who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood a single word

The basic debate between Einstein and Bohr was that Einstein was in essence saying Of course we can know where something is we can know the position of a moving particle if we know every possible detail and therefore by extension we can predict where it will go Bohr and Heisenberg were saying We can only know the probable position of a moving particle therefore by extension we can only know its probable destination we can never know with absolute certainty where it will go 

Einstein was convinced that this interpretation was in error His reasoning was that all previously known probability distributions arose from deterministic events The distribution of a flipped coin or a rolled die can be described with a probability distribution but this does not mean that their physical motions are unpredictable Ordinary mechanics can be used to calculate exactly how each coin will land if the forces acting on it are known And the headstails distribution will still line up with the probability distribution

Einstein assumed that there are similar hidden variables in quantum mechanics which underlie the observed probabilities and that these variables if known would show that there was what Einstein termed local realism a description opposite to the uncertainty principle being that all objects must already have their properties before they are observed or measured For the greater part of the twentieth century there were many such hidden variable theories proposed but in 1964 John Bell theorized the Bell inequality to counter them which postulated that although the behavior of an individual particle is random it is also correlated with the behavior of other particles Therefore if the uncertainty principle is the result of some deterministic process in which a particle has local realism it must be the case that particles at great distances instantly transmit information to each other to ensure that the correlations in behavior between particles occur The interpretation of Bells theorem explicitly prevents any local hidden variable theory from holding true because it shows the necessity of a system to describe correlations between objects The implication is if a hidden local variable is the cause of particle 1 being at a position then a second hidden local variable would be responsible for particle 2 being in its own position and there is no system to correlate the behavior between them Experiments have demonstrated that there is correlation In the years following Bells theorem was tested and has held up experimentally time and time again and these experiments are in a sense the clearest experimental confirmation of quantum mechanics It is worth noting that Bells theorem only applies to local hidden variable theories non local hidden variable theories can still exist

Whether Einsteins view or Heisenbergs view is true or false is not a directly empirical matter One criterion by which we may judge the success of a scientific theory is the explanatory power it gives us and to date it seems that Heisenbergs view has been the better at explaining physical subatomic phenomena

The uncertainty principle is stated in popular culture in many ways for example by some stating that it is impossible to know both where an electron is and where it is going at the same time This is roughly correct although it fails to mention an important part of the Heisenberg principle which is the quantitative bounds on the uncertainties Heisenberg stated that it is impossible to determine simultaneously and with unlimited accuracy the position and momentum of a particle but due to Plancks Constant being so small the Uncertainty Principle was intended to apply only to the motion of atomic particles However culture often misinterprets this to mean that it is impossible to make a completely accurate measurement

In the 1997 film The Lost World Jurassic Park chaostician Ian Malcolm claims that the effort to observe and document not interact with the dinosaurs is a scientific impossibility because of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle whatever you study you also change This is an inaccurate confusion with the observer effect as explained above

In the science fiction television series Star Trek The Next Generation the fictional transporters used to beam characters to different locations overcome the limitations of sampling the subject due to the uncertainty principle with the use of Heisenberg compensators When asked How does the Heisenberg compensator work by Time magazine on 28 November 1994 Michael Okuda technical advisor on Star Trek famously responded It works very well thank you

The Armenian Legion or Armenische Legion was the name given to the 812th Armenian Battalion which was a foreign unit comprised of several thousand men

Leaders Kanayan and Garegin Njdeh counted the support of over 18000 Armenians

In addition to this exclusively Armenian unit Nazi Armenians also served in the thirty eight other SS divisions including the elite Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler

Garegin Njdeh was an Armenian statesman military and political thinker He was a native of Nakhchivan

Njdeh fled Armenia after the triumph of Bolsheviks and was involved in patriotic activities in Iran Bulgaria and the United States A controversial person he was expelled from Dashnak party Njdeh was very much against communism He worked with Nazi Germans during the World War II He was arrested in Sofia Bulgaria in 1944 and sent to Moscow then to Yerevan He spent the rest of his life in prison in the Russian city of Vladimir where he dide in 1955

Wehrmacht was the name of the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945 The Wehrmacht consisted of the Heer the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe 

The Waffen SS an initially small armed section of Heinrich Himmlers Allgemeine SS that grew to nearly a million strong during World War II was not part of the Wehrmacht but subject to its Supreme Command

Before the rise of the NSDAP the term Wehrmacht was used in a generic sense to describe armed forces of any nation being utilized as the home defence version of the more general Streitmacht For example the term Britische Wehrmacht would identify the British armed forces Article 47 of the Weimar Constitution of 1919 declared Der Reichsprsident hat den Oberbefehl ber die gesamte Wehrmacht des Reiches To make a distinction the term Reichswehr was commonly used to identify the German armed forces

In 1935 the Reichswehr was renamed Wehrmacht After World War II and under the Allied occupation of Germany the Wehrmacht was abolished

Today the term Wehrmacht refers to Germanys armed forces during the Nazi Germany era and World War II both in German and English Note The Wehrmacht was not only the army Wehrmacht vehicles used by Heer Luftwaffe or Kriegsmarine had license plates with WH WL or WM

After World War I ended with the broken wikt linkarmisticearmistice of November 11 1918 the armed forces were called Friedensheer in January 1919 In March 1919 the national assemby passed a law founding a 420000 strong preliminary army as Vorlufige Reichswehr The terms of the Treaty of Versailles were announced in May and in June Germany was forced to sign the contract by which among other terms the army was limited to one hundred thousand men with an additional fifteen thousand in the navy Tanks and heavy artillery were forbidden and the air force was dissolved A new post war military was established on March 23 1921 

Germany immediately found means not to keep to these conditions A secret collaboration with the Soviet Union began after the treaty of Rapallo Germany helped the Soviet Union with industrialisation and Soviet officers were to be trained in Germany German tank and air force specialists could exercise in the Soviet Union and German chemical weapons research and manufacture would be carried out there along with other projects Around three hundred German pilots received training at Lipetsk some tank training took place near Kazan and toxic gas was developed at Saratov for the German army

After the death of President Paul von Hindenburg on August 2 1934 Hitler assumed the office of Reichsprsident and thus became commander in chief All officers and soldiers of the German armed forces had to swear a personal oath of loyalty to the Fhrer as Adolf Hitler now was called By 1935 Germany was openly breaking the military restrictions of the Versailles Treaty and broken wikt linkconscriptionconscription was reintroduced on March 16 1935 The size of the standing army remained at about the 100000 man mark decreed by the treaty but a new group of conscripts equal to this size would receive training each year The conscription law introduced the name Wehrmacht so not only can this be regarded as its founding date but the organisation and authority of the Wehrmacht can be viewed as Nazi creations The insignia was a simpler version of the Iron Cross that had been used as an aircraft and tank marking in late World War I The existence of the Wehrmacht was officially announced on October 15 1935

The Wehrmacht entered the war with a minority of its formations motorized infantry remained approximately 90 foot borne throughout the war and artillery primarily horse drawn The motorized formations received much attention in the world press in the opening years of the war and were cited as the reason for the success of the German invasions of Poland Norway Denmark Belgium France and Netherlands Yugoslavia and the early campaigns in the Soviet Union

With the entry of the United States in December 1941 the Wehrmacht found itself engaged in ground campaigns against two major industrial powers At this critical juncture Hitler assumed personal control of the Wehrmacht high command and his personal failings as a military commander arguably contributed to major defeats in the spring of 1943 at Stalingrad and Tunis in North Africa

The German Air Force led by Hermann Gring contributed many units of ground forces to the war in Russia as well as the Normandy front In 1940 the Fallschirmjger paratroops conquered the Belgian Fort Eben Emael and took part in the airborne invasion of Norway but after suffering heavy losses in the Battle of Crete large scale airdrops were discontinued Operating as ordinary infantry the 1st Fallschirmjger Division took part in the Battle of Monte Cassino 

The German Navy played a major role in the Second World War as control over the commerce routes in the Atlantic was crucial for Germany Britain and later the Soviet Union In the Battle of the Atlantic the initially successful German U boat fleet arm was eventually defeated due to Allied technological advances like sonar radar and the breaking of the Enigma code Large surface vessels were few in number due to construction limitations by international treaties prior to 1935 The pocket battleships Admiral Graf Spee and Admiral Scheer were important as commerce raiders only in the opening year of the war No aircraft carrier was operational as German leadership lost interest in the Graf Zeppelin which had been launched in 1938 Following the loss of Bismarck in 1941 with Allied air superiority threatening the remaining battlecruisers in French Atlantic harbours the ships were ordered to go back to German ports 

Although the Waffen SS was not technically a part of the Wehrmacht they were under the control of the Wehrmacht High Command during World War 2 They were considered as elite troops and suffered heavy losses

The Wehrmacht was used as a tool of state policy in the Second World War for both military and political aims There is considerable controvery over the allegations that the Wehrmacht was found to be significantly rather than incidentally involved in the Holocaustespecially because the elements of the SS involved in the Holocaust were not the Waffen SS and not under the control of the OKW or field commanders The Wehrmacht ordered and participated in massacres of civilians for reprisals executions of prisoners of war summary executions of Soviet political officers and executions of military and civilian hostages as punishment for partisan activities in occupied territoriesHowever the oft repeeated claim of breaking the Geneva convention by its treatment of Russian prisoners of war is not correct Common Clause 2 of the Geneva Convention states that the treatment requirements apply where both parties are signatories of the Conventions The Germans were signatories The Russians refused to sign

Mainland Australia has three official time zones The full names of the time zones are usually shortened by dropping the Australian Most Australian external territories are in different time zones Many parts of Australia have daylight saving time

The three official standard time zones were set up in February 1895

Originally South Australia was nine hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time but in May 1899 they added another thirty minutes to that Some people have disliked having this non whole number of hours difference In 1986 and 1994 they tried to take the thirty minutes away again or add another thirty minutes but they failed

When the Australian Capital Territory separated from New South Wales they kept using Eastern Standard Time When the Northern Territory separated from South Australia they kept using Central Standard Time

There have been some other changes

Australias many outside territories follow their own time zones None follow daylight saving time

South Australia New South Wales the Australian Capital Territory Victoria and Tasmania use daylight saving time every year In most of these regions daylight saving time begins on the last Sunday in October at 200 am local standard time and end on the last Sunday in March at 300 am local daylight saving time Tasmania begins daylight saving time earlier on the first Sunday in October at 200 am local standard time The starting and finishing times can also be changed when there are special events such as the Olympic and Commonwealth Games in Australia

The Northern Territory does not have daylight saving time Queensland does not have daylight savings time either Many people who live in the south east corner of Queensland would like to have But many people who live in the rural towns and farming regions of Queensland are against it

In Western Australia they have voted on daylight saving time three times in 1975 1984 and 1992 Each time people voted No Western Australia is trying daylight saving time again from spring 2006 until autumn 2009 Then they are going to vote again

Human sacrifice is the act of killing a human being as an offering to a deity or other normally supernatural power 

It was practiced in many ancient cultures The practice was different in different cultures Some like the Mayans and Aztecs are notorious for their ritual killings others have looked down on the practice as primitive 

Victims were ritually killed in a manner that was supposed to please or appease gods or spirits Victims ranged from prisoners to infants to Vestal Virgins whos stomachs were cut open with a dullstone knife and their hearts were burned

Over time human sacrifice has become less common around the world and sacrifices are now very rare Most religions condemn the practice and present day laws generally treat it as a criminal matter Nonetheless it is still occasionally seen today especially in the least developed areas of the world where traditional beliefs persist

The ancient Middle Eastern kingdom of Phoenicia practiced sacrifice of children to their god Moloch It was believed to be evil by the Jewish authors of the Bible

The Aztecs were particularly noted for practicing human sacrifice on a large scale an offering to Huitzilopochtli would be made to restore the blood he lost as the sun was engaged in a daily battle Human sacrifices would prevent the end of the world that could happen on each cycle of 52 years In the 1487 re consecration of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan many prisoners were sacrificed 

Tlaloc would require weeping boys in the first months of the Aztec calendar to be ritually murdered

A number of mummies of sacrificed children have been recovered in the Inca regions of South America

The observer effect or observer bias means several things in different situations although there are similarities

In science the term observer effect means that the act of observing will influence the phenomenon being observed 

For example for us to see an electron a photon must first interact with it and this interaction will change the path of that electron It is also theoretically possible for other less direct means of measurement to affect the electron even if the electron is simply put into a position where observing it is possible without actual observation taking place it will still alter its position

In physics a more mundane observer effect can be the result of instruments that by necessity alter the state of what they measure in some manner For instance in electronics ammeters and voltmeters usually need to be connected to the circuit and so by their very presence affect the current or the voltage they are measuring Likewise a standard mercury in glass thermometer must absorb some thermal energy to record a temperature and therefore changes the temperature of the body which it is measuring

A common lay misunderstanding of the term refers to quantum mechanics where if the outcome of an event has not been observed it exists in a state of superposition which is something like being in all possible states at once In the famous thought experiment known as Schrdingers cat the cat is supposedly neither alive nor dead until observed until that time the cat is both alive and dead However most quantum physicists in resolving Schrdingers seeming paradox now understand that the acts of observation and measurement must also be defined in quantum terms before the question makes sense From this point of view there is no observer effect only one vastly entangled quantum system A significant minority still find the equations point to an observer Wheeler who probably worked more deeply on this subject than any physicist thus far devised a graphic in which the universe was represented by a U with an eye on one end turned around and viewing itself to describe his understanding 

The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is also frequently confused with the observer effect The uncertainty principle actually describes how precisely we may measure the position and momentum of a particle at the same time if we increase the precision in measuring one quantity we are forced to lose precision in measuring the other Thus the uncertainty principle deals with measurement and not observation The idea that the Uncertainty Principle is caused by disturbance is not considered to be valid by some although it was discussed in the early years of quantum mechanics and is often repeated in popular treatments

There is a related issue in quantum mechanics relating to whether systems have pre existing prior to measurement that is properties corresponding to measurements that could possibly be made on them The assumption that they do is often referred to as realism in the literature although it has been argued that the word realism is being used in a more restricted sense than philosophical realism A recent experiment in the realm of quantum physics has been quoted as meaning that we have to say goodbye to realism although the author of the paper states only that we would have to give up certain broken wikt linkintuitiveintuitive features of realism These experiments demonstrate a puzzling relationship between the act of measurement and the system being measured but it is unclear if they require a conscious observer or not

In Information Technology the observer effect refers to potential impact of the act of observing a process output while the process is running For example if a process uses a log file to record its progress the act of viewing the file while the process is running could cause an IO error in the process which could in turn cause it to stop

Another example would be observing the performance of a CPU by running both the observed and observing programs on the same CPU which will lead to inaccurate results because the observer program itself affects the CPU performance

Observing a running program by modifying its source code or by running it in a debugger may sometimes cause certain bugs to diminish or change their behavior creating extra difficulty for the person trying to isolate the bug

In the social sciences and general usage the effect refers to how people change their behavior when aware of being watched For instance in the armed forces an announced inspection is used to see how well soldiers can do when they put their minds to it while a surprise inspection is used to see how well prepared they generally are

The related social science term observer bias is error introduced into measurement when observers overemphasize behavior they expect to find and fail to notice behavior they do not expect This is why medical trials are normally double blind rather than single blind Observer bias can also be introduced because researchers see a behavior and interpret it according to what it means to them whereas it may mean something else to the person showing the behavior See subject expectancy effect and observer expectancy effect

Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with analysis of random phenomena The central objects of probability theory are random variables stochastic processes and events mathematical abstractions of non deterministic events or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or happen over time in an apparently random fashion 

As a mathematical foundation for statistics probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve quantitative analysis of large sets of data Methods of probability theory also apply to description of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state as in statistical mechanics A great discovery of twentieth century physics was the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena at atomic scales described in quantum mechanics

The mathematical theory of probability has its roots in attempts to analyse games of chance by Gerolamo Cardano in the sixteenth century and by Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal in the seventeenth century Although an individual coin toss or the roll of a die is random event if repeated many times the sequence of random events will exhibit certain statistical patterns which can be studied and predicted Two representative mathematical results describing such patterns are the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem

The Maya civilization was a group of people who lived in Central America They lived there for a very long time and some of the Maya people live there even today They lived 4000 years ago The Mayans were the only people in the Americas to have a written language before Columbus came to the Americas in 1492 AD They were good artists architects and mathematicians They knew about stars and planets which helped them make calendars

The Maya civilization was biggest between the years of 250 AD and 900 AD The Maya civilization spread all the way from central Mexico to Honduras Guatemala and northern El Salvador The Maya People traded with other people in the Americas Their art and buildings have lots of different styles This shows they traded a lot They made changes to their buildings to make them better The style in which they made their buildings was often similar to styles of buildings in countries that the Maya people traded with

The Maya civilization started getting smaller after 900 AD

The Spanish arrived in the 15th century and took over central America even in the Mayan areas However the Mayan people still live there today Their relatives can be found in the same areas the Mayan civilization used to live in They even keep the old Mayan traditions and beliefs

There are many Mayan languages still spoken today including one called the Achi language A play called Rabinal Achi is considered very important to the world

The Maya civilization lived in three different areas the southern Maya highlands the central lowlands and the northern lowlands They had many different types of land including mountains and dry plains People living in the lowlands by the sea were affected by hurricanes and tropical storms from the Caribbean

The area covered what we now call the southern Mexican states of Chiapas and Tabasco and the Yucatn Peninsula states of Quintana Roo Campeche and Yucatn They also included where we now call Guatemala Belize El Salvador and western Honduras esaxsZWEA109255205111 1814 21 November 2011

The first Maya settlements started about 1800 BC They lived in the Soconusco region now the state of Chiapas in Mexico on the Pacific Ocean This is called the Early pre classic period in Mayan history People in central America had been nomads who went from place to place to find food and shelter Around this time they began to settle down They started to farm animals and make pottery and small clay figures They buried their dead in simple burial mounds Later they started to make these mounds into step pyramids 

There were other people around at the time especially in the north The Olmec the Mixe Zoque and Zapotec civilizations mostly lived in the area we now call Oaxaca We dont know exactly where the borders of the Maya civilisation were Many of the most important early examples of writing and buildings appeared in north so these cultures probably affected the Maya civilisation

From about 250 to 909 the Maya civilization built many monuments and cities and made lots of important carvings The southern lowlands were an important place at the time The Maya civilization made lots of discoveries about art and thinking there 

Like Ancient Greece their civilization was made up of lots of cities which all worked in different ways People gathered around these cities to farm Well known cities were Tikal Palenque Copn and Calakmul Lesser known cities were Dos Pilas Uaxactun Altun Ha and Bonampak among others In general we know more about where the cities were in the south than we do in the north Some northern cities we do know about were Oxkintok Chunchucmil and Uxmal

Their most famous monuments are the pyramids they built as part of their religious centers and the palaces The palace at Cancun is the largest we know about in the Maya area The Maya also made carved stone slabs which they called tetun or tree stones These slabs show rulers along with hieroglyphic writing describing their family military victories and other things that they did well

The Maya had trade routes that ran over long distances They traded with many other Mesoamerican cultures such as Teotihuacan the Zapotec and other groups in central and gulf coast Mexico They also traded with groups that were farther away For example people who study the Maya civilisation found gold from Panama in the Sacred well at Chichen Itza 

Some important things they traded were cacao salt sea shells jade and obsidian

Between 900 AD and 1000 AD the cities in the southern lowlands had more and more problems until all the people left The Maya civilisation there stopped making big monuments and carvings People who study the Maya civilisation are not sure why this happened They have many different ideas  some people think there was a big environmental disaster or a disease affected a lot of people or there were just too many people for the amount of food they could grow

In the north the Maya civilisation kept going Other cultures started mixing with Mayan culture much more Some of the important sites in this time were Chichen Itza Uxmal Edzn and Coba At some point the families who ruled over Chichen and Uxmal got weaker and the rulers in the city of Mayapan ruled all of the Mayan civilisation in the Yucatn peninsula until there was a revolt in 1450 After the revolt the whole area broke up into different cities who fought against each other until the the area was conquered by the Spanish

The Itza Maya Kowoj and Yalain groups around what is now Guatamela were still around but there werent very many of them By 1250 they had built themselves back up again and started to build cities The Itza had their capital at Tayasal and people who study the Maya civlisation think whats left of this city is below the modern city of Flores Guatemala on Lake Petn Itz The Kowoj had their capital at Zacpeten Some Mayan cultures were still living in the southern highlands 

The Quich kingdom produced the most famous Mayan work the Popol Vuh It talks about the creation of the world the Mayan gods and goddesses how humans and animals were created and why the Quich kingdom was the best one in the Maya civilisation

The Spanish started to conquer Maya lands It took them a long time to finish doing this because the Mayans had no capital city and each city had a different culture The last Mayan states the Itza city of Tayasal and the Kowoj city of Zacpeten still had people living in them late into the 17th century They were finally conquered in 1697

There are still about 6 million Maya people living in Central America

Looking at the history of pre Columbian Mesoamerica one can see some rather different periods between the first humans and the early Colonial period in the end 

The Paleo Indian period or era is that which begins with the first signs of human presence in the region and leads to agriculture and other practices characteristic of proto civilizations In Mesoamerica the end of this phase was at ca 8000 BC It was a period of hunter gatherers

c 8000 BCE  2000 BCE

In this time agriculture and permanent villages developed in the region Late in this era people used pottery and started weaving with a broken wikt linkloomloom

c 2000 BCE  200 CE

Nation states developed and with them the first large scale ceremonial architecture and cities That were the Olmec civilization the early Zapotec Monte Alto Culture in Guatemalas pacifc lowlands and Maya civilization

c mid 2nd century  early 10th century 

Teotihuacan grows to a metropolis and its empire dominates Mesoamerica During this time the cities of the Maya southern lowlands such as Tikal Palenque and Copn have their greatest era

The Classic Era ended earlier in Central Mexico with the fall of Teotihuacan around the 7th century than it did in the Maya area which continued for centuries more Around this time many southern lowland sites experienced a short period of limited decline called the Middle Classic Hiatus The later period of Mayas continued growth is sometimes known as the Florescent Era

In the early 20th century the term Old Empire was sometimes given to this era of Maya civilization in an analogy to Ancient Egypt the term is now considered inaccurate and has long been out of use by serious writers on the subject

10th century  16th century

Many of the great nations and cities of the Classic Era collapsed but some continue such as in Oaxaca Cholula and the Maya of Yucatn such as at Chichen Itza and Uxmal This is sometimes seen as a period of increased chaos and warfare The Toltec for a time dominate central Mexico in the 11th  13th century then collapse The northern Maya are for a time united under Mayapan The Aztec Empire rises in the early 15th century and seems on the path to gain a dominance over the whole region not seen since Teotihuacan when Mesoamerica is discovered by Spain and conquered by the Conquistadores

The late florescence of the northern Maya was sometimes called the New Empire in the early 20th century but this term is no longer considered appropriate and is no longer used

Arguably the Post Classic continued until the conquest of the last independent native state of Mesoamerica Tayasal in 1697

Sophia and sofia may mean

Trdat the Architect known in Latin as Tiridates was chief architect of the Bagratuni Dynasty of Armenia

After a great earthquake in 989 destroyed the dome of Hagia Sophia the Byzantine officials sent Trdat to Byzantium to organize repairs The restored dome was completed by 994

Byzantium was an ancient Greek city The name Byzantium is a Latinization of the original name Byzantion 

The city became the center of the Byzantine Empire but at that time it was already called Constantinople

The origins of Byzantium are not clear There is only a legend It tells a certain Byzas from Megara founded Byzantium when he sailed northeast across the Aegean Sea He had askeed the Oracle at Delphi where he should found his new city The Oracle told him to find it opposite the blind At the time he did not know what this meant But when he came upon the Bosporus he realized what it meant on the Asiatic shore was a Greek city Chalcedon It was they who must have been blind because they had not seen that obviously superior land was just a half mile away on the other side of the Bosporus Byzas founded his city here in this superior land and named it Byzantion after himself

Byzantion was mainly a trading city due to its strategic location at the Black Seas only entrance Byzantion later conquered Chalcedon across the Bosporus

When it fought with Pescennius Niger against the victorious Septimius Severus the city was besieged by Roman forces and suffered extensive damage in 196 AD Byzantium was rebuilt by Septimius Severus when he had become emperor and quickly regained its earlier prosperity 

When Roman Emperor Constantine I decided to move his capital to the Eastern part of the Roman Empire he chose the place of Byzantion because of its strategical value He refounded it in 330 AD as Nova Roma After his death the city was called Constantinople It remained the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire which was later called the Byzantine Empire by historians

Following the legend the citizens of Byzantium claimed the crescent moon as their state symbol after an important victory in 670 BC However the origin of the crescent moon and star as a symbol dates back much earlier  to ancient Babylon and ancient Egypt  But Byzantium was the first city that used the crescent moon as its symbol In 330 AD Constantine I added the Virgin Marys star to the flag

The national coat of arms of Armenia consists of an eagle and a lion supporting a shield The coat of arms combines new and old symbols The eagle and lion are ancient Armenian symbols dating from the first Armenian kingdoms that existed prior to Christ

The current coat of arms was adopted on 19 April 1992 by the Armenian Supreme Council decision On 15 June 2006 the law on the state coat of arms of Armenia was passed by the Armenian Parliament 

The shield consists of many parts In the center is a image of Mount Ararat with Noahs Ark sitting on top of it According to tradition the ark is said to have finally rested on the mountain after the great flood Ararat is considered the national symbol of Armenia and so is of significant importance to the coat of arms Surrounding Mount Ararat are symbols of old Armenian dynasties In the lower left portion of the shield there are two eagles looking at each other symbolizing the length of the Armenian territory during the reign of the Artaxiad Dynasty that ruled in the 1st century BC In the upper left portion there is a lion with a cross the emblem for the Bagratuni dynasty that ruled during the Middle Ages between 7th and 11th centuries Under this dynasty Armenia blossomed culturally making its capital Ani one of the most important cultural social and commercial centers of its time Bagratuni was destroyed by the Byzantine Empires encroachment and by Seljuk invasions in the 11th century AD In the upper right portion there is a two headed eagle the emblem of the first dynasty to reign over a Christian Armenia the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia Tiridates III of Arsacid Dynasty made Armenia the first Christian nation in 301 AD This dynasty ruled from the 1st century AD to 428 AD In the lower right portion there is a lion with a cross the emblem of the Rubenid dynasty This dynasty reigned in Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia a state that expanded and prospered during the 12th and 13th centuries until the Mamelukes and Turks eventually conquered it

The eagle supports the shield on the left side of the coat of arms while the lion on the right side The eagle was the symbol of the Artaxiad Dynasty and later on the symbol of the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia It holds the Artaxiad Dynastys branch of the shield Whereas the lion was the symbol of the Bagratuni Dynasty and later on the symbol of the Rubenid Dynasty It holds the Rubenid Dynastys branch of the shield

Both of these animals were chosen because of their power courage patience wisdom and nobility in animal kingdom 

The present day Armenian coat of arms has its origins with the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Armenia in 1918 In that year an early variation of the coat of arms was adopted by the DRA The symbols on this earlier version were placed in a slightly different order and the eagle and lion have their tongues out giving them a more menacing look Its also worthy to note that only Mount Ararat are depicted while Noahs Ark is absent The coat of arms was designed by architect and member of the Russian Academy of Fine Arts Alexander Tamanian and artist Hakob Kojoyan

In 1922 Armenia was incorporated into Transcaucasian SFSR with Georgia and Azerbaijan The coat of arms of the Transcaucasian SFSR was adopted by the government of the Transcaucasian SFSR It is uncertain when exactly it was adopted It incorporates designs from each of the three major groups that combined in the Transcaucasian SFSR the Armenians Azeri and Georgians and unusually features Islamic art and communist elements side by side The latticework in the star itself bespeaks the former coat of arms of Georgia from 1918 1921 and adopted again from 1991 2004 the crescent moon represents the Muslim Azeris on a background depicting the national symbol of the Armenians Mount Ararat

In 1937 a new coat of arms was adopted Like the DRA coat of arms this coat showed Mount Ararat along with the Soviet hammer and sickle and red star behind it The inclusion of Ararat brought objections from Turkey because the mountain is part of its territory The Kremlin retorted that although the Turkish symbol was the crescent it did not mean that they laid claim to the moon The Soviet Union broke apart in 1991 and Armenia thus became an independent republic

The Arsacid Dynasty or ruled the Kingdom of Armenia from 54 to 428 They used to be a branch of the Parthian Arsacids but became a distinctly Armenian dynasty later on Arsacid Kings reigned intermittently throughout the chaotic years after the fall of the Artaxiad Dynasty until 62 when Tiridates I of Armenia secured Arsacid rule in Armenia An independent line of Kings was established by Vologases II of Armenia in 180 Two of the most notable events under Arsacid rule in Armenian history were the conversion of Armenia to Christianity by St Gregory the Illuminator in 301 and the creation of the Armenian alphabet by Mesrop Mashtots in 405

Hakob Kojoyan was an Armenian artist He worked in genres of painting and applied art Hakob Kojoyan helped Armenian architect Alexander Tamanian in creating the coat of arms for the Democratic Republic of Armenia

Alexander Tamanian was an Armenian neoclassical architect who is remembered today for his work in the city of Yerevan

This article is about the city in Turkey For the Etruscan god see Ani

Ani is a ruined and uninhabited medieval city site situated in the Turkish province of Kars beside the border with Armenia It was once the capital of a medieval Armenian kingdom that covered much of present day Armenia and eastern Turkey

At the height of its great times Ani had a population of 100000  200000 people and was the rival of Constantinople Baghdad and Cairo Long ago renowned for its splendor and magnificence Ani has been abandoned and largely forgotten for centuries

Armenian chroniclers first mention Ani in the 5th century AD They describe it as a strong fortress built on a hilltop and a possession of the Armenian Kamsarakan dynasty

By the early 9th century the former territories of the Kamsarakans in Arsharunik and Shirak had been incorporated into the territories of the Armenian Bagratuni dynasty Their leader Ashot Msaker was given the title of ishkhan of Armenia by the Caliphate in 804

There are many other minor monuments at Ani These include a convent known as the Virgins chapel a church used by Chalcedonian Armenians the remains of a single arched bridge over the Arpa river the ruins of numerous oil presses and several bath houses the remains of a second mosque with a collapsed minaret a palace that probably dates from the 13th century the foundations of several other palaces and smaller residences the recently excavated remains of several streets lined with shops etc

In any two party system of politics a third party is a party other than the two main ones While the term should be used only when discussing the third largest party it is often used to describe any smaller party For example in the United Kingdom a third party is a national political party other than the Conservative Party and Labour Party that has a presence in the House of Commons In the United States a third party is a political party other than the Democratic Party or Republican Party that has national influence 

The term third parties is used in countries with first past the post electoral systems as these systems tend to create a two party system because successful smaller parties are rare

Countries using proportional representation have less of a tendency to create a two party system because successful smaller parties are common In fact coalitions between the smaller parties are normal in such a country A party generally needs to have a certain level of success to be called a third party Smaller parties that only win a small percentage of the vote and no seats in the legislature are often called minor parties or fringe parties

Third parties are not usually likely to win the presidency Despite this there are many reasons for third parties to run In an election the two main parties listen to the opinions of third parties The larger parties must respond to these opinions and sometimes the larger parties copy ideas from third parties Some third parties also hope that the party can slowly build its support and eventually become one of the dominant parties as the Labour Party did in Britain
