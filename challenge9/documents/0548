Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna of Russia was Queen of the NetherlandsShe was the mother of William III of the Netherlands She was the grand mother of Wilhelmina of the Netherlands

Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands was the prince consort of Juliana of the Netherlands He was the father of Beatrix of the Netherlands He died in 2004 at the age of 93

George Victor was the 3rd sovereign Prince of the German state of Waldeck and Pyrmont He was the father of Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont the consort of William III of the Netherlands George Victor is the great great grandfather of Beatrix of the Netherlands

Adelheid Emma Wilhelmina Theresia Princess of Orange Nassau Princess of Waldeck Pyrmont was the second wife of king William III of the Netherlands She was married to him from 1879 until he died in 1890 After his death she became Queen Regent of the Netherlands because her daughter Wilhelmina was only 10 when her father died and too young to reign

Emma was the fourth of seven children Her father was George Victor king of Waldeck and Pyrmont and her mother was Helena Princess of Nassau Weilburg Her grandmother on her fathers side Emma of Anhalt Bernburg Schaumburg Hoym was a grandchild of princess Carolina of Orange Nassau and Karel Christiaan of Nassau Weilburg Her grandfather on her mothers side Willem of Nassau Weilburg was also their grandchild This means that Emma was related to the House of Orange Nassau through two family connections 

The princess grew up in Schloss Arolsen in Germany Her daughter the later Queen Wilhelmina wrote in her autobiography that her mothers home life was very modern and well informed for that time

The king was married before to his cousin Sophie of Wrttemberg She died in 1877 Their marriage was unhappy they had lived apart since 1855 William III had a few relationships outside his first marriage The newspapers even reported on his relationships with the American barmaid Elisa Parker and the opera singer Leonora dAmbre from Paris 

After Sophie died and the sons did not marry anyone William thought it best to re marry That way the family name of Orange would not die out He met Sophie after going to her house to meet her older sister Pauline He had also looked into marrying his niece Elisabeth van Saksen Weimar Eisenach 

When they were engaged in September 1878 Emma was 20 years old and William was 61 They married on 7 January 1879 and on 31 August 1880 Wilhelmina was born 

The first years of the marriage were happy for Queen Emma She liked to do woodcarving and spent a lot of time in her workshop in Utrecht She also spent a lot of time on taking care of her Wimmy But soon things changed In 1884 Williams youngest son Alexander died He was 32 years old and was not married Williams other sons had already died Maurits in 1850 age 6 and William in 1879 aged 38 This meant that princess Wilhelmina would now be next in line to become Queen 

The princess was only three years old The King was 65 Because of the age difference the government voted for Emma to become Regent This meant that if the king died before Wilhelmina was 18 years old Emma would do the job of Queen until Wilhelmina was old enough to take over 

The health of the King went downhill fast in 1888 In May the family moved from The Hague to their palace in the quiet of Apeldoorn The king could no longer rule the country The government voted that Queen Emma would be Regent and she took the oath to rule for her husband on 20 november in The Hague She only ruled in his place for three days William died on 23rd November 1890 He was 73 years old From that day at 10 years old Wilhelmina officially became the Queen Emma became Queen regent for her daughter until 1898 

Emma worked in the same way as her husband She made sure she would meet all ministers once every fourteen days Unlike her husband she opened up for everyone who wanted to speak to her She also opened a lot of the post that was sent to her personally In her period as Queen widow regent she had to reshuffle her cabinet three times She found this a difficult task 

She also gave great care to raising her daughter She wanted to make sure her daughter would be ready to be the queen

Young Wilhelmina soon chose her own path when she became Queen She tried to get away from her mother but often had to rely on her good knowledge of protocol At first they lived together in Palace Noordeinde When Wilhelmina married Emma moved to Palace Lange Voorhout She was no longer involved in reigning the country but still would receive diplomats and other people as widow of the king

She supported the work to stop tuberculosis which was a disease many people died from at the time Her sister Sophie had died from it too

The next in line to the throne Juliana was born in 1909 The government again looked for a regent They did not think Wilhelminas husband Hendrik was good Because they had good memories of Emma as regent they requested that Emma again be Regent Wilhelmina agreed and from 1909 to 1927 Emma once again was regent This time it was not needed 

Emma died on 20th March 1934 from the complications of bronchitis

P versus NP is the name of a question that many mathematicians scientists and computer programmers want to answer P and NP are two groups of mathematical problems P problems are considered easy for computers to solve NP problems are easy only for a computer to check For example if you have an NP problem and someone says The answer to your problem is 12345 a computer can quickly figure out if the answer is right or wrong but it may take a very long time for the computer to come up with 12345 on its own

All P problems are NP problems because it is easy to check that a solution is correct by solving the problem and comparing the two solutions However people want to know about the opposite Are there any NP problems that are not P problems or are all NP problems just P problems If the NP problems are really separate from the P problems it would mean that no fast and easy ways to solve those NP problems can exist no matter how hard we look However if all NP problems are P problems it would mean that new very fast problem solving methods do exist but we havent found them yet

Since the best efforts of scientists and mathematicians havent found the easy methods for solving NP problems yet many people believe that there are NP problems that are not P problems Most mathematicians also believe this to be true but currently no one has proven it by rigorous mathematical analysis If somehow it is proven that NP and P are the same it would have a huge impact on many aspects of our life For this reason the question of P versus NP has become an important and widely studied topic

This question is so important that the Clay Mathematical Institute will give 1000000 to anyone who answers it There are many important NP problems that people dont know how to solve in a way that is faster than testing every possible answer Here are some examples

Mathematicians can show that there are some NP problems that are NP Complete An NP Complete problem is at least as difficult to solve as any other NP problem This means that if someone found a method to solve any NP Complete problem quickly they could use that same method to solve every NP problem quickly All of the problems listed above are NP Complete so if the salesman found a way to plan his trip quickly he could tell the teacher and she could use that same method to schedule the exams The farmer could use the same method to determine how many boxes she needs and the woman could use the same method find a way to build her towers 

Because a method that quickly solves one of these problems can solve them all there are many people who want to find one However because there are so many different NP Complete problems and nobody so far has found a way to solve even one of them quickly most experts believe that is not possible to find the answers to any of them quickly

Guillaume de Machaut was a Medieval French poet and composer He was the most important composer of the 14th century He is one of the earliest composers whose life we know something about

Machaut worked for John of Luxemburg king of Bohemia around 1323 The king travelled around Europe fighting and Machaut went with him working as his secretary After 1330 he became canon of several cathedrals After John of Luxemburg died during a battle in 1346 Machaut worked for Johns daughter Bonne then King Charles the Bad of Navarre Charles of Normandy who became King Charles V in 1364 and the King of Cyprus He also worked for wealthy dukes With all that work it is surprising that he had time to compose He seems to have spent his later years living in Rheins working on his compositions 

Machaut wrote many motets and the secular songs as well as many poems including rondeaus virelais and ballades Machaut wrote a mass known as Messe de Nostre Dame It is the earliest known setting of the complete text for the mass and it had a lot of influence on later composers

Many of his poems belong to the type which were known as dits A dit was a poem that was not meant to be sung It was in the first person Many of them are about a lover trying to get the attentions of a lady he loves

Machauts poetry had an influence on many later poets including Geoffrey Chaucer

Protin was a medieval composer He was probably French Nothing is known about his life except that he worked in or around Paris in the late 12th century to early 13th century People have tried to find out who he was by studying the archives of Notre Dame Cathedral but his name has not been found there He probably had another name and used the name Protin for his compositions 

Protin worked on a very important collection of polyphonic music called Magnus Liber The composer Lonin had written a lot of this music He may have been Protins teacher but we do not know He seems to have written music for four voices which are settings of words for the Feast of the Circumcision and St Stephens Day He wrote three and four voice music of a type called organum It was a very important development in the history of Western music He wrote music in a polyphonic style Often he took a tune and arranged it so that one voice sang it incredibly slowly while another voice sang something much faster on top

It is difficult to work out any dates for his works because of the way the music was written Often it is not even clear what mode they are in

Protins music has been an influence on some 20th century composers who wrote minimalist music such as Steve Reich

The nearby Stratford International station will open on 13 December 2009 when Southeastern begins its domestic high speed service between St Pancras and Kent In mid 2010 an extension of the Docklands Light Railway over part of the North London Line will link the two stations using platforms 1 and 2 after the North London Line is rerouted to two new platforms located to the north of the existing platform 12 The existing subway links which connect the ticket hall to the Central Line and Great Eastern platforms will be extended northwards to the new North London Line platforms The platforms were originally scheduled to open in January 2009 but this has been delayed The platforms were opened on 14 April 2009FactdateApril 2009

There are also plans to build an additional westbound Central Line platform numbered 3A to allow passengers to leave the train on both sides and thus reduce dwell times for trains serving central London at peak hours This will be connected to the existing infrastructure built for the Jubilee Line Extension at the mezzanine level Along with this new platform there are plans to build a new ticket hall at the eastern end of the mezzanine This will relieve congestion at the existing ticket hall

In preparation for the Olympics and the Stratford City development a new north facing exit and ticket hall will be constructed Both existing passenger subways will be extended north to connect with the ticket hall and the abandoned subway at the eastern end of the station which formed part of the old station complex will be reopened and refurbished to allow interchange between platforms 3 through to new high level 1 2 A new pedestrian bridge may also be built to connect Stratford shopping centre with the Stratford City development This pedestrian link will also connect the mezzanine level ticket hall with the northern ticket hall

Lonin is the first composer we know about who wrote organum a kind of church music We know nothing about his life He was probably French He seems to have worked at Notre Dame Cathedral because he wrote a collection of music called Magnus Liber or at least he wrote some of it This book has music for two voices It was designed for services at Notre Dame A younger composer called Protin did some more work on the collection changing some of it

Dmitri Kabalevsky was a Russian Soviet composer

Kabalevsky is particularly well known as a composer of childrens music He wrote a lot of piano music Many of these pieces are short pieces for children who are learning the piano He also wrote larger works such as concertos for the piano and violin In 1918 his family moved to Moscow where he had formal lessons in music at the Scriabin Musical Institute He was known for attempting to get children involved in music In 1925 he began his training at the Moscow Conservatory studying composition with Catoire and later with Miaskovsky also continuing piano studies with Goldenveyzer

Symphony No 5 in C minor Op 67 is a symphony that was composed by Ludwig van Beethoven It is the fifth of the nine symphonies that he composed It was written between 1804 and 1808 This symphony is one of the most popular and well known works of classical music

There are four movements an opening sonata allegro a slower andante and a fast scherzo which leads straight in to the broken wikt linkattaccaattacca to the finale 

The symphony was first performed in Viennas Theater an der Wien in 1808 His Sixth Symphony was also performed for the first time at the same concert The Fifth Symphony soon became recognized as one of the most important musical works

The symphony begins with a four note short short short long motif which is heard twice 

The opening of the symphony is so famous that it has often been quoted Other composers have used it in their compositions eg Sergei Rachmaninoff in his song Fate It has often been used in popular culture from disco to rock and roll and in film and television During World War II the BBC used the four note motif to introduce its radio news broadcasts because short short short long spells the letter V in Morse code The V meant Victory It was played very quietly on a drum People in Nazi occupied countries who wanted to hear the news listened in secret to the BBC news because it was more likely to be true

The third movement of the symphony uses this rhythm sometimes as an accompaniment 

When Beethoven wrote this symphony he was in his mid thirties He was becoming more and more deaf He found this terribly hard to bear He thought that he of all people should have perfect hearing He felt very depressed but he decided not to commit suicide but to stay alive and write down all the music he had in his head He wrote about this in a letter called the Heiligenstadt Testament

The opening of the Fifth Symphony sounds very bold and heroic The whole symphony is sounds like a struggle which starts from those four notes People have often said that those four notes represent fate knocking at the door By the time we get to the last movement the music has become major instead of minor It sounds as if Beethoven has overcome his depression

The fourth movement of this symphony is one of the first times a trombones or a piccolo is used in a symphony

The spectrum of a ring is a thing studied in the branch of mathematics called Algebraic Geometry This construction allows us to think of abstract mathematical objects as functions acting over some geometric space In this case the most natural geometric space is called the spectrum of the ring

A commutative ring is a set of elements in which you can add and multiply and have multiplication distribute over addition An example of a commutative ring is the set of integers If we add two integers we get an integer and if we multiply two integers we get another integer Moreover multiplication distributes in the sense that if a and b and c are integers then ccacb

Homotopies are things studied in a branch of mathematics known as Algebraic Topology A homotopy is a deformation of one thing into another without cutting it For example if we imagine an object made out of rubber then all the shapes we can stretch or twist it into are homotopy equivalent One famous example is the homotopy equivalence of a coffee cup and a donut To a topologist these two shapes are the same

Fossil remains on the dry Nullarbor Plain show that humans and climate change caused the extinction of the Australian megafauna around 45000 years ago

The Marsupial Lion is closely related to the wombat and the koala and not the cat family It looked like a cat with strong claws and very powerful jaws Scientists have worked out that the Marsupial Lion had the most powerful bite of any animal alive or extinct It was able to hunt animals like the giant kangaroo and the giant wombat but its big jaw would have made it hard to hunt and kill small animals The Marsupial Lion could weigh up to convert130kglb0lkonabbron It was about convert15mft0lkonabbron long and stood about convert75cmft0lkonabbron tall

Fossil bones of the Marsupial Lion have been found in caves on the Nullabor Plain Scientists say that these bones are between 400000 to 800000 years old In 2006 cave paintings were found in northwest Australia showing the Marsupial Lion The pictures show that the lions had a striped back tufted tail and pointy ears The long drought in south east Victoria has dried out many lakes In 2009 a farmer near Ballarat discovered fossil footprints and a jaw bone of a marsupial lion preserved in limestone in a dry lake bed

The term noble savage is an idea people had Without civilization humans are essentially good it is civilisation that makes them act in bad ways The idea started in the 17th century and developed in the 18th century One of the first to express it was Shaftesbury He told the would be author to search for that simplicity of manners and innocence of behaviour which has been often known among mere savages ere they were corrupted by our commerce His counter to the doctrine of original sin born amid the optimistic atmosphere of Renaissance humanism was taken up by another author who lived at the same time the essayist Richard Steele who attributed the corruption of contemporary manners to false education

In the eighteenth century cult of Primitivism the noble savage uncorrupted by the influences of civilization was considered more worthy more authentically noble than the contemporary product of civilized training Although the phrase noble savage first appeared in Drydens The Conquest of Granada the idealized picture of natures gentleman was an aspect of eighteenth century sentimentalism among other forces at work 

During the seventeenth century as an aspect of Romantic Primitivism the figure of the Good Savage was held up as a reproach to European civilization then in the throes of savage wars of religion People were especially horrified by the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew in which some 20000 men women and children were massacred chiefly in Paris but also throughout France in a three day period This led Montaigne to write his famous essay Of Cannibals in which he stated that although cannibals ceremoniously eat each other Europeans behave even more barbarously and burn each other alive for disagreeing about religion The treatment of indigenous peoples by the Spanish Conquistadors also produced a great deal of bad conscience and recriminations Bartolom de las Casas who witnessed it may have been the first to idealize the simple life of the indigenous Americans He and other observers praised the simple manners of the indigenous Americans and reported that they were incapable of lying European guilt over colonialism with its use of recently invented guns on people who did not have them inspired fictional treatments such as Aphra Behns novel Oroonoko or the Royal Slave about a slave revolt in Surinam in the West Indies Behns story was not primarily a protest against slavery but was written for money and it met readers expectations by following the conventions of the European romance novella The leader of the revolt Oroonoko is truly noble in that he is a hereditary African prince and he laments his lost African homeland in the traditional terms of a Golden Age He is not a savage but dresses and behaves like a European aristocrat Behns story was adapted for the stage by Irish playwright Thomas Southerne who stressed its sentimental aspects and as time went on it came to be seen as addressing the issues of slavery and colonialism remaining very popular throughout the Eighteenth Century

In English the phrase Noble Savage first appeared in Drydens play The Conquest of Granada I am as free as nature first made man Ere the base laws of servitude began When wild in woods the noble savage ran However the term Noble Savage only began to be widely used in the last half of the nineteenth century and then as a term of disparagement In French the term had been the Good Savage and in French the word savage did not necessarily have the connotations of cruelty we now associate with it but meant wild as in a wild flower 

The idealized picture of Natures Gentleman was an aspect of eighteenth century sentimentalism along with other stock figures such as the Virtuous Milkmaid the Servant More Clever than the Master and the general theme of virtue in the lowly born Natures Gentleman whether European born or exotic takes his place among these tropes along with the Wise Egyptian Persian and Chinaman He had always existed from the time of the epic of Gilgamesh where he appears as Enkiddu the wild but good man who lives with animals and the untutored but noble medieval knight Parsifal Even the Biblical David the shepherd boy falls into this category Indeed that virtue and lowly birth can coexist is a time honored tenet of Abrahamic religion most conspicuously so in the case of the Founder of the Christian religion Likewise the idea that withdrawal from societyand specifically from citiesis associated with virtue is originally a religious one

Hayy ibn Yaqdhan an Islamic philosophical tale by Ibn Tufail from twelfth century Andalusia straddles the divide between the religious and the secular The tale is of interest because it was known to the New England Puritan divine Cotton Mather Translated in to English in 1686 and 1708 it tells the story of Hayy a wild child raised by a gazelle without human contact on a deserted island in the Indian Ocean Purely through the use of his reason Hayy goes through all the gradations of knowledge before emerging into human society where he revealed to be a believer of Natural religion which Cotton Mather as a Christian Divine identified with Primitive Christianity The figure of Hayy is both a Natural man and a Wise Persian but not a Noble Savage

The locus classicus of the eighteenth century portrayal of the American Indian is that of Alexander Pope unquestionably the most famous and widely translated poet of his day In his philosophical poem Essay on Man Pope wrote Lo the poor Indian whose untutord mind Sees God in clouds or hears him in the wind His soul proud Science never taught to stray  Far as the solar walk or milky way  Yet simple Nature to his hope has givn  Behind the cloud toppd hill a humbler heavn Some safer world in depth of woods embracd Some happier island in the watry waste  Where slaves once more their native land behold  No fiends torment no Christians thirst for gold  To be contents his natural desire  He asks no angels wing no seraphs fire  But thinks admitted to that equal sky  His faithful dog shall bear him company

Popes poem expresses the typical Age of Reason belief that men are everywhere and in all times the same which was also Christian doctrine He portrays his Indian as a victim who although less learned and with less aspirations than his European counterpart is as good or better and hence equally worthy of salvation He is a bon sauvage but not a noble one

In the first century CE all of these qualities had been attributed by Tacitus to the German barbarians in his Germania in which he contrasted them repeatedly with the softened Romanized corrupted Gauls by inference criticizing his own Roman culture for getting away from its rootswhich was the perennial function of such comparisons The Germans did not inhabit a Golden Age of ease but were tough and inured to hardship qualities which Tacitus saw as preferable to the softness of civilized life In antiquity this form of hard Primitivism whether viewed as desirable or seen as something to escape co existed in rhetorical opposition to the soft Primitivism of visions of a lost Golden Age of ease and plenty

The legendary toughness and martial valor of the Spartans were also admired throughout the ages by hard Primitivists and in the Eighteenth Century a Scottish writer described Highland countrymen this way

They greatly excel the Lowlanders in all the exercises that require agility they are incredibly abstemious and patient of hunger and fatigue so steeled against the weather that in traveling even when the ground is covered with snow they never look for a house or any other shelter but their plaid in which they wrap themselves up and go to sleep under the cope of heaven Such people in quality of soldiers must be invincible

Heating oil is oil that is burned as fuel in furnaces inside of buildings The oil is usually delivered by tanker truck to individual homes and business places and the oil is stored in oil tanks in the basement or outside next to the building If oil leaks into the ground its an environmental problem because even a small leak can cause major groundwater pollution making the water from wells and springs unusable because chemicals from the oil are harmful to both humans and animals Heating oil is usually dyed to make sure it is not confused with vehicle fuel

Heating oil also known as No 2 fuel oil accounts for about 25 of the output of a barrel of crude oil the second biggest cut after gasoline 

Among processed fuels the need for heating oil has been going down while the usage of liquefied petroleum gas has increased

Investors and suppliers trade contracts that promise the delivery of large amounts of heating oil before a certain date in the future at a specific price These futures contracts trade in units of 42000 gallons which is the same as 1000 barrels Prices are based on delivery in New York City harbor the main cash market trading center

In mathematics a distribution is a generalisation of a function Distributions were introduced in the middle of the 20th century by Laurent Schwartz who received a Fields Medal for his work on them The Fields medal is comparable to a Nobel Prize in mathematics which does not exist 

Distributions were introduced to model certain concepts from Physics Physics has the concept of a mass of points in space The Dirac delta function can model an electromagnetic charge of a point in space The Dirac delta function is zero everywhere except at one point where it is infinitely large This needs to be the case because the density function needs to be 1 There is no function that can meet this criterion except if integraton is taken as a function in the mathematical sense

Today distributions are used in different fields of mathematics and physics for example to model Partial differential equations or Fourier analyses which are important for Quantum electrodynamics or signal processing

Macro photography is a kind of photography Macro photography is about photographing objects that are very close to the lens the film or the sensor Using the classic definition in macro photography the image shown on the film plane is nearly as big as the object photographed There are different ways to achieve this The most common one is to use a specialised macro lens Such lenses are good at focussing sharply on a small area approaching the size of the film frame Most 35mm format macro lenses achieve at least 12 that is to say the image on the film is half the size of the object being photographed Many 35mm macro lenses are 11 meaning the image on the film is the same size as the object being photographed Another important difference is that lenses designed for macro are usually at their sharpest at macro focus distances and are not quite as sharp at other focus distances

In recent years the term macro has been used in marketing material to mean being able to focus on a subject close enough so that when a regular 64 inch print is made the image is life size or larger With 35mm film this requires a magnification ratio of only approximately 14 which demands less of lens quality than 11 With digital cameras the actual image size is rarely stated so that the magnification ratio is largely irrelevant cameras instead advertise their closest focussing distance

There are two main problems with macro photography

The Palestinian people also referred to as Palestinians or Palestinian Arabs are an Arabic speaking people with family origins in Palestine The total Palestinian population including descendants is estimated at approximately 10 million roughly half continuing to live in the region of historic Palestine an area encompassing Israel proper the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip and Jordan In this combined area as of 2009 they constitute a majority of 51 of all inhabitants some of whom are internally displaced persons The remainder just over half of all Palestinians comprise what is known as the Palestinian diaspora most of whom are stateless Palestinian refugees lacking citizenship in any country Of the diaspora over two and a half million live in neighboring Jordan one million is shared between Syria and Lebanon a quarter million in Saudi Arabia and Chiles half a million is the largest concentration outside the Arab world

By religious affiliation most Palestinians are Muslim particularly of the Sunni branch of Islam and there is a significant Palestinian Christian minority of various Christian denominations as well as smaller religious communities As the commonly applied term Palestinian Arab ethnonym implies the current traditional vernacular of Palestinians irrespective of religion is the Palestinian dialect of Arabic For those who are citizens of Israel known also as Arab Israelis many are now also bilingual in Modern Hebrew Recent genetic evidence has demonstrated that Palestinians as an ethnic group represent modern descendants of a core population that lived in the area since prehistoric times largely predating the Arabian Muslim conquest that resulted in their acculturation and established Arabic as the lingua franca which eventually became the sole vernacular of the locals most of whom would over time also convert to Islam from various prior faiths

The first widespread use of Palestinian as an endonym to refer to the nationalist concept of a Palestinian people by the local Arabic speaking population of Palestine began prior to the outbreak of World War I and the first demand for national independence was issued by the Syrian Palestinian Congress on 21 September 1921 After the creation of Israel the exodus of 1948 and more so after the exodus of 1967 the term came to signify not only a place of origin but the sense of a shared past and future in the form of a Palestinian nation state The Palestine Liberation Organization represents the Palestinian people before the international community The Palestinian National Authority officially established as a result of the Oslo Accords is an interim administrative body nominally responsible for governance in Palestinian population centres in the West Bank and Gaza Strip

The Narwhal is a rarely seen Arctic whale This social whale is known for the very long tooth that males have Very little is known about this whale Narwhal means corpse whale in Old Norse

All narwhals have two teeth in their upper jaw After the first year of a male narwhals life its left tooth grows outward spirally This long single tooth projects from its upper jaw and can grow to be 875 feet long Tusks are usually twisted in a counterclockwise direction and are hollow inside The tusks function is uncertain perhaps used as a formidable jousting weapon in courtship and dominance rivalry in getting food andor for channeling and amplifying sonar pulses The tusk is not used in hunting Long ago narwhal sightings probably reinforced the unicorn legends In fact when people found the horn of a dead narwhal washed up on shore they thought that they had found the horn of a unicorn

Narwhal can dive deep into the sea to around 800 meters but can also sometimes dive up to 1500 meters This makes them one of the deepest diving sea mammals

Narwhals live in the icy waters of the Arctic seas They do not go far away from ice Narwhals are migrating animals who like to move from one place to live in another place for a while 

When it is warm in summer groups of them move closer to land where they can sometimes be seen in the estuaries deep fjords and bays of Greenland and Northern Canada 

These groups can be as big as 10 or even as big as 100 sometimes But when Winter comes around again they move back to the Icy waters where they breath from small holes in the ice Every so often lucky people get to see them in North West Russia

Narwhals like to eat Arctic fish such as Arctic Cod but they also like to eat both shrimp and squid  

Narwhals are both hunted by polar bears and killer whales Sometimes however even humans hunt Narwhals The native Inuit people who are sometimes called the Eskimos are allow to hunt the Narwhals for food 

The Vailala Madness was a religious movement It was active between 1919 and 1922 Many people think it was one the first cargo cults even though that term was first used in the 1940s The Vailala Madness was active in the Papuan Gulf which was a territory of Australia at the time but now belongs to Papua New Guinea 

The Vailala Madness got its name from the behaviour of people who took part in it This behaviour included glossolalia shaking and signs of mental or emotional disturbances In the indigenous language people who were taking part in the Vailala Madness called it iki haveve or belly dont know which was another way of saying dizziness

The people in the movement thought that a Ghost Steamer would come This ship would be piloted by dead people who were coming back The dead people would bring with them cargo with tinned food and tools In one version of the story the dead people would bring guns to kick the white colonizers out but not everybody agrees that this was what people in the Vailala Madness actually believed

The Bradshaw Trail nicknamed the Gold Road at one time is a historic trail which used to be a stagecoach route in Southern California

This road used to connect San Bernardino California to gold fields in La Paz Arizona known today as Ehrenberg It was the first road connecting Riverside County to the Colorado River

The part which remains today is a graded dirt road which crosses southeastern Riverside County and a part of Imperial County beginning roughly 12 miles19km east of North Shore and ending about 14 miles23km southwest of Blythe for a total of 70 miles113km

The trail is named for trailblazer William David Bradshaw who first crossed the area in 1862 A former forty niner Bradshaw knew that the northern gold mines were rapidly emptying and that miners and other people leaving the area would need a more direct trail from the south across the desert to the new gold strike at La Paz Without a direct trail they would have to travel a great distance southeast to Yuma then north up the river to La Paz Bradshaw was a smart man he knew there were lots of chances to make money in a gold boomtown

Originally 180 miles290km long the western end of the trail began east of San Bernardino in the San Gorgonio Pass Bradshaw and his party travelled southeast to the northern tip of the Salton Sink turning due east to the foothills of the Orocopia Mountains and an existing stage stop called Dos Palmas 

Leaving Dos Palmas the men continued eastward between the Orocopia and Chocolate mountain ranges briefly passing by the southern end of the Chuckwalla range and ending at the Palo Verde Valley Once they crossed the Colorado River the party rode upstream for about four miles to the gold fields Despite the fact that the trail crossed mostly barren desert there was lots of water to be found at water holes found at roughly thirty mile48km intervals

Between 1862 and 1877 the Bradshaw Trail was the main route between Southern California and the La Paz gold fields

The remaining part of the Bradshaw Trail mostly crosses public land The extreme eastern end of the trail at Ripley does not Use of a four wheel drive vehicle is recommended to travel across the trail There are no services on the trail itself 

Another fact to consider is the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range which borders a part of the Bradshaw Trail to the south This is a live bombing range and is clearly marked

Wileys Well is a remote natural artesian well in the Colorado Desert of Southern California It is also the name of the area around it

It is named after Palo Verde storekeeper and postmaster AP Wiley In 1907 Mr Wiley dug deep into a shallow well dug in 1876 by a stagecoach company which used the nearby Bradshaw Trail Wiley made the well larger since he hoped that he could attract business to his remote desert store The well was taken care of by local ranchers and cattlemen for years afterward However the rapidly falling level of the water meant a drop of the waters depth to 6018m within a dozen years Today the wells original depth is only about 206m at best after wet weather The water in the well is not good for drinking

In 1985 the Bureau of Land Management drilled a new well 965294m deep to support the new Wileys Well Campground one of only two developed campgrounds in the Mule Mountains Long Term Visitor Area The water is both hot at 90F32C and full of minerals The water is pumped into a cistern to help cool it to drinking temperature

Wileys Well is popular with rockhounds They have been coming to Wileys Well since the 1930s with the discovery of geode beds Even though Wileys Well has been very popular with rockhounds over the decades the area remains rich with such minerals as chalcedony citrine quartz crystals rhyolite and jasper Though winters are mild making the campground popular with visitors who visit every year from colder areas summer can be extremely hot with recorded temperatures as high as 130F54C 

Wileys Well is easy to reach It is off the Wileys Well Road exit from Interstate 10 sixteen miles26km west of Blythe The entrance to the campground is nine miles14km south of the highway 

Alphonse of Poitiers or Alfonso or Alphonse was the Count of Poitou from 1225 and Count of Toulouse from 1247

Alphonse was a son of Louis VIII King of France and Blanche of Castile He was a younger brother of Louis IX of France and an older brother of Charles I of Sicily

The Treaty of Paris stipulated that a brother of King Louis was to marry Joan of Toulouse daughter of Raymond VII of Toulouse and so in 1237 Alphonse married her

Honest and moderate protecting the middle classes against exactions of the nobles he exercised a happy influence upon the south in spite of his naturally despotic character and his continual and pressing need of money He is noted for ordering the first recorded local expulsion of Jews when he did so in Poitou in 1249

Aside from the crusades Alfonso stayed primarily in Paris governing his estates by officials inspectors who reviewed the officials work and a constant stream of messages

When Louis IX again engaged in a crusade Alphonse again raised a large sum of money and accompanied his brother This time however he did not return to France dying while on his way back probably at Savona in Italy on 21 August 1271

Willem Alexander Prince of Orange is the Dutch crown prince and heir apparent of Queen Beatrix He is her oldest son He is married to Maxima Zorreguita from Argentina and has three daughters by her The daughters are named Amalia Alexia Ariane

Karst Tates was a Dutchman who tried to harm the Dutch Royal Family by making his car collide with the Royal Bus This event happened in Apeldoorn Netherlands on 30 April 2009 the Dutch national holiday of Queens Day He did not succeed but killed 7 people who were watching the festivities and himself

According to a policeman who claimed having talked to Tates Tates said immediately after the crash that he had wanted to hit the members of the Royal Family that had just passed there in an open bus because Willem Alexander was a racist and a fascist in his view After having been brought to hospital Tates died from his wounds

Lists of the Counties and Principal Areas of the United Kingdom

The United Kingdom has different sorts of counties Some are traditional areas and some are for local government or other government things

These counties are sometimes called historic counties traditional counties or ancient or geographical counties People argue about how much they exist in law They are useful for genealogical and historic matters Anyone may choose to use traditional counties or not

The traditional counties have had nothing to do with government since 1889 However until 1974 most local government counties were very like them

The United Kingdom has 92 traditional counties

The areas used for local government are different in different parts of the United Kingdom They have different names too

Northern Ireland is one region and there are 26 districts within it  In parts of England there are local government counties with districts in them In other parts there are counties with just one district and in those parts there is only one council which is the district council or the county council Greater London is not a county it has London Borough Councils and a Greater London Authority In Scotland there are local government areas but most people call them council areas In Wales there are principal areas Some councils areas in Wales are called counties and others county boroughs

The Queen appoints officers called lord lieutenants The areas in which they have their duties are usually called ceremonial county except in Scotland where they are lieutenancy areas A lord lieutenant and a high sheriff is appointed to each ceremonial county In Scotland a lord lieutenant only is appointed to each lieutenancy area

A ceremonial county in England and Wales is a local government county or a group of local government counties In Northern Ireland it is a county or county borough

In the light dependent reaction light energy from the sun is used to split water which has been sucked in by plants by transpiration Water when broken makes oxygen hydrogen and electrons These electrons move through structures in chloroplasts and by chemiosmosis make ATP

The hydrogen is converted to NADPH which is then used in the light independent reactions Oxygen diffuses out of the plant as a waste product of photosynthesis This all happens in the grana of chloroplasts

Holes in the reaction centres are always being filled by electrons from water molecules

Colin Flannery was the first to propose the idea that photosynthesis needs light in 1779 He recognized it was sunlight falling on plants that was required although Joseph Priestly had noted the production of oxygen without the association with light in 1772 Cornelius Van Niel proposed in 1931 that photosynthesis is a case of general mechanism where a photon of light is used to photo decompose a hydrogen donor and the hydrogen being used to reduce chemCO2 Then in 1939 Robin Hill showed that isolated chloroplasts would make oxygen but not fix chemCO2 showing the light and dark reactions occurred in different places This led later to the discovery of photosystem 1 and 2

Light independent reactions take place within the chloroplasts During this reaction sugars are made using carbon dioxide and the products of the light dependent reactions and various other chemicals found in the plant during the Calvin cycle Therefore the light independent reaction cannot happen without the light dependent reaction Sugars made in the light independent reactions are moved around the plant by translocation

Hello all

I have found out that the following seem to often be subjects for articles

Personally I do see a few problems with such articles

Please remember that at the same time this Wikipedia lacks major articles about history and culture in general Is there a way to get a to do list of articles that we still need to be usable by our target audience  I mean you cannot blame people for using EnWP if we simply do not have the content

Yotcmdr talk to the commander 1011 9 May 2009

I do agree that we need to focus a bit more on quality over quantity but having semi permanent stubs isnt actually harming anything per se At the very least it raises the visibility of the project which Im hopeful would bring in a bit of fresh blood more now and then EVula talk 1617 9 May 2009 MC8  rather than telling an editor they cant edit in an area I would recommend to the editor individually that they consider redirecting some of their energy to areas of the encyclopedia that are more core but which they are interested For the person creating stubs about TV shows perhaps we should point out that the articles on television fiction television network and media studies are still incomplete and ask them to spend some of their time on these articles This way we would gain your valuable edits to the more central articles from those very editors who would be chased away by a ban  Philosopher Let us reason together 0027 10 May 2009

Hello all

just wanted to remind you that Abortion has been moved to be voted on as a proposed good article and that the vote for Bloc Party as a proposed very good article is running for another two days 

It would really be nice if you could express your opinion on these as well as other candidates in the respective categories  Eptalon 0902 10 May 2009

I have just realised why I dont really work on articles here Its because Simple English Wikipedias audience simply cannot work as we are now According to the Main Page our audience is for people who are a Learning English b Children This simply cannot work though Why The existence of articles such as Autofellatio Goatse etc Why on earth would someone want to improve their English by learning about someone sucking their parts or looking up a mans behind And obviously such articles are totally inappropriate for children

A fairly radical change is needed I attended the Wikimedia UK AGM on Sunday where there was a rep from Schools Wikipedia He mentioned that they used articles from enwiki and I wondered why they didnt use us The level of English in our articles is great for school age children He explained that our coverage was sparse This is because we concentrate our efforts on things that arent that important instead of important articles such as politics protein or potato

What I suggest

There are probably more things but Im just putting these thought out in the open The problem is I dont know why Im contributing to Simple On English Wikipedia my articles will be read by anyone interested in the topic who does a google search On Simple not so Its just ridiculous to say this site is for children when we have articles on sex positions We need to stop messing about and get ourselves a proper aim My suggestion is make the audience school age children and articles within the scope of anything that could be conceivably learned about or discussed in a school Majorly talk 1514 28 April 2009

An even more radical suggestion I suggest we do not allow stubs anymore If one wants to work on an article over a period they should have some time to leave a temporary stub notice but once again we should be thinking quality not quantity Some seem to be on a mission to create every bit of rock or cell that ever existed and will be perma stubs of six words that dont teach anyone anything or are identical to enwiki which would obviously be first in the results of a search engine Majorly talk 1541 28 April 2009

Majorly has some good points and Id agree we need a purpose Failing that Simple is just a poor version of EN If I had kids Id prefer them to use EN than here just because the articles are of a superior quality Here it seems editors can churn out any old rubbish just to boost edit counts However I would point out that aiming to an audience of 11 16 is not easy and there is a reason why teachers are of a certain age and academic background All in all Id support and would go so far as to suggest a reboot so that these radical changes can be implemented Soup Dish 1544 28 April 2009

My thought is that we should hijack the already dead article improvement drive and nominate articles one at a time such as World War II and work on them collaboratively for a couple of weeks each The Rambling Man 1605 28 April 2009

Comments 1 Id drop the second part and keep the children 2 I may be wrong but it seems the majority of our active community havent actually got a high school education  yet  so thats a lofty goal 3 Yes could be delete 4 Tough love is sometimes the way

Commment I see a problem in all this If the for children part of the reason for the project is dropped would the project do enough to justify it remaining WMF sanctioned As things stand it is easier for those with a less than comprehensive understanding of English to use the well written EN project than the one we offer here Removing for all ages would put this project on very shaky foundations in my opinion Soup Dish 2021 7 May 2009

Id like to start a few straw polls Although this is generally a poor way of coming to consensus I feel that this discussion has reached a bit of a stand still and Id like to get an idea of how the community feels on a few proposals 

For a while Simple English has been a place where banned en users could continue to edit Some people may say that we are a refuge and give deserving people a second change Others would say that someone banned from en should be banned from all WMF projects Our current policy reads as follows

The proposal is to reword our policy to generally not allow banned users from EN to edit on Simple Also temporarily blocked users would not be allowed to edit on Simple either until the expiry of their block on EN Those who are able to edit here before an administrator notices the EN block may be permitted to keep editing on a one strike rule at the administrators discretion Please leave comments beside your vote EhJJTALK 0318 2 May 2009

There has been some discussion about the scope of our project Some believe we should focus on children others on teenagers others on adults with learning difficulties or adults who speak english as a second language I believe the best option is to write articles that would be readable by people of all ages Our current scope is defined as

I think a lot of common sense is needed here Articles should for the most part be written for an adult audience Most children will not want to read about Rembrandt while many teenagers or adults will On the other hand children will want to read about the Sun but to a much more superficial level than an adult reader would also want to read about the Sun As such I suggest that we provide when appropriate two versions of the article One that explains complex ideas in simple words plus an additional version that contains only simple ideas in simple words This would be similar to how the first line of enGeneral relativity says For a generally accessible and less technical introduction to the topic see enIntroduction to general relativity Please leave comments with your vote EhJJTALK 0318 2 May 2009

Hello all

what I write below is longer as usual and it is my opinion so you are free to disagree I think we ought to do something about the general way the GAVGA process works What I say below both apply to GAs and VGAs The two processes are only different in two or three minor things but otherwise work the same way FOr this reason I will only speak about VGAs below but still mean GAs all the same

At the moment the process

I think we really need to revise the process as a whole In general I see the following changes

Please note that the current candidates would still use the current criteria any new criteria or procedures would only apply to candidates submitted after a certain date to be agreed on 

As always these are just my observations In the interest of keeping the GAVGA process alive I think we had better adapt it I am open for other peoples ideas  Eptalon 1014 11 May 2009

Alright considering that this is starting to look like someone requesting a mass deletion of all the one line stubs I would like to say that if they exist on the English Wikipedia why cant they exist here Furthermore people have been very opposed to the removal of short stubs because even though they are short now someone could stumble upon them to add information on them in the future I think that deleting the articles just because of how short they are is counter productive towards our goal here of creating a comprehensive encyclopedia in Simple English If these stubs meet all of the requirements in order to get a page on this Wikipedia why should they be deleted What rules do they break other than the shortness of the articles People just need to learn to accept that a Wikipedia will always have short articles like these short stubs and move on with their lives It is counter productive to squabble about short stubs when we can be improving existing articles or writing new ones 

Some people are better at writing stubs than they are fully fledged articles and therefore if we stop allowing stubs to be created or make it so that they have to be a certain length in order to stay on this site you are pushing away potential good editors from this site Writing short stubs like these are in the Wikipedia spirits so why should it matter if they exist on the Simple English Wikipedia Razorflame 1936 12 May 2009

While I hate the idea of deleting stubs I dont think I realized the numbers of each of those types were that bigthat was rediculous to create that many and at numbers that high it quite clearly had to be editcoutitis Djsasso 0356 13 May 2009This might be interesting reading Some more stats when using SpecialRandom NotGiven 1017 13 May 2009

I will explain why this is a big deal On the English Wikipedia there are millions of articles on a broad range of topics On this project we have a few thousand articles so this mass creation of stubs is polluting the project with tiny articles that are of no use to our readers Simple English Wikipedia is slowly but surely becoming an asteroid and Romanian river depository with a few other articles alongside This is not a healthy way forward PeterSymonds 1215 13 May 2009

One of the things I think you are missing Razor is that they are stubs of all the same subject Having 50 of the project as stubs would not be a big deal if they werent all romanian rivers or asteroids If you could atleast admit that you knew creating this one line stubs was just a way to inflate your numbers then maybe going forward might be easier Its fairly obvious that these stubs were easy targets as they were one sentence long and didnt require simpliication from the english version Djsasso 1404 13 May 2009

Simple has lots of problems One Simple does not have enough users that know how to write articles Two Simple is a difficult project to create articles for because the project rules makes it difficult to write quality articles Although I do not like stubs the average reader at Simple is not going to care Remember this is Simple and not the English Wikipedia We shouldnt rely on what en does We are a different project with different goals and different ways of doing things Griffinofwales 1951 13 May 2009

Just a quick question I saw this article and wasnt sure of its notability Do you think it should have its own article or just split into kidney beans and rice Ive done a quick cleanup on it anyway just incase NotGiven 0904 13 May 2009

Hello all

there are very few candidate proposals to the GAVGA process So lets look at it from another side rather than finding articles that might be suitable lets ask the community what broad subject areas they want covered with a GA or VGA People are more likely to work on articles they are interested in even that may mean more work I will make a start and tell you what I personally think we still need

Keep in mind that if we do a VGA about a subject the article will be tagged in other wikipedias That way we might attract editors as well But please do leave comments as it may help finding common subjects for better quality articles many people will be interested in  Eptalon 1001 17 May 2009

Hi I propose the 800 character rule for DYK be dropped as otherwise the project will die With the couple of editors helping out its very complicated Regards Yotcmdr talk to the commander 1051 13 May 2009

It is very easy to find a hook close to the needed 800 characters and expand it using the wikipedia article and references I just wrote a DYK candidate Can someone make it more readable easier without making it shorter Im having trouble with that because I am no native speaker of English J B A Evhh 1214 13 May 2009

Would it not be better to change to the norm to 1000 characters instead AlAf 0749 14 May 2009

It seems as if general consensus here is keeping the criteria at the 800 character rule or in other words we keep it as is Thanks RyanCross 0556 18 May 2009

Ok its clear that our RfA system is broken Its been clear for a while now But Mentifistos has done it for me Just look at the vote strikes changes Users should not be voting until they are sure of their vote They should be looking through contributions and assessing the user not just jumping on the bandwaggon I dont know how to solve this Not opening voting until after a few days Changing to a discussion format rather than a vote All I know is that we need to fix it because frankly im getting fed up of this wiki Big changes need to happen and NOW Goblin 1147 14 May 2009 What I believe Bluegoblin7 is trying to drive at is that most of us do not assess the candidates contributions thoroughly before placing their vote Under normal circumstances the community should be able to spot the low number of edits to Wikipedia namespace Chenzw Talk 1513 14 May 2009 Hello there I have not looked at all contributions of the editor in question before voting Rather I have voted based on those edits of the contributor I have seen Personally I think that there should be a good mix of contributions that is they should be distributed over all sections A very good example for this is this page end of May 9 my time we were at a total size of roughly 57Kb for the page at the time of this posting 5 days later the size almost doubled and stands at 93k If the bot works as planned its running tonight will archive about half the content How much use has grown out of these 40k added over the last 4 days  how is what is posted here directly related to improving the Wikipedia  We have found out that possibly we have a large number of stubs and that improving them to be useful beyond what they are now might take a long time We have also seen that the processes behind the two ways we currently have to focus people on articles are straining to the point that they are ignored by a large number of editors  In that context can I perhaps ask what difference it makes if an editor contributed actively to the Wikipedia namespace before becoming an admin  Eptalon 1637 14 May 2009

The Krebs cycle or citric acid cycle is a part of cellular respiration It comes after the link reaction and provides the hydrogen and electrons needed for the electron transport chain It happens inside mitochondria 

The details of the reactions are beyond the scope of this wiki but the diagram below shows how this part of respiration is an ever repeating cycle which produces ATP and gives off CO2 The ATP is a molecule which carries energy in chemical form to be used in other cell processes To summarize 

Because two acetyl CoA molecules are produced from each glucose molecule two cycles are required per glucose molecule Therefore at the end of two cycles the products are two GTP six NADH two QH2 and four CO2 

Coenzyme A is an enzyme used in making fatty acids and accepting chemicals in the Link reaction and Krebs cycle 

A molecule of coenzyme A carrying an acetyl group is called acetyl CoA

In organic chemistry acetyl is a functional group the acyl of acetic acid with chemical formula COCH3

The acetyl group contains a methyl group bonded to a carbonyl with a lone electron left over This electron forms a chemical bond to the rest of the molecule

The acetyl group is part of any organic compounds such as acetylcholine and acetyl CoA

Beforehand the Irish had planned to have a bigger amount of men to attack the city But a man called Sir Roger Casement was captured on the way back from Germany with guns and the Irish had very few guns As a result only about 1250 men took part in the rising Out of these about 300 went into the General Post Office in Dublin led by Patrick Pearse and James Connolly Other groups took over different parts of the city for example St Stephens Green Shelbourne Hotel Bolands Mills and Jacobs Factory At first the British put up no resistance because of Easter public holiday but soon more of them came into Dublin to fight the Irish 

The biggest fighting happened at Bolands Mills where amon de Valera had his men open fire on British soldiers called Sherwood Foresters while they landed in the city The shootings here killed about 200 people and wounded several more St Stephens Green was a big part of the fighting as well where the Irish lost a lot of men After six days the Irish were exhausted and were being shot at by huge artillery pieces mounted onto a British ship called HMS Helga The GPO was badly hit and soon the Irish surrendered Sixteen of the Irish leaders were shot by firing squad after the Rising

The British admitted that they lost 155 men to Irish gunfire and 200 were wounded The Irish rebels lost at least 70 men and over 1000 of them were wounded At least 100 Irish citizens were killed in the crossfire as well After the rising Dublin was in very bad shape and several hundred people had been killed But after the British shot the sixteen leaders of the rising the Irish people soon felt sorry for the rebels and followed them The 1916 rising was a major reason for the Irish War of Independence

June Hill Robertson McCarroll was a nurse with the Southern Pacific Railroad in the early twentieth century She has been credited by Caltrans with the idea of using a painted line to separate lanes of traffic on a highway This is now in use all over the world

McCarroll was born and raised in the Adirondacks She attended a medical college in Chicago She moved to Southern California in 1904 with her first husband John Robertson They had hoped that the desert climate would help him with his tuberculosis but Robertson died in 1914 She later married Frank McCarroll the local station manager for the Southern Pacific Railroad From 1907 to 1916 she was the only physician regularly practicing in the vast desert between the Salton Sea and Palm Springs She was also the only physician serving the areas five Indian reservations for the Bureau of Indian Affairs

In the fall of 1917 McCarroll was driving on the road leading to her office near Indio California on a stretch of highway that would later become part of US Route 99 Today that part of the highway is part of Indio Boulevard She was literally run off the road by a truck as she recalled many years later 

McCarroll soon told her idea to the local chamber of commerce and the Riverside County Board of Supervisors but no one listened Finally she took it upon herself to hand paint a white stripe down the middle of the road This would later help drivers since they could now easily see the actual width of the lane and keep accidents like Nurse McCarrolls from happening again Through the Indio Womens Club and many similar womens groups Nurse McCarroll launched a statewide letter writing campaign to tell of her proposal In November 1924 the idea was adopted by the California Highway Commission and 3500 miles of lines were painted at a cost of 163000 It would not be long before the idea was adopted worldwide

A memorial plaque to Dr McCarroll may be found at the intersection of Indio Boulevard and Flower Street in Indio California On April 24 2002 to honor her contribution to road safety the State of California named the stretch of Interstate 10 near Indio east of the Indio BoulevardJefferson Street exit as The Doctor June McCarroll Memorial Freeway To find the plaque with a GPS system the coordinates are 3343260 N 11613040 W

The Sopwith Camel was a British World War I fighter biplane it was famous for flying very well

The Sopwith Camel entered service in June 1917

Unlike other biplanes the Camel was unpleasant to fly The Camel could manoeuvre well because of the placement of the engine pilot guns and fuel tank but controlling the engine torque made flying it difficult and dangerous

The Camel soon had a bad reputation with pilots The engine was sensitive to fuel mixture control and wrong settings caused the engine to cut out during takeoff Many crashed due to mishandling on takeoff when a full fuel tank affected the center of gravity As well as this the Camel was also known for its bad spinning characteristics where any stall resulted in an uncontrollable spin

The Camel had better guns and better performance compared to other biplanes Its controls were light and sensitive The Camel was one of the best remembered Allied aircraft of the First World War The Camel was credited with shooting down 1294 enemy aircraft more than any other Allied fighter

By 1918 better aircraft had been invented faster and with better high altitude performance The camel soon became a ground attack and infantry support aircraft When fighting Germans in March 1918 flights of Camels stopped the advancing German Army Because of this the Camel remained in service until the broken wikt linkarmisticearmistice

Celtic Christianity refers to the Early Medieval Christian practice that evolved in Ireland after the introduction of Christianity in the fourth millennium Having taken its cultural foundation from the egalitarian gender inclusive nature based culture of the Celts Celtic Christianity was very different in its basic practice from Roman Christianity which became based in the hierarchical patriarchal culture of Rome following Constantines absorption of Christianity into accepted society of Imperial Rome While few Christians call themselves Celtic Christians today many of the Celtic values still influence much of the Christian world

Roman Christianity was late arriving in Ireland because the Roman armies never invaded the island Consequently Roman culture and its brand of Roman Christianity had little influence on early Irish Christianity Because the educated class of the Celts the Druids had a long history of educational excellence and philosophic curiosity they welcomed the new religion into Ireland as they did all new informationIreland is the one country that had no martyrs when Christianity came into its territory prompting the Irish Christians of later years so as not to be outdone to develop the White Martyrdom of monks who lived austere lives as living martyrs Christian worship had reached Ireland around 400 AD Ireland at this time was still very much a Celtic nation what the generalization by the Roman Church called pagan Contrary to common myth the Irish did not abandon their Celtic culture in favor of Christianity but rather wove Christianity into their culture as they did with so many other ideas they encountered through the millennia The Celtic cross reflects this mingling of the two Celtic culture unlike the very linear philosophy of Rome and Greece was built upon a very cyclically minded philosophy patterning itself after the seasonal cycles and life cycles they observed in their beloved natural world The Celtic cross includes the cross to represent Christianity and the Circle to represent the Celtic world view

Roman Christianity like Roman culture was a city based culture All of the letters of Saint Paul that made it into the official Roman cannon of the New Testament were written to new churches in various Roman cities For most of its early history the Roman church paid little attention to the country dwellers they called the Paganus which is equivalent to the contemporary redneck or country bumpkin Consequently it was not the Roman missionaries who Christianized the vast majority of the European land mass it was the monks from Ireland who were comfortable with the nature loving ways of the Paganus who traveled to mainland Europe and taught the country folk Celtic Christianity Despite Romes later philosophic battles against it like those at the Synod of Whitby in 664 AD Celtic Christianity remained the dominant form of Christianity in terms of numbers of adherents for the first thousand years of the Christian era Most modern Christians do not know this because once Rome either converted suppressed or killed the adherents of what they saw as a heresy they removed all reference to Celtic Christianitys legacy from the libraries of Europeexcept the Irish libraries material being translated only since the Irish Revolution in the early Twentieth Century

Legend says that Cetlic Christianity in Britain was founded by St Joseph of Arimathea legend also says that King Arthur is buried in his ruined abbey According to legend Joseph was a tin merchant who was often coming and going to the tin mines of Roman Britain Legend continues to say that he may have taken his nephew Jesus with him on some of these trips Later Joseph of Aramathea becomes first keeper of the Holy Grail Perhaps the best known myth about Celtic Christianity is that Saint Patrick brought Christianity to Ireland Christianity was already established in Ireland by the time Patrick began his ministry What he brought to Ireland was Roman Christianity not Christianity itself

Power over Ethernet is a technology that allows to supply electricity over standard Ethernet cables This is useful in many ways as it allows to only have one cable to both provide the computer network and electricity to a device It can be used for powering IP telephones wireless LAN access points network cameras remote network switches embedded computers and other appliances In many of these cases it is often inconvenient expensive or infeasible to supply power separately 

The technology is comparable to POTS telephones These also receive power and data through the same cable Power over ethernet doesnt require changing the existing Ethernet cabling infrastructure

There are several general terms used to describe this feature The terms power over Ethernet power over LAN and inline power are synonymous terms used to describe the powering of attached devices via Ethernet ports

There are several PoE implementations including ad hoc techniques but using the IEEE standard for supplying power over Ethernet is strongly recommended

The Battle of the Teutoburg Forest was a military battle that took place in the year 9 AD In the battle an alliance of Germanic tribes won a major victory over three Roman legions The Germanic tribes were led by Arminius the Roman legions by Publius Quinctilius Varus

This was more than a victory it was the complete destruction of three Roman legions and all their commanders the few men who survived were made slaves It was the greatest disaster in Roman military history Apart from occasional raids and campaigns the Romans never again held the Germanic land across the Rhine 

The battle began a seven year war which ended with the Rhine as the boundary of the Roman Empire for the next four hundred years until the decline of the Western Roman Empire

The Roman commander Varus was about the fourth most important man in Rome He was known and feared because of his ruthless actions and his crucifixion of defeated enemies It is certain this was known to the Germans and may have helped the tribes come together to resist him

The German commander was Arminius who had been given a Roman military education He had spent his youth in Rome as a hostage Therefore he knew Roman military methods this knowledge was to be crucial

Later Arminius returned to Germania with Varus and became his trusted advisor In secret he forged an alliance of Germanic tribes that had traditionally been enemies He was helped to do this by the anger over Varus insolence and cruelty to the people he defeated

Stratagem was therefore indispensable and it was necessary to blind Varus to their schemes until a favorable opportunity should arrive for striking a decisive blow British historian Edward Shepherd Creasy 

While Varus was on his way from his summer camp west of the Weser river to the winter headquarters near the Rhine he heard reports of a local rebellion This was faked by Arminius 

This was represented to Varus as an occasion which required his prompt attendance at the spot but he was kept in studied ignorance of its being part of a concerted national rising and he still looked on Arminius as his submissive vassal Edward Shepherd Creasy

Recent archaeological finds place the battle at Kalkriese Hill in Osnabrck County Lower Saxony The Romans must at this time have been marching northwestward from the area that is now the city of Detmold passing east of Osnabrck they must then have camped in this area before being attacked

Varuss forces included three legions six cohorts of auxiliary troops and three squadrons of cavalry Many of them had little combat experience with Germanic fighters under local conditions 

The Roman forces were not marching in combat formation and there were also large numbers of camp followers As they entered the forest they found the track narrow and muddy according to Dio Cassius a violent storm had also arisen He also writes that Varus neglected to send out advance reconnaissance parties

The line of march was dangerously stretched out estimates are that it was more than 15 km and was perhaps as long as 20 km It was then suddenly attacked by Germanic warriors who were carrying some light swords large lances and spears that came with short and narrow blades so sharp and warrior friendly that they could be used as required The Germanic warriors surrounded the entire Roman army and rained down javelins on the intruders

The Romans were able to set up a fortified night camp and the next morning broke out into open country near the modern town of Ostercappeln The break out cost them heavy losses as did a further attempt to escape by marching through another forest area with heavy rains continuing The rain stopped them from using their bows because sinew strings become slack when wet and left them virtually defenseless as their shields also became waterlogged

The Romans then began a night march to escape but marched into another trap that Arminius had set at the foot of a kill near Osnabrck There the sandy open strip on which the Romans could march easily narrowed at the bottom of the hill There was a gap of only about 100 m between the woods and the swampland at the edge of the Great Bog The road was blocked by a trench and towards the forest an earthen wall had been built along the roadside This let the tribesmen to attack the Romans from cover 

The Romans made a desperate attempt to storm the wall but failed The Germanic warriors then stormed the field and slaughtered the Romans Varus committed suicide 

Around 1500020000 Roman soldiers must have died not only Varus but also many of his officers are said to have taken their own lives by falling on their swords in the approved manner Tacitus wrote that many officers were sacrificed by the Germans as part of their indigenous religious ceremonies cooked in pots and their bones used for rituals However others were ransomed and some of the common soldiers were enslaved 

The victory over the legions was followed by a clean sweep of all Roman forts garrisons and cities of which there were at least two east of the Rhine The remaining two Roman legions in Germany were stationed in a fort at Mainz and commanded by Varus nephew They were content to try to hold the Rhine

Arminius then left saying he would drum up Germanic forces to support the Roman campaign Instead he led his troops who must have been waiting close by in attacks on surrounding Roman garrisons

Obviously this route was chosen as a short cut but Varus had no proof that such urgency was really necessary This was doubly so as the forest caused the line to stretch so far that one part could not support another

Though we can never know why Varus made these mistakes his reputation for arrogance and over confidence suggests he under estimated the Germans But all Romes previous experience from Caesar onwards had shown the Germanic tribes as strong in war

Upon hearing of the defeat the Emperor Augustus according to the Roman historian Suetonius in his work De vita Caesarum was so shaken by the news that he stood butting his head against the wall of his palace repeatedly shouting Quintili Vare legiones redde 

The three legion numbers were never used again by the Romans after this defeat unlike other legions that were restructured a case unique in Roman history

The battle ended the period of triumphant Roman expansion that had followed the end of the Civil Wars 40 years earlier Augustus stepson Tiberius took effective control and prepared for the continuation of the war Three legions were sent to the Rhine to replace the lost legions

Though their shock at the slaughter was great the Romans immediately began a slow systematic process of preparing to reconquer the country In 14 AD just after Augustus death and the accession of his heir and stepson Tiberius a huge raid was led by the new emperors nephew Germanicus 

On a starry night he massacred the Marsi and ravaged their villages with fire and sword That night the Germans had celebrated drunk and asleep they were surprised by Germanicus The temple of their deity was destroyed 

Several other tribes were roused by this slaughter and ambushed Germanicus on the way to his winter quarters but were defeated with heavy losses

The next year was marked by two major campaigns and several smaller battles with a large army estimated at 5500070000 men backed by naval forces In spring 15 AD the legate Caecina Severus invaded the Marsi a second time with 2500030000 men causing great havoc 

Meanwhile Germanicus troops had built a fort on Mount Taunus from where he marched with 30 to 35000 men against the Chatti and slaughtered children women and the elderly The able bodied men fled across a river and hid themselves in the forests After this blow Germanicus marched on Mattium and burned the city down

In summer 15 AD the army visited the site of the first battle According to Tacitus they found heaps of bones and skulls nailed to trees which they buried looking on all as kinsfolk and of their own blood Burial pits with remains fitting this description have been found at Kalkriese Hill

Under Germanicus the Romans marched another army along with allied Germanic soldiers into Germania again in 16 AD He was able to fight his way across the Weser near modern Minden suffering some losses He forced Arminius army to stand in open battle at the Weser River Germanicuss legions inflicted huge casualties on the Germanic armies while sustaining only minor losses 

One final battle was fought at the Angivarian Wall west of modern Hanover and again many Germanic soldiers were killed which forced them to flee In summer 16 AD Caius Silius marched against the Chatti with 33000 men Germanicus invaded the Marsi for a third time and devastated their land 

With his main goals reached and winter coming Germanicus ordered his army back to their winter camps with the fleet incurring some damage from a storm in the North Sea After a few more raids across the Rhine which resulted in the recovery of two of the three Roman legions eagles lost in 9 AD Tiberius ordered the Roman forces to halt and withdraw across the Rhine Germanicus was recalled to Rome and informed by Tiberius that he would be given a Triumph and be given a new command

Germanicus campaign had been to revenge the defeat at Teutoburg and also partly in reaction to signs of mutiny amongst his troops

Arminius who had been considered a real threat to stability by Rome was now defeated Once his allied Germanic coalition had been broken and honour avenged the huge cost and risk of keeping the Roman army operating beyond the Rhine was simply not worth any likely benefit to be gained

The last chapter of this story is told by the historian Tacitus Around 50 AD bands of Chatti invaded Roman territory and began to plunder The Roman commander with a legionary force supported by Roman cavalry and auxiliaries attacked the Chatti from both sides and defeated them Great was the joy when they found Roman prisoners including some from Varus legions who had been held by the Chatti for 40 years

The battle and the histories of Tacitus had a big effect on 19th century German nationalism In the 19th century the Germans were still divided into many German states but they linked themselves with the Germanic tribes as shared ancestors of one German people

In 1808 the German author Heinrich von Kleists play Die Hermannsschlacht aroused anti Napoleonic sentiment even though it could not be performed under French occupation 

Later the figure of Arminius was used to represent the ideals of freedom and unification as supported by German liberals and opposed by reactionary rulers A memorial the Hermannsdenkmal was begun during this period and Arminius became a symbol of Pan Germanism The monument remained unfinished for decades until after the Franco Prussian War of 187071 unified the country The completed monument was then a symbol of conservative German nationalism

An Electro optic modulator is an optical device It is made of a material that has a so called electro optical effect This means that the material changes its optical properties when there is an electric field One example is than when there is no electricity light can pass through and when there is it cannot and is reflected 

Liquid crystals are special substances that are usually liquid but that show certain properties of a solid crystal A liquid crystal may flow like a liquid but its molecules may be rotated in a crystal like way There are many different types of liquid crystal phases Different phases are different because their optical properties are different Using a microscope and a polarized light source different liquid crystal phases will have different textures This is also shown in the image 

The contrasting areas in the texture each correspond to a domain where the LC molecules are rotated in a different direction Within a domain however the molecules are well ordered LC materials may not always be in an LC phase

A computer is Turing complete if it can do anything that any Turing machine can do if it had all the time memory and software that it needs If it can do anything that any Turing machine can do that proves that it can do anything that any computer can do It does not mean the computer can let you type something in the same way or that it will show the same graphics It means that it can change one set of numbers to another set of numbers in the same way

For instance a computer from Dell can do anything that a computer from Hewlett Packard can do and the Hewlett Packard can do anything the Dell can do One computer might need more time memory and software to do what another computer can do and it might need a different keyboard monitor or other inputoutput but you would not need a new CPU chip Any well known computer is Turing complete But the simplest calculators are not Turing complete All they can do is add subtract multiply and divide They cannot play chess for instance no matter how you try to combine their four functions

Because of the end of the Soviet Union Russia went through a large change politically economically and militarily First off the Soviet Union became the Russian Federation People now consider that the Federation is a follow up of the Soviet Union However Post Soviet Russia lacked the military and political power of the former USSR Now that communism died Russia could elect a President in June of 1991 the first president in Russian history was elected his name was Boris Yeltsin 

The election of Boris Yeltsin showed a new future in Russia He told his people that he would help the economy One thing he did was help improve trade with other countries However not all his ideas would be good When Yeltsin lifted price controls a huge sudden increase in prices occurred Also because the military was hit hard during the fall of the Soviet Union many plants laid off workers because the Government was not sending the plants any new orders this lead to large unemployment In 1998 a large financial crisis hit Russia The Value of the Ruble fell a lot Massive tax evasion also occurred The government stopped making payment of wages pensions and when workers were paid it was often with goods rather than rubles Despite this Russia came back from the August 1998 financial crash with speed This was because the price of oil went up Having the prices of oil go up the exportation of the oil form Russia would cost more this would bring in lots of money for the economy

Hurricane Henriette was the deadliest tropical cyclone of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season The storm which caused nine fatalities formed from an area of cloud on August 30 2007 and became a tropical storm the next day The storm moved along the Mexican Pacific coast and it rained very heavily The city that had the most problems was Acapulco Guerrero where six people were killed by landslides and where over 100 families had to leave after the La Sabana River flooded Henriette then turned north and headed towards the Baja California peninsula and became a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale Henriette made its first landfall east of Cabo San Lucas when it was at its strongest causing the death of one woman because of rough seas

Hurricane Henriette then moved over the Sea of Cortez and made its second landfall near Guaymas Sonora After causing heavy rains in Sonora the storm weakened over the Sierra Madre Occidental and what was left went on to cause flooding in New Mexico and Texas The damaged caused cost about 275 million It hit Mexico on the same day Hurricane Felix hit Nicaragua only one of two time when an Atlantic hurricane and a Pacific hurricane have made landfall on the same day

Henriette originated from a tropical wave that departed the west coast of Africa on August 20 2007 The wave produced some convection while in the Caribbean Sea but reached Central America on August 28 before any significant development could occur Early on August 30 the area of low pressure now 400 miles south southeast of Acapulco Mexico started to gain clusters of strong convection By the afternoon of August 30 the system continued to show strong convection and had developed a broad but well defined area of low to mid level cyclonic turning By 0600 UTC that day the system became a tropical depression about convert360mi0 southeast of Acapulco and was designated as Tropical Depression Eleven E

Convection continued but the cyclone was encountering extensive easterly to north easterly wind shear which stinted the strengthening of this storm through out its history The cyclone initially headed toward the west northwest around a subtropical ridge that was centered over the western Gulf of Mexico The depression moved north west parallel with the west coast of Mexico due to being steered by the midupper level ridge On August 31 it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette 85 miles south of Acapulco 

It continued to move along the Mexican coast bringing heavy rains With continued strong convection Henriette maintained its strengthening and was predicted to reach hurricane strength However despite the low wind shear and apparent warm waters Henriette did not strengthen as expected This is believed to be due to its close proximity to land and colds waters being brought up due to Henriettes slow movement The convection and strengthening continued and maintained itself as it moved away from Jalisco Henriette turned westward and away from the Pacific coast of Mexico late on September 1 as the subtropical ridge built westward over northern Mexico

Henriette continued to improve in structure and with the formation of a distinct eye feature reached hurricane strength on September 4 as it turned north northwestward toward the Baja California peninsula ahead of a mid latitude trough approaching the west coast of the United States The hurricane reached its peak intensity of 85 mph that morning while centered about 75 milessouth southeast of Cabo San Lucas

The center of Henriette made landfall just east of Cabo San Lucas on the afternoon of September 4 with maximum winds near convert80mihkmhabbron It was over land for only about six hours before emerging into the Sea of Cortez The brief interaction with land caused a slight weakening but Henriette remained a Category 1 hurricane for most of that day The next day it made final landfall near Guaymas in the state of Sonora Henriette weakened quickly over land and dissipated over the mountains of northwestern Mexico early on September 6 The remnants of Tropical Storm Henriette continued to track across west Texas and southeastern New Mexico as it was being absorbed by a cold front moving through New Mexico The flow of moisture from originating from these remnants moderate instability and marginal shear contributed to flash flooding and severe thunderstorms

The formation of Henriette was not anticipated well in NHC Tropical Weather Outlooks The incipient system was first mentioned only about 31 hours before it became a tropical depression and the potential for the formation of a depression was explicitly stated beginning only about 13 hours prior to genesis

Modernism was a cultural movement in the first part of the 20th century It occurred in art literature music architecture and drama 

Modernism is marked by a rejection of tradition and an interest in new ways of doing old things Also there was a belief that the application of science and technology could change the world for the better The changes began in the late 19th century and carried on until about 1950 The details differ greatly and the term covers some movements which are somewhat contradictory

Art is where people can find Modernism Modern art is what replaced classical art It included Abstract art Cubism Pop art Minimalism and Dadaism It affected sculpture quite strongly though at the beginning sculptors like Rodin and Epstein made both traditional and modernist works Henry Moore is one of the most famous modernist sculptors

Typical modernist painters were Picasso Braque Matisse Kandinsky and Mondrian

Composers such as Stravinsky George Antheil and Schonberg are modernists Stravinskys The Rite of Spring is a landmark work

James Joyces Ulysses is the classic example of modernism in the novel Ulysses has been called a demonstration and summation of the entire Modernist movement

Modernism in architecture is found in the work of Frank Lloyd Wright Le Corbusier Walter Gropius and Mies van der Rohe Le Corbusiers famous remark A building is a machine for living in shows how different his thinking was to architects of the 19th century The skyscraper such as Mies van der Rohes Seagram Building in New York became the archetypal modernist building

A criticism of the modern movement is that it doesnt value tradition and that it goes in for change for the sake of change What Modernists want most is freedom of expression or perhaps freedom of experimentation This is why many modern paintings avoid making visual copies of real things In modernist literature an author may leave out plots or narrative or characterization in books

These experiments were not random They drew on the ideas of their day mass media science and technology Marxism Freudian psychology and so on There was a general search for new materials new methods and new ideas There was often a rejection of elitism and a love of populism and popular culture

Another criticism was of the connection between modernism and socialism Certainly many modernists were also socialists In the early days of socialism it seemed to offer hope of a new future without the baggage of the past This also explains their rejection of tradition

The medal has on occasion been awarded to more than one person at once in 1938 it was won by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton for their discovery that nuclei could be disintegrated by artificially produced bombarding particles in 1981 by Peter Higgs Thomas Walter and Tom W B Kibble for their international contributions about the spontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries in elementary particle theory in 1982 by Drummond Matthews and Frederick Vine for their elucidation of the magnetic properties of the ocean floors which subsequently led to the plate tectonic hypothesis and in 1988 by Archibald Howie and MJ Whelan for their contributions to the theory of electron diffraction and microscopy and its application to the study of lattice defects in crystals

Terraforming is a process of taking an inhabitable planet and making it habitable for living organisms This can be done by adding an atmosphere heat and water Mars is considered by many to be the best candidate for terraformation Much study has been done on the possibility of heating the planet and altering its atmosphere and NASA has put some input into this idea but the economic resources to terraform are far too much for any government to be willing to donate

Many people say that it is possible to terraform Mars our Moon Titan Callisto Mercury and dozens of other moons

Looking at what we did to this earth many people think that planets should be left without human interference Others say that terraforming sounds ethically sound once we know that the planet we are terraforming has no other life of its own but if it does while we should not try to reshape the planet to our own use we should engineer the planets environment to artificially nurture the alien life and help it thrive and co evolve or even co exist with humans

There are many potential political issues for terraforming a planet such as who gets to own the terraformed land on the new planet It could be national governments organizations like the United Nations corporations etc Such settlements may become national disputes as countries try to make portions of other planets part of their own national territory

There are different kinds of cards

The two standards are not compatible but devices that accept SDHC also accept SD cards

There are also different classes These refer to the read and write speeds Currently in use are Class 2  which means 2 MBytessecond Class 4  4 MBsec and Class 6 at 6 MBsec The problem with this is that different manufacturers measure different things with it some measure write speeds others read speeds There are also differences because some give guarantees and others simply say that the speeds they indicate are the maximum achievable under good conditions

Still another measurement is called rating A rating of 1 corresponds to 150 KBytes per second the read speed of a CD That way a class 2 is equal to a speed of 13x

Integrated Services Digital Network is an international standard for a communication network It is often shortened to ISDN It is used for telephone lines Before ISDN telephone lines were mainly seen as a way for people to make phone calls so the main idea was to use circuit switching When a phone call is made a line is set up between the two participants With ISDN this view changes ISDN offers a number of services which use the telephone line to transport data There were different services like telex or teleprinters before ISDN but they used their own networks At specific locations there were gateways between these networks With ISDN this changes There is only one network and it offers different services Some of them are for voice to make phone calls others are for data for example to send telefaxes

ISDN offers a number of data channels and a signalling channel The data channels are completely independent and can be used independently The usual setup has two such data channels That way it is possible to send a fax while doing a phone call for example

douard Manet 23 January 1832 30 April 1883 was a French Impressionist painter He was one of the first painters of the 19th century to paint subjects of everyday life in the modern world This made him very important for modern painting especially for the change from Realism to Impressionism 

Some of his paintings were very controversial The paintings Lunch on the Grass and Olympia were a starting point for a group of young painters to develop what would later be called Impressionism

Life 

Training douard Manet was born in Paris on 23 January 1832 to a wealthy family As he grew up his uncle encouraged him to paint and draw but his father wanted him to join the navy Eventually he was allowed to be trained as a painter Manet worked from 1850 to 1856 in the studio of the academic painter Thomas Couture a painter of large historical paintings In his spare time he copied the old masters in the Louvre While he was a student he visited Germany Italy and the Netherlands looking at the paintings of Renaissance and Baroque masters such as Frans Hals and Spanish painters such as Diego Velzquez and Goya 

In 1856 Manet opened his own studio One of the best known French painters of that time was Gustave Courbet who painted in a style known as Realism Courbet in his pictures tried to show the life of the poor working people of the farms and villages Manet began to paint beggars singers and people in cafes His style was not like Courbets because he used large brushstrokes without much detail Courbets paintings were dark and somber because he painted all his canvases brown before he put the figures in Manets paintings were brighter and lighter with lots of white paint and often small parts painted in bright blue and red

In 1863 Manet married Suzanne Leenhoff who had been employed by his father to teach piano to Manet and his younger brother Eugene Suzanne had an eleven year old son Leon Koella Leenhoff who often posed as a model for Manets paintings

Impressionism 

Every year the academy in Paris would hold a big exhibition called the Salon de Paris In 1863 Manet put a picture into the show called Lunch on the Grass The judges at the Salon refused to hang this work in the gallery because it showed a naked woman sitting on the grass with two men wearing clothes If the painting had been about Ancient Greek mythology this would not be a problem but these men were wearing ordinary suits and the womans dress and hat were lying on the grass Perhaps she was a prostitute The judges said that the painting was indecent 

At this time there were a group of young artists who mainly painted landscapes They were Claude Monet Pierre Auguste Renoir Alfred Sisley Frdric Bazille Camille Pissarro Paul Czanne and Armand Guillaumin Monet and his friends also had their paintings turned away They were angry and they met with Manet to discuss this The Emperor Napoleon III gave permission for another exhibition called the Salon des Refuses which showed all the pictures that had been refused Many people went to see this exhibition and soon discovered that there was a new movement in art quite different from the style that they were used to 

In 1874 thirty Impressionist artists held their first exhibition The main artists who are called Impressionists include Claude Monet Auguste Renoir Paul Czanne Camille Pissarro Alfred Sisley Edgar Degas and Berthe Morisot Manet became friendly with Berthe Morisot who later married his brother Eugene Manet Manet encouraged Morisot with her painting Morisot in turn encouraged Manet to paint outdoors in the way that Monet and the other Impressionist painters did Monet painted some landscapes seascapes and city scenes in the Impressionist style However most of his paintings are figurative 

Manets paintings usually show people going about their ordinary lives They show people at home and at work or out and enjoying themselves One painting is very different It is a terrible scene showing the execution of the Emperor Maximillian of Mexico by a firing squad

Khat is very popular in Yemen Much of the countrys farming resources go towards it It is estimated that 40 of the countrys water supply goes towards irrigating it Its production is said to increase by about 10 to 15 every year Water use in producing khat is so high that groundwater levels in the Sanaa basin are getting lower For this reason government officials have proposed to move large portions of the population of Sanaa to the coast of the Red Sea One of the main reasons Yemen produces so much khat is because the price brings in a high income for farmers Some studies done in 2001 estimated that the income from growing khat was about 25 million Yemeni rials per hectare while it was only 057 million rials per hectare if fruits were grown This is a strong reason farmers prefer to grow khat over coffee and fruits It is estimated that between 1970 and 2000 the area on which khat was cultivated grew from 8000 hectares to 103000 hectares

The original inhabitants of modern day Bangladesh and North east India were the Proto Austroloid Kols otherwise known as Kolarians The term Kol has ubiquitously been corrupted by the Aryan Sanskritic speakers to the word kalu meaning both black and ugly in almost all of the 16 languages of the Subcontinent The Kolarians are a Dravidian sect whose descendant communities can be found also in Bengal and elsewhere in the eastern belt of the Indian continent Most geological scholars will contend that most of Bangladesh was fashioned 1 to 65 million years ago during the tertiary era Semi recent excavations in the Deolpota village of western Bengal seem to suggest that a Paleolithic civilization in the region existed about one hundred thousand years ago A 10000 to 15000 year old stone structure in Rangamati is the primary evidence of Paleolithic civilization along with a hand axe found in the mountainous inclines of the Feni district This Neo stone age began 3000 BC lasting almost 1500 years Similar tools were found in Sitakunda of the eastern region Chittagong and near Comilla district The sparsely forested hills in eastern Bengal strewn with fertile valleys imparted a hospitable location for Neolithic settlements

Bumblebees are a group of social and semi social bees of the genus Bombus The genus contains about 250 different species mostly in the Northern Hemisphere though they are common in New Zealand and Tasmania They occur practically everywhere on the Eurasian landmass 

Most bumblebees live in small groups which generally last only for a year They collect pollen as protein for their young and themselves eat nectar They are extremely hairy with a covering of soft hairs called a pile

Most of them have the same social structure as honey bees do there is a queen and there are workers and drones The usual size of a colony is under 50 members though some tropical species live in larger colonies 

Bumblebees carry aposematic warning colours usually some combination of black red yellow and white This is the usual Mllerian mimicry found in bees and wasps

Fertilised queens overwinter in a dormant state They start a nest in the Spring The queen stores sperm from her mating and can decide whether or not to fertilise an egg as it comes down the oviduct to the vagina The females are diploid the males are haploid This is the common method of sex determination throughout the Hymenoptera 

Only fertilised eggs grow into females unfertilised ones grow into males Queens suppress their female workers egg laying by aggression and pheromones until late in the season when the workers do start to lay eggs 

Thus the queen will be the mother of all the first males New queens and males leave the colony when they are mature they mate and the new queens search for a place to overwinter Then they are dormant over the winter period starting a new nest in the Spring That completes the cycle

About ten species are called cuckoo bumblebees These are nest parasites they specialize in invading and taking over the nests of other bumblebees In these species there are no workers Once such an animal has invaded a nest it will force the workers to feed it and its offspring Once the offspring are ready they will leave the hive to mate and take over other hives

All bumblebees have a sting as hive bees do However the bumblebee sting does not damage it when used and they can sting several times However they rarely do sting unless really threatened 

They have an additional type of defence against birds and that is their mechanical toughness Birds usually do not swallow bees whole If they eat bees at all they manipulate them to eat the thorax alone for its wing muscles This is hard to do with a bumble bee and time consuming Generally they are left alone

It is made up of two bridges both built in the mid 19th century The eastern side was built by the London Chatham and Dover Railway in 1858 to 60 to carry trains into Victoria Station This was the first railway bridge across the Thames in central London The western side was built by the London Brighton and South Coast Railway in 186566

Both bridges were rebuilt in steel in 196367 the original piers now being wrapped in concrete The designer for this work was Freeman Fox Partners

On the north bank is Pimlico to the north and east and Chelsea to the west The Lister Hospital and the Royal Chelsea Hospital are immediately to the north west On the south bank is Nine Elms to the east and Battersea to the west Battersea Power Station is immediately to the south of the bridge and Battersea Park to the south west

Vauxhall Bridge is a steel and granite bridge in central London It crosses the River Thames in a north west south east direction between Vauxhall on the south bank and Westminster on the north bank Opened in 1906 it replaced an earlier bridge as part of a program for redeveloping the south bank of the Thames The original bridge was itself built on the site of a former ferry

The building of both bridges was difficult with both the first and second bridges needing multiple redesigns from multiple architects The original bridge the first iron bridge over the Thames was built by a private company and was run as a toll bridge before being taken into public ownership in 1879 The second bridge which took eight years to build was the first in London to carry trams and later one of the first two roads in London to have a bus lane

The present bridge is most significant for road traffic across the Thames

The Highland Football League is a league of football clubs operating not just in the Scottish highlands as the name may suggest but also in the north east lowlands It is one of the three senior non leagues in Scotland The HFL is a full member of the Scottish Football Association

The HFL was formed on 4 August 1893 at the Inverness Workmans Club The original league consisted of seven teams Inverness Thistle Caledonian Clachnacuddin Forres Mechanics Inverness Union Inverness Citadel and Cameron Highlanders Ross County were an eighth original member but resigned membership in November 1893 Of the original teams two are still playing in the league today and two merged to become current Scottish Premier League club Inverness Caledonian Thistle

Many of the member clubs have performed well when competing against SFL clubs in the Scottish Cup However from the 1990s onwards the HFL has been a victim of its own success with various teams defecting to other leagues Furthermore it has also had to contend with overexposure of large teams in the area such as Aberdeen and Inverness Caledonian Thistle as well as the Old Firm to the South and to an extent English football However the lack of Premier League and to a lesser extent First Division teams in the area has worked in its favour with some football fans being less willing to travel long distances to games in southern Scotland

The league has been somewhat weakened in recent years by the departure of many former members who have subsequently joined the SFL This happened in 1994 when Caledonian Inverness Thistle and Ross County left Until then the HFL had operated with 18 clubs this was reduced by the departure of the three mentioned clubs but Wick Academy from the North Caledonian Football League were elected to create a league of 16 clubs This was the state of affairs till 2000 when Elgin City and Peterhead were elected into the SFL In 2002 Inverurie Loco Works were elected into the HFL to give it a membership of 15 clubs with which it continues to operate

In 2008 North Region Junior League sides Formartine United and Turriff United both submitted bids to join the Highland League following in the footsteps of past Junior League side Inverurie Locos If both teams were to join the Highland League would have a total of 17 teams An even team league is preferred so only one clubs application was likely to be successful Whichever team is successful in their application was planned to join in the 200910 season However Banks O Dee and Strathspey Thistle also applied giving the potential for an 18 team Highland league in 2009 10 if three of these four clubs were elected On February 25 2009 Formartine United Turriff United and Strathspey Thistle were accepted into the league for the following season with Banks O Dee being the unsuccessful club

Results from the HFL and the Highland League Cup have featured on the Press Association vidiprinter since the start of the 199798 season

The Highland League is the subject of a song of the same name by the popular music ensemble I Ludicrous 

The HFL also administer several other competitions contested by some or all of the clubs These competitions are

The MeselsonStahl experiment was an experiment done by Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl in 1958 using Ecoli DNA With their experiment the two scientists could show that DNA replication was semiconservative The DNA consists of two helices that are combined When the two helices are copied each will have one part coming from the original cell The other part will be newly made In chemistry this is called synthesis 

There are three different way this replication could happen

Mendelson and Stahl concluded that DNA employs semi conservative replication They placed the bacteria in an environment which contained a selected Nitrogen isotope They first used N14 The bacteria then integrated this isotope into their DNA Later they used an environment that contained N15 They then looked at which of the isotopes the bacterial DNA contained They found that it contained both isotopes of nitrogen which implies that conservative replication is not the correct conclusion By having a closer look they could then also rule out disperse replication Some helix strands were all N14 Other helix strands from the time in the N15 environment had N15

Granulating methods are necessary when the specific surface of fine powders has to be decreased and its bulk density increased This will reduce the problems of charging in the loading of the equipment so that the flow characteristics and accuracy during the pressing of tablets improve Solids with low bulk weights are usually heavily ventilated leading to a strong dust nuisance in the workplace In addition segregation of heterogeneous composites is avoided by granulating materials with different average particle sizes that are to be processed together Fixing of the different particles to each other allows a further processing without significant loss of uniformity with regard to the composition

There are wet and dry granulating methods

Wet granulating methods use a binder or adhesive and a solvent 

Dry granulating methods produce so called foreign material free compact granulate by applying a compacting pressure

Roller compacting agglomerates the starting material followed by crushing to granules Dry granulating methods produce foreign material free compact granulate by applying a compacting pressure Depending on the material the device parameters and equipment larger or smaller slab segments are produced These slabs are further processed to produce the actual pellet Some manufacturers combine the process of roller compacting and the subsequent shredding by a granulating unit in one device These devices are strictly speaking compacting  granulators General advantages of roller compacting 

The dry granulating technology of roller compacting is an efficient and economically advantageous granulating method due to the absence of water and solvents and making it suitable for moisture sensitive substances This affects the cost benefit balance positively

Sir Thomas Beecham was an English conductor He was one of the most famous conductors of his time He came from a very rich family and was able to use his money to pay orchestras that he formed He formed the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra He was especially well known for conducting the music of Mozart as well as that of his friend Delius 

He often made funny jokes and many amusing stories are told about things that he said

Beecham was born in 1879 in St Helens Lancashire in the north of England Beecham was self taught as a conductor He had some private composition lessons from Charles Wood in London and Moszkowski in Paris Beechams father Sir Joseph Beecham had made a lot of money making medicines and he also liked music so he was able to help his son in his career as a musician 

Thomas was only 20 years old when his father was reinstated as mayor of St Helens To celebrate this his father paid for the Hall Orchestra to give a concert It was going to be conducted by the famous German conductor Hans Richter However a few days before the concert it was announced that Richter was ill Thomas immediately said he would conduct the concert The orchestra at first refused to play for a 20 year old who had only once ever conducted a concert but in the end they changed their minds and the concert was a great success

In 1909 Thomas got a group of musicians together to form the Beecham Symphony Orchestra They gave concerts and played for ballets and operas Beecham conducted operas in Covent Garden and other London opera houses He conducted works by composers suc as Strauss Delius Smythe and Holbrooke He also played for Diaghilevs Ballets Russes when they first came to England

During World War I he gave money to the Halle Orchestra London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Society all of which he conducted He often conducted these orchestras outside London giving people opportunity to hear music they had never heard before

For several years he had financial problems and did not conduct much Then in 1932 he formed the London Philharmonic Orchestra and quickly made it into an excellent orchestra They toured Germany in 1936 and the next year went to Paris During the 1930s he conducted at Covent Garden where he had control of everything that went on He conducted several cycles of Wagners Ring When World War II started in 1939 the theatre was closed He went to the United States where he conducted several orchestras including the New York Philharmonic He also went to Australia

In 1944 he returned to Britain His orchestra the London Philharmonic Orchestra were now a self governing body They decided that they did not want Beecham because he would want to have power to rule the orchestra in the way he wanted So Beecham formed another orchestra the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra He gave many concerts toured with them and made many great recordings He was especially known for his concerts of Joseph Haydn and Mozart He also conducted Die Meistersinger at Covent Garden in 1951 as well as appearing at the Teatro Coln in Buenos Aires in 1958 The last concert he gave was on 7 May 1960 when he conducted the RPO in Portsmouth

Beecham was an enormously talented musician Because he had a lot of money he did not need to go through the musical education that most other musicians have He formed his own life and spent a lot of his energy as well as money creating the right conditions for musicians to work in conditions that would have been normal in many other European countries but which were not normal at the time in England

He was not interested in the music of Bach though he did conduct Handel He was famous for his Mozart performances and particularly enjoyed playing Berlioz Mendelssohn Bizet and Dvok He was one of the first people in England to conduct the new music of Richard Strauss and Sibelius He was a close friend of Delius and performed his music as well as editing it so that it could be published

There are many stories about the witty things that he said He was knighted in 1916

A lady told Beecham that she wanted her son to learn to play a musical instrument but did not want to hear the awful sound it made when he was beginning to learn She asked him what instrument he should learn Beecham said he should learn the bagpipes because they sound exactly the same when you have finished learning them as when you start learning them

Beecham was rehearsing a very long opera by Wagner They had been rehearsing for a long time Beecham took out his watch and said My God We have been playing for two hours and we are still playing this bloody tune

Beecham was rehearsing an opera by an English composer The composer was at the rehearsal and kept stopping the orchestra and asking Beecham to play it differently Each time Beecham turned back to the orchestra and said The same again gentlemen please

Beecham once met a lady he knew but could not remember who she was He asked her whether she was well

A Power Purchasing Agreement is a legal contract between a electricity provider and a land owner The contract allows the electricity provider to produce power on the land owners land or roof and the land owner buys the electricity primarily from the electricity provider This deal is often done using solar technology where the electricity provider will install operate and maintain solar panels on the land owners roof Then the land owner will buy the electricity from the solar panels on the roof Part of the PPA is to set a price for the electrcity If the solar panels do not provide enough electricity for the land owner then he will buy the rest of his electrcity from the power lines If the electricity provider creates more electricity than the land owner needs then he will sell the excess to the power lines

Schools and government buildings often like to do power purchasing agreements because they do not have the money to install solar panals on their rooffactdateJuly 2010 Large department stores also like to do power purchasing agreements because they have large roofs and do not want to deal with the costs of installing and maintaining panelsfactdateJuly 2010

Power Purchasing agreements tend to last 5 20 yearsfactdateJuly 2010 At the end of the PPA either the contract is extended the solar panels are removed from the property or the land owner buys the solar panels from the electricity provider

Power Purchasing agreements have been very important to the expansion of solar electricity use in the United StatesfactdateJuly 2010 Investment tax credits from the federal and state governments have helped make the price of solar panels affordable for the providing companies The tax credit can help pay for significant percentage of the project cost in some cases

Vancouver Washington is a United States city just north of the Columbia River in the state of Washington It is directly north of Portland Oregon and convert305mi south of Vancouver British Columbia Both cities were named for George Vancouver a British explorer and sea captain Vancouver Washington includes the old Fort Vancouver begun by the British Hudsons Bay Company in 1824 It was made part of the United States on June 15 1846 as part of the Oregon Treaty It is the fourth largest city in Washington state

The Vancouver area was home to Native Americans before the arrival of Europeans Chinook and Klickitat tribes called this area land of the mud turtles before 1775 Disease killed most natives before the Hudsons Bay Company came in the 1820s The Hudsons Bay Company built Fort Vancouver to trade in beaver skins which were used to make top hats Workers at Fort Vancouver came from England the Sandwich Islands Scotland and Canada Many trappers had native wives and lived outside Fort Vancouver

Americans began to arrive from the Oregon Trail John McLoughlin was head man at Fort Vancouver and helped the Americans with tools and seed Fort Vancouver closed in the 1840s The city of Vancouver was incorporated in 1857 and was over three times as big by 1909 In 1917 the first bridge connecting Oregon to Washington over the Columbia River was built from Vancouver In 1982 another bridge was built a few miles east for the I 205 freeway

Columbia Barracks became Vancouver Barracks and was the biggest US military base in Oregon Washington or Idaho for many years During World War I the Vancouver Barracks had a lumber mill to cut spruce wood to make biplanes Another ship yard built ships for World War II Shipyard workers came and Vancouver grew from from 18000 to over 80000 people Vancouver grew again and in 1997 grew again to almost its present size About half as many people live just north of Vancouver as live inside the city About one in three Vancouver workers have jobs in Portland Oregon

Vancouver is located at 45381 North 1223611 WestGR1 

Vancouver is just north of the Columbia River and west of the volcanic Cascade Range mountains and the Columbia gorge Vancouver is about fifty miles from the Pacific Ocean which gives it rain Because it is in a valley between the Pacific Coast and Cascade mountains there are clouds in winter When it is clear one can see Mount Hood the Mount Saint Helens volcano and Mount Adams from Vancouver

Vancouver is north of Portland Oregon and shares a similar climate wet from November through June and dry from July through October Vancouver has snow once or twice a year on average Vancouver has a total area of convert461mi2 Abuout 7 is water including Vancouver Lake to the west

The National Register of Historic Places says that Vancouver is a good place to visit Because it is the oldest city in the area Vancouver has a wide variety of buildings including

Fort Vancouver National Historic Site also has many structures rebuilt as they were in the 1830s

Radiant heating occurs when a hot surface warms other objects around it Radiant heating has a long history of use in buildings by the Romans and the Koreans and is much more efficient than standard ways of heating the air in a building Underfloor radiant heating is the most common type of radiant heating used in buildings but wall and overhead radiant heating systems are also used Radiant heating can also be used to heat outdoor areas 

The Romans were the first people to use underfloor radiant heating systems These systems were based on hypocausts and used warm air for heat The floor was set on top of many brick piles leaving room for the hot air and steam produced by a furnace to pass underneath the floor The hot air then went up chimneys on the sides of the walls so the hot air and steam never actually went into the living rooms These systems were very expensive to build and maintain so only the wealthy could afford them 

In Korea radiant underfloor heating has been in use for about 2000 years Ondol which means warm stone involves the use of stones and underground ducts to help transport warm air from the kitchen to the rooms in the house Most homes and buildings in Korea still use ondol although they now use hot water and electric systems The American architect Frank Lloyd Wright discovered ondol in the early 1900s and used it in many of his building designs Wright also invented hot water underfloor systems 

The most common kind of radiant heating is underfloor heating There are three types of underfloor heating hot air systems hot water systems and electric systems 

Hot air systems use hot air to heat the floor similar to the Romans systems However air does not hold heat very well and these systems arent recommended for residential use 

Hot water systems are the most popular and cost effective systems for cold climates In this type of system water is heated by a boiler and pumped through pipes laid underneath the floor Hot water systems can also be combined with solar thermal energy to make them more environmentally friendly Solar thermal energy uses sunlight to heat water which can then be used in the underfloor heating system 

Hot water systems can also be run in reverse by running cold water through the pipes to cool the building However this technology is difficult to use properly and can result in condensation on the floor which can ruin hardwood floors or rugs and make people more likely to fall

Electric systems are made of electric cables that are laid underneath the floor Electricity is then used to heat the cables and this type of system can be turned on or off much faster than a hot water system However these systems are often more expensive than hot water systems because of the high prices of electricity especially if the hot water system includes the use of solar thermal energy The high cost of an electric heating system can be reduced if the floor can be set to heat during non peak hours such as late at night and is left turned off during the day Electric systems are also less environmentally friendly because electricity is usually produced by burning fossil fuels which increases carbon emissions

Underfloor radiant heating systems can be installed as either wet or dry systems Wet systems are laid down and then concrete is poured over them Concrete floors hold heat very well but can take a long time to absorb the heat Dry systems run in open air space between the foundation and the floor but can be less efficient because they have to heat the air too However dry systems are much easier to reach if the system breaks or leaks 

Any kind of flooring can be used with underfloor heating but ceramic tiles are the most popular floor material because they transfer and store heat well Materials like wood carpet or linoleum tile decrease the heat transfer from the underfloor system and the system must be set at a higher temperature if any of these materials are used

Wall and overhead radiant heating systems are usually made of aluminum panels hung on the walls or ceiling Like underfloor radiant heating these panels can be heated by either hot water or electricity However panels heated by hot water often leak so electric panels are the most common These panels cant heat as much area as an underfloor system but they can be quickly turned on and off when a person enters or leaves the room Electric panels can reduce energy costs if panels are left turned off in empty rooms

Using radiant heating outdoors is much more practical than heating air because the air is always moving outside Outdoor radiant heaters are almost always electric devices and usually portable although it is possible to have underfloor radiant heating installed under a patio

Top Gear is a television show on the BBC The show is all about cars and other vehicles They test new cars to see how fast they go They also test really old cars and do crazy stuff with them They usually rate cars that the normal person wouldnt be able to afford The show started as a regular car show but has changed over time to what it is now It uses comedy to attract viewers which are now estimated to be 350 million

The show often has long distance races They usually race a fast car against a different form of transportation like trains and boats They are called epic races They also have smaller races where they match up cars of different times to see which one outperforms the other

The challenge part of the show is about different stunts of the most ridiculous things the show can come up with One time they jumped a bus over a row of motorcycles Recently the show has started using the phrase How hard can it be for the challenge segment They put themselves in different situations that a normal person probably wouldnt get a chance to experience

Once during every episode they bring a celebrity on stage They show footage of the celebrity driving an average car around a racetrack They put the time it took for them to complete a lap of the track on a board with the names of all of the other celebrities who drove the same course

Power laps are one lap around the Top Gear Test Track They will take any car that can drive and will see how fast it can make it around the track The vehicles must be cars and they must be road legal

Foot binding is an old Chinese custom of binding womens feet with cloth strips in order to keep them from growing more than about three inches Although some Chinese legends say the practice started during the Shang dynasty written evidence indicates that foot binding began at the court of the Song dynasty  It continued until the early 20th century when it was outlawed by the Peoples Republic of China a time when the influence of western fashion was increasing There had been several anti footbinding attempts before it was outlawed When the Manchuria established the Qing dynasty the Manchurian emperors wrote a number of laws banning foot binding but with little success In 1874 the first anti footbinding committee was held in Shanghai by a British priest Chinese authority continued its efforts to abolish foot binding after the collapse of the Qing dynasty by imposing fines on those who still had their feet bound after 1915 Though not very successful the Peoples Republic of China eventually outlawed foot binding According to the Chinese Xinhua News Agency the last factory to make shoes for bound feet women in Harbin China had ended production in 1998 

The practice of foot binding was originally a status sign of the higher class women who were free from manual labor However it gradually spread to the lower classes as a means of upward social mobility and by the 17th century Chinese girls regardless of their social status all had their feet bound Because some drastic measures were taken from time to time to attain desired feet size foot binding usually resulted in lifelong impairments of its victims According to a UC San Francisco study issued in November 1997 the physical consequences of foot binding had lingered in Chinese society until very recently especially for women who are in the 70s and 80s age groups There is also a view that Chinese women were forced to bind their feet so as to maximize the sexual pleasure of their husbands Foot binding may also be seen as female subjugation However this view is often refuted by opponents because they believe that the view is biased against a specific culture with contemporary western standards

Waxing is a method of removing hair from the body Waxing removes the whole hair including the root Both men and women engage in waxing as do female children as young as eight Any area of the body can be waxed but the more common areas are the legs underarms genitals torso and face There are health concerns about waxing such as pain inflammation infection and physical damage to the skin At least two women have been hospitalized due to bikini waxing The waxing of young girls has been criticized and concerns over emotional problems have been raised by parents and by doctors and psychologists Although it is known as waxing not all treatments of this kind use wax Some waxing treatments use a sugar mixture in the same manner as wax 

Any area of the body where hair grows can be waxed The most commonly waxed areas are

Women in Ancient Egypt removed unwanted hair with a sticky mixture of honey and oil Women in the Middle East have used a sugaring mixture which is made up of a paste of warm sugar lemon juice and water In 1922 Sears started selling razors to women and the ability for them to remove unwanted hair began Pubic hair removal began during World War II when the US government ordered less material to be used in making womens bathing suits and the bikini was invented causing some women to have hair stick out the sides of the bikini bottom In the 1960s waxing products became available

Waxing rips the hair out of the skin and often causes pain The pain increases in areas such as the genitals especially for people who havent waxed before or dont wax often Redness and swelling also often occurs at the waxing site Waxing is itself a safe thing but there are times when it is not safe to get waxed When skin is sunburned it is not good to get a wax treatment Allegic reactions can also happen with waxing People with medical problems such as diabetes chronic kidney or liver disease skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis or weakened immune systems are advised not to get wax treatments at all At least one woman with diabetes almost died due to getting a bikini wax and becoming infected and another woman was hospitalised after being waxed in her genital area In 2007 the New Jersey State Board of Cosmetology and Hairstyling came close to banning genital waxing based on health concerns There is also concern about the trend to remove all or most of the pubic hair from a persons genitals Dr Linda K Franks assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the New York University School of Medicine says Pubic hair is there for a reasonto protect the sensitive skin and mucous membranes in the genital region getting a wax literally strips away that layer of protection Waxing can pull small pieces of skin off the body This is usually minor and is not usual Skin infections can also occur such as staph folliculitis Ingrown hairs are also quite common and can become infected

Young children also get waxing treatment with children as young as eight receiving wax treatments such as eyebrows legs and genital waxing Such genital waxing on young girls has been called virgin bikini waxes and is aimed at either reducing the girls need for pubic hair removal in the future or stopping hair growth permanently with as few as five or six treatments as long as the child has never shaved before The increase demand for preteen waxing is being met by spas with some 10000 spas in offering services only for young girls and early teenagers in the United States of America alone The International Spa Association has reported that 16 of teens who have had spa treatments have had waxing done The association has not been able to give figures for younger children because it is illegal to survey them 

Both parents and children say that young girls feel broken wikt linkintenseintense pressure from television shows and other children to look pretty and sexy and say that peer pressure magazines pop stars like Britney Spears and TV shows like Miley Cyrus Hannah Montana increase childrens demands to have spa treatments such as waxing microdermabrasion and chemical peels Such pressure has been reported to cause intense stress and emotional problems in young girls The opinions of boys about girls beauty is also a pressure to look their best with reports of boys rating girls on a scale of 1 to 10 at school

Dr Diane Levin professor of education at Wheelock College in Boston and co author of the book So Sexy So Soon The New Sexualized Childhood and What Parents Can Do to Protect Their Kids believes child waxing to be bad because it tells girls to keep your bodies like little girls because thats what men like This is backed up with surveys that show that 93 of men want women to at least remove some hair from their pubic area Dr Doris Pastor a pediatrician feels that the problem is not whether young children get wax treatments but that such events might encourage young children and preteens to take part in risky behaviour Pubic hair waxing of children has caused concern with doctors Dr Janice Hillman of the Penn Health System a specialist in adolescent medicine when checking for pubic hair on young girls as a sign of development has said she often has to ask the girls if they wax because it has become so common

Concern has also been raised by the cost of such treatments making regular waxing often only available to children with well paid parents leaving girls from poorer families unable to compete for beauty and so being made fun off by those who can afford them

Kikuyu is the largest tribe in Kenya They are 22 of Kenyas population and are of Bantu ethnicity

There are two theories explaining where the Kikuyu came from First it is believed the Kikuyus came from Central Africa where all the Bantus once lived They then moved south towards present day Tanzania where the migrating group separated again and the Kikuyus moved towards Mount Kenya where they settled The second theory is that they came from a mythical place called Shungwaya which is present day Somalia 

According to Kikuyu creation stories Ngai made a man called Gikuyu and his wife Mumbi and settled them on Mount Kenya Gikuyu and Mumbi had nine daughters who form the major groups of the Kikuyu people Due to the fertile soil on Mount Kenya and the hard work of the Kikuyu people they grew more than they needed and started trading with their neighbours the Maasai The Kikuyus swapped their farm produce and crops for the animal products from the Maasai who kept livestock It is also believed that the Maasai are the ones who married the nine daughters of Gikuyu and Mumbi

Members of the Kikuyu tribe speak the Kikuyu language The Kikuyu greeting is Atiriri wimwega which means Hello are you okay The Kikuyu language is similar to other languages like Meru Mbeere and Embu which are believed to have been once part of the Kikuyu tribe but moved away and formed their own tribes Even though tribalism is dying down the Kikuyu language is still spoken a lot today as a sense of cultural pride

Famous people from this tribe include Jomo Kenyatta Mwai Kibaki and Wangari Maathai

The proper Kikuyu spelling of the greeting should be Atiriri wi Mwega meaning by the way are you fine The other forms of greeting include Wakia Maitu greeting an elderly female Wakia Awa greeting an elderly male and Wanyua for agemates

In Japan because of religious beliefs people were forbidden to eat beef venison horse mutton and other meat from Asuka era to Meizi era issue of religion Cattle and horse were also work animals therefore if people eat cattle and horse meat people were punished This is a commandment of Buddhism But difficulty in making a living meant that people secretly ate boar and venison meat Over time people ate beef secretly

Each Japanese region has preferred way of cooking sukiyaki Japan can be divided into two regions The big variation is between Kansai and Kanto In the Kanto region sukiyaki is based on Gyunabe that was in fashion in Meiji period Before cooking sukiyaki people prepare the soup stock mixing a seasonings together They then stew beef in it

In the Kansai region people grill meat in the pan greased with lard After that they put the other ingredients over these and the liquid is poured into the pan They do not grill meat and the ingredients that make the meat tough and they do not grill the meat and watery vegetables at a same time This is the Kansai style of cooking sukiyaki The border between the styles of cooking sukiyaki is becoming unclear Some people say that the border between eastern and western is in Aichi But recently ready made stock pre mixed with seasoning used to flavor sukiyaki is sold all over Japan so the border is no longer clear

For centuries human beings have been able to do some pretty remarkable things with lenses Although we cannot be sure when or how the first person stumbled onto the concept it is clear that at some point in the past ancient people realized that they could manipulate light using a shaped piece of glass Over the centuries how and for what purpose lenses were used began to increase as people discovered that they could accomplish different things using differently shaped lenses In addition to making distant objects appear nearer they could also be used to make small objects appear larger and blurry objects appear clear The lenses used to accomplish these tasks fall into two categories of simple lenses Convex and Concave Lenses Take a look at these cool and amazing telescopes from Amazoncom

A concave lens is a lens that possesses at least one surface that curves inwards It is a diverging lens meaning that it spreads out light rays that have been refracted through it A concave lens is thinner at its centre than at its edges and is used to correct short sightedness The writings of Pliny the Elder makes mention of what is arguably the earliest use of a corrective lens According to Pliny Emperor Nero was said to watch gladiatorial games using an emerald presumably concave shaped to correct for myopia

After light rays have passed through the lens they appear to come from a point called the principal focus This is the point onto which the collimated light that moves parallel to the axis of the lens is focused The image formed by a concave lens is virtual meaning that it will appear to be farther away than it actually is and therefore smaller than the object itself Curved mirrors often have this effect which is why many come with a warning Objects in mirror are closer than they appear The image will also be upright meaning not inverted as some curved reflective surfaces and lenses have been known to do

The lens formula that is used to work out the position and nature of an image formed by a lens can be expressed as follows 1u 1v 1f where u and v are the distances of the object and image from the lens respectively and f is the focal length of the lens

We have written many articles about concave lens for Universe Today Heres an article about the telescope mirror and heres an article about the astronomical telescope

Cell biology is the study of how living cells work This includes the structure and function of the cell organelles and the carbon based molecules which cells produce The most important molecules are DNA RNA and proteins

The most important structures in the cell are the nucleus and the chromosomes but there are many others The structure of eukaryotic cells is much more complex than prokaryotic cells This is because endosymbiosis has occurred some or all of the eukaryote organelles are former prokaryotes Examples are mitochondria and plastids

The most important function of cells is to divide by mitosis or meiosis Cells in a multicellular organism also specialise in different functions and the different types may look quite to each other

The strike zone is the area over home plate through which a pitch must pass to be called a strike roughly between the batters armpits and knees The Strike Zone shall be determined from the batters stance as the batter is prepared to swing at a pitched ball The strike zone in baseball is a tricky subject as the strike zone changes with each batter Accordingly there is no automatic strike zone and much of what is a strike or not a strike is left to the judgement of the home plate umpire

In short the strike zone extends from the batters knees to the letters across the front of his uniform To be called a strike the pitcher must throw the baseball across home plate an area 17 inches wide and between the knees and letters as indicated In professional baseball a player who stands 5 6 tall for example will have a much smaller strikes zone that will a 6 4 homerun hitter Moreover the focus is not on where the ball is caught by the catcher but rather where the ball is as it passes the front of home plate

Changdeokgung is one of the five grand palaces in South Korea They are Gyeongbokgung Changdeokgung Deoksugung Changgyunggung and Gyeonghuigung The five grand palaces were not built at the same time Changdeokgung was built as the secondary palace next to Gyeongbokgung The construction began by King Taejong the Third King of the Joseon Dynasty in 1405 Taking 7 years to complete it was finished in the year 1412 

In the word Changdeokgung Changdeok means Prospering Virtue and gung means palace So the word Changdeokgung means the palace of prospering virtue Due to the meaning of the name of the palace the kings of Joseon Dynasty chose mostly Changdeokgung to reside in 

The palace had been the home of 14 kings of Joseon Dynasty until it was totally destroyed by the Japanese army in the year 1592 After the Japanese were driven back by the combined forces of Korea and China Changdeokgung was rebuilt in 1612 After the reconstruction the palace had suffered little damage and became the primary royal court of the Joseon Dynasty This was because Gyeongbokgung was also destroyed by the Japanese but the Joseon Dynasty did not rebuild it for some reason and the Changdeokgung became the biggest palace in Korea

However Changdeokgung had suffered some damage for 350 years after the reconstruction As a result a large scale restoration took palace from 1990 to 1999 This restoration shows how much the Korean people loved Changdeokgung Apparently the UNESCO saw its value as well Seeing Changdeokgung as a vital global asset UNESCO listed it as a World Cultural Heritage The UNESCO said that Changdukgung was outstanding example of Far Eastern palace architecture and garden design

Modern Dance is related to ballet but aims at different types of performance instead of the classical ballets Many of its dancers have been trained in ballet and modern dance companies are rather similar to ballet companies 

The phrase Modern dance is also applied to Ballroom dance of the English style However this page uses Modern dance as a term to describe 20th century concert dance on stage The modern dance style does not have set rules Modern dancers often create their own dance routines using their emotions and moods but on the other hand many performances are choreographed

Modern dancers prefer a more relaxed and free style of dancing While ballerinas try to be light on their feet modern dancers use body weight to increase movement 

Also modern dancing does not require specific costumes So modern dancers often dance barefoot and choose whatever they want to wear Modern dancers try to show their innermost emotions through dancing often trying to get closer to their inner selves This is why many modern dancers choose a subject that is close to their hearts and attempts to express the subject to the audience 

Modern Dance was developed in the 20th century mainly in the United States and Germany In the early 1900s several female dancers began rebelling against the strict rules of classical ballet The pioneers of Modern Dance in the United States were Isadora Duncan Loie Fuller Ruth St Denis and Martha Graham The pioneers of Germany were Rudolf Von Laban and Mary Wigman

Osechi is Japanese food made to celebrate the coming of the New Year called Shogatsu It is one of the most important annual events in Japan Osechi food is packed in colorful lacquer boxes called jubako Each dish and ingredient in osechi has a meaning such as good health fertility good harvest happiness long life and so on The kind of osechi foods eaten in Japanese homes varies from area to area It is a Japanese tradition to eat osechi dishes during the New Years holidays which go from January 1 to January 3

One year there was not much food People did not have enough rice to cook in their rice cooker Emperor Jintoku knew about this and it worried him a lot He said that he would lower the taxes in years when people did not have enough rice for New Years Day After that the taxes were lowered but the House of Emperor Jintoku became poor Japanese people celebrated this custom on New Years Day Osechi ryori is a dish that is cooked before New Years Eve to eat on New Years Day

On New Years Day the God of the Year named Toshigami comes to the world and the world starts a new year The god came through a special gate a Kadomatsu into our world He is god of agriculture In Japan when agriculture was the main activity of life people welcomed Toshigami and hoped for a rich harvest A special decoration a shimekazari was put up to welcome the god Another decoration a wakazari was put up to make sure that nothing would go wrong during the next year Osechi is a meal to give to Toshigami In Japan people gave the first part of the crop to god The rest of the celebration was a feast called naorai 

The beginning of osechi starts in the Yayoi period This went from 1000 BC to 300 AD People at that time were starting to grow rice As part of a harvest festival called Sekku people made food gifts to please the gods Sekku foods are eaten to thank the gods for the blessing of nature a good harvest and big catch This is the beginning of osechi This idea came from China

In the Heian period from 710 to 1185 this event became more common in Japan as the influence of China became more important There were five seasonal festival days or sekku January 7 March 3 5 May 7 July and 9 September An offering table was set up for the gods The foods offered to the gods were dry foods not processed for people to eat Modern osechi comes from the Edo period These days many Japanese people buy their osechi in shops instead of making it at home

There are many different osechi foods and each has a special meaning The shape the color and the name of each food has a meaning which might bring good luck happiness or long life One type of osechi is made from black soybean and herring roe Black is a color which brings youth and long life The name of the black soybean means that people can live a long life without sickness Herring roe symbolizes the prosperity of descendants because there is a lot of roe in each piece

Enma is the god of hell in the Buddhist religion He is often called Yama He is the god who judges whether the souls of people go to heaven or hell 

Enma is the god of hell who judges right and wrong after a human dies and falls into hell Enma gives many kinds of dreadful punishments The word Enma comes from Yama in Sanskrit and Pali a language for Buddhist writings in Sri Lanka Myanmar and Thailand He is said to be a human ancestor in the Rigveda He is a god of the Indian Veda myth and he is said to be the incarnation of the Jizo Bosatsu the stone statue which is the god of help in Japanese Buddhism 

Believers in Buddhism think Enma comes from the start of the world He was linked with death at first People thought he was king of paradise for the dead the god who ruled people when they lived in heaven People thought he tied up souls of the people with the rope that he held in the hand He became a feared god Then he was treated as just the god of death Because he is also an incarnation of the god of help it is said that he can come and go freely between heaven and hell

The appearance of Enma is really scary Enma is always shown wearing Chinese traditional clothes from the Sung era Why he wears Chinese traditional clothes is unknown Usually his dress is red He has a square crown on his head and a mace in his right hand His eyes are open wide and he looks angry His eyes and eyebrow slant upward He has a red face 

However in other countries and at different times in history Enma is pictured differently For example in old pictures from India Enma has a crown and is riding a water buffalo He has a club and a big rope Another Enma from ancient India has a flag and steps on water buffalo with one leg Enma is well built with thick arms and a very big chest He seems authoritative His looks are really scary Because of his appearance it is easy to understand why people fear Enma

Enma was the first person in the world to die He went to paradise called Gokuraku Jyoudo He lived in paradise and his job was looking after the dead People believed Enma was the god of paradise Over time people became scared of Enma His job was changed from looking after the dead to judging them Enma used a club and a big rope to tie up the souls of dead people He ruled the lower world and judged the dead He decided if a dead person went to heaven or hell He made his judgment on what they had done in their lives People who had behaved well went to heaven People who had behaved badly go to hell

The stories about Enma are very mysterious The most famous story is how Enma will pull someones tongue out if they did a bad thing Japanese parents teach their children to be honest by using this story Enma can also bring dead people back to life Abe no seimei a famous person in Japanese history died and was revived by Enma He also can decide when life should end This is the strangest story an actor died and met Enma The actor went to hell because he plays other people it means lying He told Enma all about himself his life and Enma started to be interested in his acting He said I would like to see you act The actor agreed and said I need a costume so please give me yours Enma gave it to him and the actor played as Enma saying Ogres Ogres Take this bad man away Enma was taken away and punished The actor became a new Enma instead of the real Enma

There are a number of books and movies about Enma in Japan and even in other countries Enma has been written about by many Japanese novelists The First Love of Enma Bungeisya by Hideo Watanabe is about escaping from hell and falling in love with a beautiful dead woman along the way Another side of Enma is shown in Enmas sword Syodensya and Hiraiwa by Koshihiro Igawa and The Worship of Enma by Yumie Enma is not fearful or strong at all In comic books like Dragon Ball Z Enma is shown as kind and calm Enma in Ojarumaru is funny In the American movie called Heaven Can Wait a dead man talked with Enma about his whole life before his death This Enma is not kind but strict This movie was nominated for best picture Some writers write about his power and the fear he causes and others write about his opposite side kind and calm

Futons are traditional Japanese bedding A futon is a padded mattress called a shikifuton a quilt called a kakefuton and a pillow filled with beans called a makura The futon was put on the floor at night for sleeping They could be easily rolled up during the day when they were not needed The word futon has come to mean a lot more than this Although many Japanese people sleep in a bed they say I sleep on futon it means to go to bed Futon now means things that Japanese people sleep on including beds

Many companies make futons and there are many kinds of futons Futons help you sleep comfortably so people choose futons that suit them Futons are made from chemical fibers like polyester natural fibers like cotton feather down and wool Japanese quilts usually contain feathers and Japanese mattress usually contain wool

The Japanese quilt can keep in heat and moisture depending on what it is made from Usually a futon that includes over 50 hemp or cotton is called a Menfuton This is popular all over the world Futons made from down are called quilt down This retains heat so this is a high class futon Futons made from feathers are called comforters This is cheap and is common around the world Futons made from chemical fibers are called chemical fiber futons This is cheap so this is popular Futons made from wool are called Yomo futon These are warm

In winter people generally use Hadafuton like a blanket to keep warm In summer people generally use Towelket like a big towel or Seer quilt which are cooler

Futons are generally used with a futon cover because these make it easy to keep the futon clean People generally use futons so they can sleep comfortably stay warm and support their bodies while asleep People usually sweat during sleep so futons absorb sweat and collect moisture Futons have to be hung out in sunlight to keep them dry this is called futon hoshi If this is not done ticks and mold could grow on the futon and it will become dirty and insanitary Futons need to be looked after properly

In the 13th century most people slept on straw mats but the nobles slept on tatami These were not as soft as futons are now It was said that they were hard and uncomfortable For a very long time people covered themselves with their clothes to keep warm Most people slept nude Rich people never did such things

In the 17th century bedclothes were made People made it by stuffing cloth with cotton and wool These bedclothes are the original form of the futon

In the 18th century futon production started because there was more domestic cotton available At that time futons were too expensive to buy for average people They could cost 1200000 yen Futons were important gifts and many men gave them to women in order to seduce them Prostitutes were sometimes presented with futons by rich men Prostitutes could be ranked by counting the futons the higher ranks of prostitutes received more futons

In those days futon meant a mattress not a quilt Bedclothes were common In the Kansai area they used a square thing like a blanket a fusuma The quilt is said to have evolved long before it

In the 19th century most people were able to buy futons The import of the raw cotton began and many factories were built Because of industrial development making futons was easier and more efficient than before This made the price become down and people were able to afford them

The manufacturer Nishikawa is the most famous This company is in Kyoto and Tokyo They make everything for the futons for example pillows sheets and quilts This brand has history of 440 years

In old days people thought any futon was good as long as they could sleep But now people want better futons Today people like a futon which they can relax on and recover from fatigue Futon makers have developed futons that can adjust to the human body This is called Seiatsu Futon in Japan There is some advantages to this new type of futon Since ventilation is good they are cool in summer and warm in winter Since it can adjust to ideal posture when you sleep it improves blood circulation while sleeping And they are easy to look after Also a futon of low repulsion is popular among Japanese people This is said to fit the body of the user Some users who are troubled by bedbugs on futon like tick guard futons

The Red Queen is the name of an evolutionary theory of Leigh Van Valen and later a book by Matt Ridley 

The term is taken from the Red Queens race in Lewis Carrolls Through the Looking Glass The Red Queen said It takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place The Red Queen principle can be stated as follows

The hypothesis is used to explain two different phenomena the advantage of sexual reproduction at the level of individuals and the constant evolutionary arms race between competing species

The book takes Van Valens idea which is about co evolution and extends it into a discussion about sexual selection in humans It argues that few aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex since human nature is a product of evolution and evolution in our case is driven by sexual selection

Sex is an evolutionary puzzle In most sexual species males make up half the population yet they bear no offspring directly and generally contribute little to the survival of offspring This latter point is of doubtful validity in many birds and mammals In human paleolithic populations males were no doubt vital for hunting and protection Many bird species rear the young jointly However most invertebrate species are not raised by parents at all with larvae developing amongst the plankton In addition males and females in many vertebrate species spend resources to attract and compete for mates Sexual selection may appear to favor traits that may reduce the fitness of an organism such as brightly colored plumage in birds of paradise which makes them more visible to predators Thus sexual reproduction appears to be highly inefficient 

The book begins with an evolutionary account of sex itself defending the theory that sex flourishes despite its costs because a mixed heritage confers to each generation a defensive head start against parasites and disease The basic reason for this is the way sexual reproduction increases the genetic variety in a population This greatly increases the chance of at least some individuals surviving the onslaught of predators parasites and diseases This much is common ground amongst evolutionary theorists

Ridley then argues that human intelligence is largely a result of sexual selection He argues that human intelligence far outstrips any need for survival He says our intelligence is like the peacocks tail a product of sexual selection Human intelligence he suggests is used primarily to attract mates through prodigious displays of wit charm inventiveness and individuality This view of intelligence is also treated at length by Geoffrey Miller The history of ideas on sexual selection and the evolution of sex is treated by Helena Cronin

The word FIDE means Fdration Internationale des checs It is the world chess organisation connecting all national federations It decides matters like World Championships and changes in rules of the game

FIDE was founded on 20 July 1924 in Paris France However it had little influence until the end of WW II The reigning worldchampion at that time Alexander Alekhine did not want to have anything to do with it He regarded the worldtitle is personal property This only changed when he died in 1946 Another event was the strong Soviet chess federation joining the FIDE in 1946 It had a lot of influence and many young strong players

In 1948 a tournament was organized to determine which of the world top players was entitled to call himself World Champion The death of Alekhine had left a vacuum One of his challengers before the war Jos Ral Capablanca from Cuba had also passed away 

The six players chosen by FIDE were

In the end Reuben Fine dropped out and the other five contested the event Mikhail Botvinnik won the tournament and became the new world champion

In 1950 the FIDE awarded its first IM and GM titles However it was not until 1957 that FIDE formulated clear criteria to award these titles In 1970 a new ranking system the Elo rating was introduced

With the collapse of the Soviet Union FIDE lost a powerful partner This resulted in a long period of trouble In 1993 worldchampion Gary Kasparov and his challenger Nigel Short left FIDE They founded their own organisation for professional top players the PCA So now there were two worldchampions one from FIDE and one from the PCA 

It was not until 2006 that the dust settled down and a re unification match between Vladimir Kramnik and Veselin Topalov took place In 1999 FIDE was recognised by the International Olympic Committee In 2001 FIDE played by anti doping rules trying to make chess for like a candidate for the Olympic Games

A Master in chess is a player who is awarded a master title by the world chess organisation FIDE or by a national chess organisation The term was used for a long time to describe someone who is an expert player but it now has an official meaning 

Grandmaster is a chess title for even stronger players The title comes from the word in Middle French Grand maistre was the title given to the head of an Order of Knights such as the Knights Templar or the Teutonic Knights Its first use in chess is a comment in the periodical Bells Life referring to William Lewis as our past grandmasterp156

FIDE titles were first awarded in 1950p133 There are four levels of masteryp132 177 There are detailed rules as to the number of games played at a given level and the full rules are quite lengthy Some countries go with this system entirely but others have their own system as well 

Once awarded a title the player keeps it for life 

In order of merit with official abbreviations they are

There are also women only titles

It can be seen that a woman grandmaster is a lower standard than an international master The purpose of women only titles is to encourage female players because there are few female players in the game

A Grandmaster is the highest title that a player can get except becoming a world champion It is given by the world chess organisation FIDE

Meeting the demands is not easy To become a grandmaster is very difficult To become a grandmaster a player has to play at least 27 games with at least two grandmaster results In practice this means achieving at least three grandmaster results or norms The tournament rating must be 2600 at least Besides this a players own FIDE rating must be at least 2500 Men and woman can earn the GM title by meeting the demands

A chessplayer who is already an IM will simply become grandmaster but it is not necessary to get the IM title first

As chess became more popular in the latter half of the 19th century the term began to be given out by organizations For example in Germany there arose an annual sponsored tournament the Hauptturnier the winners of which were awarded the title of Meister Emanuel Lasker who later became World Champion first earned a master title in one such tournament The Soviet Union had a system of national candidate masters masters and grandmasters before World War II and the satellite countries in eastern Europe followed suit after the war 

In the United States the title of National Master is awarded for life regardless of whether his rating goes below 2200 later In August 2002 the USCF decided that Any USCF member who has had a normal post tournament rating of 2200 or higher has demonstrated a significant level of chess ability and thought and is automatically awarded the lifetime title of National Master

Pungmul is a Korean traditional music that includes drumming dancing and singing Most performances are outside with tens of players all in constant motion Pungmul is rooted in the dure farming culture It was originally played as part of farm work on rural holidays at other village community building events and in shamanistic and Buddhistic rituals Pungmul performers wear very gorgeous costumes A flowery version of the Buddhist kkokkal is the most common head dress Advanced performers sometimes wear sangmo which are hats with long ribbon attached to them that players can spin and flip in intricate patterns by moving their heads

Drumming is the most importalnt element of Pungmul Each group is led by a kkwaenggwari player and includes at least one person playing janggu buk and jing Wind instruments are sometimes played along with the drummers Following the drummers are dancers who often play the sogo and tend to have more elaborate choreography Finally japsaek dressed as caricatures of traditional village roles wander around to engage spectators blurring the boundary between performers and audience Minyo are performed in Pungmul sometimes and audience members enthusiastically sing and dance along Most Minyo are set to drum beats in one of a few jangdan that are common to Pungmul Sanjo Pansori and other traditional Korean musical genres

The afro is a type of hairstyle that is noted for its large size The hair is curled out forming a ball shape For some people this is how their hair grows because it is naturally curly Not all beauty salons can offer this hairstyle though

An afro can be any length short or long but it is different for everyone especially depending on the persons race and ethnicity Europeans and Asians will tend to have wavier looser curls while those of African descent will have stronger tighter curls Some Jewish people also can naturally grow afros because of their curly hair These hairstyles are often called Jewfros 

The afro requires more looking after than other hairstyles but there are many ways to style the afro There is a special comb called the Afro pickcomb that helps get rid of tangles and smooths the hairs texture

The unconscious mind is thought to be a deeper part of a persons mind that works without that person knowing it Feelings thoughts desires or emotions appear to come out of nowhere leaving the person to question where they came from

The unconscious mind is a term coined by the 18th century German romantic philosopher Friedrich Schelling and later introduced into English by the poet and essayist Samuel Taylor Coleridge It is however an ancient idea which has been noticed in many civilisations and cultures Also whether other mammals have similar mental mechanisms to man is also a question with a considerable history

The unconscious mind plays a large role in Sigmund Freuds psychoanalysis He discussed the importance of the unconscious mind in understanding conscious thought and behaviour 

However the unconscious was not discovered by Freud Historian of psychology Mark Altschule concluded It is difficultor perhaps impossibleto find a nineteenth century psychologist or psychiatrist who did not recognize unconscious thought as not only real but of the highest importance 

Freuds advance was not to uncover the unconscious but to devise a method for systematically studying it though his method is as controversial as the rest of his ideas Freud called dreams the royal road to the unconscious This meant that dreams illustrate the logic of the unconscious mind Freud developed his first topology of the psyche in The Interpretation of Dreams in which he proposed that the unconscious exists and described a method for gaining access to it The preconscious was described as a layer between conscious and unconscious thought its contents could be accessed with a little effort

One key feature of the unconscious is repression Freud believed that many people repress painful memories deep into their unconscious mind

The adaptive unconscious is a set of unconscious mental processes influencing judgment and decision making It is different from conscious processing it is faster effortless more focused on the present but less flexible

In other theories of the mind the unconscious is limited to low level activity such as carrying out goals which have been decided consciously In contrast the adaptive unconscious is thought to be involved in high level cognition such as goal setting as well

The term adaptive unconscious suggests it has survival value and hence is an adaptation which was strongly selected in the past Indeed for much of vertebrate evolution all mental activity was unconscious No one supposes that fish have consciousness Thus our consciousness is added to an already existing set of mechanisms which operate but whose operation is normally not felt by usp23

The evidence for there being such a thing as the adaptive unconscious is a series of case studies which are hard to explain any other way 

After many scientific tests were done on an early Greek statue the Getty Museum was about to buy it However a small group of experts looked at it and said immediately Its a fake Eventually it was found to be a fake The question was how could anyone beat the battery of scientific tests just by looking at it The sceptics were asked how they did it One said It doesnt look old as if it had been centuries under the ground Another said Its fingernails dont look right Apparently they had all seen something which triggered a doubt Psychologists thought this might be an ancient mental mechanism which has survival value

A firefighter in Cleveland answered a routine call with his men It was in a kitchen in the back of a one story house The firefighters broke down the door laid down their hose and began dousing the fire with water This had little effect As the fire lieutenant recalls he suddenly thought to himself Theres something wrong here and he immediately ordered his men out Moments after they fled the floor they had been standing on collapsed The fire had been in the basement not the kitchen as it appeared When asked how he knew to get out the fireman thought it was ESP What is interesting is that the fireman could not immediately explain how he knew to get out From the locked door in our brains the fireman just blinked and made the right decision In fact had he thought consciously about the situation he would probably have lost his life and the lives of his menp125

In a similar way there are people who can repeatedly do something which seems amazing It really is possible to spot who is lying for instance and it is a skill which can be trained and improved It is possible to predict which couple will divorce and which will not The time taken for each decision is short and the amount of information available to the person making the decision seems very little

Thin slice decisions based on limited information are one end of a scale At the other end is the confusion caused by too much unorganised information analysis paralysis There are many examples of the latter state being bad for decision taking

It is easy to show that our snap judgements can also be quite wrong especially when we are overwhelmed with information or when we come to the decisions with unconscious bias and prejudice

In experiments subjects give verbal explanations of their own mental processesfor example why they chose one thing rather than anotheras if they could directly introspect the causes of their ideas and choices This introspection illusion may cause differences between the self and other people because people trust these unreliable introspections when forming attitudes about themselves but not about others

Gravitational lensing is caused by a massive body between a distant object and ourselves It can create the appearance of two or more objects where there is really only one The light from the object gets bent round the massive body in between

The massive body such as a galaxy or black hole creates a very strong gravitational field in space The exact nature of the effect depends on

Albert Einstein predicted the possibility of gravitational lensing The discovery that our Sun bends the light of distant objects when their light passes close to it was evidence that the general theory of relativity was correct

There a three types of lensing

Strong lensing betrays itself by producing multiple images from the same object A well known example is Einsteins Cross at a distance of 8 billion lightyears Here the gravitational lens produces four images from the same object although it is only one object The light of the quasar does not travel in a straight line to earth Instead it is bent along the gravitational field of a galaxy in front of it This galaxy is at a distance of 400 million lightyears

The first discovery of this kind happened in 1979 Two quasars were close to each other They both had the same spectrum and proved to be two images of the same quasar In 1980 scientists found out which group of galaxies functioned as the lens

Weak lensing does not produce multiple images of the same object Instead it produces a highly deformed or stretched image from an object far beyond the lens In 1986 this was discovered in cluster Abell 370 Later it was understood that this was a greatly deformed image of a galaxy far beyond the cluster 

The object can appear larger or smaller as is shown in the table Weak lenses allow us to observe very distant galaxies which we would be unable to observe without such lens By bending the light the amount of light from the source increases This way a very distant and faint galaxy can become visible while we normally would not be able to observe it

In cases of microlensing there is no distortion in shape However the amount of light visible from an object changes periodically This can be used to detect exoplanets Light from a distant star is bent and enhanced by the gravitational field of a closer star The presence of an exo planet rotating around that closer star bends the light of the star farther away periodically Object OGLE 2005 BLG 390 Lb discovered 25 January 2006 is the first exoplanet detected by using microlensing

Joan Geraldine Bennett was an Emmy nominated American film actress who appeared in more than 70 Hollywood films from the silent era to talkies from color to the advent of television and epic films She may be best known and loved for her film noir femme fatale roles in films by director Fritz Lang 

Joan Bennett had three distinct phases to her long and successful career first as a winsome blonde ingenue then as a brunette femme fatale and finally as a warm hearted wifemother figure

Born in Palisades NJ she was part of a famous theatrical family with a lineage dating back to traveling minstrels in 18th century England Her father was actor Richard Bennett her mother actress Adrienne Morrison and her sisters actress Constance Bennett and dancer Barbara Bennett Joan first acted onstage with her father at age 18 and by 19 had become a movie star courtesy of her roles in such movies as Bulldog Drummond and Disraeli She moved quickly from film to film throughout the 1930s appearing with John Barrymore in his version of Moby Dick and playing Amy to Katharine Hepburns Jo in Little Women Of the three Bennett sisters Joan would achieve the greatest fame

Contracted to 20th Century Fox Joan Bennett appeared as a blonde ingenue in several films including Puttin on the Ritz in 1930 and Me and My Gal in 1932 before leaving this studio to appear in Little Women The latter film brought Bennett to the attention of producer Walter Wanger who signed her to a contract and eventually married her 

Wanger managed Bennetts career and with director Tay Garnett convinced her to change her hair from blonde to brunette With this change her screen persona evolved into that of a glamorous seductive femme fatale and she began to attract attention in a series of highly acclaimed film noirs by director Fritz Lang During the search to find an actress to play Scarlett OHara in Gone with the Wind Bennett was tested and impressed producer David O Selznick She was briefly considered to be a front runner for this part but Selznick eventually turned his attention to Paulette Goddard who was then rejected in favour of Vivien Leigh

In the 1940s Bennett appeared in four films directed by Fritz Lang with whom she and Wanger had formed their own film company Three of these films Man Hunt The Woman in the Window and Scarlet Street established her as a film noir femme fatale and leading Hollywood actress She also worked with noted directors Jean Renoir in The Woman on the Beach and Max Ophls in The Reckless Moment Other highlights of the more mature phase of her career include the role of Spencer Tracys wife and Elizabeth Taylors mother in both Father of the Bride and Fathers Little Dividend

In 1950 Bennett changed agents In 1951 Wanger shot and injured Bennetts new MCA agent Jennings Lang with whom she had allegedly begun an affair The resulting scandal hurt her career much more than Wangers according to the double standards toward women of the time Wangers attorney Jerry Giesler mounted a temporary insanity defense and Wanger served a four month sentence at the Castaic Honor Farm two hours drive north of Los Angeles quickly returning to his film career to make a string of intelligent hit films Bennett meanwhile was forced to flee to Chicago to appear in theater and later in television because the scandal was too great a stain on her film career and the film studios were already floundering in the 1950s as it was Though Humphrey Bogart a longtime friend of Bennetts pleaded with the studios on her behalf to keep her role in Were No Angels following the shooting scandal that film proved to be one of Bennetts last Wanger and Bennett remained married until 1965 

Bennett continued to work steadily in theatre and television and was a cast member of the television series Dark Shadows for its entire five year run from 1966 until 1971 receiving an Emmy Award nomination for her performance therein Bennett also appeared in a few more films most notably the cult horror thriller from Italian director Dario Argentos Suspiria In the last decades of her life she was married to David Wilde a Yale graduate and film critic Bennett died from a heart attack in Scarsdale New York at the age of 80 and was buried in Pleasant View Cemetery Lyme Connecticut

Joan Bennett was survived by 4 daughters and 13 grandchildren

Bennett has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for services to Motion Pictures at 6310 Hollywood Boulevard

The kome sd were riots where many of the citizens of Japan became upset and rebelled against the government This happened between July 1918 to September 1918 They caused the ending of the Terauchi Masatake government

A very big rise in the price of rice caused very bad economic problems especially in rural areas where rice was the main food of daily life for people Farmers became angry at the government and the rice merchants when they learned that they were making much less money for growing the rice than it was being sold for to the public They blamed the government and the merchants for letting the price of rice rise so high The rise in the price of rice happened just at the worst point in the rapid rise in prices in many things such as food and rents that was happening just after World War I This caused problems for the people of Japan The Siberian Intervention made things worse because the government themselves bought lots of rice to feed their soldiers who were outside of Japan This made the price of rice rise even more The government didnt do anything to stop it and it spread to the towns and cities 

The Rice Riots were the biggest most violent and wide spread in modern Japanese history The first protest happened in the small fishing town of Uozu Toyama Prefecture on 23 July 1918 Starting with peaceful petitioning the protest quickly grew into riots strikes looting incendiary bombings of police stations and government offices and into armed fights By mid September 1918 over 623 protests and or riots had happened in 38 cities 153 towns and 177 villages with over 2 million people taking part in them 25000 people were arrested and 8200 were convicted of crimes Punishments were given including minor fines and up to the death penalty

Prime Minister Terauchi said he and his cabinet were to blame for the riots and they all broken wikt linkresignationended their jobs on 29 September 1918

People studying this part of Japanese history think that the riots and so the need for rice in some way may have caused the Japanese to grow their occupation of other countries Evidence of this is thought to be the increase in rice production in Taiwan and Korea

Leadbeaters Possum is an endangered species of Australian possum Once thought to be extinct it is now only found in small areas of surviving old and mixed age mountain ash forest in the central highlands of Victoria Australia north east of Melbourne About half this area was burnt out in the disastrous Black Saturday bushfire in 2009 Large areas of the forest around Marysville Narbethong and Healesville were destroyed They need food all year and trees with holes where they can hide during the day This limits them to mixed age wet sclerophyll forest with a thick mid story of Acacia 

It is the only species in the Gymnobelideus genus It was named after John Leadbeater a taxidermist at the Museum of Victoria 

It is the only mammal that is only found in Victoria so in 1968 the State of Victoria made Leadbeaters Possum its faunal emblem

The possum was first discovered by Europeans in 1867 Only five possums were found the last one in 1909 It was thought the species was extinct because its habitat around Bass River in south west Gippsland was cleared for farming in the early 1900s

In 1961 a group was discovered near Marysville in the Upper Yarra Valley Further searching found more groups in the highlands of Victoria However type of forest is critical it can not be too old or too young

The possums survival is believed to be due to the terrible Black Friday fires that burnt through Victoria in 1939 This created a lot of new growth in the forest which provided food It also left a lot of large dead trees for shelter and nesting The Leadbeaters Possum population grew to about 7500 in the early 1980s After the 2009 fires it is believed that there are now only about 1000 possums left Many of the old trees have decayed and there is little new growth Before European settlement the possums would simply have moved to new recently burnt areas but with so much land cleared in the last 100 years they now have nowhere else to go

If a population of about 1000 can survive for another 150 years natural tree hollows will begin to develop in the trees that started growing after the 1939 fires and which survived the 2009 fires This should help possum numbers start to increase again

Leadbeaters Possums are rarely seen They sleep during day and come out at night They are small about convert10cmin0lkonabbron long and weigh about 90 grams about the size of a small rat They move very quickly and live at the top of some of the tallest forests in the world The possum is covered in thick soft fur It can be grey through to brown in colour with a black stripe along their backs Their fur on the chest and stomach area is pale grey One of the main features of the possum is its club shaped tail

They live in small family groups of up to 24 individuals usually a breeding pair their children and sometimes an extra male or two They sleep together in a nest made out of broken wikt linkshredshredded bark in a tree hollow The nests can be anywhere from convert6mft0lkonabbron to convert30mft0lkonabbron above the ground They have a territory of up to 20000 square metres which they will defend from other possums The oldest female is the most aggressive She will attack outsiders and chase her own daughters out of her territory when they become adults at about 14 months of age The average female lifespan in the bush is only about 27 months but as much as 10 years in captivity

Leadbeaters Possums do not survive by themselves Young males leave their parents at about 15 months of age and join another group or live together in large male groups looking for females to start new groups

At sunset Leadbeaters Possums leave their nests and go out to find food in the tree tops They often take huge leaps from tree to tree They are omnivorous they eat a range of tree saps lerps and arthropods which they find under the loose bark of eucalyptus trees such as spiders crickets and beetles They get their energy from the sap and their proteins from the arthropods

They give birth at the beginning of winter or late spring They have one or two babies which stay in the pouch for 80 or 90 days When they come out of the pouch they stay in the nest for another three weeks Young Leadbeaters Possums are often eaten by owls

Because of the small area where they live and the mix of forest trees that they need the Leadbeaters Possums is an endangered species Logging continues to be a major threat to the possum In 1993 five hectares of protected habitat east of Powelltown was logged because of a mapping error  Author Peter Preuss said that the number of possums dropped in 1997 with their current habitat under threat from logging He said that there needed to be a new breeding program 

Dr David Lindenmeyer has said that the need to make nest boxes showed that logging was removing too many older trees with hollows needed by species like Leadbeaters Possum Studies have shown that logging in the forest between the Yarra Valley National Park and Mount Bullfight Conservation Reserve in February 2006 led to the deaths of most possums in the area Adult possums are territorial and do not want to move Many more were killed early in 2007 when VicForests cleared large firebreaks through possum habitat after the Christmas fires Firebreaks and cleared land stop the possums from being able to travel and breed with other nearby groups

With its much of its known habitat destroyed in the bushfires of February 2009 the species status is currently in doubt The mapped distribution of the Leadbeaters possum exactly matches the area burnt in the fires

The last Leadbeaters Possum in captivity died at Healesville Sanctuary Victoria in May 2006 There are now no Leadbeaters Possums in captivity anywhere in the world and no breeding program to assist this animals survival A group Friends of Leadbeaters Possum has formed to try an protect the possum and to make the government protect the habitat

Kennel cough or tracheobronchitis is a very easily caught dog illness characterized by inflammation of the upper airways It can be caused by viral infections such as canine distemper canine adenovirus canine parainfluenza virus or canine respiratory coronavirus or bacterial infections such as Bordetella bronchisepticapage needed It is called kennel cough because the infection can spread very quickly among dogs such as in the closeness of a kennel

Both viral and bacterial causes of kennel cough are spread through the air by infected dogs sneezing and coughing It can also be spread through contact with things that have the bacteria or virus on them It can still be spread days or weeks after symptoms disappear Symptoms begin usually 3 to 5 days after exposure The disease can become pneumonia

Symptoms can include a broken wikt linkharshharsh dry coughing broken wikt linkretchretching sneezing broken wikt linksnortsnorting broken wikt linkgaggagging or vomiting in response to light pressing of the trachea or after excitement or exercise The symptoms are caused by the inflammation of the airways It can increase after excitment or exercise because of the quick breathing that takes place which causes the nerves of airway to become more stimulated A fever is not always present The disease can last 10 20 days and can come back when the dog is put into a stressful situation which puts stress on the dogs immune system Medical diagnosis is made by seeing these symptoms having a history of exposure is also helpful but not always found as kennel cough is easily spread through contact with the ground toys sidewalks dog parks

Antibiotics are given to treat any bacterial infection present Cough suppressants are used if the cough is not productive The usual outcome is good Prevention is by vaccinating for canine adenovirus distemper parainfluenza and Bordetella In kennels the best prevention is to keep all the cages clean Most kennels will not board dogs without proof of vaccination

Ethelbert Woodbridge Nevin was an American pianist and composer He is remembered for a small number of romantic songs and piano pieces which became extremely popular in the early 20th century

Nevin was born in 1862 at Vineacre on the river Ohio near Pittsburgh Pennsylvania He grew up there His father was a newspaper editor and he taught the young boy most subjects His mother played the piano The family bought a grand piano which was the first grand piano ever to be taken across the Allegheny Mountains 

Ethelbert showed musical promise when he was very young His brother and cousins were also musical When he was four he was playing the piano with cushions on the floor so that he could reach the pedals His father took him to Dresden for two years to study music He also studied in Pittsburgh and in Boston

He started his career giving piano lessons When he had earned enough money he went to Berlin where he had lessons from Karl Klindworth who was a good teacher for him He showed Nevin how important it was to have a good general knowledge and not just to spend hours and hours practising the piano This helped Nevin who had good tastes in literature and he chose some good poems to make into songs

In 1885 he was invited to join a group who had lessons from Hans von Blow He played works by of Brahms Liszt and Raff Cosima Wagner and Joseph Joachim often came to the concerts given by this group

In 1887 he went back to America and lived in Boston where he taught and played in some concerts He asked Richard Strauss to teach him composition but Strauss did not accept him

In 1892 he went to Paris where he taught singing and helped many American and French opera singers to learn their parts for singing in operas  He worked very hard and his health got bad He spent his last years in several European places and then he went back to America He died in 1901

Nevins music is romantic and sometimes rather sentimental for modern tastes His best known piece is Narcissus from Water Scenes These pieces were used by the dancer Isadora Duncan to dance to He also wrote a famous song called The Rosary and Mighty Lak a Rose

Nevin was pictured on a 1940 ten cent US postage stamp

Eucalyptus regnans also called Mountain Ash Victorian Ash Swamp Gum Tasmanian Oak or Stringy Gum is a species of Eucalyptus from Victoria and Tasmania It can grow to more than convert100mft0lkonabbron and is the tallest flowering plant in the world 

It is an evergreen tree the tallest eucalyptus tree growing 70 120 m tall It has a straight grey trunk with smooth bark The leaves are narrow curved and end in a point like a sickle They grow up to convert14cmin0lkonabbron long and convert25cmin0lkonabbron wide They are green to grey green with a red stalk The flowers are in groups of 9 15 together each flower about 1 cm diameter with a ring of many white stamens The fruit is a hard nut up to 9 mm long and 7mm wide

Mountain Ash are found in cool deep soiled mountain areas to convert1000mft0lkonabbron above sea level with high rainfall of over convert1200mmin0lkonabbron each year They grow very quickly at more than a metre a year and can reach convert65mft0lkonabbron in 50 years They live for an average life span of 400 years The fallen logs continue supporting a rich variety of life for centuries more on the forest floor

Unusually for a eucalypt Mountain Ash does not regrow after fire They grow only from seed which are released from their woody gumnuts by heat The seedlings need a lot of light much more than reaches the forest floor normally when there are mature trees blocking the sun Severe fires can kill all the trees in a forest which causes a massive release of seed to take advantage of the nutrients in the ash bed Up to 25 million seedlings per convert1haacre0lkonabbron have been recorded after a major fire Competition and natural thinning slowly reduces the number of mature trees to about 30 to 40 per hectare Because it takes roughly 20 years for seedlings to reach become old enough to make seeds repeated fires in the same area can cause local extinctions If however there are no fires to release seeds the trees die off after about 400 years and are replaced by other species 

Eucalyptus regnans is the tallest of all flowering plants and possibly the tallest of all plants although no living trees can make that claim The tallest tree named Centurion stands 996 metres tall in Tasmania There are 16 living trees in Tasmania that have been measured taller than 90 metres The tallest tree ever found was the Ferguson Tree at 1326 metres found in the Watts River region of Victoria in 1872 It had fallen over and was measured by William Ferguson the Inspector of State Forests The top of the tree had broken off but the trunk was still more than one metre in diameter Ferguson guessed the tree would have been more than 152 metres in height

Eucalyptus regnans is valued for its timber and large areas of trees have been cut down The main uses are building timber and woodchipping It also used for newsprint in the 20th century Most of the woodchips are sent to Japan While the area of natural stands with large old trees is rapidly decreasing large areas of new trees exist It is increasingly grown in plantations where the long straight fast growing trunks are more valuable than the old growth timber

The timber is rather rough in texture It is easy to work and the grain is straight with long clear sections without knots The wood works reasonably well for steam bending It is used for furniture flooring woodpanelling veneer plywood window frames and general building

Hurricane Boris was a deadly storm It was the fourth cyclone of the 1996 Pacific hurricane season formed on June 27 During the overnight hours the depression became Tropical Storm Boris Shortly thereafter Boris rapidly strengthened into a hurricane Just as an eye began to form Boris made landfall in Mexico with peak winds of 85 mph It rapidly weakened and dissipated on July 1 Boris caused heavy flooding in southern Mexico Ten deaths were reported Damage is unknown

Meteorological history 

Boris originated from a tropical wave that moved of Africa June 8 It passed near the Cape Verde Island with no convection It crossed Central America on June 23 The wave was very poorly defined on satellite imagery for many days The first signs of a circulation on satellite imagery appeared on the 26th centered about 250 miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec The system became a tropical depression on the 27th when convective banding increased around the center 

At its first advisory it was noted that it get better organized At that time tropical storm warnings went up for Mexico It was also noted the Aviation model forecast Tropical Depression Four E to make landfall in Mexico as a weak tropical storm in 12 hours Around that time the forecast track was issued by the National Hurricane Center late on June 27 stating that it would receive an outflow from close by Hurricane Alma At the same time the Ukmet model had Tropical Depression Four E remaining offshore Mexico The same model also had the depression becoming Tropical Storm Boris The National Hurricane Center forcasted Tropical Depression Four E to become Tropical Storm Boris and make landfall in Mexico with winds of convert50nmikmabbron In the same advisory it was noted that the outer rain bands of brand new Tropical Depression Four E had moved onshore Mexico 

The tropical cyclone moved northwestward at 8 to 10 knots for the next two days and strengthened from 25 knots to 80 knots during a 36 hour period with a ragged eye appearing on satellite imagery just before landfall on the afternoon of June 29 at a peak intensity of convert85nmikmabbron making Boris a moderate Category 1 hurricane The center crossed the south coast of Mexico midway between Lazaro Cardenas and Acapulco Boris quickly weakened to a depression and turned southwestward in response to a building ridge to its north The system was disrupted by the mountainous terrain of Mexico and dissipated on the July 1 after moving back over water just south of Puerta Vallarta

Hurricane Boris was in general a well forecast storm Due to the short time when the system was at or above tropical storm intensity long range forecasts were not verified The average errors were convert101nmikmabbron at one and a half days in the future As Hurricane Boris was approaching Mexico a tropical storm watch was issued for the coast between Manzanillo and Puerto Escondido on June 28 From Manzanillo to Puerto Maldonado the tropical storm replaced with a hurricane warning the same day

Boris caused ten deaths One person was killed in Tecpan Nearby three other people drowned and five fishers were missing In Acapulco a child was killed when a roof collapsed Rain was heavy throughout the impacted region with the highest totals in Guerrero A total of 1216 in was recorded in Coyuca de Bentez The highest total was 1498 in at Paso de San Antonio to the east of the point of landfall Those rains caused a flood on the San Jeronimo River which left at least 5000 homeless In Tecpan a countless number of homes were washed away The storm flooded lobbies of hotels along the coast Also in Acapulco strong surf pushed fishing boats against a sea wall Trees were knocked down and business signs were blown down Streets were flooded to the level of hubcaps A total of about 10000 people were left homeless and at least 70 people were injured Approximately 12 boats were sunk offshore Tecpan bore the brunt of the storm reporting heavy damage On July 18 the President and Republic had a meeting for the Victims of Hurricane Boris and Hurricane Cristina later that season in Acapulco Mexico

There are some Sciences that are used to study nature According to these sciences the things that can be observed in nature follow certain rules These rules are often unknown and natural sciences are about finding them They often use what is called the scientific method to do this

Some sciences like Mathematics can help in all of the above They make it easier to talk about rules and models

Other sciences that mainly look at how humans think and behave and about their society are called social sciences

The natural sciences are used to make new things The natural sciences are guides to test new ideas They are used to solve engineering problems and technology problems Math helps the natural sciences to solve problems and make new things Computers do this too Computers and math are tools for the natural sciences

The model was the first to explain why certain groups of people lived in certain areas of the city Burgess said that there were circles around the center of the city The circle a piece of land was in determined how it was used Burgess saw different zones starting at the center

Burgess saw that wealthier people tended to live farther away from the city center When the city grew the city center would grow the rings would also shift outwards

The model also has some problems for example

An equilibrium is a state of a system where the system is balanced A system that is in equilibrium does not change The word has been used for different concepts from different fields of study 

Chemical equilibrium is an idea which describes the behavior of chemical reactions over time In reactions that have finished reacting and have attained equlibrium the concentrations of the reactant and product chemicals do not change Instead the amount of product chemicals to reactant chemicals remains a fixed value this ratio is called the equilibrium constant For some reactions the equilibrium constant is very large in which case nearly all of the reactant chemical is turned into products such as when paper is burned For other reactions it is very small which results in very little product being formed If the equilibrium constant is close to 1 a mixture of both products and reactants is expected at equilibrium When chemists talk about equilibrium constants they call reactions with large K values favorable and reactions with small K values unfavorable It is important to note however these terms are not judgements about the value or usefulness of a particular chemical reaction In fact some very important reactions are actually unfavorable one such example is the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen gas which has a rather small equilibrium constant  

Understanding the concept of chemical equilibrium in general and finding the equilibrium constant for specific reactions in particular is very important to chemists and other scientists Discovering the equilibrium constant for a reaction is very helpful for understanding that reaction Knowing the equilibrium constant of a reaction is important because it allows you to calculate how much product will ultimately be formed during a reaction Moreover it also tells you how a particular mixture of chemicals will react This is because chemical reactions always occur in the direction which will make the ratio of their products to reactants equal to the equilibrium constant This is known as Le Chatteliers Principal The exception to this rule is when an outside energy source forces the reaction to occur in the opposite direction such as when a battery is recharged Knowing the equilibrium constant of a reaction also helps you to understand the flow of energy that occurs during the reaction 

In Information technology a packet is collection of data that can be used by computers which need to communicate with each other usually as part of a network Some computers and networks do not use packets to communicate But most currently do including nearly all computers on the Internet Packets allow many computers on a network to communicate more quickly and easily

A packet consists of two kinds of data control information and user data If you think of a packet like a letter in the mail the control information is like the outside of the envelope Theres an address that says where to send the letter and a stamp that says how to send it Similarly the computer uses the control information in the packet to decide where and how to send the data People arent usually interested in the control information

The user data is like the inside of the envelope It is the actual information the computer is trying to send This might be the contents of a web page or a users name and address for example Its generally more for peoples use and less for the computers use

Different communication protocols put the control information and user information in different places or make it look different But they still do the same thing

Sometimes the computers make mistakes while transmitting data or have trouble hearing each other So many packets use a checksum or cyclic redundancy check to make sure they got the right information This is usually one component of the control information This helps to make sure the packets themselves have the right information But then computers also need to get the right packets

Designing computer networks is very hard Even though todays computers are very fancy sometimes information doesnt arrive where its supposed to Sometimes computers try to fix this and end up sending it twice And sometimes the information doesnt arrive in the right order The Transmission Control Protocol or TCP was invented to fix these problems But since it is complex some computers use the User Datagram Protocol or UDP instead

It is not possible to do an exact measurement but it is possible to say how accurate a measurement is This is because one can measure the same thing again and again and collect all the data together This allows us to do statistics on the data Statistics talks about statistical errors and residuals In both cases what is meant is the difference between the observed or measured value and the real value which is unknown 

If there is only one random variable the difference between statistical errors and residuals is the difference between the mean of the population against the mean of the sample In that case the residual is the difference between what the probability distribution says and what was actually measured

Suppose there is an experiment to measure the height of 21 year old men from a certain area The mean of the distribution is 175 m If one man chosen at random is 180 m tall the error is 005 m if he is 170 tall the error is 5 cm

A residual on the other hand is an observable estimate of the unobservable statistical error The simplest case involves a random sample of n men whose heights are measured The sample mean is used as an estimate of the population mean Then we have

Note that the sum of the residuals within a random sample must be zero The residuals are therefore not independent The sum of the statistical errors within a random sample need not be zero the statistical errors are independent random variables if the individuals are chosen from the population independently

In sum

Portal is a first person shooter puzzle video game made by Valve Corporation set inside the Half Life series It was originally sold in The Orange Box a game collection deal which came with the Valve made games Portal Half Life 2 and Team Fortress 2 It is now sold by itself and is available for Xbox 360 PlayStation 3 Mac and PC

The player plays as a woman named Chell who has to go though tests while being watched by a computer named GLaDOS an acronym for Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System GLaDOS provides all of the games dialog and is known for being clever funny and sarcastic promising the player character a cake if all of the tests are finished GLaDOS and the testing rooms were created by a company called Aperture Science which competes with Black Mesa The player must use a gun called the Portal Gun that makes two linked holes called portals to solve puzzles The two portals one blue and one orange are linked together and let the player get from one place to another When the player enters the blue portal they will come out of the orange portal

Portal has many jokes in it that have become popular on the internet for example the cake is a lie Because the game was very popular Valve made a sequel in 2011 called Portal 2

The game starts with Chell waking up in a small glass room that has only a bed a toilet and a radio inside She is told by GLaDOS that testing will start soon and an orange portal opens on one of the walls Once the player goes through she enters the testing rooms and begins testing There are 19 testing rooms called Test Chambers in all

The tests start out simple Chell has to pick up boxes called Weighted Storage Cubes and put them on buttons which will open the door to the exit of the chamber At this point GLaDOS speaks to Chell as a guide praises her and promises her cake when the tests are over Near the beginning of the game Chell gets the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device also known as the Portal Gun At first her Portal Gun only makes blue portals and the orange portals are made by GLaDOS Later Chell gets the complete Portal Gun and can make both blue and orange portals

The tests become more and more dangerous farther into the game In some rooms there is deadly acid on the floor In others there are balls of electricity called High Energy Pellets which will kill Chell if she touches them During these tests GLaDOS becomes more and more sarcastic giving Chell useless advice such as The floor here will kill you Try to avoid it At one point GLaDOS tells Chell a chamber is broken and she must go through a chamber full of sentry guns called Turrets instead If a Turret sees Chell it will shoot at her until she dies In this chamber is a hidden room In the hidden room are drawings and writing on the walls left by an unknown person The writing says things like the cake is a lie and shes always watching with a picture of a camera There are more rooms like this in later chambers

In another chamber Chell has to use the Weighted Companion Cube which looks like a Weighted Storage Cube with hearts on it to solve the test During the test GLaDOS tells Chell several times that the Companion Cube is not alive but at the end of the test she tells Chell she has to kill the Companion Cube to get to the next test 

During the last test Chell has to stand on a moving platform At the end of the platforms track it will carry her into a fire pit GLaDOS thanks Chell for doing the tests At the last minute Chell uses her Portal Gun to escape the trap While trying to escape the building Chell is led into a room where she finds GLaDOS Chell breaks a white ball that fell out of GLaDOS GLaDOS tells her she was stupid to break it because they did not know what it was but GLaDOS quickly figures out it was her morality core She tells Chell the people who worked for Aperture Science installed it to make her stop killing them with Deadly Neuro Toxin Because Chell broke it GLaDOS can use the Neuro Toxin again Chell has a time limit of 6 minutes to kill GLaDOS before the Neuro Toxin kills Chell After breaking pieces off of her and burning them GLaDOS is destroyed and Chell escapes the building 

After Chell escapes she faints and a robot drags her back into the building During the credits GLaDOS sings a song called Still Alive written by Jonathan Coulton that says even though Chell killed her she is still alive

Portal is a first person shooter game which means that it is played from the view of the player character Chell When players get the fully powered portal gun they can make two portals that are linked together on some white surfaces Chell starts out with nothing only able to do what GLaDOS lets her such as entering portals created by GLaDOS and using cubes that GLaDOS gives her Once Chell gets a half powered portal gun she can fire a blue portal that connects to orange portals that GLaDOS puts in the rooms When Chell gets the fully powered portal gun she can put both portals anywhere 

The portals are linked making a tunnel that Chell can walk through The tunnel works in both directions so if Chell enters a blue portal she will exit from an orange portal and if she enters an orange portal she will exit from a blue portal The purpose of the portals is to make shortcuts to different areas for example if the player needs to get to a high ledge but is unable to jump to it they can put a blue portal at their level and fire an orange portal above the ledge Going through those portals will get the player onto the ledge

The portals can be used in different ways notably as a way to catapult Chell If the player cannot put a portal on a high ledge but can put one on a wall across from the ledge and one on the floor below these portals can be used to propel Chell forward far enough to reach the ledge This is because portals do not affect forward momentum When Chell enters the portal in the floor and exits the portal in the wall she will fall gaining speed If she goes through the portal on the floor again while falling she will be going fast enough that when she exits the wall portal again she will be able to land on the ledge

The different ways the portals work together mean there are multiple ways to solve the puzzles in the Test Chambers

Sistn o Balchestn   is one of the 30 provinces of Iran It is in the southeast of the country It has borders with Pakistan and Afghanistan Its capital is Zahedan 

The province is the largest in Iran with an area of 181785 km and a population of 24 million The counties of the province are Iran Shahr Chabahar Khash Zabol Zahedan Saravan and Nik Shahr

The region is also home to Irans Baloch Sunni minority

Balochistan or Baluchistan is an arid region on the Iranian Plateau The plateau is in Southwest Asia and South Asia between Pakistan Iran and Afghanistan The area is named after the numerous Baloch tribes The Baloch are an Iranian people who moved into the area from the west around AD 1000 All natives are considered Balochi even if they do not speak the Balochi language Pashto Persian Hazaragi and Brahui languages are also spoken in the region The southern part of Balochistan is known as Makran Now it is recognised by UNPO as an Unrepresented Nation

Balochistans landscape is made of barren rugged mountains and fertile land During the summer some regions of Balochistan are the hottest Most of the land is barren particularly the Iranian and Afghan side of the region Relatively few people live there In the south is the desert through which Alexander the Great passed with great difficulty

The naked mole rat also known as the sand puppy or desert mole rat is a burrowing rodent The species is native to parts of East Africa It is only species currently classified in genus Heterocephalus It is one of only two known eusocial mammals 

The animal has an unusual set of traits which allow for a life in a harsh underground environment The animals are unable to feel pain in their skin They also have a very low metabolism

Typically the animals are between eight and ten centimetres long and weigh about 30 grams Queens are larger and may weigh well over 50 g the largest reaching 80 g They are well adapted to their underground existence Their eyes are quite small and they do not see very well Their legs are thin and short Nevertheless they are very good at moving underground and can move backward as fast as they can move forward They have large protruding teeth which they use to dig Their lips are sealed just behind the teeth to prevent soil from filling their mouths while digging They have little hair and wrinkled pink or yellowish skin

The naked mole rat is well adapted for the limited availability of oxygen within the tunnels that are its habitat its lungs are very small and its blood has a very strong affinity for oxygen increasing the efficiency of oxygen uptake It has a very low respiration and metabolic rate for an animal of its size about two thirds that of a mouse of the same size It only uses very little oxygen In long periods of hunger such as a drought its metabolic rate can reduce by up to twenty five percent

The naked mole rat can only regulate its body temperature in the typical mammalian fashion over a relatively narrow range of temperatures Outside this range it overheats or cools It can overcome this via behavioral means to keep a constant temperature When cold naked mole rats will huddle together or bask in the shallow parts of their burrow systems When they get too hot they retreat to the deeper cooler parts of their tunnel system

The skin of naked mole rats lacks a key neurotransmitter called substance P This neurotransmitter is responsible in mammals for sending pain signals to the central nervous system When naked mole rats are exposed to acid or capsaicin they feel no pain When injected with Substance P however the pain signaling works as it does in other mammals but only with capsaicin and not with the acids This probably is an adaptation to the animal living in high levels of carbon dioxide due to poorly ventilated living spaces which would cause acid to build up in their body tissues

The naked mole rat is native to the drier parts of the tropical grasslands of East Africa mainly South Ethiopia Kenya and Somalia

colonies averaging 75 80 individuals live together in complex systems of burrows in arid African deserts The tunnel systems built by naked mole rats can stretch up to two or three miles in cumulative length

The naked mole rat is one of the two species of mammals that exhibit eusociality They have a complex social structure in which only one female and one to three males reproduce while the rest of the members of the colony function as workers As in certain bee species the workers are divided along a continuum of different worker caste behaviors instead of discrete groups Some function primarily as tunnellers expanding the large network of tunnels within the burrow system and some primarily as soldiers protecting the group from outside predators

This eusocial organisation social structure similar to that found in ants termites and some bees and wasps is very rare among mammals The Damaraland Mole Rat is the only other eusocial mammal currently known

The relationships between the queen and the breeding males may last for many years A behaviour called reproductive suppression is believed to be the reason why the other females do not reproduce meaning that the infertility in the working females is only temporary and not genetic Queens live from 13 to 18 years and are extremely hostile to other females behaving like queens or producing hormones for becoming queens When the queen dies another female takes her place sometimes after a violent struggle with her competitors

Males and females are able to breed at one year of age Gestation is about 70 days A litter typically ranges from three to twelve pups but may be as large as 28 The average litter size is 11 In the wild naked mole rats usually breed once a year if the litter survives In captivity they breed all year long and can produce a litter every 80 days The young are born blind and weigh about 2 g The queen nurses them for the first month after which the other members of the colony feed them feces until they are old enough to eat solid food

Naked mole rats feed primarily on very large tubers that they find deep underground through their mining operations but also eat their own feces A single tuber can provide a colony with a long term source of foodlasting for months or even years as they eat the inside but leave the outside allowing the tuber to regenerate Symbiotic bacteria in their intestines help them digest the fibres 

The naked mole rat is also of interest because it is extraordinarily long lived for a rodent of its size and holds the record for the longest living rodent The secret of their longevity is debated but is thought to be related to the fact that they can shut down their metabolism during hard times and so prevent oxidative damage This has been summed up as Theyre living their life in pulses

Due to their extraordinary longevity for such a small rodent an international effort was put into place to sequence the genome of the naked mole rat

Naked mole rats are not threatened Despite their tough living conditions naked mole rats are quite widespread and numerous in the drier regions of East Africa Though seen living up to 20 years their lifestyles in those situations consist of mostly sleep

Capsaicin is a chemical substance It is responsible for the sense of hotness found in chile peppers In mammals it causes a sensation of burning of the tissues it comes in contact with Capsicain and other similar substances called capsaicinoids are produced by chile peppers and other plants probably as a protection against being eaten Pure capsaicin is a hydrophobic colorless odorless crystalline to waxy compound

capsaicinoids are added to food to make it have a hot taste but it can also be used as an analgesic a painkiller Such painkillers are often directly used on the skin The burning of the capsaicin will mask the real pain Capsicaicin is also the main agent in pepper spray 

Capsicain is not soluble in water it binds to oil and fat Soap can be used to wash it off If something too hot has been eaten milk or yoghurt can be used 

A football team refers to a group of players who together play football

Gravitational potential energy is energy associated with gravity or gravitational force

An object gets gravitational potential energy when it moves uphill The energy used up when moving up the hill is changed into gravitational potential energy When the object comes back down again the gravitational potential energy is turned back into kinetic energy Thats why riding a bike up a steep hill is very hard but when you are coming back down you will not need to pedal at all  you are being powered by the gravitational potential energy that you stored when you rode up the hill Another way gravitational potential energy helps us is by keeping earth and the other planets in orbit in our solar system around the sun

The Waterloo City line is a short underground railway line in London It was opened on 11 July 1898 It has two stations Waterloo and Bank

The 1967 tube stock was a deep level tube stock that ran on the Victoria line from 1968 to 2011 These trains do not run on the London Underground anymore as they were replaced by the London Underground 2009 tube stock between 2010 and 2011 The stock was built by Metro Cammell The trains have also ran on the WoodfordHainault section of the Central Line in the past

An order to buy 30 8 car trains of 1967 tube stock was made in March 1964 They were built by Metro Cammell Each train is made up of two 4 car units that are joined together The trains cost 225 million to build Today this would buy just three trains The first unit was delivered to West Ruislip depot on 27 September 1967 and the fleet was bought to run the Victoria Line The units were then tested at the depot before they were moved to Hainault depot and being tried out in passenger service on the Woodford Hainault broken wikt linkshuttleshuttle on the Central line Once the tests were finished the trains were moved from Hainault to Northumberland Park Depot using a battery locomotive The trains are were looked after at this depot until they were scrapped It is the only part of the Victoria line that is not Underground and it is unusual because unlike the rest of the London Undergound network there is a staff rail link from Seven Sisters station

The trains had Automatic Train Operation The train operator controls when the doors open and close and also starts the train by pressing two buttons at the same time These buttons start the automatic process of driving the train The trains were built with wrap around windows in the driving cabs and were the first London Underground trains to have windows like this The trains were delivered with a shiny grey coat but this soon faded to a dull grey

When the extension Victoria line to Brixton opened in July 1971 a further 72 cars of 1967 tube stock were ordered which made up 9 trains This brought the total number of 1967 tube stock trains to 39

In 1989 a refurbishment programme was started across the whole fleet of London Underground rolling stock following the Kings Cross fire in 1987 The Victoria line stock was chosen to be the first to be refurbished The refurbishment was carried out by Tickford Rail at Rosyth Dockyard The refurbishment was due to take 5 years to complete but the last train did not leave the works until 1997 because each train was slightly different to the next train When the trains had completed the refurbishment the outside was painted in a white blue and red colour scheme The insides of the trains have fire resistant materials and are finished in the Victoria line blue colours though some have the Bakerloo line brown as they run on that line too

The last 1967 stock in passenger service ran on 30th June 2011 It has been replaced by 2009 stock

Congestion may refer to

Traffic congestion is when vehicles travel at slower speeds because of too many vehicles on the road and so on This makes trip times longer and increases queueing This is also known as a traffic jam The causes of this can be accidents on the road and roads being closed It can also be caused by bad road layouts which can then lead to gridlocks

The British Transport Commission was created by Clement Attlees post war Labour government It was a part of its nationalisation programme Its objective was to provide an efficient adequate economical and properly integrated system of public inland transport and port facilities within Great Britain for passengers and goods excluding transport by air The BTC came into operation on 1 January 1948 Its first chairman was Lord Hurcomb Miles Beevor was the Chief Secretary

The 2009 tube stock is a type of London Underground train It is built by Bombardier Transportation at their Litchurch Lane Works in Derby England The stock belongs to Bombardiers Movia type of train Bombardier Transportation UK used to be known as ADtranz and before that ABB Asea Brown Boveri ABB Asea Brown Boveri built the 1992 tube stock which is currently used on the Central and Waterloo City lines 

Forty seven 8 car units will be built for use on the Victoria line These will replace the lines original 1967 tube stock The trains are still being built They will be introduced by 2012 when all of the 1967 tube stock trains will be completely replaced The first 2009 tube stock train started running on the line with passengers on board on 21 July 2009 One new train will enter service every two weeks from early 2010

The trains are part of a 34 billion pound contract that was awarded to Bombardier by Metronet The contract was to supply new trains featuring Automatic Train Operation and signalling for the Victoria and sub surface lines When it is finished this upgrade should make the lines and trains more reliable There should also be an 8 decrease in journey times between stations and a 16 overall decrease in journey times This decrease is partly because the new trains have better performance that the 1967 tube stock that they are replacing The new trains have a higher top speed of convert80kmhmph3abbron a faster maximum acceleration of 13 ms2 a normal service deceleration of 114 ms2 and an emergency brake deceleration of 14ms2 This is the same as the 1992 tube stock

During the busiest times of the day or the peaks 43 trains should be available in service This will be an increase of 6 trains over the 37 units of 1967 tube stock The trains have seats for 252 people and standing space for an estimated 1196 passengers This gives a 19 increase in capacity The new trains also have wider doors for easier boarding and alighting of passengers to decrease the times that the trains have to wait at stations

The new trains are being built convert40mmin3 wider than the current 1967 tube stock This is because the Victoria line has a larger than normal loading gauge compared to the other deep level tube lines The larger size means that the new trains cannot leave the Victoria line except by road as they are too wide to travel on the other London Underground deep level tube lines This means that to move the units each car has to be broken wikt linkuncoupleuncoupled loaded onto a lorry and then re coupled when they are delivered The trains have been built using Bombardiers technology called FICAS which gives them a thinner bodyshell Along with the larger size this gives more space for passengers

The stock is the first to be designed since the Rail Vehicle Accessibilty Regulations came into force Because of this they will have more facilities for people with impaired mobility including multi purpose areas with tip up seats and space for wheelchairs and pushchairs and offset centre door poles for wheelchair access

The design of the trains was finalised in September 2004 and manufacture of two pre production trains began in January 2005 The first train was scheduled to be completed by mid 2006 Metronet announced on 3 February 2006 that the first of the pre production cars had been completed to allow it to be tested without being moved From 21 July until 4 August 2006 a example of the train was on show at Euston Square Gardens near Euston Square tube station for a Customer Acceptance Test followed by public display From September 2006 the first of the two trains underwent testing at Bombardiers manufacturing and test site at their Litchurch Lane Works in Derby It was due to be delivered to London Underground by the end of 2006 for testing on the Victoria line during engineering hours but this did not occur until May 2007 It will also be used for driver and maintenance training and familiarisation The first of the trains was expected to begin passenger service for the Victoria line for evaluation purposes in July 2008 with the remainder of the fleet being delivered and entering passenger service in 2009 However by October 2007 the date for the first train entering service had been moved to January 2009 The first train entered service on 21 July 2009 leaving Northumberland Park depot at 2300 and forming train 277 leaving Seven Sisters at 2355 to Brixton

Weak interaction also called the weak force or weak nuclear force is one of the four fundamental forces in the universe It is carried by a particle known as a gauge boson The weak force causes beta decay a form of radioactivity At extremely high energy levels the force of weak interaction and electromagnetism begin to act the same and this is called electroweak interaction

Beta Decay is what scientists call an atom breaking down The different types of breaking down are called radioactivity Beta Decay can be simply explained as breaking down a neutron into a proton and an electron However this is not completely true

Beta Decay begins with a neutron which is made of one up quark and two down quarks Since up quarks have a charge of 23 and each down quark has a charge of 13 23 13 13 0 charge Due to weak force if there are too many neutrons in an atom nucleus one of the down quarks in one of the neutrons turns into an up quark This would change the charge of the neutron from 0 to 1 From this the neutron is no longer a neutron but actually a proton 

In a strange quantum effect this transformation releases a particle called a W boson This is the gauge boson of weak force Oddly the W boson weighs about 80 times as much as a neutron This sort of thing actually happens very often in quantum mechanics but it follows the conservation of energy because it happens so quickly After 3x1025 seconds the W boson breaks into an electron and an electron antineutrino This releases the electron and basically creates a proton from a neutron

The National Health Service is a government run health care organization that provides health and medical services to citizens and residents of the United Kingdom It was started in 1948 and intended by its creators to be free at the point of service This meant that people who use the NHS would not be required to pay for services each time they used them

The NHS is paid for out of employee contributions from their wages and also from general government money raised in the form of taxes The promise of a health service that would be free at the point of service was broken almost right away with the start of prescription charges Prescription charges are a set price that people within England must pay for each item on a prescription form This charge is currently 710 for each item and is raised each year

The health service is run in different ways depending on which country within the United Kingdom a person lives in For instance there are no charges for prescriptions in Scotland or Wales but there are in England 

The service also provides basic dental services and prescription eyeglasses hearing aids prosthetic limbs and other services There are normally charges at the point of service for these services unless one lives in a no charge country or is considered a special needs case such as children pregnant women or the elderly

Binary Arithmetic is a way of adding together two or more binary numbers

There are four rules in binary arithmetic They are

0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 10 1 1 1 11

This is because in binary there are only two digit 0 and 1 Because of this the number two and three have to be represented in some other way This is how the binary value for three is calculated

This shows that the binary value would be 11

Negative binary numbers have to be stored in a special way Negative decimals have a sign in front of them but inside a computer where binary is used there is no sign for negative  only 1s and 0s

There are two methods for storing negative binary numbers they are Sign and Magnitude and 2s Complement

Sign and Magnitude works by changing the most significant bit to a 1 if the number is negative for example

will become

This method of storing negative binary numbers does not work because

2s Complement is a more difficult way of storing negatives There are three steps for it

Real numbers in binary have to be stored in a special way in a computer There is no decimal point in the binary system so the computer has a method of understanding decimals This is called floating point representation

Real numbers are usually called decimals

The decimal point in a real number is called a floating point because it can be placed anywhere  it is not fixed Because of this a computer will divide a number into two parts These are called the mantissa and the exponent

The mantissa is found by taking the real number and removing the decimal point for example

1101 0111 would become 1101 0111

The exponent is the number of spaces the decimal point has moved In the example above the decimal point moved 4 places to the left so the exponent is 0000 0100

If the decimal point moves to right the exponent is negative For example

0000 0111 here the exponent is 1 The binary number for this is 1111 1111

The result is found by putting the Mantissa and Exponent together The results for the examples above are

A Ponzi scheme is a kind of fraud It is an investment operation Normally if investments make a profit this profit is shared and distributed among those people investing money A Ponzi scheme is different It offers returns that are paid by the people investing themselves or by other people investing and not from the profits made 

Ponzi schemes offer returns that are much better than those offered by other forms of investment Returns offered are either very high or very consistent They have to do this because they need to find new people who invest Keeping the returns going that a Ponzi scheme advertises and pays requires an increasing flow of money from investors

Many times the system will collapse because people have to pay more than they earn if they earn anything at all Most of the time the system itself does not collapse but the authorities find it In that case they will stop the system and start charging people because running such systems is illegal in many countries As more investors become involved the likelihood of the scheme coming to the attention of authorities increases

The scheme is named after Charles Ponzi who became notorious for using the technique after emigrating from Italy to the United States in 1903 Ponzi did not invent the scheme but his operation took in so much money that it was the first to become known throughout the United States His original scheme was in theory based on arbitraging international reply coupons for postage stamps but soon diverted investors money to support payments to earlier investors and Ponzis personal wealth 

Knowingly entering a Ponzi scheme even at the last round of the scheme can be rational in the economic sense if a government will probably bail out those participating in the Ponzi scheme

People who advertise Ponzi schemes will often use words or phrases that sound very good but that do not really mean much Examples are

The people promoting the scheme will take advantage of the fact that the investors do often not know much about economics The Madoff scandal of 2008 showed that investors presumed to be sophisticated such as hedge fund managers and international bankers can also be tricked into joining a Ponzi scheme by a promoter with a well established reputation for financial skill Sometimes people also claim that they have their own investment strategy and that this strategy can only work if it is kept secret 

Bernard Madoff for example only permitted one accounting firm run by his brother in law to perform audits on his hedge fund claiming the need to keep his strategy secret

Without the benefit of precedent or objective prior information about the investment only a few investors are tempted usually for small sums Thirty days later the investor receives the original capital plus the 20 percent return At this point the investor will have more incentive to put in additional money and as word begins to spread other investors grab the opportunity to participate leading to a cascade effect deriving from the promise of extraordinary returns However the return to the initial investors is being paid out of the investments of new entrants and not out of profits

One reason that the scheme initially works so well is that early investors those who actually got paid the large returns commonly reinvest their money in the scheme Thus those running the scheme do not actually have to pay out very much they simply have to send statements to investors showing them how much they earned by keeping the money in order to maintain the deception that the scheme is a fund with high returns

Promoters also try to minimize withdrawals by offering new plans to investors often where money is frozen for a longer period of time in exchange for higher returns The promoter sees new cash flows as investors are told they could not transfer money from the first plan to the second If a few investors do wish to withdraw their money in accordance with the terms allowed the requests are usually promptly processed which gives the illusion to all other investors that the fund is solvent

The catch is that at some point one of three things will happen

The Dominican city of Ban is the head municipality of the Peravia province on the south of the country close to the Caribbean Sea

Ban is a Tano word meaning ebony or a similar tree but the city takes the name from the small river that goes through the city

The municipality of Ban has an area of 74379 km that represents almost 94 of the total area of the small province of Peravia the other municipality of the province is Nizao

There are nine municipal districts in the Ban municipality Those municipal districts are

The western and northern part of the municipality has many mountains that are part of the Cordillera Central this range is called here Sierra de Ocoa

In the southern half of the municipality there are several small valleys and savannas such as the Peravia Valley where the city of Ban is located and Sabana de Paya around the town of Paya

West of Ban the region is very dry and there are not many people living here except close to rivers and to the coast

The most important rivers in this municipality are Ocoa and Ban rivers

The municipality had in 2002 a total population of 107926 52897 men and 55029 women The urban population was 5732 of the total population In this numbers are included the population of the municipal districts of Catalina El Carretn El Limonal Las Baras and Villa Sombrero

In 1764 the people that were living in the Peravia Valley bought some land in Cerro Gordo to build a new town The new town was given the name of Ban after the river that is found to the east of the town

After the independence from Haiti in 1844 the country was divided in five provinces and in 1845 Ban was made a municipality of the old Province of Santo Domingo In 1944 Ban was made the capital city of the new province Jos Trujillo Valdz now with the name of Peravia

Kathryn Janeway is a character in the American TV series Star Trek Voyager She is the captain of the starship Voyager

Tikhon Khrennikov was a Russian musician  He was a composer and pianist He got involved in the musical politics of his country which was then the Soviet Union  A lot of people hated him especially in western countries He is particularly remembered for what he did at the unpleasant conference in 1948 when some of the most famous Soviet composers including Shostakovich and Prokofiev were made to say they were sorry for the music they had written and that they would compose better music in future

In the days of the Soviet Union and especially under Stalin musicians had to be very careful about what they did and how they composed Music like all arts was supposed to make people feel that they were lucky to be living in a great country like the Soviet Union If composers wrote music that the politicians did not like or understand life became very difficult for them they would not be allowed to compose and their music could not be performed They might even be sent to prison Tikhon Khrennikov became Secretary to the Union of Soviet Composers in 1948 at the time when Stalin was dictator He continued in this job until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 He made sure that all musicians obeyed their political leaders

It is difficult for us today to judge the actions of Khrennikov fairly He survived because he did what he was told by Soviet dictators After the collapse of the Soviet Union he tried to say he was sorry for what he did It is difficult to judge whether he really meant this

Tikhon Khrennikov was the youngest of ten children born into a family of horse traders in the town of Yelets in the Russian province of Lipetsk in central Russia His family started to teach him the guitar and mandolin When he was nine he started learning the piano and when he was 13 he started composing Three years later he was sent to the Gnesin Academy of Music studying with the composer Mikhail Gnesin In 1932 he went on to the Moscow Conservatoire He studied composition with Vissarion Shebalin and piano with the famous teacher Heinrich Neuhauss who was later the teacher of Emil Gilels and Sviatoslav Richter 

His early works include a symphony a piano concerto and an opera based on the book Into the Storm which was based on a novel Loneliness a favourite book of Stalin His music was always happy and energetic He wrote music for 22 films and many patriotic songs He did everything he could to please Stalin and soon he became Secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers

In 1948 he headed a conference at which Shostakovich Prokofiev Myaskovsky and Shebalin were told that they were bad formalists The word formalist has no meaning in music but it was used by the politicians to describe anyone who was not obeying the politicians guidelines Khrennikov said at the conference that we will stop all manifestations of formalism and popular decadence 

Shostakovich had given Khrennikov some friendly advice about his opera Into the Storm but Khrennikov had been angry about being criticized and now he could get his own back Shostakovich made satirical remarks about Khrennikov in an opera Rayok which he never showed to anyone and was found amongst his papers after his death in 1975

After the fall of the Soviet Union Khrennikov published a book Thats the Way It Was In this book he says that everybody had to obey political rules and he was only doing what everyone else did However he then wrote some bad things about Shostakovich Khrennikov had also been an enemy of the composer Alfred Schnittke He banned his music from being played and was furious when it was performed in other countries He also banned music by other composers who have now become famous such as Sofia Gubaidulina and Viktor Suslin

Khrennikov was however not all bad He supported Shostakovich and Prokofiev for getting the Stalin Prizes in the 1950s He also invited Stravinsky who had been exiled to the United States to revisit the Soviet Union in 1962 

When he was in his eighties Khrennikov continued to compose many comic operas operettas and ballets They always had tunes that were easy for people to enjoy

The Soviet state gave him many prizes for the work he did three Stalin Prizes a State Prize of the USSR and a Lenin Prize Before his death he was even given an award by Vladimir Putin which makes it seem as if Russia might be returning to its past values

He died in Moscow aged 94

Dialysis is where a machine is used to replace a kidney after kidney failure The word dialysis comes from the Greek word dialusis dia meaning through and lusis meaning loosening

Dialysis can be used for people who have become sick and have lost the use of their kidneys for a short time or for people who no longer have working kidneys The purpose of the kidney is to keep a balance of water and minerals in the body These minerals include sodium potassium chloride calcium phosphorous magnesium and sulfate The kidneys also take out hydrogen ions from the blood Dialysis is able to remove these wastes from the body and help keep the minerals in balance

However the kidneys are also part of the endocrine system and make erythropoietin and calcitriol Dialysis machines are not able to replace this part of the kidneys function

Dialysis machines work by using diffusion and ultrafiltration A very fine material called a membrane allows blood and fluid to flow through it In the machine the blood flows in one direction and on the other side of the membrane a special fluid dialysate flows in the opposite direction Dialysate is a fluid that has different chemicals in it such as potassium and calcium A doctor would decide what mixture of chemicals would be needed for each patient The dialysate has bicarbonate in it to lower the higher acid levels that these patients often have The blood and dialysate mix together The waste products are removed from the blood and caught up in the fine membrane

The kinkajou is a mammal of the family Procyonidae and it is related to the raccoon coati olingo raingtail and cacomistle It lives in the rainforests of South America and Central America and spends most of its time on trees It can eat both meat and plants and has a gripping tail that can be used like an arm It is an endangered species because it is being hunted for its fur meat and to be illegally sold as pets

Although kinkajous may look like monkeys or ferrets they are not related to those animals An adult kinkajous weight is between 1 3 kg Its body can grow up to 43 56 cm long and its tail usually measures between 16 22 cm The kinkajou has woolly fur consisting of an outer golden coat and another gray coat underneath

The Barber of Seville is a comic opera in two acts by the composer Gioachino Rossini The libretto are based on a comedy by Pierre Beaumarchais called The Barber of Seville It is Rossinis most famous opera containing some very well known tunes

The first performance took place on 20 February 1816 in Rome

Rossinis opera was not the first one to be based on Beaumarchais play The composer Giovanni Paisiello had written one with the same title and another was composed in 1796 by Nicolas Isouard Paisiellos opera was popular for a time but soon Rossinis opera became famous and Paisiellos opera was forgotten

Mozarts opera Le nozze di Figaro composed in 1786 is also based on the same play but it deals with the second part of the play

Rossini is well known for being able to compose very quickly He composed all the music for The Barber of Seville in less than three weeks He borrowed the overture from something he had written earlier 

When the opera was first performed on 20 February 1816 it was a big failure The audience hissed and jeered the whole time and there were several little accidents on the stage At one point a cat walked onto the stage

The second time it was performed it was a great success

The square in front of Dr Bartolos house

The story takes place in the town of Seville in Spain It is supposed to be the 17th century In a town square outside Dr Bartolos house a band of musicians are serenading outside the window of Rosina Among them is Lindoro who is pretending to be a poor student but he is really Count Almaviva in disguise He hopes that Rosina will love him He pays the musicians who then leave

Figaro comes in He used to be Almavivas servant The aria that he sings is very famous It is called Largo al factotum Almaviva asks him to help him meet Rosina offering him money if he can do it Figaro says he should disguise himself as a soldier and pretend to be drunk and to try and get into the house 

Inside Dr Bartolos house Rosina sings a song Una voce poco fa Rosina writes to the Count calling him Lindoro because she thinks that is his name As she is leaving the room Bartolo and Basilio enter Bartolo is suspicious of the Count and Basilio says that they should start to tell bad stories about him to get him out of the way

When they are gone Rosina and Figaro enter Figaro asks Rosina to write a short note to Lindoro She has already done this She is surprised by Bartolo but she manages to fool him

Berta Dr Bartolos servant tries to leave the house She is met by the Count disguised as an drunken soldier Bartolo cannot get rid of the Count who manages to have a quick word with Rosina He whispers to her that he is called Lindoro and gives her a letter Bartolo is watching and is suspicious He wants to know what the letter is about but Rosina fools him by giving him a list of things to be washed Bartolo and the Count start arguing Basilio Figaro and Berta appear and the noise is heard by the Officer of the Watch and his men Bartolo thinks that the Count has been arrested but Almaviva tells the officer his real name and he is immediately released Bartolo and Basilio cannot understand why this happened Rosina laughs at them

Dr Bartolos house

Almaviva comes to the doctors house again This time he is disguised as a music teacher He is pretending that Basilio is ill and that he has come instead At first Bartolo is suspicious but he soon lets him in when he shows him Rosinas letter He gives Rosina a singing lesson Bartolo things that Lindoro is one of the Counts servants and that he is trying to get girls for the Count Bartolo does not want to leave him alone with Rosina so he gets Figaro to shave him

When Basilio suddenly appears Almaviva bribes him with some money and he goes away saying he is sick Bartolo realizes in the end that it is a trick and gets everyone out of the room He goes to a notary to get a marriage contract made between himself and Rosina He shows Rosina the letter she wrote to Lindoro and makes her think that Lindoro is a servant and cunning friend of Almaviva

The stage is empty while the music creates a thunder storm The Count and Figaro climb up a ladder to the balcony and enter the room through a window Rosina shows Almaviva the letter and says she is very sad Almaviva tells her who he really is Rosina now loves him Figaro tells them they should leave Basilio and the notary come to the front door and try to leave by the ladder but it has gone Basilio can either take a bribe a be a witness to the marriage or he can be shot dead He decides together with Figaro to witness the signing of the marriage contract between the Count and Rosina Bartolo rushes in but is too late The Bartolo is made happy when he is told he can keep Rosinas dowry

Hi folks Here is my second SN article

Hope you all had a great 2 weeks I remember saying last time that we were only 264 short of 60000 articles However Im sad to say that this margin has now increased to 3005 5000  Most of you will know that this is the result of the mass deletion of several hundreds of articles It has been a concern for all of us that several articles which have been created are one line stubs on non notable subjects 

I believe that we should follow a particular list of notable uncreated articles which should be created by us This is not like List of articles all Wikipedias should have Articles to be included should be important people FAGAs from other projects and businesses having large number of Google hits Also we should strive to eradicate stubs and so I usher all users to join WikiProject Stub Eradication

Eptalon proposed to create an offline version of SEWP here We should try to cover at least 50 of the articles at detect possible candidates for inclusion in the CD

Unfortunately yesterday Bluegoblin7 left SEWP after an argument regarding the mass deletion of articles without the flood flag Itll surely be a bit difficult without him but anyway we should not let it be a hindrance for us

This is all for now Hope to see you again next time Bye Pmlineditor 1620 2 July 2009

The Historical geology is used by geologists and other scientists to describe the timing and relationships between events that have occurred during the history of Earth The table of geological periods presented here agrees with the dates and nomenclature proposed by the International Commission on Stratigraphy and uses the standard color codes of the United States Geological Survey

Evidence from radiometric dating indicates that the Earth is about 8000 thousand years old The geological or deep time of Earths past has been organized into various units according to events which took place in each period Different spans of time on the time scale are usually delimited by major geological or palaeontological events such as mass extinctions For example the boundary between the Cretaceous period and the Palaeogene period is defined by the CretaceousTertiary extinction event which marked the demise of the dinosaurs and of many marine species Older periods which predate the reliable fossil record are defined by absolute age

The largest defined unit of time is the supereon composed of Eons Eons are divided into Eras which are in turn divided into Periods Epochs and Stages At the same time paleontologists define a system of faunal stages of varying lengths based on changes in the observed fossil assemblages In many cases such faunal stages have been adopted in building the geological nomenclature though in general there are far more recognized faunal stages than defined geological time units

Geologists tend to talk in terms of UpperLate LowerEarly and Middle parts of periods and other units such as Upper Jurassic and Middle Cambrian Upper Middle and Lower are terms applied to the rocks themselves as in Upper Jurassic sandstone while Late Middle and Early are applied to time as in Early Jurassic deposition or fossils of Early Jurassic age The adjectives are capitalized when the subdivision is formally recognized and lower case when not thus early Miocene but Early Jurassic Because geologic units occurring at the same time but from different parts of the world can often look different and contain different fossils there are many examples where the same period was historically given different names in different locales For example in North America the Lower Cambrian is referred to as the Waucoban series that is then subdivided into zones based on trilobites The same timespan is split into Tommotian Atdabanian and Botomian stages in East Asia and Siberia A key aspect of the work of the International Commission on Stratigraphy is to reconcile this conflicting terminology and define universal horizons that can be used around the world

The principles underlying geologic time scales were laid down by Nicolaus Steno in the late 17th century Steno argued that rock layers are laid down in succession and that each represents a slice of time He also formulated the principle of superposition which states that any given stratum is probably older than those above it and younger than those below it While Stenos principles were simple applying them to real rocks proved complex Over the course of the 18th century geologists realized that 

The first serious attempts to formulate a geological time scale that could be applied anywhere on Earth took place in the late 18th century The most influential of those early attempts divided the rocks of the Earths crust into four types Primary Secondary Tertiary and Quaternary Each type of rock according to the theory formed during a specific period in Earth history It was thus possible to speak of a Tertiary Period as well as of Tertiary Rocks Indeed Tertiary and Quaternary remained in use as names of geological periods well into the 20th century

In opposition to the then popular Neptunist theories expounded by Werner a major shift in thinking came with the reading by James Hutton of his Theory of the Earth or an Investigation of the Laws Observable in the Composition Dissolution and Restoration of Land Upon the Globe before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in March and April 1785 events which as things appear from the perspective of the twentieth century James Hutton in those reading became the founder of modern geology What Hutton proposed was that the interior of the Earth was hot and that this heat was the engine which drove the creation of new rock land was eroded by air and water and deposited as layers in the sea heat then consolidated the sediment into stone and uplifted it into new lands This theory was dubbed Plutonist in contrast to the flood oriented theory

The identification of strata by the fossils they contained pioneered by William Smith Georges Cuvier Jean dOmalius dHalloy and Alexandre Brogniart in the early 19th century enabled geologists to divide Earth history more precisely It also enabled them to correlate strata across national boundaries If two strata contained the same fossils chances were good that they had been laid down at the same time Detailed studies between 1820 and 1850 of the strata and fossils of Europe produced the sequence of geological periods still used today 

The process was dominated by British geologists and the names of the periods reflect that dominance The Cambrian and the Ordovician and Silurian named after ancient Welsh tribes were periods defined using stratigraphic sequences from Wales The Devonian was named for the English county of Devon and the name Carboniferous was simply an adaptation of the Coal Measures the old British geologists term for the same set of strata The Permian was named after Perm Russia because it was defined using strata in that region by a Scottish geologist Roderick Murchison However some periods were defined by geologists from other countries The Triassic was named in 1834 by a German geologist Friedrich Von Alberti from the three distinct layers red beds capped by chalk followed by black shales that are found throughout Germany and Northwest Europe called the Trias The Jurassic was named by a French geologist Alexandre Brogniart for the extensive marine limestone exposures of the Jura Mountains The Cretaceous as a separate period was first defined by a Belgian geologist Jean dOmalius dHalloy in 1822 using strata in the Paris basin and named for the extensive beds of chalk 

British geologists were also responsible for the grouping of periods into Eras and the subdivision of the Tertiary and Quaternary periods into epochs

When William Smith and Sir Charles Lyell first recognized that rock strata represented successive time periods time scales could be estimated only very imprecisely since various kinds of rates of change used in estimation were highly variable While creationists had been proposing dates of around six or seven thousand years for the age of the Earth based on the Bible early geologists were suggesting millions of years for geologic periods with some even suggesting a virtually infinite age for the Earth Geologists and paleontologists constructed the geologic table based on the relative positions of different strata and fossils and estimated the time scales based on studying rates of various kinds of weathering erosion sedimentation and lithification Until the discovery of radioactivity in 1896 and the development of its geological applications through radiometric dating during the first half of the 20th century which allowed for more precise absolute dating of rocks the ages of various rock strata and the age of the Earth were the subject of considerable debate

In 1977 the Global Commission on Stratigraphy started an effort to define global references for geologic periods and faunal stages The commissions most recent work is described in the 2004 geologic time scale of Gradstein et al A UML model for how the timescale is structured relating it to the GSSP is also available

The following table summarizes the major events and characteristics of the periods of time making up the geologic time scale As above this time scale is based on the International Commission on Stratigraphy The height of each table entry does not correspond to the duration of each subdivision of time

1 In North America the Carboniferous is subdivided into Mississippian and Pennsylvanian Periods

2 Discoveries in the past quarter century have substantially changed the view of geologic and paleontologic events immediately prior to the Cambrian The nomenclature has not stabilized The term Neoproterozoic is used here but other writers might equally well have used one or more of the terms Ediacarian Vendian Varangian Precambrian Protocambrian Eocambrian or might have extended the Cambrian further back in time All of these terms are usually treated as a subset of the Proterozoic rather than a period between the Palaeozoic and the Proterozoic

3 Dates are slightly uncertain with differences of a few percent between various sources being common This is largely due to uncertainties in radiometric dating and the problem that deposits suitable for radiometric dating seldom occur exactly at the places in the geologic column where we would most like to have them Dates with an are radiometrically determined based on internationally agreed to GSSPs All dates given are for the end of the epoch in question

4 Paleontologists often refer to faunal stages rather than geologic Periods The Stage Nomenclature is quite complex See httpflatpebblenceasucsbedupublicharlandhtml for an excellent time ordered list of faunal stages Also see the article on GSSPs

5 In common usage the Tertiary Quaternary and Palaeogene Neogene Quaternary Periods are treated as equivalents to the Mesozoic and Palaeozoic Periods The term PeriodAge is sometimes used instead of Period

Australovenator wintonensis is a medium sized theropod dinosaur that lived in Australia about 100 million years ago 

The fossil bones of the dinosaur was found at an ancient billabong near Winton Queensland Scientists have called him Banjo after the famous Australian poet Banjo Patterson Patterson wrote the song Waltzing Matilda after a visit to Winton in 1885 The name Australovenator wintonensis comes from the Latin words Austral meaning from the south venator meaning hunter and wintonensis meaning from Winton

The dinosaur was discovered in 2009 with several dinosaurs such as the sauropods Diamantinasaurus and Wintonotitan It is the most complete theropod skeleton found in Australia

Banjo was a medium sized fast canivorous dinosaur with three large sharp claws on each hand It stood about two meters tall Dinosaur expert Scott Hocknull described Australovenator wintonensis as being like a cheetah

Operation Ichi Go was a series of battles between the armies of Japan and China The battles happened between April and December 1944 There were three battles in the Chinese provinces of Henan Hunan and Guangxi The goals of Operation Ichi go were to make a route to French Indochina and to capture bases that American bombers were using to attack Japan and her shipping

There were two parts to the operation In the first part the Japanese secured the Railway between Beijing and Wuhan In the second part they destroyed the US air forces in Hunan province and reached the city of Liuzhou Liuzhou was near the border with Japanese occupied Indochina 

400000 men 12000 vehicles and 70000 horses took part in operation Ichi Go The Japanese army included the very well trained Kwantung Army units and equipment from Manchukuo North China and Japan It was the largest land operation by the Japanese during the Second Sino Japanese War Many of the new American trained Chinese units were fighting in Burma under General Joseph Stilwell using weapons leased from the United States Chiang Kai Shek had agreed that Stilwell could manage the distribution of American arms  

In Operation Kogo 390000 Chinese soldiers led by General Tang Enbo defended Luoyang The Japanese 3rd Tank Division crossed the Yellow River around Zhengzhou in late April and defeated the Chinese near Xuchang They then moved around broken wikt linkclockwiseclockwise and put Luoyang under broken wikt linksiegesiege Luoyang was defended by three Chinese divisions The 3rd Tank Division began to attack on May 13 and won Luoyang on May 25

The second part of Ichigo began in May Japanese forces moved south and occupied Changsha Hengyang Guilin and Liuzhou In December 1944 Japanese forces reached French Indochina and completed the operation Despite this success US air forces moved inland from the threatened bases near the coast The US Air Force often stopped the railway between Beijing and Liuzhou that had been started in Operation Ichigo Japan continued to attack airfields where US air forces were stationed up to the spring of 1945 

USAs XX Bomber Command using B 29 bombers of the which were attacking Japan were forced to move as well But this affected their efficiency for only a short time In early 1945 the Twentieth Air Force moved to newly established bases in the Marianas under the command of the newly established XXI Bomber Command

The failure to hold the coastal airfields led to a loss of confidence in General Joseph Stilwell by Chiang Kai shek Stilwell was replaced in October 1944 by President Roosevelt The new Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai Shek and commander of the US Forces in China was Major General Albert Wedemeyer Stillwells other responsibilities in China Burma and India were given to other officers

A very different version of events was that General Joseph Stilwell was asking for a fuller use of Chinese forces and had made diplomatic connections with the Chinese Red Army commanded by Mao Zedong They had agreed to follow an American commander 

Because Chiang Kai shek was ignored by the American general he had Stilwell called back to the United States New York Times reporter Brooks Atkinson wrote at the time The decision to relieve General Stilwell represents the political triumph of a moribund anti democratic regime that is more concerned with maintaining its political supremacy than in driving the Japanese out of China America is now committed to support a regime that has become increasingly unpopular and mistrusted in China that maintains three secret police services and concentration camps for political prisoners that stifles free speech and resists democratic forces The Chinese Communists have good armies that are now fighting guerrilla warfare against the Japanese in North China The Generalissimo regards these armies as the chief threat to his supremacy has made no sincere attempt to arrange at least a truce with them for the duration of the war No diplomatic genius could have overcome the Generalissimos basic unwillingness to risk his armies in battle with the Japanese

But the Time Magazine article in which Atkinson was quoted went on to talk about the true failure of Stilwells goals by saying that The Chinese exhausted by seven years of almost singlehanded war against Japan were reluctant to give General Stilwell the troops he wanted for the Burma offensive the Japs might suddenly crack down on them in earnest When the Japs began the drive that last week seemed on the verge of cutting China in two Chiang Kai sheks Government might well have felt that its go slow policy was justified 

This loss and the poor opinion in the USA caused the Americans to lose confidence in the Chinese troops Instead the US focused all its resources on the island to island war in the Pacific

The Black Sea is a sea in Eurasia between Europe Caucasus and Anatolia Many big rivers connect to the Black Sea like Don Danube and Dnieper rivers

It is connected to the Atlantic ocean through the Mediterranean Sea Aegean Sea and many straits 90 of the sea has no oxygen and the water has salt in it During the last ice age the Black Sea was a freshwater lake

In Greek mythology the Argonauts traveled on the sea The sea was very important to trade for many countries in ancient history It was also important during World War I and World War II

The Black Sea sits on continental plates which have subsided It is a geologic basin and therefore is a genuine inland sea Its maximum depth is about 2000 metres The Black Sea is the worlds largest basin where the deep waters do not mix with the upper layers of water that receive oxygen from the atmosphere As a result over 90 of the deeper Black Sea volume is anoxic water The upper layers are generally cooler less dense and less salty than the deeper waters as they are fed by large river systems whereas the deep waters come from the warm salty waters of the Mediterranean

Mixed cropping is growing of two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land It is also known as multiple cropping This type of cropping leads to an improvement in the fertility of the soil and hence increase in crop yield because when the two crops are properly chosen the products and refuse from one crop plant help in the growth of the other crop plant and vice versa Mixed cropping is an insurance against crop failure due to abnormal weather conditions

By planting one line of one crop then a line of another crop both crops can get better In one line a leguminous crop and in another line the crop which is to be planted So if one crop takes the nitrogen from the soil the another leguminous crop fixes the cropThe nitrogen is fixed in the root nodules of the leguminous plants in the form of nitrates Hence the fertility of the soil gets maintained This helps the farmers to produce more and more crops without the nitrogen being depleted from the soil

Mixed cropping is not the same as crop rotation In crop rotation you plant different crops in the same field in different years Some plants add nitrogen to the soil some take it out If you would plant the same crop year after year you wear out your soil

Multiple cropping patterns are described by the number of crops per year and the intensity of crop overlap Double cropping or triple cropping signifies systems with two or three crops planted sequentially with no overlap in growth cycle Intercropping indicates that two or more crops are planted at the same time or at least planted so that significant parts of their growth cycles overlap Relay cropping describes the planting of a second crop after the first crop has flowered in this system there still may be some competition for water or nutrients When a crop is harvested and allowed to regrow from the crowns or root systems the term ratoon cropping is used Sugarcane alfalfa and sudangrass are commonly produced in this way while the potential exists for such tropical cereals as sorghum and rice Mixed cropping strip cropping associated cropping and alternative cropping represent variations of these systems See also Agriculture Agronomy

Another simple definition of mixed cropping

Mixed cropping also known as inter cropping or co cultivation is a type of agriculture that involves planting two or more of plants simultaneously in the same field In general the theory is that planting multiple crops at once will allow the crops to work together Possible benefits of mixed cropping are to balance input and outgo of soil nutrients to keep down weeds and insect pests to resist climate extremes to suppress plant diseases to increase overall productivity and to use scarce resources to the fullest degree Agronomists studying mixed crops have had mixed results determining if yield differences can be achieved with mixed versus monoculture crops If a combination of say wheat and chickpeas works in one part of the world it might not work in another But overall it appears that measurably good effects result when the right combination of crops are cropped together EXAMPLE The classic example of mixed cropping is that of the American three sisters maize beans and curcurbits These three plants domesticated at different times were together an important component of Native American agriculture historically documented by the Seneca and Iroquois and probably beginning sometime after 1000 AD All three seeds are planted in the same hole The maize provides a stalk for the beans to climb on the beans are nutrient rich to offset that taken out by the maize and the squash grows low to the ground to keep weeds down and water from evaporating from the soil in the heat

ne this allows in increase of the produnction thus acting a profit for the farmer and helps him increase his earnings

Televisions with plasma display are much thinner than cathode ray tubes and are usually higher definition

Plasma screens are made of 2 sheets of glass with 2 gases stored between the sheets The gases are xenon and neon and they fill thousands of tiny chambers or spaces Behind each space are a series of red blue and green phosphors When electricity connects to the plasma chambers the colored phosphors produce the right color on your screen They work in a very similar way to fluorescent tubes used for lighting

Plasma screens may seem to be a new technology but actually they have been around since 1964 but only 2 colors could be produced then Now we have high definition Plasma screens up to 150 inches in size Japanese engineers are currently working on a 270 inch model

Plasma TVs have more pixels per inch than the old fashioned cathode ray tube screens so they can produce a much sharper image In the old style of CRT screens the pictures were made up of lines If you look closely at a Plasma screen you will not see any lines You will find out that most Plasma screens have a wide screen option so you can see movies in the way they were intended for movie theaters They are also ideal for the latest digital broadcasting methods

One of the big advantages is the space saving The problem with old cathode ray tubes is that they needed a lot of space so that the rays can fire upon all areas of the screen The wider the screen the larger the volume of the television would be The average Plasma television is around 6 to 8 inches deep Moving your Plasma onto the wall can really increase the amount of floor space and they can be looked at from any point in the room

Plasma screens are also very light especially when compared to a rear projection TV A 40 inch Plasma TV will weigh from 50 to 80 pounds and provided you purchase a suitable bracket they can be hung very easily to a suitable wall When fixing to the wall you need to make sure you choose a bracket which tells you the highest weight it can carry Most brackets can be tilted if you want to view from a different angle

Plasma TVs can display up to 16 million colors so not only are they great for watching TV programs they also make a good screen for the latest computer games consoles Most Plasma TVs have inputs for HDMI and laptop computers connections making them ideal to use to display products and sales messages in offices and shops

You will also find out that they are very easy to watch even on a sunny day or a very bright room Unlike the old CRT screens they are not hard to see in bright areas

Because of the phosphor technology in Plasma TVs it is possible for traces of an image to be burned in to the display meaning you might see little traces of it even while watching other images This is really only a concern in commercial uses where images are shown for long periods of time Burn in can generally be avoided by making sure that you do not keep a constant image on the screen for a long time either by turning the television off or changing the channel

Although still much brighter than rear projection TVs direct view and LCD TVs often are able to provide a brighter picture Latest generation Plasma TVs have improved on brightness but a warning is do not view where it is too bright or sunny

Although Plasma TVs are much lighter and thinner than direct view and rear projection TVs an LCD TV is lighter and slimmer LCD TVs use the same technology as used in most laptop computers You should know that LCD TVs are not really available in the same sizes as Plasma TVs and if they are they usually cost much more

Plasma screen TVs cost much more than CRTs and a little more than LCDs

Compared to other television technologies Plasma TVs have a shorter life span Most Plasma TVs have a life span of 20000 30000 hours based on makers estimates This life span is commonly referred to as the Plasma TV half life as it is the number of hours over which the Plasma TV will lose approximately half of its brightness

Plasma TVs break easily and it is possible to break them if you are not careful and the parts are quite easy to damage You must take a lot of care when moving them

As technology has been made better Plasma screens have a much longer life and you should expect 30000 hours of use In other words your television would need to be on for 16 hours a day every day for the next 5 years By the time your TV needs replacing higher definition models will have become available Most of us should not be worried as it will give years of enjoyment

When the first Plasma televisions were designed for home use you did not get much change from 5000 dollars for a basic small model As the technology has improved and production has increased prices have been smaller You can now get a 37 inch model for as little as 1000 or even less so they are great value Soon buying a CRT television will be a thing of the past as the new digital age is upon us

Sir Edward Downes was an English conductor He was famous for conducting opera but also conducted orchestral concerts He worked a lot with the orchestra of the Royal Opera House as well as Opera Australia

When he was old he was almost totally blind and deaf and his wife was dying of cancer so they both decided that they wanted to die together They went to Switzerland where they were allowed to commit assisted suicide

Downes was born in Birmingham England His father worked in a bank He left school when he was 14 and got a simple job in a gas store where he earned 16s 10d a week 

He had been playing the piano and violin since he was five When he was 16 he got a scholarship to the University of Birmingham where he studied English literature and music and began playing the cor anglais He then got a scholarship to study conducting at the University of Aberdeen

In the 1960s he married Joan a dancer with the Royal Ballet She later became a choreographer and television producer They had two children a son Caractacus who became a musician and recording engineer and a daughter Boudicca who became a video producer

When he was 85 he had become almost totally blind and deaf His wife was dying of cancer and was in a lot of pain They both wanted to die together but in Britain it is against the law to help someone to die so they decided to go to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland There surrounded by members of their family they drank a fatal dose of barbiturates and died on 10 July 2009

Some people who support the idea of assisted suicide are hoping that this case may lead to more discussion which could bring about a change in the law in Britain and other countries 

Assisted suicide is when somebody who wants to commit suicide is helped to do this by someone else Normally people who ask for assisted suicide are very ill and in a lot of pain so they want someone to help them to die for example by being given access to drugs which will kill them Some people prefer the terms aid in dying or death with dignity to describe assisted suicide The term euthanasia is sometimes used although euthanasia is generally regarded as different to assisted suicide as it involves causing a person to die rather than helping them to kill themselves

The law about this varies a lot in different countries In Belgium the Netherlands Switzerland and in three American states it is legal to help someone to die in these circumstances However in many countries it is not allowed and the person who helps someone to die may be arrested and sent to prison

Some people who are very ill and want to die may go to these countries such as Switzerland in order to end their life

Dignitas is a Swiss group that helps people with assisted suicide This means that if a person is very ill and wants to die the doctors and nurses help them to end their life Only people who have a terminal illness or very bad physical or mental illnesses are allowed to be helped The patients must be able to understand what is happening and decide for themselves that death is what they want

Dignitas was started in 1998 by Ludwig Minelli a Swiss lawyer The law in Switzerland says that someone can help in an assisted suicide so long as they do not have any self interest The doctor has to meet the person on two occasions and make sure that the person really does wish to die There must be evidence for this ie the patient has to sign a paper and two witnesses have to sign to say they saw the patient signing If the patient is too ill to sign a video film can be made The patient is asked several times whether that is what they want If everyone is absolutely sure then he or she is given a drug which will kill them

Some people travel from other countries such as Britain to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland so that they can be helped to die For example the rugby player Daniel James who was 23 had a terrible injury to his spine which left him paralysed from his chest down travelled there with his parents to die In 2009 the British conductor Edward Downes and his wife both travelled to Dignitas where they died together

Terminal illness is a term used to describe an illness which cannot be cured and will almost definitely end in the death of the patient The term is mostly used for progressive diseases such as cancer or advanced heart disease Someone who has a terminal illness may be described as a terminal patient or as being terminally ill Usually a patient is called terminally ill when they are not expected to live more than 6 months Diseases such as AIDS are not called terminal illnesses because the patient may live for many years before eventually dying of the illness

Very often terminally ill patients are given palliative care to give them a better quality of life Sometimes they go to a hospice to be looked after

When biologists talk about symmetry they refer to how certain body parts that are present multiple times are arranged Most multicellular organisms show some kind of symmetry A few show none and are called asymmetric 

There are three basic forms

In nature and biology symmetry is approximate For example plant leaves while considered symmetric will rarely match up exactly when folded in half

When symmetry is not complete or not present at all

Zhu Xi or Chu Hsi was a Confucian scholar during the Song Dynasty He was from Fujian province in China

Zhu Xi was born Wu Yuan North East Jiangxi province He taught for many years in the Wuyi Mountains and he is also remembered for the large role he played he spent teaching at the Yuelu Academy in Changsha and at his retreat near the White Deer Grotto in Lushan In his life his ideas were not generally accepted and he was fired from quite a lot of official positions After his death nearly 1000 people were at his funeral and his tablet was put in a Confucian temple

During the Song Dynasty Zhu Xis teachings were considered to be unorthodox Rather than focusing on the Book of Changes like other Neo Confucians he chose to emphasize the Four Books the Great Learning the Doctrine of the Mean the Analects of Confucius and the Mencius as the core curriculum for aspiring scholar officials For all these classics he wrote extensive commentaries that were not widely recognized in his time however they later became accepted as their standard commentaries The Four Books served as the basis of civil service examinations all the way down to 1905

According to Zhu Xi knowledge and action were indivisible components of truly intelligent activity Although he did distinguish between the priority of knowing since intelligent action requires forethought and the importance of action as it produces a discernible effect Zhu Xi said Knowledge and action always require each other It is like a person who cannot walk without legs although he has eyes and who cannot see without eyes although he has legs With respect to order knowledge comes first and with respect to importance action is more important

The Epping Ongar Railway is a preserved railway It runs along the last section of the old Great Eastern Railway and London Underground Central line branch line The line runs between Epping and Ongar There is also an intermediate stop at North Weald The line was reopened in late 2004 after 10 years of being closed It runs a Sunday and Bank Holiday service using a Class 117 diesel multiple unit The service runs between Ongar and Coopersale The service is provided by volunteers who take care for the line as well as run the trains The land and infrastructure are owned by Epping Ongar Railway Ltd

The branch line to Ongar was built in 1865 by the Eastern CountiesGreat Eastern Railway The eastern section of the line between Epping and Ongar was single track There was one passing loop at North Weald station Around 14 trains went as far as Ongar station each day The rest finished at Epping or Loughton

The trains continued to finish at Epping or Loughton until 1949 At this time the London Passenger Transport Boards New Works project extended the Central line to Epping using electric trains The Central Line would take over the railway from British Rail As part of this change the Epping Ongar branch line had its through trains to London removed Instead a shuttle service between Epping and Ongar was used At one stage it was possible to see the unusual sight of steam trains and London Underground electric multiple units side by side at Epping The steam shuttle was hired by the London Transport Executive from British Rail This was because it was felt that the cost of electrifying the line to Ongar could not be justified because of the low passenger numbers on this part of the branch

In the 1950s there were attempts to improve the service on the branch line Over time permission was given to electrify the line in 1957 However because the electrification did not cost much the branch was only able to have special two or three car trains running on it This was because the power supply was not strong enough to support trains that had more cars Another problem was that the stations on the line had short platforms This would mean that the normal 8 car trains would not be able to stop at them Because of this the Epping Ongar branch line was normally operated separately from the rest of the Central Line However for two days each year trains did run through from London These trains would terminate at North Weald for the airshow on the Saturday and Sunday of its opening The normal Epping Ongar service would get around this extra service by passing the train on the other line at North Weald station whilst it headed towards Epping The train from London was run as an extra train on the normal Central Line timetable However this extra train was only four carriages long instead of the normal eight

During the late 1960s it became clear that the amount of people using the line had not become as big as people thought that it would Not a lot of new development was allowed because the land was now Green Belt land The amount of people using the line peaked in 1971 and it was still only 650 people every day This meant that the line did not make very much money London Underground tried to close the whole line in 1980 but they were not able to Instead fewer trains were run on the line and they also closed Blake Hall tube station on Sundays

Blake Hall was permanently closed in 1981 Before the station closed it only had six passengers a day The station building still survives as a private residence However the platform has been removed

North Weald stations platform one was closed in 1976 The passing loop and westbound tracks were lifted in 1978 Until this time access to the two platforms was controlled from the original Eastern Counties Railway signal box This signal box is still on the southbound platform North Weald was the last section of the London Underground network to be signalled using semaphore signals

The line was making a loss of seven pounds for each passenger journey It was also in need of some expensive maintenance work On 30 September 1994 the line was closed to the public From this time on the Central Line terminated at Epping station When the line closed it was carrying just 80 passengers a day Local lore said that the line was being kept open in case the Cabinet needed to be evacuated to the nuclear bunker at Doddinghurst

Cravens Heritage Trains have preserved a three car unit of 1960 stock This was the train that ran the final London Underground service on the line

The line was bought by Pilot Developments in 1998 Pilot Developments is now known as Epping Ongar Railway Ltd The Ongar Railway Preservation Society also entered an offer to buy the line Their offer was for 325000 However Pilot Developments made a slightly higher offer and got London Underground to accept it Martin Bell an independent politician said that this was the most controversial land deal in the constituency for years He said that there was a conflict of interest with local politicians

The line reopened on Sunday 10 October 2004 It is being run by the Epping Ongar Railway Volunteer Society An hourly service between Ongar and North Weald was operated Shortly after opening the line was extended to Coopersale However it is currently not possible to get off the train there

Between 22 January and 9 April 2006 the line was closed for engineering works The works included general station maintenance rolling stock maintenance and track maintenance Ongar station remained closed for engineering works and general maintenance and reopened on Sunday 28 May 2006 to passengers At first though it was not possible to use the station buildings

At the end of 2007 the railway was sold to a new private owner This was because planning permission for the Ongar residential development had been given The new owner wants to bring steam locomotives back to the line

In early 2008 the line was closed to passenger trains This was to allow the railway to be able to have major engineering works The work will mean that steam locomotives will be able to run on the line again To make this happen run round loops and signalling amongst other things must be built

Passenger services on the heritage line were operated throughout 2006 and 2007 by a Class 117 diesel multiple unit This unit is currently being restored along with a class 205 DEMU Class 37029 is in operation along with 03170 There are a selection of British rail Mk1 and Mk2 coaches on the line The line also has some small diesel shunters a Drewry shunter named Heather by the railway and two Ruston 88 shunters The line employs a Harsco tug unit for engineering work The EORs fleet also includes a small works trolley a Shark brake van a Dogfish ballast hopper and a box van for permanent way duties 

At one point the line owned two trains of 1962 tube stock Units 1616 and 1491 were purchased in 1996 and unit 1744 was purchased in 1998 These units were taken away to be cut up for scrap in 1998 and 2003 respectively after they were destroyed by vandals

The Ecclesbourne Valley Railway is a heritage railway in Derbyshire Its operations are based at Wirksworth station It is currently planned to extend the railway along the former Midland Railway branch line which joined the main line at Duffield 

When complete it will be one of the few Heritage Railways that operates a whole branch line in its original form and entire length

The line is operated by diesel locomotives which haul former multiple unit trailer cars and also uses heritage diesel multiple units

The Wirksworth Branch was the product of early nineteenth century railway rivalry Since 1835 Wirksworths citizens had been promoting the idea for a branch line from the North Midland Railway at Duffield The Midland was initially uninterested but then realised that the branch could be extended to Rowsley This was difficult but the branch could avoid the section from Ambergate on its Manchester Buxton Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway which was shared with its rival the London and North Western Railway

The Chelsea Hackney line is a safeguarded route for an underground railway running from south west London to north east London As of 2008 the plan is being developed by Cross London Rail Links Ltd who are the developers of Crossrail It is therefore sometimes known as Crossrail 2

A naval mine is a bomb placed in water to destroy ships or submarines Unlike depth charges mines are put in the water and left to wait until they make contact with a ship Naval mines can be used offensively to make it harder for enemy ships to sail easily or trap them into a harbour They can also be used defensively to protect friendly ships and create safe zones

Mines can be laid in many ways by specially built minelayers refitted ships submarines aircraft or even by dropping them into a harbour by hand They are a cheap weapon with a basic mine costing as little as US1000 There are very advanced mines which can cost millions and have several kinds of sensors and deliver a warhead by rocket or torpedo

International law says that nations have to say when they put mines in an area This is to make it easier for civil shipping to avoid the mines The warnings do not have to be specific during World War II Britain said simply that it had mined the English Channel North Sea and French coast

Francisco Correa de Arauxo was an important Spanish organist composer and theorist in the last years of the Renaissance and early years of the Baroque period

We do not know very much about Correa de Araujo He was probably born in 1584 He may have been of Portugese origin In 1599 he got a job as organist in Seville It must have been an important job because he earned a lot of money Many years later he seems to have become a priest He may have been made a priest because he was a good organist In 1630 he organized a protest when priests were made to work harder wothout being paid more money Because he argued about this he was sent to prison for a time By 1635 his health was very bad In spite of earning a high salary he often had no money 

After 37 years in Seville he took a job as organist in Jan Cathedral He was there until 1640 when he went to Segovia Cathedral He worked there until 1653 by which time he was too ill to work When he died the following year he was very poor

Correa only seems to have published one collection of organ works It was called Libro de tientos y discursos de msica practica y theorica de organo intitulado Facultad organica This was a collection of organ music as well as a discussion about music theory It is one of the few books we have which shows us what musical composition was like in Spain at that time His organ music uses a divided keyboard so that the upper and lower parts of the keyboard can use different stops The organ pieces in the collection are arranged in order of difficulty The pieces at the end are very hard indeed He uses a lot of dissonances and he expects the performer to put in lots of ornaments even if they are not shown in the music He uses glosa although he also uses counterpoint His harmony shows the influence of composers such as Cabezon and Aguilera de Heredia

A creative network is a loose group of people creating something in art or science or business It is never larger than about a dozen people who may move from one project to another as a troupe or team 

They have only a few goals at a time and never more than one major goal Each person plays a tightly or loosely defined role in the network For instance to make a movie a writer director producer and actors are needed There may also be a need for a costumer a cameraman an audio engineer and a film editor if the project is big enough and the schedule tight enough Very often the roles and timing are determined by a power network However the creative control remains within the small creative network

Braidwood is a town in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales Australia It is in the Palerang Shire In 2006 there were 1108 people living in Braidwood It was used as a location for the movie Ned Kelly starring Mick Jagger in 1969

Braidwood is on the Kings Highway which joins Canberra to Batemans Bay on the coast It is about convert200kmmi0lkonabbron south west of Sydney It is in a highland area near the headwaters of the Shoalhaven River

European explorers Kearns Marsh and Packer reached the area in 1822 and the settlers arrived soon after The town was surveyed in 1839 Gold was discovered in 1851 and over the next 20 years the population grew to about 10000

The town was named after Dr Thomas Braidwood Wilson He had been a surgeon on the ships taking convicts to New South Wales and Van Diemens Land He was first given land in Van Diemens Land in 1824 but changed it for land near Lake George in 1825 He was also given convert2560acreha0lkonabbron of land in the new country on Monkittee and Flood creeks In 1833 the government took back the western end of Wilsons land for a future village They gave him more land at the eastern land in return Wilson moved to the district in late 1836 with his wife and family He became a community leader He built the first courthouse in 1837 38 In 1840 Wilson asked the government to build a road from Braidwood to Huskisson for faster and cheaper shipping of wool to Sydney Wilson and Col John Mackenzie supplied the materials and men to make the Braidwood to Nerriga section In 1841 there were 141 people living at Braidwood Farm Wilson lost all of his money because of a drought in the late 1830s He died in November 1843 His land was sold for 2000 to John Coghill who now owned most of the land on the south east and north of the town Wilson still owned land on a hill north of the town and was buried there in 1843

A memorial and large pine tree mark the site of Wilsons grave The path to the grave is open to the public and is through a series of paddocks with gateway sculptures and large art pieces by local artists

Bushrangers Thomas and John Clarke killed four policemen near Braidwood in 1867 There is a special monument for the police in the Braidwood cemetery

Australias first Royal Commission took place in Braidwood in 1867 It looked at the role of the police in trying to control bushrangers in the area The Commission found the police were lazy and in some cases had actually helped the bushrangers They found that the superintendent of police did not have strict and proper control over his men

Because of the goldrush the banks and hotels in Braidwood were well built and made to last It is these old heritage buildings that now attract visitors to the town Other businesses in the area are sheep and cattle farming and timber growing

Braidwood used to be the home of the Tallaganda local government area However following changes to local government areas by the New South Wales Government it is now part of the Palerang council The eastern office of the council is in the town The local paper is now called the Braidwood Times

After the gold rush Braidwood became a quiet and poor country town Because of this very little new building work was carried out and so the town still has most of its original streetscape and architecture intact On 30 March 2006 the town and its setting were listed on the NSW State Heritage Register There were arguments between those who wanted to save the towns old fashioned charm and those wishing to develop it

The town has several times been used for movie making locations

Local stories say that Mick Jagger wrote one of his major hits while in Braidwood making Ned Kelly but there is no agreement as to which one

The Letter of Jeremiah also known as the Epistle of Jeremy This is a deuterocanonical book of the Old Testament The letter is believed to have been made by Jeremiah to the people who were to be taken prisoner into Babylon It is included in Catholic Bibles as the last part of the Book of Baruch It is also in Orthodox Bibles as a standalone book

Most learned people argue that the person who started the book was not Jeremiah Jeremiah was a Hellenistic Jew who lived in Alexandria Whoever the starter the work was written with a purpose to teach the Jews not to worship the gods of the Babylonians Instead to worship only the Lord

The letter is part of the Septuagint There is no evidence of it ever having been rule bearing in the Jewish tradition

The earliest evidence we have of the question of its canonicity arising in Christian tradition is in the work of Origen of Alexandria as reported by Eusebius in his Church History Origen listed Lamentations and the Letter of Jeremiah as one unit with the Book of Jeremiah proper among the canonical books as the Hebrews have handed them down 

Jerome provided the majority of the translation work for the vulgar Latin translation of the Bible called the Vulgate Bible In view of the fact that no Hebrew text was available Jerome refused to consider the Epistle of Jeremiah as the other books he called apocryphal canonical

Despite Jeromes reservations the epistle is included as chapter 6 of the book of Baruch in the Old Testament of the Vulgate The Authorized King James Version follows the same practice while placing Baruch in the Apocrypha section In the Ethiopian Orthodox canon it forms part of the Rest of Jeremiah along with 4 Baruch

The epistle is one of three deuterocanonical books found among the Dead Sea scrolls The portion of the epistle discovered at Qumran was written in Greek This does not preclude the possibility of the text being based on a prior Hebrew or Aramaic text However the only text available to us has dozens of linguistic features available in Greek but not in Hebrew hence introductions of a Greek editor not required for minimalist translation
