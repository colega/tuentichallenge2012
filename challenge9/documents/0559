The Association Sportiva Roma abbreviated A Rome or simply Roma is a club team in Rome It was founded July 22 1927 Among the major Italian clubs is along with Juventus and Lazio one of three Italian football quoted 1

In 83 years of history has ever attended except on one occasion the Serie A winning three league titles nine Italian Cups and 2 Super Cups Italian He finished the championship in second place for eleven times and five times third in 78 Serie A total of 79 played the Roma arrived on the podium in 247 of occasions After Inter which was present in all editions is along with Juventus the team that has participated in more Serie A 78 times out of 79 In Europe the best result was winning the Fairs Cup in 1961

The symbol of the team is the Lupa Capitolina the emblem of the city of Rome the split which takes the colors from the national banner and dark red tending to purple edged with yellow orange 2 

The main national rivals Lazio of Rome with which we count the first citizen in the Derby della Capitale and Juventus the team against which the Capitoline eleven competed in the eighties to win the title from 2006 then Adding a heated rivalry with Inter given the presence at the top of both national teams 3 4 Internationally the most heated rivalry is certainly linked to English club Liverpool who beat on penalties in 1984 the Roma in the Champions League final in his home of yellow and red at the Stadio Olimpico 5

According to some surveys on the number of Roma fans for the team ranks fifth among Italian companies It is placed behind Juventus AC Milan Inter and Napoli 6

Red violet is a deep tone of rosy magenta It may also be considered a reddish tone of purple or a bluish tone of rose 

On the old fashioned now obsolete red yellow blue pigment color wheel red violet was a tertiary color between red and violet on the red yellow blue pigment color wheel and thus was the equivalent of pigment purple The other tertiary colors on a red yellow blue color wheel were called blue violet blue green yellow green yellow orange and red orange 

The RYB color wheel is still often used to teach color to children 

It has been reported by ophthalmologists that those who have their lenses removed and replaced with clear plastic intraocular lenses can see partway into the ultraviolet and view electric purple on the spectrum beyond Violet because it has been shown that the retina has some ultraviolet sensitivity which is normally blocked by the natural lens Presumably tetrachromatic animals such as birds can also see this color on the spectrum These observers able to see partially into the ultraviolet describe the color they can see beyond violet in the ultraviolet as a sort of lilac that is a reddish violet color that is the color of the lilac flower  

Note The spectrum colors can only be approximated on a computer screen but the colors shown below are a close approximation of the spectral colors red and violet shown compared to the non spectral color red violet

Thrush may mean

Candidiasis often called yeast infection or thrush is a type of infectious disease It is a fungal infection The disease is caused by any of the Candida species of yeast Candida albicans is the most common species 

Candida yeasts are common in most people The yeast is usually controlled in the body When the yeast grows without control an infection happens

A weakened unhealthy or young immune system may cause Candidiasis HIVAIDS cancer treatments steroids stress and not enough nutrients may cause candidiasis 

Antibiotic and steroid use are the most common reason for uncontrolled yeast Antibiotic kills the good bacteria which control the yeast  the change youll get the yeast increases because of it

The Candida fungus grows best in warm moist and dark places

Esophageal candidiasis is an infection of the esophagus by Candida albicans The disease happens in unhealthy people Sometimes people will get the infection when they are done with chemotherapy People with AIDS can also get this infection more often 

One sign of esophageal candidiasis is painful swallowing Weight loss can happen when a person has esophageal candidiasis for a long time 

Oral candidiasis is a yeast infection of the mouth It is located on the mucous membranes of the mouth It is caused by Candida albicans Candida glabrata or Candida tropicalis  

Candida may appear as thick white or cream coloured areas on mucosal membranes The infected mucosa of the mouth may look inflamed In babies the condition is called thrush For babies it is usually painless and causes no pain Adults may experience discomfort or burning sensation

In healthy persons candidiasis is usually a very small infection of the skin or mucous membranes These areas include

Candidiasis is a very common cause of vaginal irritation or vaginitis It can also occur on the penis or scrotum In unhealthy patients the Candida infection can affect the esophagus It could get everywhere in the body This would cause a much more serious health condition a state called candidemia 

A Graphics Processing Unit is a RISC processor whose task is the calculation of graphical output for monitors It is mostly used in computers and video game systems The GPU can be put on the motherboard or on separate video cards

Today there are generally two types of images a GPU has to calculate which is also called rendering Most applications like the operating systems desktop or office applications the GPU has to render two dimensional pictures Modern GPUs are so powerful that there is no difference in 2D performance between low cost and expensive GPUs The minor part of todays applications use 3D pictures to simulate three dimensionality Examples for such applications are computer and video games or applications for design and technical construction The 3D acceleration performance of GPUs differs greatly Generally more expensive GPUs can render faster than low cost ones

Todays market leaders for GPUs are AMD Intel and nVidia There are some smaller manufacturers whose market share is rather small eg Matrox and S3 Graphics They are concentrating on niche products Some of them have focused on research only instead of producing real products eg PowerVR and XGI Technology Inc There were several manufacturers who were bought by larger competitors like 3Dfx and 3Dlabs or stopped their efforts as research costs are very high Examples are Cyrix Tseng Labs Trident Microsystems and OAK Technologies Other early pioneers like Hercules who were once one of the market leaders concentrate to produce video boards based on GPUs from AMD or nVidia nowadays

The term GPU computing combines all tasks a GPU can calculate that go beyond simple calculation and output of pictures It is also known under the term General Purpose Computation on Graphics Processing Unit Tasks are calculation of physics Artificial Intelligence or even acceleration of video and picture editing One of the first applications to support GPU computing is Adobes Photoshop CS4 

nVidia calls their attempt at GPU Computing CUDA This is nVidias interface for using their GPUs for general computing tasks CUDA is based on the C programming language

ATi is calling their attempt Stream There were some earlier attempts under a different name prior to Streams release with ATis graphics driver Catalyst 812 in December 2008

S3 Graphics showed a first application for video editing which is accelerated by their latest GPUs Yet there is no information whether S3 Graphics will continue to increase their efforts in GPU computing

The latest milestone in GPU computing was AMDs announcement of a Super Computer based on GPUs at the CES in January 2009 It will be built of more than a thousand GPUs and will have a computing power of one petaflop

Early GPUs used Peripheral Component Interconnect interface to communicate with the motherboard of a computer a type of slot which is still used today for simple motherboard add ons such as extra audio processing cards or USB ports As graphics cards became more powerful and graphics applications more demanding a faster kind of interface called Advanced Graphics Port was created and then PCIe x16 after it the current overall standard In 2008 PCIe 20 was introduced doubling the speed of PCIe 10 and still working with older PCI Express interfaces

PCI graphics cards will only work in PCI slots AGP will only work in AGP slots PCIe graphics cards will not function in PCI slots and PCI graphics cards will not function in PCIe slots However PCI Express 20 graphics cards will work in PCI Express x16 10 motherboard slots and vice versa

Multi GPU Systems are computers which use more than one GPU Generally this is used in high end home computers to accelerate computer games but there is also the ability to have one GPU rendering normal game scenes and one GPU calculating physics This is currently supported by nVidias GPUs only and called PhysX ATi and Intel are working to implement their own Physics engine called Havok

The first attempts in Multi GPU Systems were done by 3Dfx which was bought by nVidia later Their Voodoo video cards which were 3D only accelerators could be hooked up to a second Voodoo video card to gain more performance This was called SLi Theoretically the performance would double practically it increased far less depending on the video game which is still a problem in todays Multi GPU Systems Later 3Dfx built more than one GPU on one video card Its latest video card the Voodoo 6 was based on four GPUs but it was never released However there exist several engineering samples of the Voodoo 6 mostly owned by collectors

After nVidia bought 3Dfx Multi GPU Systems were dead for several years until nVidia came up with this idea again in 2004 As nVidia had bought all technologies and market names from 3Dfx too they simply used the name SLi again Todays SLi works with up to three video cards which is called 3 way SLi There were also attempts with four cards but this failed due to limitations in the DirectX9 API Todays DirectX10 API however would support this Despite the video cards a SLi compatible motherboard is needed to build a SLi System Such motherboards have several PEG Slots for more than one video card nVidia offers various Multi GPU video cards where two GPUs are built on one video card These are often called Dual GPU video cards and do not need a SLi compatible motherboardclear

ATis Multi GPU Technology is called CrossFire It works quite the same way though there are fewer limitations for video card combinations CrossFire was renamed to CrossFire X in 2007 to represent the possibility to combine more than two cards Today it is possible to have a CrossFire X system based on four video cards or two Dual GPU cards

Just like with SLi there is the necessity for a CrossFire compatible motherboard in order to build a CrossFire System One Dual GPU video card from ATi does not necessarily need such a Crossfire compatible motherboard however for two of them it is neededclear

The 1970 Atlantic hurricane season was the period of time in 1970 that tropical cyclones formed in Atlantic Ocean It officially began on June 1 1970 and it ended on November 30 1970 Strong storms of 1970 include Hurricane Celia which killed 20 and caused severe damage Also Tropical Storm Dorothy killed 51 people most in Martinique

These are the names of the tropical cyclones that formed in the season

These are the names set aside for 1970 Names that werent used are in tcname unused

After this season there was one name that got retired Celia In 1974 the name Carmen was used instead

Gary Karr is an American classical double bass virtuoso and teacher

There were several double bass players in his family but he did not meet them He studied with several teachers He went to the Juilliard School In 1962 he became famous when he was a soloist in a nationally televised New York Philharmonic Young Peoples Concert conducted by Leonard Bernstein On that famous telecast Karr performed The Swan from Carnival of the Animals by Camille Saint Sans

Gary Karr has given performances in many parts of the world He has published a number of books for learning to play the double bass After 40 years as a concert artist he retired in 2001 to Victoria British Columbia where he lives with his dog Shin Ju

In 1967 Karr founded the International Society of Bassists an organization which encourages the playing of the double bass all over the world Every two years the ISB has a big international conference 

Olga Koussevitzky widow of the conductor and double bass player Serge Koussevitzky heard Karr play when he was young and gave him the beautiful Amati double bass made in 1611 which her husband had played Karr later gave this double bass to the ISB so that double bassists world wide could play on it 

In 1984 the Karr Doublebass Foundation was established by Karr which loans instruments to promising young double bassists to help them in their careers 

The 1996 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 1996 and lasted until November 30 1996 Tropical Cyclones can and have formed outside these dates but not in 1996 because Hurricane Marco ended on November 24 The 1996 Atlantic hurricane season was very active but not as active as 1995 but it was more active then 1997

Tropical Storm Arthur was the first tropical storm of the 1996 season It started on June 17 in the Bahamas as Tropical Depression One One became Tropical Storm Arthur late on June 19 Tropical Storm Arthur made landfall in Cape Lookout North Carolina was a weak tropical storm It moved to the east and went back into the Atlantic Ocean and died on June 21 Arthur killed no one and caused only 1 million in damage

Hurricane Bertha was the first hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season It started on July 5 near the Cape Verde Islands On that same day it became Tropical Storm Bertha By July 7 it became a hurricane during that day it struck Antigua and Sint Maarten Bertha moved along the edges of the islands in the Bahamas Hurricane Bertha made landfall in North Carolina on July 12 as a category 2 hurricane It quickly got weaker and died on July 14 as it entered Canada Bertha killed 9 people and caused 335 million in damage 

Hurricane Cesar started off the coast of Venezuela on July 24 it was a tropical depression at this time It slowly got stronger becoming a tropical storm the next day and a hurricane by July 27 On July 28 it made landfall as a hurricane in Nicaragua Cesar weakened to a tropical storm over land but it reached the Pacific Ocean and later on it became Hurricane Douglas Hurricane Cesar killed 77 people and caused 206 million in damage

Hurricane Dolly started as Tropical Depression Four near Jamaica It got stronger and it became Tropical Storm Dolly soon after Tropical Storm Dolly became Hurricane Dolly just before it made landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula on August 20 It weakened over land and entered the southern Gulf of Mexico as a tropical depression Dolly quickly got stronger again and became a tropical storm Just before it made another landfall in Mexico it became Hurricane Dolly again on August 23 The storm weakened a lot over Mexico and it died on August 26 It killed about 14 in Mexico

Hurricane Edouard 

Hurricane Edouard was the strongest hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season It started as Tropical Depression Five near Cape Verde on August 19 Tropical Depression Five did not become Tropical Storm Edouard until August 22 By the next day it had gotten stronger and it was Hurricane Edouard at this point 

Hurricane Edouard strengthened fast peaking as a category 4 hurricane on from August 24  28 After this it weakened slightly back to a category 3 hurricane It turned to the north and repeated this but did not again re strengthen into a category 4 hurricane On September 2 Hurricane Edouard passed only 90 miles to the south of Massachusetts By the next day Hurricane Edouard had died 

Edouard killed 2 people and caused around 35 million in damage

Fran started on August 23 as Tropical Depression Six It slowly got stronger because Hurricane Edouard was near it The depression became Tropical Storm Fran on August 27 Fran became a hurricane on August 29 weakened back to a tropical storm on August 30 and became a hurricane again on August 31 Hurricane Fran did not get much stronger until it began on a track more to the north By September 5 it made landfall in Cape Fear North Carolina as a category 3 hurricane It died on September 8 Fran caused the deaths of 26 people and caused 32 billion in damage

On August 26 Tropical Depression Seven started It slowly grew and became Tropical Storm Gustav It headed northwest and did not get any stronger because of the large size of Hurricane Fran and wind shear Wind shear also caused in to die on September 2

Hortense started on September 3 as the eighth tropical depression in 1996 in the Atlantic It slowly strengthened becoming Tropical Storm Hortense on September 7 four days later As a tropical storm it passed into the Leeward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea Continuing to slowly strengthen it became Hurricane Hortense on September 9 Hurricane Hortense made landfall on the southwestern part of Puerto Rico This resulted in 155 million in damage and the deaths of 18 people It also moved along the coast of Dominican Republic which killed 3 people 

It soon re entered the Atlantic Ocean and it quickly strengthened By September 13 it had become a 140 miles per hour category 4 hurricane Hortense started moving faster but weakened at the same time Finally by September 15 it had made another landfall in Nova Scotia In Nova Scotia there was 3 million in damage Hurricane Hortense died on later on September 15

Isidore started on September 24 a few hundred miles south of Cape Verde It headed westward and later peaked as a category 3 hurricane Hurricane Isidore began heading north after it became a category 3 hurricane Isidore weakened and died on October 1 

The 1996 Atlantic hurricane season had 4 tropical storms 3 hurricane 6 major hurricanes and 1 possible storm

There were 8 unused names in 1996 they include

In the spring of 1997 the following names got retired Cesar Fran and Hortense

Healesville Sanctuary or the Sir Colin MacKenzie Fauna Park is a zoo at Healesville in Victoria It only keeps animals that come from Australia It has a history of breeding Australian animals In 1943 it became the first zoo to breed a platypus The only other zoo to have bred a platypus is Sydneys Taronga Zoo It also helps by breeding the endangered Helmeted honeyeater It is one of three zoos in Victoria run by Zoos Victoria the others are the Melbourne Zoo and the Werribee Open Range Zoo

The zoo is in a natural bush setting Paths wind through different habitat areas with wallabies wombats dingoes kangaroos and over 200 Australian birds There are tours bird shows and information areas for visitors

Dr Colin MacKenzie set up the Institute of Anatomical Research in 1921 It was on convert73acreha0lkonabbron of land which had been part of the Coranderrk Aboriginal Reserve The Reserve was given to the Healesville Council in 1927 It became the Sir Colin MacKenzie Sanctuary in 1934 By 1947 the sanctuary had grown into a major tourist attraction and the management was taken over by the Victorian government Since then the zoo has grown with new special features and facilites including the 6 million Australian Wildlife Health Centre in 2005

The Healesville Sanctuary is currently working on breeding programs for endangered species including the 

Tropical Storm Barry was a tropical cyclone that grew quickly It made landfall on Florida in early June 2007 It was the second Atlantic named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season Barry formed in the Gulf of Mexico and moved toward the northeast reaching top wind speeds of 60 mph It then weakened and first reached land near Tampa Bay Florida Barry quickly weakened after wind shear blew away most of the thunderstorms Barry moved up the East Coast of the United States and by June 5 it was taken over by a bigger storm

Rain from Barry in the province of Pinar del Ro Cuba hurt three people and damaged 55 houses In Florida Barry caused heavy rain in an area that had been in drought Flooding and wet roads killed two people in traffic accidents Rough seas killed one surfer in Pinellas County Florida In Florida and Georgia the rain helped firefighters fight bad wildfires Damage from the storm was minor

On May 29 a weather system in the Yucatn Peninsula created a small area of thunderstorms over the Yucatn Channel The thunderstorms got stronger near the weather system By May 30 clouds from the area reached from Nicaragua to the southeastern Gulf of Mexico Another weather system called a tropical wave created a storm on May 30 The next day a cyclone formed inside the system The storm moved towards the north northeast and slowly gained strength More thunderstorms formed near the center and the system became a tropical depression A tropical depression is a type of storm

The depression developed an area of squalls A Hurricane Hunters airplane flew into the area to collect information about the cyclone At the beginning the tropical depression looked to be both a tropical and subtropical cyclone On June 1 the National Hurricane Center named the storm Tropical Storm Barry Barry was now 235 miles to the west of Key West Florida Barry moved quickly towards the north On June 2 it reached its strongest with winds of 60 mph

After Barry reached its highest strength strong wind shear removed most of the thunderstorms from the tropical cyclone The center of the system then increased in length and it began to weaken At 1400 UTC on June 2 Barry made landfall near Tampa Florida while it was at tropical depression status As Barry moved inland it weakened more Later that day the National Hurricane Center said that Barry had died out over northeastern Florida What was left of Barry continued to move northeast On June 3 it moved onto shore again this time in South Carolina Late on June 4 the extratropical system entered New England Late on June 5 what was left of the cyclone was taken over by a larger weather system near the border of the US state of Maine and the Canadian province of Quebec

When Barry was named as a tropical storm the National Hurricane Center sent out a tropical storm warning for the west coast of Florida from Bonita Beach through Keaton Beach Also a tropical storm watch was issued from Keaton Beach northward to Saint Marks An inland tropical storm warning was also sent out for inland parts of Charlotte Citrus DeSoto Hardee Hernando Highlands Lee Levy Manatee Pasco Pinellas Polk Sarasota and Sumter counties The storm increased the risk of rip currents so officials told swimmers to stay out of the water until the storm left the area A tornado watch was sent out for the southern part of the state but it was removed after the storm lost strength 

After becoming an extratropical cyclone National Weather Service offices sent out flood watches for parts of South Carolina eastern North Carolina southeastern Virginia and southeastern Maryland Flood watches were also sent out for southeast Pennsylvania northern Delaware northern New Jersey east central New York southern New England A wind advisory was sent out for parts of Georgia

Barry caused heavy rain in Florida the most rain being 699 inches at Palm Beach International Airport Other areas reported over 3 inches of rain The rain helped to get rid of drought conditions It also helped in fighting bad wildfires across the state In Brevard County the rain caused a large sinkhole a hole in the ground to open in the middle of a road Other roads were flooded On Interstate 95 near Lake Worth another sinkhole closed two lanes of traffic Wet roads caused many traffic accidents in the state In Brevard and Volusia counties drivers were killed in traffic accidents On Interstate 4 a tractor trailer crashed into a guardrail because of the weather

The storm caused stormy seas along the coastline of Florida with a storm surge of 478 feet at Clearwater Beach The waves caused minor beach erosion The high surge also caused minor flooding on many roads near Tampa Bay At Indian Shores a woman died after being injured by the high seas

Barry caused high winds in Florida which reached 47 mph near the southeastern coastline of the state The winds knocked down trees and caused power failures In Carrolwood one person was injured when a tree crashed onto their house The storm created at least two tornadoes including some that damaged fences and power lines One possible tornado in Goulds Florida left about 2000 people without power

The storm also caused heavy rain in Georgia of up to 8 inches The rain helped put out wildfires It also caused some minor flooding and in Savannah there were a few minor car accidents Winds blew down some trees and power lines Heavy rain from the storm moved across much of the East Coast of the United States High winds also occurred in South Carolina

The remains of Barry caused strong winds alone the Atlantic coast They reached 60 mph near Charleston South Carolina Around 200 houses in Craven County North Carolina lost power In southeastern Virginia the storm caused over 60 traffic accidents Ten people were injured in them High seas off Cape Fear left a sailboat with three people needing rescue from the Coast Guard 

Rain went north into the Mid Atlantic States and New England with 450 inches at Absecon New Jersey 391 inches near Central Park New York and 319 inches at Taunton Massachusetts Several roads and driveways were damaged by flooding in the Finger Lakes region of New York State Flash floods were seen in southeast New York and high wind gusts caused some damage to trees In New Jersey winds pushing over land caused high tides and minor coastal flooding

The 2009 Atlantic hurricane season was a time period of 2009 when tropical cyclones were likely form in the Atlantic Ocean The season started on June 1 2009 and it ended on November 30 2009 In this season Tropical Depression One formed early on May 28 In June and July there were no storms The most recent occurrence of no storms in June or July was in 1992 In total there were 2 tropical depressions 7 tropical storms 3 hurricanes and two of the three were major hurricanes

On May 28 a small storm formed off the coast of North Carolina and became a tropical depression called One by the National Hurricane Center The National Hurricane Center said that Tropical Depression One might strengthen into a tropical storm but it did not because the water was cold and did not give enough energy to the storm It weakened and stopped being a depression the next day

Tropical Depression Two formed on August 11 south of Cape Verde The system moved west and dissipated on August 13 On August 15 the remains of Tropical Depression Two reformed Tropical Depression Two quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Ana The storm continued west towards the Leeward Islands A few days later as the storm was still headed for the Leeward Islands it weakened to a tropical depression Ana struck Dominica on August 16 and dissipated the next day

On August 15 Tropical Depression Three formed and quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Bill On August 17 Tropical Storm Bill became Hurricane Bill On August 18 Hurricane Bill became a major hurricane Hurricane Bill quickly strengthened into a category 4 hurricane on August 19 but weakened back on to a category 3 on August 20 Hurricane Bill weakened to a category 2 on August 21 it again weakened the next day to a category 1 hurricane As a category one hurricane Bill came close to a landfall in Nova Scotia Near midnight on August 23 Bill made landfall in Newfoundland and became extratropical the next day The remains affected United Kingdom

Tropical Storm Claudette formed in the Gulf of Mexico as Tropical Depression Four early on August 16 At 1215 pm EDT the same day it strengthened into Tropical Storm Claudette Early the next morning Claudette struck Santa Rosa Island Florida Tropical Storm Claudette weakened and dissipated on August 18

Tropical Storm Danny formed north of Puerto Rico on August 26 Danny top winds were at 60 mph Danny did not become a hurricane Danny instead moved toward North Carolina as a weak tropical storm On August 29 Danny weaken into a depression and lost it clouds to an extratropical storm Danny did not reach North Carolina before losing its cloud Danny killed a boy in North Carolina due to rip currents

Tropical Storm Erika formed on September 1 as Tropical Storm Erika meaning it was never a tropical depression Tropical Storm Erika moved mostly west for most of the lifespan of it On September 2 Tropical Storm Erika made landfall in Guadeloupe Tropical Storm Erika weaken to a tropical depression and a remnant low on September 3 The remnant low caused some rain to some of the northern islands of the Caribbean Sea

Tropical Depression Seven formed on September 7 south of the Cape Verde Islands Later on September 7 it became a tropical storm and was named Fred Early the next day Tropical Storm Fred became Hurricane Fred the second hurricane of the season Hurricane Fred became a major hurricane Fred slowly weakened after becoming a category 3 hurricane On September 12 while a tropical storm Fred became a remnant low and is no longer a tropical storm 

Tropical Depression Eight formed near Cape Verde on September 25 Tropical Depression Eight was said that it would become a tropical storm this did not happen Tropical Depression Eight instead became a tropical wave on September 26 It is no longer a tropical depression

Tropical Storm Grace became a tropical storm late on October 4 it was also never a tropical depression while it was forming Tropical Storm Grace moved towards Ireland but went into a frontal system on October 5 Grace was not a tropical storm anymore The remains affect Ireland and the United Kingdom

Tropical Storm Henri was a weak storm that stayed out in the ocean for most of its life It formed from a tropical wave on October 6 while moving northwest across the Atlantic On the next day wind shear around the storm caused it to weaken into a remnant low Its remains were last seen near Cuba The storm did not come close to any land and did not cause any damage to property

On November 4 Tropical Depression Eleven started in the Caribbean Sea Later that same day it became a tropical storm and was given the name Ida Ida became a hurricane just before landfall on November 5 Ida weakened fast over land and was a depression before the end of the day On November 6 Ida came back into the Caribbean Sea just north of Honduras Ida became a tropical storm again on November 7 Ida later on became a hurricane again and weakened back to a tropical storm on November 9 Ida made landfall in Alabama on November 10 The storm died only about 4 hours later The remains of Ida became a noreaster that killed 9 people Hurricane Ida also caused about 56 million in damage

The following names will be used for named storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2009 This is the same list that was used in the 2003 season except for Fred Ida and Joaquin In 2003 those three names were Fabian Isabel and Juan because they were bad storms in 2003 their names were retired from the list of names

Tropical Depression Seven was a weak tropical depression that formed near the northeast Florida coast It was the seventh tropical cyclone of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season The depression formed on July 25 from the same tropical wave that created another weather system It was a small and disorganized depression and it never became a tropical storm which is stronger than a tropical depression The depression moved onto land at St Catherines Island Georgia and it quickly weakened Because the storm was weak the effects were limited to heavy rain in Florida Georgia South Carolina and North Carolina

A tropical wave which had also created Tropical Depression Six combined itself with an upper level low pressure area to create an area of deep convection near Hispaniola on July 23 2003 A mid to lower level circulation started to form inside the storm as it moved mostly in a north northwest direction According to surface and satellite observations it is thought that the system became Tropical Depression Seven at 1200 UTC on July 25 about 60 miles east of Daytona Beach Florida The system was caught in an environment characterized by high surface pressures

At first the depression moved west northwest at about 13 mph and most of the convection from the storm was separated from the center However the cloud pattern became organized and was made up of a number of curved banding features The storm continued to move northwestward for its whole life from the steering currents of a subtropical ridge and an approaching mid level trough

Moving through an area of cool water temperatures as well as unfavorable upper level winds the depression was not able to get winds greater than 35 mph and as a result did not gain tropical storm status Before landfall the highest winds were measured to exist in a small area northeast of the center of circulation where a well defined group of clouds persisted Early on July 26 it moved onto land on St Catherines Island Georgia and after slowly weakening over land it died out on July 27

One of the things that most Wikipedians aim for is to achieve at least one Good Article andor at least one Very Good Article We have a very good process here at the Simple English Wikipedia but its main fallback is that there are not enough active users nominating and voting for the articles

In the closing days of 2008 both of our processes were several weeks out of date due to no interest Eptalon did a very good job of trying to revive the process and it is now running fairly smoothly

However many of the candidates are still being declined due to a lack of votes Good Articles need to have a minimum of 5 votes and Very Good Articles need to have 6 votes There are also percentage requirements

The majority of the GA and VGA candidates currently at voting do not meet these criteria and are due to close on the 20th January Many are up to their respective standards but do not have enough votes to allow them to gain the titles that are rightly theirs

Another issue is articles that are being turned away because they are being nominated but no one is acting on the comments raised in the nomination TheGA processes require lots of community input to help get the articles up to their relevant standards and the reward of having your article on the Main Page pays for all the hard work that you would have put in

Finally we need more people to actually nominate articles that are eligible We are going to run out of VGA candidates in a couple of weeks and GA candidates soon after

So how can you help Well head over to proposed Very Good Articles or proposed Good Articles and give your thoughts or go write some articles and nominate them As I have said it is a very time consuming but rewarding process

Ive added my GA nomination have you

Methane hydrate also called methane ice or methane clathrate consists of methane which is enclosed in frozen water The water molecules completely surround the methane Methane hydrate is a common constituent of the shallow marine geosphere In 1971 it was first discovered in Black Sea

Methane hydrate is often described as methane gas surrounded by ice Although this description is easy to understand its not completely accurate A more accurate description would be that methane hydrate consists of methane gas trapped inside cage like crystal structures made up of water molecules These cages have a size of atoms and molecules far too small to see with the naked eye Under normal temperature and pressure one litre methane hydrate is equal to 168 litres methane gas

Methane hydrate is thought to be formed by dead organic matter trapped between the earths layers and then broken down by micro organisms and the earths heat The process is similar to the one that produces methane when organic waste is dumped at a garbage pit and covered with earth except that it occurs deep below the earths surface

Areas where natural methane hydrate is thought to exist are generally areas under the ocean where continental plates meet In depths between 500 to 1000 meter where pressure is high and temperature deep enough

Danger of methane hydrate

Nyssa is a fictional character in the long running British science fiction television series Doctor Who She is played by Sarah Sutton Nyssa came from the planet Traken Nyssa was created by writer Johnny Byrne for the Fourth Doctor serial The Keeper of Traken but the production team later decided that she should join the Doctor on his travels She returned in the next serial Logopolis in which the Fourth Doctor regenerated and remained as a companion of the Fifth Doctor She was a regular in the programme from 1981 to 1983 Sutton was the youngest female actor to play a companion in the series

Nyssa is a alien from the planet Traken the daughter of Tremas and stepdaughter of Kassia She helps the Doctor and Adric to defeat Master During her journeys with Tegan and Adric aboard the TARDIS Nyssa finds herself trapped in a mathematical equation by the Master whom she hates as he is of course now using that face She also encounters a race of androids and their insane ruler helps foil the genocidal plans of a wounded Terileptil and incidentally start the Great Fire of London and discovers her remarkable resemblance to Ann Talbot

Nyssas fate after she leaves the TARDIS is not known although the spin off novel Asylum by Peter Darvill Evans reveals that she eventually leaves Terminus and settles down as an academic in a university on an unspecified planet In Asylum Nyssa shares an adventure with the Fourth Doctor from a time before he met her leaving the Doctor with the knowledge that he will have to be extremely careful dealing with Nyssa when they eventually meet to avoid changing history

Since then Sutton has also voiced Nyssa in several audio plays alongside Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor produced by Big Finish Productions

Harry Sullivan is a fictional character from the British science fiction television series Doctor Who He was a companion of the Fourth Doctor Harry Sullivan was played by Ian Marter the character appears as a regular during the programmes twelfth season in 19741975

Harry is a doctor in the Royal Navy who is also a medical officer to the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce the military organisation to which the Doctor works for as a scientific advisor He is first mentioned in Planet of the Spiders when the Brigadier thinks the Third Doctor has gone into a coma The Brigadier calls Doctor Sullivan and asks him to come to the Doctors laboratory but tells him not to bother when Sergeant Benton wakes the Doctor by offering him a cup of coffee In the next serial Robot after the Doctors third regeneration Sullivan is called in to help him and ends up travelling aboard the TARDIS with the Fourth Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith for several adventures 

The character was originally devised by the production team to do any action scenes required in episodes when they had envisioned that the new Doctor would be played by an older actor When forty year old Tom Baker was cast however this was no longer a concern and the decision was taken to write Harry out something producer Philip Hinchcliffe later admitted was probably a mistake as Harry was a likeable and popular character who worked well with both of his fellow leads 

Harrys last regular appearance is in the season thirteen opener Terror of the Zygons which had actually been made at the conclusion of the twelfth production block and held over to start the following season At the conclusion of this story he chooses to return to London by train rather than by TARDIS with the Doctor and Sarah Jane who continue their adventures without him He does however reappear three stories later in The Android Invasion both as the original Harry and an android double This is the characters final appearance in the programme

A photo of Harry can be seen in Sarah Jane Smiths attic in The Sarah Jane Adventures and in Invasion of the Bane Sarah Jane thought of naming her newly adopted son after him before deciding on Luke

A fire drill is a practice event where people leave a building They are practicing what they would do if there was a fire in the building The event is started when a fire alarm is turned on When everybody is out the teachers count the people outside to find out if anyone is missing Sometimes people set off the fire alarm when there is not actually a fire or a scheduled fire drill This is called a false alarm It is against the law to set off a fire alarm for no reason

In the United Kingdom the law says that all schools must do a fire drill once per school year and recommends they do one every term In the United States different states have laws that say how often schools must have fire drills For example in many states schools must have one fire drill per month

During fire drills some schools block exits with a piece of cardboard or something else that is supposed to stand for a fire This makes people practice finding another way out of the building

A fire alarm is a sounder The sounders make a siren or a similar noise to let people know that there is a fire Some companies that make fire alarms are Wheelock and Simplex Sometimes old fashioned fire alarms are metal bells

An alarm sounder is a device that will make a loud noise when the fire is discovered and the fire system set off with either a manual or an automatic system The loud sound created will alert anyone at the building or site that there is a fire so they can escape safely Many fire alarm systems also have flashing lights These are important for deaf people who cannot hear the fire alarm

Fire alarms are often used in schools and other places during fire drills If somebody sets off a fire alarm without a good reason it is called a false alarm Setting off a false alarm is against the law almost everywhere

Hurricane Nate was an Atlantic hurricane that formed in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season It came close to Bermuda but it stayed at sea Nate was the 14th named storm and 7th hurricane of the 2005 season It formed to the southwest of Bermuda on September 5 It then moved very slowly to the northeast and it passed to the south of Bermuda The storm then moved into colder waters and it began to weaken Nate was later absorbed by a larger weather system

The storm caused no damage because it stayed at sea However one person was killed from rip currents that were caused by the storm Nate caused light rainfall and gusty winds on Bermuda Canadian Navy ships that were carrying supplies to help people in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina were slowed down because of Nate

Chromalveolata is a eukaryote supergroup first proposed by Thomas Cavalier Smith as a refinement of his kingdom Chromista which was first proposed in 1981

The origin of the Chromalveolata was thought to be a secondary endosymbiosis between a bikont and a red alga This union led to plastids containing chlorophyll c In Cavalier Smiths classification the Chromalveolata was one of the six major groups within the eukaryotes

The classification has been challenged

Hurricane Irene was an Atlantic hurricane that formed in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season The storm formed near the Cape Verde Islands on August 4 It moved across the Atlantic Ocean and it turned northward around Bermuda The storm lost its name as a tropical cyclone to the southeast of Newfoundland Irene lasted for 14 days as a tropical system That is the longest time of any storm of the 2005 season 

Irene was a hard storm to forecast The storm almost died out on August 10 but it gained back its strength Irene reached Category 2 hurricane strength on August 16 Because the storm stayed far away from land no tropical cyclone warnings were declared Also Irene did not cause any bad damage However it caused strong waves along the East Coast of the United States Because of the waves from Irene a 16 year old boy drowned after being caught in a rip current near Long Beach New York Lifeguards at one beach made over 100 rescues The name Irene is expected to be used again in 2011

Heterotrichea

Spirotrichea

The ciliates are a group of protists characterized by the presence of hair like organelles called cilia which are identical in structure to flagella but typically shorter and present in much larger numbers with a different undulating pattern than flagella Cilia occur in all members of the group and are variously used in swimming crawling attachment feeding and sensation

Conoidasida

They have a unique apical complex for penetrating a hosts cell and an organelle called an apicoplast 

They are unicellular spore forming and exclusively parasites of animals Motile structures such as flagella or pseudopods are absent except in certain gamete stages 

Apicomplexans have complex life cycles and there is much variation among different apicomplexan groups Both asexual and sexual reproduction occur

This is a diverse group including organisms such as coccidia gregarines piroplasms haemogregarines and malarias Diseases caused by apicomplexan organisms include

Giant magnetoresistance is a very small magnetic effect found in thin layers of iron and other materials It is used to read and write information in hard drives

The GMR effect can be measured when a magnet is used to change the flow of electricity The 2007 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Albert Fert and Peter Grnberg for the discovery of GMR

GMR was discovered in layers iron chrome and ferrite by Peter Grnbergs research team of the Jlich Research Centre in 1988 Peter Grnberg owns a patent for the technology It was also discovered by Albert Ferts research group of the University of Paris Sud in layers ferrite and chrome The Fert group were first to see what they thought of as a large effect which is why they gave the name Giant The Fert group were also first to explain the correct physics of GMR The discovery was the beginning of the science spintronics Grnberg and Fert have been given prizes and awards including the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery and other spintronics work

In multilayer GMR two or more magnetic layers are separated by a very thin non magnetic layer Ferrite a form of iron is a magnetic layer and chrome is an insulating layer At certain thicknesses the strength of magnetism between the layers becomes easy to measure and adjust The strength of electrical current between the layers can change by up to 10

The GMR effect was first observed in stacks of 10 or more layers

In spin valve GMR two magnetic layers are separated by a thin non magnetic layer It is possible to measure and adjust the strength of magnetism between these layers

It is hoped that research into spinning electrons will improve spin valves 

Materials used in spin valves are copper and an alloy of nickel and iron  

Spin valve GMR is the most useful sort for hard drives and is tested carefully to meet industry standards

Granular GMR is an effect found in copper containing grains of cobalt It is not possible to control the strength of granular GMR in the same manner as Multilayer GMR

GMR is used in modern hard drives and magnetic sensors Another use of the GMR effect is in magnetoresistive random access memory GMR has begun a new science of electronics called spintronics

The Link reaction or pyruvate decarboxylation forms an important link between the metabolic pathways of glycolysis and the citric acid or Krebs cycle

In eukaryotes the reaction takes place only inside the mitochondrial matrix in prokaryotes similar reactions take place in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane

To summarise 1 Pyruvate is decarboxylated CO2 is removed 2 It is added to CoA to form Acetyl CoA Acetyl CoA is then ready for use in the Krebs Cycle

The Link reaction is important as acetyl CoA is needed for the Krebs cycle to happen

The 2005 Azores subtropical storm was a type of tropical cyclone in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season The storm was not named by the National Hurricane Center because it was not found until after the season ended The storm formed in the Atlantic Ocean and it became a subtropical cyclone on October 4 The storm did not last a long time It passed over the Azores and it stopped being a subtropical cyclone on October 5 What was left of the storm went on to become Hurricane Vince After the hurricane season ended the National Hurricane Center checked to make sure they did not miss any storms during the year Some forecasters found this storm which was not noticed while it was active 

The system formed from a weather system to the west of the Canary Islands on September 28 The weather system gained strength over the next few days On October 3 it became a type of low pressure system Thunderstorms around the storm began to become more active and it then became a type of cyclone that is called a subtropical depression At about the same time the depression turned towards the northeast and gained strength It became a subtropical storm which is stronger than a subtropical depression The storm gained a bit more strength later that day It then moved across the Azores and began to weaken The storm weakened slightly as it moved to the north northeast The storm died out on October 5 What was left of the storm later became Subtropical Storm Vince

High winds were reported in parts of the Azores because of the storm The strongest winds were on Santa Maria Island where there was a gust of 59 mph Ponta Delgada also saw 52 mph wind gusts There was no damage and there were no deaths The storm was not said to be a subtropical storm until the National Hurricane Center found it on April 10 2006 Every year the National Hurricane Center checks to make sure they did not miss any storms during the past tropical storm season If the storm was found when it was active it would have been named Tammy

Tropical Storm Cristobal was a cyclone that formed in August of 2002 It stayed away from land for most of its life However when it died out what was left of the storm caused rain and wind on Bermuda It also caused stormy seas that caused three people to drown near Long Island No severe damage happened

A cyclone formed on August 5 At that time it was located about 175 miles to the east southeast of Charleston South Carolina The storm then moved towards the southeast On August 6 the rain and clouds around the storm began to get weaker However the storm gained enough strength to be named Tropical Storm Cristobal on August 6

The tropical storm was still moving towards the southeast when it became Cristobal On August 7 it turned to the east Cristobal then reached its highest strength It began to weaken after that Early on August 9 Tropical Storm Cristobal merged with another weather system when it was located about 350 miles to the southeast of Cape Hatteras North Carolina What was left of the storm passed near Newfoundland on August 10 It fully died near Greenland on August 14

A barrel organ plays music by using turning a barrel with notes decided by an arrangement of pins It is very similar to a simple music box where the pins pluck a metal harp With a barrel organ the pins in the barrel lift keys that open valves that let air from the bellows to play the pipes 

The barrel organ is sometimes wrongly called a hurdy gurdy which is a string instrument Barrel organs come in many different sizes from hand carried ones to large sizes carried on a wagon or trailer Usually each barrel had a number of tunes on it and the tune could be changed to different selection by lifting an indexing pin and sliding the barrel to the next index position Even a small hand carried organ could play six or eight tunes Stationary barrel organs built into large houses or churches were larger pipe organs and could play longer and more serious music Some had different barrels or revolving barrel changers which meant they did not need an organist to play them and had a larger selection of music Organs built in a church allowed people to sing accompanied by organ Some of the only organ music composed by Mozart was supposedly written for a barrel organ built into a clock

Jack Donahue sometimes called John Donohue was a famous Australian bushranger With the exception of Ned Kelly there have been more songs poems and stories about him than any other bushranger He quickly became a folk hero Governor Ralph Darling told hotel owners they would have their hotels closed if they allowed people to sing songs about Donahue

Jack Donahue was born in Dublin Ireland in 1804 He was in trouble with the police for his political activities to gain independence for Ireland In 1824 he was found guilty of intent to commit a felony This means he was going to do something wrong but he had not done it yet He was sent to Sydney on the convict ship Ann and Amelia which arrived on 2 January 1825 He was sent to work for a Mr Pagan at Parramatta He was soon in trouble and put to work on a road gang Major West at Quakers Hill employed Donahue to look after his pigs

With two other men George Kilroy and Bill Smith he held up some carts on the Richmond Road The police soon caught them and the court sentenced them to death As he was being taken back to gaol in Sydney he escaped The government offered a reward of 20 for his capture

In August 1828 Donahue and a gang of eight robbed houses south of Bathurst A police group nearly captured Donahue near Goulburn They shot at the gang and killed several gang members Donahue escaped and was not seen for several months

He next appeared in the Nepean River valley around the towns of Liverpool Penrith Windsor Parramatta and Liberty Plains They robbed the Reverend Samuel Marsden near Windsor Donahue was working with a man known as Darky Underwood and an escaped convict Jack Walmsley The government increased the reward to 50

In April 1830 Governor Ralph Darling made a special law to try to stop bushranging The police could arrest anyone enter and search houses without having to have a warrant There were many stories some people said Donahue and Underwood had gone to New Zealand others said they had been killed by the aborigines On 22 May 1830 Donahues gang held up the famous explorer Charles Sturt Donahue recognized Sturt and told the others to let him go

On 1 September 1830 a group of police and soldiers searching for Donahue found him near a creek at Bringelly Donahue shouted at them to try to capture him Private John Muckleston fired his rifle and pistol hitting Donahue in the neck and forehead He died soon afterward His body was taken to Sydney The surveyor and explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell drew a picture of Donahue This is the only known picture of him

Walmlsey was shot and killed soon after Gang member Bill Webber was caught and hanged Darky Underwood was shot and killed in 1832

There are many songs and poems about the life of Jack Donahue These include

Frederick Ward also known as Captain Thunderbolt was an Australian bushranger He lived in northern New South Wales Some people thought he was like Robin Hood who robbed from the rich to help the poor

Ward was born Windsor New South Wales in 1835 His father Michael Ward had been sent to Australia as a convict in 1815 Fred was one of eleven children He was arrested in 1856 for selling 50 stolen horses and sent to prison on Cockatoo Island for ten years After four years he was given a ticket of leave which meant he was able to leave the gaol as long as he reported to the police every three months

Ward went to the Mudgee area to work There he met a girl named Mary Ann Bugg who had a convict father and aboriginal mother Mary Ann fell pregnant soon afterwards Ward took her back to her fathers farm near Dungog and did not report to the Mudgee police on time His ticket of leave was cancelled When he reached the Mudgee police station he was also arrested for stealing the horse he was riding He was sent back to Cockatoo Island to finish his six years in gaol plus another three for the stolen horse 

On 11 September 1863 he and Fred Britten escaped from gaol They swam from Cockatoo Island and headed north to the New England district in north east New South Wales The government put up a reward of 25 for Wards capture Late in October 1863 they robbed a woman near Armidale and stole a shotgun and some bacon A few days later they were seen by the police near Thunderbolts Rock In the gunfight that followed Ward was shot in the back of the left knee The two bushrangers split up soon afterwards 

In December 1863 Ward tried to take money from the toll keeper on the road between Maitland and Rutherford There were only a few shillings in the cash box Ward took the money but later gave it back As he left he told the toll keeper that his name was Captain Thunderbolt He then went into the Spread Eagle Inn and asked for food When he asked for his bill the owner Mrs Byrne told him that there was no charge He replied that since she was so nice he was not going to rob her The police began to search for him but he managed to escape  

In 1864 Ward and Mary Ann lived quietly in the north western plains near Bourke Early in 1865 he joined up with three other men and formed his first gang His three companions were McIntosh Thomas Hogan and a youth called John Thompson They robbed travellers and stations near Collarenebri A group of police from Bourke followed their tracks and found their camp in the bush The gang escaped but Mary Ann and her two children were captured by the police They started to take her to Bourke but she pretended she was having a baby and they left her at a nearby station Ward went to the station and rescued his family and took gunpowder and food Ward and his first gang broke up after young Thompson was shot and nearly killed in April 1865 at Millie near Moree Mary Ann was arrested again in 1866 and also in 1867 but she was soon released from prison because of support from the community 

Late in 1865 Ward formed his second bushranging gang with Patrick Kelly and Jemmy the Whisperer They robbed as far south as Quirindi Currabubula and Carroll At Carroll they had another shoot out with the police in December 1865 where a trooper was shot in the arm The gang split up early in January 1866 

Ward had another quiet year in 1866 Early in 1867 he took on another young accomplice Thomas Mason They carried out robberies from near Scone as far north as the Queensland border Mason was captured by the police in September 1867 Later that year Ward and Mary Ann separated Mary Ann lived for the rest of her life at Mudgee where she died in 1905

In 1868 Ward took on another young accomplice William Monckton and they committed many robberies in northern New South Wales They separated in December 1868 and soon afterwards Monckton was captured by the police Ward did not have any other accomplices Some claim that Thunderbolt was involved in about 80 robberies and stole about 20000 but his takings were much smaller than that 

On 25 May 1870 the police at Uralla were told that Thunderbolt was robbing travellers near Thunderbolts Rock Constable Alexander Binney Walker chased after Ward on horseback for six or seven miles until they reached Kentucky Creek south west of Uralla Ward jumped off his horse and began swimming across the creek Constable Walker shot Thunderbolts horse then he shot and killed Ward himself Ward was later buried at Uralla 

While there have been stories that it was Wards brother William who was killed these stories are easily disproven

The Great Sphinx is at Giza near Cairo in Egypt It sits in a depression to the south of the pyramid of the Pharaoh Khafre at the west bank of the Nile River The Sphinx is a stone sculpture of a creature with a human head and a lions body The greatest monumental sculpture in the ancient world its body is 200 feetlong and 65 feet tall Its face is 13 feet wide

An accumulating body of evidence both archaeological and geological indicates the Sphinx is far older than the 4th Dynasty and was restored by Khafre during his reign The name Sphinx means strangler but the purpose of the Sphinx is not known Some archaeologists assume that it was a memorial to a Pharaoh or that it functioned as some sort of talisman or guardian god Other scholars believe the Sphinx as an astronomical observation device that marked the position of the rising sun on the day of the spring equinox in the time of Leo the Lion

The statue is eroding today because of wind and humidity and the smog from Cairo Attempts to restore it have often caused more harm than good Present attempts at restoration are under the control of the Supreme Council of Antiquities archaeologists They are working to drain away underground water which is damaging the rock

A xylophone is a musical instrument that is part of the percussion family It belongs to the group which is often called tuned percussion because it can play different pitches Xylophones have bars which are made of wood People play the xylophone by hitting the bars with a mallet Each piece of wood is a different length so they play different notes when they are hit The bars are arranged like the keys of a piano Underneath the bars there are long tubes called resonators which make the sound louder

The modern orchestral xylophone developed from xylophones found in Africa and Asia It came as a folk instrument to countries in Central Europe It was first used in an orchestra by Humperdinck in his opera Hansel and Gretel It was also used by Saint Sans in his Danse macabre where it is supposed to sound like a skeleton and in his Carnival of the Animals where it is supposed to sound like fossils 

The xylophone is usually played so that the music sounds an octave higher than written Because the sound is always very short the xylophone is often used for short solo tunes which are fast and dry

The marimba is a kind of xylophone which has a softer sound It is not often used in orchestras It is usually heard on its own or with small groups or in jazz It was invented in 1910 in the USA

Xylophones and marimbas are usually played with two beaters but it is possible for good players to play with four so that they can play four notes at once Large beaters like those used for the marimba can also be called mallets

Bibimbap is one of the most famous Korean traditional foods The word bibimbap means stirred or mixed rice It is served as a bowl of rice with more ingredients on it These ingredients can include some vegetables spinach herbs potherb and gosari Beef or seafood can be added too

There are some theories or stories about the origin of Bibimbap It was first written about in a cook book in the late 1800s First is the palace food theory It says that bibimbap was served as a light meal whenever the king wanted something to eat

The second theory is the meal for peasants during the farming season As it was too difficult for peasants to have regular meals during the farming season they would use a single bowl where rice was combined with vegetables

The third theory is the Donghak uprising theory When the Donghak uprising broke out in the Jeolla provinces in 1894 the Donghak peasants were forced to mix their rice with side dishes because they didnt have enough plates or bowls

Because Bibimbap has many ingredients it contains a lot of nutrition Also its color and appearance can be very different It is easy to prepare and clean up because it is all packed in one bowl

Generally class struggle or class conflict means conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie The proletariat is the social class which doesnt have means of production that the bourgeoisie has Class struggle has been existed all the time but after Karl Marxs explanation in his book Das Kapital this concept became popular

Class struggle happens when the rich business owners pay everyday workers to make things for them to sell The workers have no say in their pay or what things they make since they can not live without a job or money

Karl Marx was mad that the workers were forced to work without any say in the business He believed that since the workers make the things they should say where they go and for how much instead of the rich owners They had to work hard to earn a living while making the rich richer just doing simple office work

Since they had to earn money to buy food and jobs were the only things that give money they had no choice but to work for the rich who made the business The rich became richer while the worker hauled and lifted and did all of that hard manual stuff no one really likes to do

Karl Marx thought that their labor limited their freedom He wanted the workers to unite and take over the business so that they could all be prosperous He thought that the common man deserved to run the business and that the rich were not better than the commoner

When money was made everyone got their identical share regardless of how much or little they worked Each person received equal pay which Karl Marx saw as fair and just

Class struggle appeared in some forms First there is an economic form The proletariat struggle with the bourgeoisie through their laborers organization in this form Second there is a political form In this form the proletariat has their party and through democracy they try to change the system And the last there is an ideological struggle In this form the proletariat try to adapt the old governing system to new social situations There are other forms of struggle too These forms are not exclusive but exist at the same time

 History  Class struggle appeared all throughout history At first people lived in small communist societies Then they took property from the Earth for themselves and started to use slaves They then had feudalism which meant one person owned an entire area of land and used soldiers and workers to help them make money and only gave their workers land but they had some freedom that slaves didnt Finally in Karl Marxs time people in some countries were becoming workers and bosses during the industrial revolution The bosses owned the machines that the workers used to make things but they didnt help using the machines Instead they made money by buying the time and energy of the workers to make things Marx believed that the workers werent making the money they deserved because the boss would make money from the work they did without helping

Marx believed that countries would overthrow capitalism and that workplaces would move toward socialism This roughly means that the workers would control the workplaces When this has happened everywhere Marx thought the world will have achieved communism

The Soviet Union overthrew feudalism They never reached the point of capitalism so their society was very corrupt Many blame them for the bad name of communism but other workplaces and societies are run democratically by workers such as the kibbutzim in Israel and the democratic car industry in Japan

Other people who believe in class struggle like democratic socialists think class struggle can be ended by the government and a place can evolve to socialism through voting Marx believed that the bosses wouldnt give up their machines without a fight and the only way to get them is through violent revolution

The Grand Korean Waterway plan officially known as the Pan Korea Grand Waterway consists of 3 canals the Seoul Busan Canal the Honam Canal and the North Korea Canal

The Seoul Busan Canal would run between Seoul and Busan which are two of South Koreas largest cities connecting the Han River and Nakdong River Honam Canal which would run through ChungCheongBuk do ChungCheongNam do JeollaBuk do and JeollaNam do connects Geum River and YeongSan River The North Korea Canal would connect SinUiJu Pyongyang GaeSeong Wonsan GaeSeong 

The canal is a project of Lee Myung Bak who is the present president of South Korea It is hugely controversial Many Koreans object to this plan President Lee said that he would not carry out this plan if many people objected to this idea but there was a person who works in the Korea Institute of Construction Technology has confessed that governments Four Major River Arrangement Plan is a canal project in reality 

The major canal in this plan is the GyeongBu Canal

The GyeongBu Canal starts in Seoul the capital of South Korea It flows along the Han River and encounter with mountains And then 40 km long tunnel begins connecting the Han River with the Nakdong River

Many Koreans are anxious about this plan Critics of the plan say that this canal is not efficient at all They say that mountains along the proposed route would make it difficult and expensive to construct Currently the major transportation method on the GyeongBu line is road transport which takes 5 hours However ships following the GyeongBu Canal will take 25 hours to finish the trip Critics believe this plan would just be a waste of money In addition it would be harmful to the environment and damage cultural treasures On the other hand supporters of this plan say that this canal will lessen congestion on the GyeongBu Expressway and GyeongBu Railroad line Furthermore sand from dredging the river bed could be sold for use in construction They argue that this money could be used to fund the construction of the canals However critics argue that sand prices will be so cheap that little money will be earned from selling the sand They say that it is only beneficial to the construction industry

Baobab is the common name of a genus containing eight species of trees native to Madagascar mainland Africa and AustraliaThis tree is the National Tree of Madagascar

Other common names include boab boaboa bottle treethe tree of life upside down tree and monkey bread tree The species reach heights of 5 to 30 metres and trunk diameters of 7 to 11 metres Its trunk can hold up to 120000 litres of water 

The Baobab Tree is also known as the tree of life with good reason too It is capable of providing shelterclothing food and water for the animal as well as human inhabitants of the African Savannah regions The cork like bark or huge stem is fire resistant and is used for making cloth and rope The leaves are used as condiments and medicines The fruit called monkey bread is rich in vitamin C and is eaten The tree is capable of storing hundreds of litres of water which is tapped in dry periodscitation needed Mature trees are frequently hollow providing living space for numerous animals and humans alikeCitation needed Trees are even used as bars barns wine and beer shops and moreCitation needed Radio carbon dating has measured that age of some Baobab trees at over 2000 years old For most of the year the tree is leafless and looks very much like it has its roots sticking up in the air 

There are numerous legends offering explanations of how the tree came to be stuffed in the ground upside down so it could no longer complain Some of the myths are

The Bushmen believed that goings on in the baobab so offended God that in his wrath he uprooted it and cast it back into the earth upside down

It is said that if you drink its delectable sap you will receive protection from the crafty crocodile but do not pluck its flowers for whosoever does so will be torn apart by lions

It is also claimed that on the day of creation each animal was given a tree to plant and that the hyena planted the baobab upside down and as a result it should never have grown But grow it did and today baobabs dot the Limpopo landscape in Africa

Hurricane Kenneth was the strongest hurricane in the 2005 Pacific hurricane season After the hurricane died out what was left of Kenneth came near another weather system and it caused rain on the Hawaiian Islands Because of the heavy rain there was flooding At Nuuanu Pali on Oahu the rain reached 1025 inches The rain was so heavy that 411 inches fell in one hour The rain reached 12 inches in other areas This made Kenneth tied for the 9th rainiest tropical storm in Hawaii One example of the flooding was 1 foot of water on Hawaii Route 61 This flooded a few houses There was flooding on some rivers 

Kenneth caused stormy seas along the coast Waves were between 8 and 10 feet high These high waves crashed along the east shores of these islands

There was no bad damage and no people were killed by Kenneth

The Raumur scale is a way of measuring temperature The unit associated with the scale is called Raumur named after the physicist Ren Antoine Ferchault de Raumur who created it in 1731 The unit is usually abbreviated R sometimes r The two base points of the scale are the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water both at normal pressure There are 80 degrees between those values one degree Raumur is the 80th part of that temperature difference 

Raumur used ethanol for his thermometers Thermometers that use ethanol show the change of temperature better than those using mercury This is because when heated ethanol expands faster than mercury There is the problem though that the expansion of ethanol is different at different temperatures  it is non linear Ethanol has a very low boiling point which makes thermometers based on it unusable for many applications Soon instrument makers used other liquids and then chose 80R as the boiling point of water 

In 1772 Jean Andr Deluc studied the several substances used in thermometers at the time At the time new theories of heat were being developed Delucs analysis came to the conclusion that mercury based thermometers were the best for practical use He made an experiment as follows Suppose there are two amounts of water say one liter are mixed The two amounts have different temperatures The temperature of both liquids are taken before the mix and the temperature of the mix is measured The mix should have the temperature that is the mean of both temperatures This relationship only held reliably when mercury was used in thermometers From the late 18th century almost all thermometers used mercury for this reason The termometers that use other substances than ethanol but have 80 scales between the boiling and the freezing points of water have nothing in common with Raumurs thermometer except for the name



Gdels incompleteness theorems is the name given to two theorems proved by Kurt Gdel in 1931 They are about limitations in all but the most trivial formal systems for arithmetic of mathematical interest The theorems are very important for the philosophy of mathematics The idea behind the theorems is that some mathematical systems are not complete Most people think they show that Hilberts program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all of mathematics is impossible This would give a negative answer to Hilberts second problem

In a formal system there are axioms All axioms are supposed to be true even without a proof A theorem then serves to come up with other true statements from the axioms using certain rules A sequence of such statements is called a proof of a statement because it shows that the statement is true under all circumstances Ideally it should be possible to construct all true statements in the formal system in that manner A system that has this property is called complete one that does not is called incomplete Another thing wanted of a theory is that there should be no contradictions This means that it is not possible to make false statements with the theory A system that does not include theories that allow to make false statements is called consistent

Gdel said that every non trivial formal system is either incomplete or inconsistent

The first theorem says that for a given formal system there will be statements that are true in that system but that they cannot be proved to be true inside the system The second theorem says that if a system can be proved to be consistent using its own logic then there will be a theorem in the system that is contradictory

A cilium is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells Cilia are slender protuberances that project from the much larger cell body

There are two types of cilia 

In eukaryotes cilia and flagella together make up a group of organelles known as undulipodia Eukaryotic cilia are structurally identical to eukaryotic flagella although distinctions are sometimes made according to function andor length

Motile cilia are found on protist ciliates like Paramecium They are how Paramecium moves around They are also found on the epithelial cells of many internal organs of metazoans such as the digestive system and the trachea of the lungs

 Cilia in metazoa  Non motile cilia usually occur one per cell nearly all mammalian cells have a single non motile primary cilium In addition examples of specialized primary cilia can be found in human sensory organs such as the eye and the nose 

Cilia are structurally almost identical with the much larger flagella So much so that it has been proposed protists bearing either should be unified in the Phylum Undulipodia Previously Margulis had proposed that the Ciliates alone should be placed in a Phylum Ciliophora Admittedly the Protista is a collection of disparate single celled forms but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux Protista is still a useful term

Cilia and flagella are cell organelles specialised units which carry out well defined functions like mitochondria and plastids It is fairly certain now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once independent prokaryotes and that the eukaryote cell is a community of micro organisms working together in a marriage of convenience

Closed circuit television is the use of video cameras to send a signal to a certain place on a small set of monitors

Big Brother is watching youin your school

CCTV is the use of video cameras to transmit images from covered camera places to a limited set of monitors

Since the 1970s the British government has invested 20 million to be exact in CCTV cameras In all primary and secondary schools classrooms are now televised and equipped with cameras which monitor continuously pupils and teachers by the security staff CCTV cameras are installed at strategic locations and provide much needed support to teachers Nowadays schools tend to get bigger thus CCTV cameras enable teachers and security staff to see and then control what is happening in live In our opinion like Britain we believe that our school should also install CCTV cameras As children deserve the best working conditions in a school environment the CCTV cameras furnish a useful technology support A large part of a childs day is spent at school As a result children are exposed to violence bullying and influence from others undisciplined pupils Therefore it is a good reason to be monitored More than an intrusion into private life CCTV cameras prevents violent behavior and prohibits children from breaking the rules As CCTV discourages children monitoring is a good mean of persuasion After a few weeks this safety device will be forgotten by the children who continue to live as before the installation However when one considers the positive consequences monitoring appears to be an obvious choice in the purpose of protecting children and even adults

In schools the accusations are many and it is also difficult to determine if the children involved are guilty or innocent Hence CCTV cameras overcome this problem and resolve arguments parents and teachers are now able to know the accurate truth CCTV cameras improve concentration and productivity from both teachers and pupils who feel much supported The cameras can be used by teachers to show good practice to colleagues and give feedback As children are in a position where they are not going to be robbed or harassed they feel more safe and confident Consequently CCTV cameras improve educational standards of a school For instance Harrop Fold is a school that has installed cameras and microphones in its classrooms

In the last four years the percentage of pupils achieving GCSEs in this school with grades of A C has grown from 18 to 52 Even though schools should not have to resort to technology to fight bullying and bad behavior children are becoming more and more out of control and violence had considerably increased in schools within the past few years As a consequence CCTV in schools is vital It protects teachers and students alike ensuring that those who perpetrate unpleasant acts can be prosecuted and punished To conclude CCTV cameras provide appropriate solutions when using for lesson observation or pupil discipline

The SQL slammer worm was a highly damaging computer worm that spread on the internet in early 2003

The SQL worm mainly attacked computers that had Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or Microsoft Desktop Engine 2000 on them The worm also produces a Denial of Service attack on some websites and computers because it sends too much data

In June 2002 Microsoft released a patch that fixed the weakness that the SQL worm attacked However many people did not fix the weakness In January 2003 the worm was released Within ten minutes of its release it had attacked and infected 75000 internet servers Bank of America was one of the largest companies affected by the worm Many of its ATMs would not work for consumers The damage got worse and on January 25 2003 the worm cause a global internet slowdown The worm was reported to have interfered with 911 calls and was responsible for many canceled flights

During its lifetime in 2003 the SQL worm caused about 1 billion US Dollars in damage

A computer worm is a kind of malware that is able to copy itself and spread Unlike a computer virus this is done without changing files on a computer and without affecting the boot sector of media Worms spread over networks or on removable media like USB flash drives They almost always need a helper program that is able to access the network or that executes when a new medium is inserted In that way a worm could start a program to send electronic mail and send itself on to all the addresses in the address book of the email application A very famous worm that appeared in 2000 was called ILOVEYOU it sent a simple mail with the subject ILOVEYOU and an attachment of a document that contained the worm code

Solid Snake is a fictional stealth character seen in Metal Gear games by Konami Introduced in the 1987 video games Metal Gear and Metal Gear Solid created by series creator Hideo Kojima Solid Snake is a combination of a spy special operations agent and mercenary who works for FOXHOUND

Solid Snake is one of three clones made in a secret project to clone the worlds greatest soldier His childhood is a mystery but he is known to have fought in the Gulf War and maybe a few others before that After the war ended he joined the Secret Organization known as FOXHOUND While he was a member of this group he discovered the existence of a new war machine called Metal Gear This is a staple throughout the series as the title suggests He fights a new type of Metal Gear in every game 

In the fourth release in the Metal Gear Solid series Solid Snakes codename id changed to Old Snake as a reference to his old age In reality he is not actually as old as he seems A side affect of the cloning that created him was an aging process that would speed up when he reached a certain age around the time a normal humans body starts to weaken It should be noted that another side effect of the cloning is that he is unable to have children

Though Snake is not a Nintendo character he makes an appearance in Super Smash Bros Brawl as a secret character If used right his can be one of the best attack sets

A food web is similar to a food chain only bigger Food webs show how plants and animals are connected in many ways to help them all survive unlike food chains that just follow one path 

For example a tree produces acorns  this is called the producer Mice Squirrels and insects eat these acorns and because there are many mice the weasels snakes and racoons have food With insects in the acorns other predators would be attracted and therefore foxes hawks or owls could all find food

Food webs can be effected in many ways considering the urban areas of major countries are taking no action and care

The ozone layer is a layer of ozone high up in the Earths atmosphere In the region between about 10 kilometres and about 50 kilometres above ground the atmosphere contains more ozone The exact amount of ozone that can be found varies the seasons influence it it is also different in different places on the earth This layer can absorb between 93 and 99 percent of the ultraviolet radiation from the sun This radiation is dangerous to many living organisms on earth 

Over the last hundred years the ozone layer has been damaged by man made chemicals especially ones called CFCs CFCs were used in spray cans but also as solvents or as cooling agents in refrigerators They have been replaced by other substances for most applications These CFCs are broken down in the upper atmosphere where they react with the ozone This reduces the amount of ozone in the upper atmosphere There is now a hole in the layer over Antarctica Ozone is responsible for absorbing harmful UV radiation from the Sun Diseases of the skin which are related to this UV radiation will become more common as a result 

The ozone layer was discovered in 1913 by the French physicists Charles Fabry and Henri Buisson Its properties were explored in detail by the British meteorologist G M B Dobson who developed a simple spectrophotometer the Dobsonmeter This tool could be used to measure the ozone levels found in the stratosphere from the ground Between 1928 and 1958 Dobson established a worldwide network of ozone monitoring stations Most of these stations are still in use today The Dobson unit a convenient measure of the total amount of ozone in a column overhead is named in his honor

Dolly was a sheep remarkable in being the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell using the process of nuclear transfer She was cloned by Ian Wilmut Keith Campbell and colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh Scotland It took 277 attempts to create Dolly and the success rate when cloning animals is very low 

The cell used as the donor for the cloning of Dolly was taken from a mammary gland and the production of a healthy clone therefore proved that a cell taken from a specific part of the body that could recreate a whole individual She was cloned so she did not need any male cells to fertilize the egg and mature it She only has one parent

In July 1863 Morgan and his friend German Bill began to rob from farms around Gundagai New South Wales They stole food gun powder guns watches and horses There is story that he killed German Bill but there is no proof Morgan robbed the police magistrate from Wagga Wagga Henry Bayliss Morgan said he would not shoot him as long as he didnt report the robbery to the police Bayliss told the police at Urana and a search party was sent from Wagga Wagga With the help of black trackers the police found Morgans camp In the shooting that followed Morgan shot Bayliss in the hand and shoulder Morgan escaped into the bush After more robberies the government put a reward of 500 for the capture of Morgan

Stop Stansted Expansion is a pressure group established in 2002 It was originally a working group of the North West Essex and East Herts Preservation Association in response to the Governments consultation on expanding UK airports and particularly expansion plans for Stansted Airport defined in 2001 It has around 7500 members and registered online supporters and its campaign director is Carol Barbone

The groups objective is to restrict the development of Stansted Airport within tight limits that are truly sustainable and in this way to protect the quality of life of its supporters over wide areas of Essex Hertfordshire and Suffolk to preserve local heritage and to protect the natural environment

The organisation has already delayed the time frame for second runway plans for Stansted by four years 

If the plans went ahead there would be climate change effects The predicted annual equivalent carbon dioxide emissions are 12 million tonnes annually with full use of the existing runway and up to 23 million tonnes a year with a second runway

On the 9th October 2008 the UK Government approved an increase in Stansteds permitted passenger throughput from 25 million passengers per annum to 35mppa using the existing runway following a Public Enquiry  Stop Stansted Expansion has described this decision as entirely predictable cynical and unjustified  After this announcement on 14 November Stop Stansted Expansion lodged an Appeal with the High Court

A key part of the campaign against the second runway is to stimulate letters of objection to the application Uttlesford District Council has received over nine thousand representations to date with many more expected to follow 

Passenger traffic at Stansted is falling sharply The airport handled 6 fewer passenger in 2008 than in the previous year SSE therefore says that increasing passenger numbers from 25mppa to 35mppa will not make any difference in the short term Indeed with the recent dramatic deterioration in the economic situation both domestically and internationally the UK is entering uncharted territory with regard to the future demand for air travel 

BAAs Plans to get through the Public Inquiry as fast as possible for their application for a second Stansted runway have been condemned by Stop Stansted Expansion It began 15 April 2009

The news that the Inspector appointed by the Government is looking to conduct the Inquiry at a breakneck pace was revealed in a note from the Planning Inspectorate issued ahead of the Pre Inquiry Meeting held on 10 November 2008 when the Inquiry programme and procedures were discussed at a public session A further programming meeting is to be held on 19 January 2009

Running parallel sessions examining different subjects in different Inquiry rooms at the same time would severely compromise the communitys ability to participate fully in the Inquiry SSE says It would be impossible to conduct a fair and proper examination of BAAs plans by effectively excluding community representation by SSE and parish councils who are planning to play a leading role said Carol Barbone campaign director

A return statement is the information that part of a computer program gives to another part In object oriented programming the term return is used by methods to perform an output Much like when a button is pressed on a vending machine then the item you bought comes out when an object performs a method then something is returned Specifically what is returned depends on an special identifier called a return type

A return type is a required part of any method because it tells the computer what the user wants to be returned to whatever called the method If an integer was expected then typically the method would have a return type of int as int is the common name for an integer in computer science There are several return types that can be found to most programming languages

Means a method returns an integer a whole number

Means a method returns a double value This is the default method of using numbers with decimal points

In object oriented programming a method is a part of an object A method allows the object to perform an action whether this action is to modify itself or to return a value An example is

This syntax is the same in different programming languages such as Java and C

The public identifier means that this method is publicly accessible that anyone is allowed to use this In comparison a method may be private or sometimes protected the latter of which means only specific parts of the same program are allowed to use this method and never a human user A privately accessible method only allows the object it belongs to to edit it This is used to give data security

The int identifier means that the return type is an integer value

Snape didnt kill himself after Lilys death only because of the green eyes he had loved that Lilys son had inherited from her Just before Snapes death in the seventh book Snape asks Harry to do the last thing for him

The last thing Snapes eyes ever saw were Lilys green eyes Later Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley named their youngest son after Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape Harry confesses to his son Albus Severus that Severus Snape was the bravest man he ever knew even though while still at school Snape had been the teacher that Harry had hated the most because of Snapes bad behaviour towards Harry Snape was so mean to Harry because of Harrys father James Potter that had bullied Snape while they were at Hogwarts Snape was more than a cruel heartless death eater but rather a brave and sincere victim to the perils of love in the reign of a power obsessed and heartless dictator

The St Matthew Passion is a musical composition written by Johann Sebastian Bach The words tell the story of Jesuss death on the cross as told in chapters 26 and 27 of the Book of St Matthew in the Bible The work is for a choir solo voices and orchestra Both the choir and the orchestra are divided into two sections Chorus 1 and Chorus 2 Orchestra 1 and Orchestra 2

The words are from the Bible and by the poet Picander There were other composers who also wrote works called St Matthew Passion the most famous being Heinrich Schtz However Bachs St Matthew Passion is thought by many musicians to be the greatest choral work ever written Two other very great choral works by Bach are his St John Passion and Mass in B minor 

The tradition of singing the story of Jesus passion during Holy Week goes back many hundreds of years to a time when a priest would sing the story instead of speaking it Later a tradition developed of letting it be sung by a choir During the Baroque period the Passion oratorio developed Bachs St Matthew Passion written in 1727 is the most famous work in this tradition It was probably first performed on Good Friday 1727 in the Thomaskirche in Leipzig where Bach was Kapellmeister He made some changes to it by 1736 and performed it again on 30 March 1736 After that it was almost completely forgotten until long after Bachs death Even Bachs music in general was forgotten by most people In 1829 the composer Felix Mendelssohn discovered the music of the St Matthew Passion and decided to perform a short version of it in Berlin It immediately became extremely popular with the public and from then on Bach has always remained recognized as one of the greatest of all composers

The words of Bachs St Matthew Passion are partly taken straight from the Bible and partly made up by the poet Picander The words from the Bible are used to tell the basic story They are sung to recitative by a tenor soloist who is known as the evangelist The words spoken by Jesus are sung by a baritone or bass soloist The evangelist is accompanied by the continuo Jesus is accompanied by the strings

Between the sections of recitatives there are arias each of which is sung by one of the four soloists a soprano an alto a tenor and a bass The arias often have an introductory movement called arioso which in musical style is something between a recitative and an aria The arias are accompanied by the orchestra often with one instrument playing an important solo The words of the arioso and arias comment on what is happening in the story and describe what is going on in the peoples minds 

The choir divided into two sections sing some movements in which they represent the crowd of people in the story Some of these movements such as the opening one are quite long others are very short indeed In some of these movements there is a vocal soloist and the choir are commenting on what the soloist is singing about In addition to the main choir there is a small choir which sings a chorale tune on top of the music during the first movement Sometimes a boys choir is used for this

There are also several chorales which are sung by the whole choir These are like hymn tunes It is likely that in Bachs time the congregation would have joined in singing these as they were chorales which were often sung at church services

During some of the choral movements there are very small sections for a solo voice These represent one person from the crowd These may be sung by soloists from the choir So as well as Jesus there are small parts for Judas Peter two high priests Pontius Pilate Pilates wife two witnesses and two ancillae These small parts can be sung by different soloists but in some performances one soloist may take several of these parts

In the tradition of these musical Passions the Resurrection is not mentioned at all The story ends with the chorus shedding tears after Jesus has been put to death

The instruments in the orchestra are string instruments organs two flutes two oboes and bassoon Orchestra I plays with Choir I and Orchestra II plays with Choir II There are some extra instruments as well two recorders three different kinds of oboe and a viola da gamba

Bachs St Matthew Passion takes nearly 3 hours if it is performed without any cuts It is divided into two parts There is usually a long interval between each part so that musicians and audience can have a meal before coming back refreshed for the second part

The St Matthew Passion and the St John Passion are both very great works They are different in character The St John Passion is very dramatic enjoying the drama of the story The St Matthew Passion is more gentle and thoughtful although it also has some dramatic moments

Oatmeal is a meal made of oats It is normally made for breakfast Oatmeal can also be steel cut oats crushed oats or rolled oats Occassionally brown sugar honey jelly or other items are added to oatmeal It makes a tasty treat for all to enjoy

The St John Passion is a musical composition by Johann Sebastian Bach The words tell the story of Jesuss death on the cross as told in the Book of St John in the Bible The work is for a choir solo voices and orchestra

The St John Passion was first performed in 1724 in the St Nicholas Church Leipzig The words are from three sources the Bible by two poets from Hamburg mostly by Barthold Heinrich Brockes and from chorales which were well known to German church goers at the time There were other composers who also wrote works called St John Passion the most famous being Heinrich Schtz  However Bachs St John Passion is thought by many musicians to be one of the greatest choral works ever written Two other very great choral works by Bach are his St Matthew Passion and Mass in B minor 

WPST is a radio station serving Trenton New Jersey USA

The Carnival of the Animals is a musical composition by the French composer Camille Saint Sans It is one of the best known pieces of classical music for children along with Prokofievs Peter and the Wolf and Brittens The Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra

Saint Sans wrote the Carnival of the Animals when he was on holiday in Austria He wrote it for a bit of relaxation because at the time he was busy composing a large symphony his Symphony no 3 It was performed at a small gathering of friends just for a bit of fun Saint Sans did not want the general public to hear it because he did not want to be thought of as someone who wrote jokey pieces He wanted to be thought of as a serious composer Just one movement was published during his lifetime the famous Swan movement for solo cello The rest of the work was not heard any more until a year after Saint Sans death

There are 14 short movements with a short introduction Saint Sans arranged it for an orchestra consisting of flute doubling piccolo clarinet two pianos glass harmonica xylophone two violins viola cello and double bass Today it is often performed with a full orchestra of strings and with a glockenspiel instead of a glass harmonica which is an unusual instrument

There are fourteen movements

After an introduction the pianos introduce a march theme They imitate the roar of the lions 

This music sounds like hens clucking and a cock crowing

The two pianos seem to go wild with scales rushing up and down madly

This movement for strings and piano is very slow like a tortoise Saint Sans makes a musical joke here the tune is the same tune as the famous Can Can from Offenbachs operetta Orpheus in the Underworld but played very slowly

This double bass solo with piano accompaniment makes the elephant sound heavy and clumsy In the middle section the elephant tries to dance a waltz This is also a musical joke  the tune is taken from Felix Mendelssohns Incidental Music to A Midsummer Nights Dream and Hector Berliozs Dance of the Sylphs where it is played on high sounding instruments

The two pianos hop about gracefully like kangaroos

This is very graceful music with the tune played on the flute accompanied by strings with occasional glissandi on the glass harmonica

The Persons with Long Ears are actually donkeys It is played on two violins which imitate the hee haw sound of the donkey 

The pianos play gentle chords like someone walking quietly through a forest Now and again the clarinet plays two notes which sound like the call of the cuckoo

The flute has a very delicate fast tune accompanied by strings and pianos It sounds like birds flying in an aviary 

This is another joke because pianists are people who play the piano they are not animals Saint Sans makes them seem rather stupid as they practise their scales

The xylophone plays a fast tune which sounds like skeletons playing Saint Sans is making a joke about himself because he uses a tune from one of his own works the Danse Macabre There are bits of other tunes as well Ah vous dirai je Maman the French nursery rhymes Au Clair de la Lune and Jai du bon tabac the popular anthem Partant pour la Syrie as well as the aria Una Voce Poco Fa from Rossinis Barber of Seville Saint Sans was saying that these tunes were old fashioned

This is one of the most famous of all tunes for the cello It is a lovely tune which sounds like a swan swimming gracefully along 

All the instruments join in the Finale which has bits from nearly all the movements

In the ocean the storm caused waves that were up to 30 feet high The hurricane wrecked 52 ships and killed 57 fishermen On land Ismael caused 59 deaths in Mexico The hurricane destroyed thousands of houses leaving 30000 people without homes The storm reached the United States where it caused heavy rainfall in parts of New Mexico It was the deadliest hurricane in the 1995 season

The storm that eventually became Hurricane Ismael started off the southern coast of Guatemala on September 9 As it grew it moved to the west northwest After a few days with no activity a low pressure area developed off the coast of Mexico Late on September 12 it formed into Tropical Depression Ten At this time the storm was about convert350mikm south southwest of Manzanillo Colima The depression moved to the northwest and strengthened to a tropical storm early on September 13

Because of the influence of a nearby weather system over Baja California Ismael slowly turned to the north Tropical Storm Ismael became stronger as it moved northward Ismael continued to grow and on September 14 it became a hurricane

An eye began to form inside of the storm and six hours after becoming a hurricane it reached its peak strength Ismael then sped up as it moved to the northwest The storm passed just east of Cabo San Lucas on September 15 The hurricane made landfall in the state of Sinaloa on September 15 Ismael quickly lost strength over land and it died out on September 16 The remains of Ismael continued moving to the north Rain from the storm reached parts of the United States

At first weather forecasters expected the hurricane to stay over the ocean However when they later found out that the storm would affect land the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Manzanillo Colima to Cabo Corrientes The warning was later extended to Los Mochis and another one was given out for part of the east coast of Baja California Sur Forecasters then issued a hurricane warning from Mazatln to Los Mochis Before the storm arrived 1572 people moved to emergency shelters

Hurricane Ismael caused waves that were 30 feet high over the Gulf of California Many fishermen were not prepared for the hurricane Because of this 52 boats were destroyed of which 20 sank About 57 fishermen died off the shore some washed up on shore Another 150 fishermen survived the storm by waiting on islands or broken wikt linksandbarsandbars Navy rescue teams searched for days off the coast of Mexico to find victims and survivors

The storm dropped moderate to heavy rainfall which reached 776 inches in Sinaloa The heavy rain caused flooding in four municipalities In one area the hurricane destroyed 373 houses and damaged 4790 others The storm left 177 houses without drinking water and led to lots of power outages Damage was very bad where the hurricane made landfall In Los Mochis the winds from Ismael knocked down houses and telephone poles A total of 59 people were killed in Sinaloa

Ismael produced heavy rainfall farther to the north Very bad flooding was reported in Huatabampo Across Sonora the winds destroyed 4728 houses and removed the roofs from 6827 homes The hurricane also ruined 107 schools The hurricane damaged about 100 miles of roads About 83 sq miles of crop lands were damaged

Atmospheric convection is caused by one of two possibilities One is instable state of atmosphere The second is different ability of Earths surface to get warmer The first type can be called spontaneous The second type can be called contact convection Spontaneous convection starts at any level Contact convection starts near the terrain

The most frequent is contact convection The sun is shining on the surface It gets warmer and warmer This leads to origination of spontaneous rising and downward motions This warm air has higher temperature than its neighborhood Warmer air has lower thickness than cold air Warm air is getting high Through this rising motion the air element decelerates because of the fiction This trend stops when the temperature of this element is equal to the temperature of surrounding air Next rising caused just the inertia

These thermal motions are used for example in gliding The Thermal flow has enough energy to bring gliders to higher altitude

Pablo Casals was a Spanish Catalan cellist He is generally thought of as the greatest cellist of his time He made the cello popular as a solo instrument and inspired many cellists of the younger generation His Spanish name was Pau Casals i Defill His nickname Pau means peace in Catalan In his later years he was also a conductor as well as a composer

Casals made many recordings of solo chamber and orchestral music Perhaps his best known recordings are the ones he made between 1936 and 1939 of the Cello Suites by Bach When the dictator General Franco started to rule Spain he felt very strongly about the political situation When the democratic party was defeated in 1939 he said that he would never go back to Spain until democracy had been restored He did not live long enough to see the end to Francos rule

Casals was born in El Vendrell Catalonia Catalonia is part of Spain It has its own language the Catalan language Casals was always very proud of being a Catalan

His father was the organist at the local church He gave Casals his first music lessons teaching him piano violin and organ When Casals was eleven he heard a group of travelling musicians playing music One of the instruments was the cello He had never heard one and he decided that was what he wanted to play His mother took him to Barcelona where he went to a music school the Escola Municipal de Msica There he studied the cello music theory and piano 

One day when he was 13 he was looking at some old music in a second hand music shop He found some very old music for solo cello They were the Cello Suites by Bach People in those days thought they were just a collection of studies to help cellists with their technique but Casals although only still a boy realized it was great music He spent the next 12 years practising them until he felt ready to perform them Casals discovery of these wonderful Cello Suites was the most important Bach discovery since 1829 when Mendelssohn found and performed the St Matthew Passion which the world had forgotten about

Casals showed enormous talent for the cello On 23 February 1891 when he was 14 years old he gave a solo recital in Barcelona He graduated from the Escola with honours two years later

In 1893 the Spanish composer Isaac Albniz heard him playing in a trio in a caf He gave him a letter which allowed him to be introduced to the Queen She gave him money so that he could study at the Conservatory in Madrid She then allowed him to go to Brussels to study at the Conservatory which was then the best in Europe for string instruments The cello teacher mentioned a long list of cello pieces and asked him which ones he played When Casals told him he could play them all the teacher made fun of him When Casals started playing everyone was amazed at his talent The teacher wanted him to be one of his pupils but Casals had been insulted and so he went to Paris the next day The Queen of Spain was angry with Casals when she heard what had happened and stopped sending him money

In Paris he had very little money He earned a living by playing second cello in the theatre orchestra of the Folies Marigny His mother tried to earn some money by sewing In 1896 he returned to Catalonia where he taught at a music school and played principal cellist in the orchestra of Barcelonas opera house the Liceu In 1897 he appeared as soloist with the Madrid Symphony Orchestra and was awarded the Order of Charles III from the Queen

In 1899 Casals played the Saint Sans Cello Concerto at Crystal Palace in London and later for Queen Victoria at her summer home at Cowes Isle of Wight He was becoming very famous In Paris he make a great impression on everyone especially the conductor Charles Lamoureux who had started a famous orchestra Casals went to the Netherlands the United States where he gave 80 concerts and South America He often played with the pianist Harold Bauer

On 15 January 1904 Casals was invited to play at the White House for President Theodore Roosevelt He played in the Carnegie Hall in New York playing Richard Strausss Don Quixote with the composer conducting Between 1906 and 1912 he had a relationship with a Portuguese cellist Guilhermina Suggia although they were never married In 1914 Casals married the American singer Susan Metcalfe They were separated in 1928 but did not divorce until 1957

Casals formed a trio with the pianist Alfred Cortot and the violinist Jacques Thibaud They gave many concerts and made some of the first recordings of piano trio music They played together for 30 years

In 1905 he toured Russia It was an unfortunate time because the Russian Revolution was taking place During the concert he played in Moscow gunfire could be heard outside the hall 

During the First World War Casals lived in New York In 1919 he went back to Barcelona He wanted to improve the music in his own country There were very few people who could play well so he founded his own orchestra the Orquesta Pau Casals This annual music festival continued until the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936

Casals supported the Spanish Republican government When it was defeated he said that he would not return until Spain was once more a democratic country He then left his country and went into exile He went to live in the French village of Prades which was near the border with Spain He continued his career as a cellist After World War II in June 1946 he went to England and played the cello concertos by Schumann and Elgar at the Royal Albert Hall with Sir Adrian Boult conducting Outside the hall the police had to help him get to his car because so many people were crowding round him

Casals played in many countries but refused to play in any country that was friendly with Francos government in Spain In 1945 he gave a broadcast at the BBC and spoke to his people in Catalonia He finished by playing a Catalan folksong called El Cant dels Ocells He played it at the end of all his concerts When Britain recognized Francos government Casals decided he could no long play in England He made one big exception to his decision not to visit Franco friendly countries in 1961 he took part in a concert of chamber music in the White House on 13 November where he played to President John F Kennedy whom he admired

In 1950 he continued his career as conductor and cellist at the Prades Festival in Conflent He agreed to play on condition that the money that was made at the festival would be given to a refugee hospital nearby Franco said that Spaniards were forbidden to go to the festival but many managed to cross the border on foot Many world famous musicians played at Prades Josef Szigeti Isaac Stern Rudolf Serkin and Eugene Istomin and others

He continued to lead the Prades Festivals until 1966 

When he was 80 Casals married one of his young students a girl called Marta They had met in Prades Marta was from Puerto Rico where Casals mother had come from They went to live in Puerto Rico in a house called El Pesebre In 1957 a musical festival was started there in the town of San Juan He continued to visit the festival at Prades every year until 1966 He also gave masterclasses at American schools and universities as well as in other countries Some of these were televised

Casals was also a composer One of his last compositions was the Himne a les Nacions Unides he conducted its first performance in a special concert at the United Nations on 24 October 1971 2 months before his 95th birthday 

Casals wrote an autobiography Joys and Sorrows Reflections

Casals died in 1973 in San Juan Puerto Rico at the age of 96 In 1979 his remains were taken to El Vendrell Catalonia where he had been born He did not live to see the end of the Franco dictatorial regime Later when Franco had died and Spain was a democracy once more the Spanish government under King Juan Carlos I issued a postage stamp in honour of the centenary of his birth 

In 1989 sixteen years after his death Casals was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award

No other cellist had such an influence on cello playing in the 20th century He changed the way people thought about cello technique For example when he was young violinists and cellists were taught to practise with a book under the right arm This made the bowing arm very stiff Casals taught his pupils to play with a free bowing arm Casals was a great teacher and he learned a lot about playing through his teaching He thought about fingering and bowing and showed his pupils how their left hand could be strong but also relaxed

The International Pau Casals Cello Competition is held in Germany once every four years It was started in 2000 to help young cellists to start their careers It is supported by the Pau Casals Foundation under the patronage Casals widow One of the prizes is the use of a beautiful cello which was owned by Casals

The National Football Conference is one of the two conferences of the National Football League the other being the American Football Conference Every year the winner of the NFC Championship Game receives the George Halas Trophy and gets to play against the winner of the AFC Championship Game in the Super Bowl

Each NFC team plays the other teams in their division twice in the regular season They play the team once at home and once at the other teams stadium Each team also plays 10 other games given to their schedule by the NFL in the April before Two of these games are assigned on the basis of the teams final record from the year before The other 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions This assignment shifts each year For example in the 2007 regular season each team in the NFC West played one game against each team in both the AFC North and the NFC South In this way division competition is the same opponents except for the 2 games given based on the strength of the each teams season record from the year before

At the end of each season a series of playoff games are played among the top six teams in the NFC These are the four division champions and the two other teams with the best win loss records The NFC playoffs culminate in the NFC Championship Game for the George Halas Trophy The NFC Champion plays the AFC Champion in the Super Bowl

The NFC was made after the NFL merged with the American Football League in 1970 While all of the former AFL teams along with the NFLs Cleveland Browns Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Colts made up the American Football Conference the other 13 NFL teams formed the NFC

However team owners could not agree to a plan on how to put the teams into divisions in the NFC The proposals were narrowed down to five finalists Then the plan that was selected was picked out of a glass bowl by then NFL commissioner Pete Rozelles secretary

Since the merger three expansion teams have joined the NFC This makes the current total number of teams 16 When the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the league in 1976 they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively for one season before they switched conferences The Seahawks returned to the NFC as a result of the 2002 realignment The Carolina Panthers joined the NFC in 1995

Assigning permissions means granting users extra rights within the wiki software This is done by going to the SpecialUserRights page and adding users into a group which has specific rights The first thing to note however is that this action requires special permissions itself 

 Bureaucrats 

By default you will need to be a Bureaucrat before you can access the SpecialUserRights page Other users can always contact one of the bureaucrats to request a change of permissions Find out who these people are at SpecialListUsersbureaucrat In a small wiki there might typically be only one such user or maybe two

The SpecialUserRights page allows you to set which groups a user is in A common task would be to put a user into the Sysop group This will grant the user various extra rights such as deleting pages and blocking users See HelpSysops and permissions for more details

Obviously giving a user such rights implies that you trust the user both in terms of being non malicious and also as somebody with sufficient competence in using the wiki software and in dealing with the wiki community People hoping to become sysops should read HelpSysops and permissions However it should be noted that actions of a sysop user are entirely reversible by other sysop users and so it can be a good idea to dish out these extra permissions to a number of users in order to

If you have many sysops you may start to need documented processes governing their actions eg when should a page be protected versus leaving it unprotected You may even reach the point where you need a documented procedure for deciding who gets to be a sysop and who should have their sysop rights revoked To manage all of this you may wish to promote several users into the Bureaucrat group to spread the workload managing the promotingdemoting of sysops On some large wikis users are voted in by other users before they are granted extra permissions and sysops have their rights revoked by a committee who investigate accusations of misconduct Such processes are unlikely to be necessary in anything but the largest of wiki communities

Beyond promotingdemoting of Sysops and Bureaucrats you can also allow a user to operate as a bot meaning their edits do not show up on recent changes

Threatened species are any species which might soon become extinct

The World Conservation Union are the experts on threatened species They put threatened species into three groups each group in more danger than the next 

One way scientists can work out how threatened a species is is to measure the birth and death rates If a species becomes small in numbers it can get to a critical point This happens when there are not enough individuals left alive to continue the species

Species that are not a threatened species but are still a concern can be put into groups of Near Threatened Least Concern and Conservation Dependent Conservation dependent is no longer used a group When the species has not been studied Not Evaluated or there is not enough information Data Deficient the IUCN does not put them on the threatened species list 

Threatened species are also called red listed species because they are in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species

Under the Endangered Species Act in the United States threatened means any species which is likely to become endangered in the near future in all or a large part of its range The Bay checkerspot butterfly is an example of a threatened species protected by the Endangered Species Act

The countrys leading newspaper The Philippine Daily Inquirer described PLM as a local university with a national character and reputation US Ambassador Kristie Kenney in her speech during the 40th Commencement Exercises at the PLM Grandstand praised PLM for building a culture of commitment to public service in its students faculty and alumni In an article in the Business Mirror PLM was considered as the highest symbol of Manilas public educational system which radiates another form of power and influence Websites such as Manila Board regarded that PLM is one of leading and prime public universities in the country today

On August 13 2008 Adel A Tamano in his column at the Manila Times wrote that PLM is a unique learning institution and is essentially an honors school where only the students from lower income families with excellent scholastic records are admitted

However PLM is not a perfect institution and the university had been criticized in the past for the reconsideration cases wherein some students who failed to meet the universitys standards for retention were readmitted because of the so called backers In order to resolve this issue the city government has insulated the University from political pressure so as not to compromise its status as one of the countrys leading educational institutions

The site where the PLM campus at Intramuros is situated used to be occupied by the Colegio de Manila which was founded in 1590 by Fr Antonio Sedeo SJ The Colegio de Manila formally opened in 1595 and was the first school in the Philippines

Aside from Colegio de Manila there were other structures that were built in the site Iglesia de Santa Ana the first stone church in the Philippines was built in 1590 and opened in 1596 However an earthquake destroyed it and another church was built in honor of St Ignatius of Loyola in 1626

In 1601 the Colegio de San Jos was set up as an annex of Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio Twenty years later Pope Gregory XV through the Archbishop of Manila authorized the Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio to confer degrees in theology and arts and elevated it into a university In 1623 Philip IV of Spain confirmed the authorization making the school both a pontifical and a royal university and the very first university in the Philippines and in Asia In 1722 the Colegio de San Jos was granted royal patronage 

In 1768 the Jesuits surrendered the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio to the Spanish authorities after their suppression and expulsion from Spain and its territories Later the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio was placed under secular administration and converted into a seminary and a liberal arts college In 1773 Pope Clement XIV formally declared the dissolution of the Society of Jesus In 1895 the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio merged with the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of the University of Santo Tomas The Colegio de San Jos is now the San Jos Major Seminary at the Ateneo de Manila University

The buildings of what was the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio were transformed into military headquarters called Cuartel del Rey which eventually became known as Cuartel de Espaa was placed on trial for sedition here on December 26 1896

During the American occupation part of the barracks was razed and a gymnasium was built on it In early 1930s one of first games of the NCAA was played in the 31st Infantry Quonset Gym The buildings and the whole premises served as military headquarters for the 31st Infantry of the United States Army until 1941 During World War II General Douglas McArthur held command post here but the entire area was later destroyed by the on going military conflict

In early 1960s the site was rehabilitated by the city government and a building was constructed at General Luna Street to house the students of Manila High School However on April 24 1965 the late President Diosdado Macapagal issued Proclamation 392 A giving to the proposed city university the three hectare lot being occupied by Manila High School On February 26 1967 the new complex along Victoria Street was inaugurated and the students of Manila High School was transferred there And finally on July 17 1967 the first batch of PLM scholars began its academic pursuits in the site where the very roots of the modern educational system in the Philippines may be found

The call to open a university run by the city government of Manila began during the term of Mayor Arsenio H Lacson when Ordinance No 4202 was approved by the City councilors on January 13 1960 The said ordinance allotted a total of PhP 1000000 for the construction of the university However Mayor Lacson did not however live to see the realization of this project as he died suddenly of heart attack Vice Mayor Antonio Villegas took over and continued Lacsons plan He later issued Executive Order No 7 s 1963 that created the committee that would draw up the plan of founding a university But some difficulty prevented the universitys formal creation As a result he sought the help of Congressman Justo R Albert representative of the Citys fourth congressional district Congressman Albert then sponsored House Bill No 8349 at the Philippines House of Representatives The Senate version of the bill was authored by Senators Gil Puyat and Camilo OsiasfactdateApril 2009

The two bills were eventually combined into one and it was discussed during the Fourth Session of the Fifth Congress of the Philippines on January 25 1965 The final bill was later passed by the joint Congress and signed by Senate President Ferdinand E Marcos and House Speaker Cornelio T Villareal with Mr Regino S Eustaquio Secretary of the Senate and Mr Inocencio B Pareja Secretary of the House of RepresentativesfactdateApril 2009

On June 19 1965 the final bill with the title  An Act Authorizing the City of Manila to Establish and Operate the University of the City of Manila and for Other Purposes  was signed into law by President Diosdado P Macapacal in a signing ceremony at Malacaang Palace The signing was witnessed by Atty Primitivo de Leon Mayor Villegas Congressman Ramon Mitra Jr and its main sponsor in the House of Representatives Congressman Albert The law was captioned as Republic Act No 4196 which now serves as the University CharterfactdateApril 2009

With an enrollment of 556 studentsboth men and womenPLM opened for classes on July 17 1967 All of them are housed under the University College which offered liberal arts courses After a year a Graduate Institute for Teachers was founded and it was followed by the Institute of Extramural Studies At the turn of the decade the school had expanded its offerings to include degree programs leading to specializations in communication engineering education business administration nursing

Ardipithecus is a very early hominid genus which lived during the late Neogene

Two species are known A kadabba dated to about 56 million years ago and A ramidus which lived about 44 million years ago during the early Pliocene 

Because this genus shares several traits with the African great ape genera some place it on the that branch rather than human branch 

Most consider it a proto human because of a likeness in teeth with Australopithecus Ardipithecus had bipedalism and reduced canines like the Australopithecines

Australopithecus anamensis is a fossil species of Australopithecus The first fossilized specimen of the species though not recognized as such at the time was a single arm bone found in Pliocene strata in the Kanapoi region of East Lake Turkana by a Harvard University research team in 1965 The specimen was tentatively assigned at the time to Australopithecus and dated about four million years old Little additional information was uncovered until 1987 when Canadian archaeologist Allan Morton discovered fragments of a specimen protruding from a partially eroded hillside east of Allia Bay near Lake Turkana Kenya Six years later the London born Kenyan paleoanthropologist Meave Leakey and archaeologist Alan Walker excavated the Allia Bay site and uncovered several additional fragments of the hominid including one complete lower jaw bone which closely resembles that of a common chimpanzee but whose teeth are much more similar to those of a human In 1995 Meave Leakey and her associates taking note of differences between Australopithecus afarensis and the new finds assigned them to a new species A anamensis deriving its name from the Turkana word anam meaning lake

Australopithecus bahrelghazali is a fossil hominin that was discovered in 1993 by the paleontologist Michel Brunet Brunet found the fossil in the Bahr el Ghazal valley near Koro Toro in Chad in Africa and named it Abel Abel was dated using Berylium based Radiometric dating as living about 36 million years ago

Emanuel Feuermann was a famous Austrian cellist who became a naturalized American During his short career he was thought of as the worlds greatest cellist after Pablo Casals

Feuermanns parents were amateur musicians His father started to teach him the violin but the young boy wanted to hold it between his legs like a cello so his father bought him a small cello In 1909 the family moved to Vienna so that he could learn the cello from the famous Friedrich Buxbaum the cellist of the Ros Quartet and principal cellist of the Vienna Philharmonic  Then he studied with Anton Walter at the Music Academy in Vienna In February 1914 aged twelve he played in his first concert performing Joseph Haydns Cello Concerto in D with the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Felix Weingartner 

In 1917 Feuermann went to Leipzig where he studied with Julius Klengel Klengel thought his young pupil was incredibly talented but that he did not know much great cello music Feuermann worked very hard Klengel was a good teacher for him

In 1919 Friedrich Grtzmacher died and Klengel recommended Feuermann should take his job at the Grzenich Conservatory in Cologne Although he was very young he got the job which had a very good salary but he was not given the title of professor 

During the 1920s he gave many concerts all over the world In 1929 he became professor at the Musikhochschule in BerlinHe played with famous people such as the violinists Carl Flesch Szymon Goldberg Joseph Wolfsthal and Jascha Heifetz the composer and viola player Paul Hindemith and the pianist Artur Rubinstein

On April 3 1933 with the rise of Nazism he lost his job at the Berlin Conservatory because he was Jewish He moved to London He toured Japan and the United States where he played the Haydn concerto with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Bruno Walter Some music critics were not very impressed with his playing However a few days later he gave a recital Nearly all the professional cellists in New York were there because they had heard that Feuermann was an exceptional player The audience were extremely enthusiastic and even the music critics changed their minds

In 1935 he married He moved to Zrich with his wife but happened to be in Vienna at the time of the Anschluss while his wife and young daughter were still in Zrich Bronislaw Huberman helped Feuermann and his family escape to Israel in September 1938 At the end of the year they went to the United States and applied for American citizenship

He taught at the Curtis Institute of Music and gave concerts and made recordings with other great musicians including Artur Schnabel Bronislaw Huberman and especially with the pianist Franz Rupp 

Feuermann died in 1942 of an infection after a small operation for haemorrhoids

Feuermann was one of the greatest cellists who ever lived The cello was not often heard as a solo instrument in those days but Feuermann and Pablo Casals made people change their minds Feuermann did not actually practise very much on his own but when he was making music with other people he worked very hard at all the detail He loved teaching He also loved fast cars His family were very important indeed to him

Many believe that Feuermanns interpretation of Antonn Dvoks Cello Concerto and his performance of Johannes Brahmss Double Concerto with Jascha Heifetz are among the best ever

In Greek mythology Pandora was the first mortal woman According to Hesiod each god helped create her by giving her unique gifts Zeus ordered Hephaestus to mould her out of Earth This was part of the punishment of mankind because Prometheus had stolen the secret of fire All the gods helped by giving her seductive gifts Another name was found for her was Anesidora she who sends gifts This name was found inscribed against her figure on a white ground kylix in the British Museum

According to the myth Pandora opened a jar and released all the evils of mankind With the exception of plagues and diseases Hesiod does not specify the evils in detail When Pandora closed the jar again only Hope was left inside The word pithos has been translated the wrong way which may have led to the idea of Pandoras box Pandora opened the jar because she was curious what was inside and not because of malice

The myth of Pandora is ancient and there are several different Greek versions It has been interpreted in different ways In the literary versions the myth is a kind of theodicy it addresses the question why there is evil in the world The oldest versiion is that of Hesiod who wrote it in the 7th century BC He shortly mentions it in his Theogony in line 570 but does not name Pandora In his Works and Days he gives the oldest known literary version of the story There is an older story that tells that urns and jars can contain blessings and evils which is told in Homers Illiad The immortals know no care yet the lot they spin for man is full of sorrow on the floor of Zeus palace there stand two urns the one filled with evil gifts and the other with good ones He for whom Zeus the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends will meet now with good and now with evil fortune but he to whom Zeus sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world and he will go up and down the face of the earth respected neither by gods nor men

The Pandora myth first appears in lines 560612 of Hesiods poem the Theogony This version does not give the woman a name Prometheus has stolen the gift of fire and has given it to the humans Zeus is angry about this and decides to punish men as a compensation for the gift He commands Hephaestus to make the first woman from earth This woman is described as a beautiful evil whose descendants would torment the race of men After Hephaestus does so Athena dressed her in a silvery gown an embroidered veil garlands and a crown of gold This woman is unnamed in the Theogony but is probably Pandora Hesiod rewrote her myth in Works and Days When she first appears before gods and mortals wonder seized them as they looked upon her But she was sheer guile not to be withstood by men Hesiod elaborates

 From her is the race of women and female kind of her is the deadly race and tribe of women who live amongst mortal men to their great trouble no helpmates in hateful poverty but only in wealth

Later Hesiod tells that men who try to avoid the evil of women by avoiding marriage will fare no better He reaches deadly old age without anyone to tend his years and though he at least has no lack of livelihood while he lives yet when he is dead his kinsfolk divide his possessions amongst them

At the end Hesiod says that occasionally a man finds a good wife but still evil contends with good

The more famous version of the myth comes from another of Hesiods works called Works and Days There the myth is contained in lines 60 to 105 Hesiod tells about Pandoras origin He also makes the scope of the misery she inflicts on mankind bigger As before she is created by Hephaestus but now more gods help completing her Athena taught her needlework and weaving Aphrodite shed grace upon her head and cruel longing and cares that weary the limbs Hermes gave her a shameful mind and deceitful nature Hermes also gave her the power of speech putting in her lies and crafty words Athena then clothed her next she Persuasion and the Charites adorned her with necklaces and other finery the Horae adorned her with a garland crown Finally Hermes gives this woman a name Pandora All gifted because all the Olympians gave her a gift The story is written in such a way that Pandoras feminine and deceitful nature is a small problem for mankind because she brings a pithos This word is usually translated as jar sometimes as a box The box contains burdensome toil and sickness that brings death to men diseases and a myriad other pains 

Prometheus had warned his brother Epimetheus not to accept any gifts from Zeus But Epimetheus did not listen he accepted Pandora who promptly scattered the contents of her jar As a result Hesiod tells us the earth and sea are full of evils One item however did not escape the jar hope Only Hope was left within her unbreakable house she remained under the lip of the jar and did not fly away Before she could Pandora replaced the lid of the jar This was the will of aegis bearing Zeus the Cloudgatherer

He does not tell the reader why hope remained in the jar

Hesiod closes with this moral Thus it is not possible to escape the mind of Zeus

Archaic and Classic Greek literature do not mention Pandora any more Sophocles wrote a satyr play Pandora or The Hammerers but very little is known of this play Sappho may have made reference to Pandora in a surviving fragment

Later people filled in small details or they added postscripts to Hesiods story Examples for this are Apollodorus and Hyginus Each of them added a part to the story that might have already been in Hesiods version even though it was not written down Epimetheus married Pandora They each add that they had a daughter Pyrrha who married Deucalion and survived the deluge with him The problem of that version is that Hesiods Catalogue of Women fragment 2 had made a Pandora one of the daughters of Deucalion and the mother of Graecus by Zeus 

In the 15th century a monk named Annio da Viterbo said he had found a manuscript of a historian named Berossus Berossus had lived in the 3rd century BC According to the manuscript Pandora was also named as a daughter in law of Noah This attempt to join pagan and Christian texts was later recognised as a forgery though 

The poet Theognis of Megara who lived in the 6th century BC had a different view Hope is the only good god remaining among mankind the others have left and gone to Olympus Trust a mighty god has gone Restraint has gone from men and the Graces my friend have abandoned the earth Mens judicial oaths are no longer to be trusted nor does anyone revere the immortal gods the race of pious men has perished and men no longer recognize the rules of conduct or acts of piety

Theogonis seems to be referring to a different version of the myth In that version the jar contained blessings rather than evils This version seems to follow a tradition before Hesiod which was preserved by 2nd century writer Babrius According to Babrius the gods sent a jar containing blessings to humans A foolish man opened the jar and most of the blessings were lost forever Only hope remained to promise each of us the good things that fled

Attic red figure painters seem to have had a tradition which was independent of the literary sources Sometimes they add to the literary version sometimes they ignore it altogether 

There are many ways in which the figure of Pandora can be interpreted Erwin Panofsky wrote a monography on the subject According to M L West the story of Pandora and the jar is older than Hesiods versions This also explains the confusion and problems of Hesiods version and that it is inconclusive According to West Pandoora was married to Prometheus in these versions West cites Hesiods Catalogue of Women which preserved the older version In one version of the story the jar may have contained only good things for mankind West also writes that it may have been that Epimetheus and Pandora and their roles were transposed in the pre Hesiodic myths This is called a mythic inversion He remarks that there is a curious correlation between Pandora being made out of earth in Hesiods story to what is in Apollodorus that Prometheus created man from water and earth Hesiods myth of Pandoras jar then could be an summary of many different early myths

There are different questions that need to be discussed The Greek original text speaks about elpis Usually this word is translated into English as Hope but it could be translated differently Expectation is another possible translation which is more neutral One can expect good things as well as bad things Hope has a positive connotation

Elpis is everything that remains in the jar when Pandora closed it again so does the jar give elpis to mankind or does it keep elpis away from it Another question to ask is wheter elpis remaining in the jar a good thing or a bad one for mankind

The first question might confuse the non specialist But as with most ancient Greek words elpis can be translated a number of ways A number of scholars prefer the neutral translation of expectation But expectation of what Classical authors use the word elpis to mean expectation of bad as well as expectation of good Statistical analysis demonstrates that the latter sense appears five times more than the former in all of ancient Greek literature Others hold the minority view that elpis should be rendered expectation of evil

How one answers the first question largely depends on the answer to the second question should we interpret the jar to function as a prison or a pantry The jar certainly serves as a prison for the evils that Pandora released they only affect mankind once outside the jar Some have argued that logic dictates therefore that the jar acts as a prison for Elpis as well withholding it from men If one takes elpis to mean expectant hope then the myths tone is pessimistic All the evils in the world were scattered from Pandoras jar while the one potentially mitigating force Hope remains locked securely inside

This interpretation raises yet another question complicating the debate are we to take Hope in an absolute sense or in a narrow sense where we understand Hope to mean hope only as it pertains to the evils released from the jar If Hope is imprisoned in the jar does this mean that human existence is utterly hopeless This is the most pessimistic reading possible for the myth A less pessimistic interpretation understands the myth to say countless evils fled Pandoras jar and plague human existence the hope that we might be able to master these evils remains imprisoned inside the jar Life is not hopeless but each of us is hopelessly human

It is also argued that hope was simply one of the evils in the jar the false kind of hope and was no good for mankind since later in the poem Hesiod writes that hope is empty and no good and makes mankind lazy by taking away his industriousness making him prone to evil

In Human All Too Human philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche argued that Zeus did not want man to throw his life away no matter how much the other evils might torment him but rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew To that end he gives man hope In truth it is the most evil of evils because it prolongs mans torment

An objection to the hope is goodthe jar is a prison interpretation counters that if the jar is full of evils then what is expectant hope a blessing doing among them This objection leads some to render elpis as the expectation of evil which would make the myths tone somewhat optimistic although humankind is troubled by all the evils in the world at least we are spared the continual expectation of evil which would make life unbearable

The optimistic reading of the myth is expressed by M L West Elpis takes the more common meaning of expectant hope And while the jar served as a prison for the evils that escaped it thereafter serves as a residence for Hope West explains It would be absurd to represent either the presence of ills by their confinement in a jar or the presence of hope by its escape from one Hope is thus preserved as a benefit for humans

An incorrect etymology of Pandoras name all gifted was provided in Works and Days Pandora means all giving but not all gifted Some paintings in vases from the fifth century before Christ indicate that the beliefs about the goddess Pandora lasted after the time of Hesiod Another name of Pandora was found in a kylix Anesidora that means she who sends up gifts This vase painting depicts Hephaestus and Athenae finishing the touches on the first woman like in the Theogony The epithet anesidora is also used to name Gaia or Demeter

PandoraAnesidora possibly would have taken on aspects of Gaea and Demeter Pandora would incarnate the fertility of the Earth and its capacity to bear grain and fruits for the benefit of the Humans Over time this all giving goddess somehow devolved into an all gifted mortal woman T A Sinclair commenting on Works and Days argues that Hesiod shows no awareness of the mythology of such a divine giver AH Smith however notes that in Hesiods account Athena and the Seasons brought wreaths of grass and spring flowers to Pandora indicating that Hesiod was conscious of Pandoras original all giving function Jane Ellen Harrison sees in Hesiods story evidence of a shift from matriarchy to patriarchy in Greek culture As the life bringing goddess Pandora is eclipsed the death bringing human Pandora arises Thus Harrison concludes in the patriarchal mythology of Hesiod her great figure is strangely changed and diminished She is no longer Earth Born but the creature the handiwork of Olympian Zeus Robert Graves quoting Harrison asserts of the Hesiodic episode that Pandora is not a genuine myth but an anti feminist fable probably of his own invention HJRose wrote that the myth of Pandora is decidedly more illiberal than that of epic in that it makes Pandora the origin of all of Mans woes with her being the exemplification of the bad wife

The Hesiodic myth did not however completely obliterate the memory of the all giving goddess Pandora A scholium to line 971 of Aristophanes The Birds mentions a cult to Pandora the earth because she bestows all things necessary for life

In fifth century Athens Pandora made a prominent appearance in what at first appears an unexpected context in a marble relief or bronze appliqus as a frieze along the base of the Athena Parthenos the culminating experience on the Acropolis there Jeffrey M Hurwit has interpreted her presence as an anti Athena reinforcing civic ideologies of patriarchy and the highly gendered social and political realities of fifth century Athens Interpretation has never come easy Pausanias merely noted the subject and moved on Jeffrey Hurwit has argued that Pandora represents an anti Athena similarly a child of no mother an embodiment of the need for the patriarchal rule that the virginal Athena rising above her sex defended

The humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam translated Hesiod from Greek to Latin in the 16th century The Greek word pithos is used for a large jar used for example for storing wine It can also refer to a funerary jar Pyxis on the other hand is a box Usually it is said that Erasmus swapped the words when he translated so Pandoras jar became Pandoras box The phrase Pandoras box has endured ever since FilePithos Louvre CA4523jpgA pithos from Crete ca 675 BC Louvre FileWedding procession BM GR192012 211jpgAn Attic pyxis 440430 BC British Museum

Quicksand is a mixture of water and sand or silt It has the characteristic of thixotropy it looks solid but when pressure is applied it liqifies If animals of people stand on it they sink into it If the sand is deep they may drown

Water circulation underground can focus in an area with just the right mixture of fine sands and other materials such as clay The water moves up and then down slowly in a convection like manner throughout a column of sand and the sand remains a generally solid mass This lubricates the sand particles and makes them unable to support any significant weight since they move around with very little friction They behave more like a liquid when exposed to stress Since the water does not usually go all the way up through the sand the sand above does not appear to move at all and can support leaves and other small debris This makes it difficult to distinguish quicksand from the surrounding environment

Quicksand is a non Newtonian fluid when undisturbed it often seems to be solid but a small change in the stress on the quicksand causes it to turn liquid There is a sudden decrease in its viscosity Under his weight the person then sinks into the sol

Someone stepping in it starts to sink Around the person dense regions of sand and sediment form and grip the person The viscosity of the quicksand seems to increase suddenly It is now a gel In order to move within the quicksand a person or object must apply sufficient pressure on the compacted sand to re introduce enough water to liquify it The forces required to do this are quite large to remove a foot from quicksand at a speed of one centimeter per second would require the same amount of force as that needed to lift a medium sized car

It was commonly believed that the behavior of quicksand was due solely to saturated or supersaturated suspensions of granules in water Pressure from underground sources of water would separate and suspend the granular particles reducing the friction between them As of September 2005 it has been shown that the presence of salt is important One finding was that a human cannot be drawn into a saltwater quicksand entirely The stability of the colloidal quicksand is compromised by the presence of salt increasing the likelihood of sand flocculation and the formation of the high viscosity regions of sediment responsible for quicksands trapping power

Quicksand may be found inland or near the coast

One region notorious for its quicksands is Morecambe Bay Yorkshire As the bay is very broad and shallow a person trapped by the quicksand would be exposed to the danger of the returning tide which can come in rapidly

A military organization is a way of making up the armed forces of a state as a need to offer military capability as needed by a national defence policy In some countries paramilitary forces are included in a nations armed forces Armed forces that are not a part of the military or paramilitary organizations such as insurgent forces often mimic military organizations or use ad hoc structures

The SS Verfgungstruppe were combat divisions of the SS trained to the same way as the normal German Armed Forces They were the precursor of the later developed Waffen SS 

On 24 September 1934 a special SS military unit was made up by a group of a few other Nazi and paramilitary units like units known as SS Special Detachments and the broken wikt linkheadquartersHeadquarters Guard known as the units The new group was to be trained as combat ready infantry The unit was called SS Special Purpose Troops and was not the police or the Armed Forces but military trained men for the use by the Fhrer in war or peace The SS Verfgungstruppe was told to the public on 16 March 1935 The SS VT trained with Hitlers body guards some of which later joined the SS VT prior to the invasion of Russia in 1941

Some units of the SS VT worked with the Wehrmacht during the take over of the Sudetenland Austria and Czechoslovakia and took part in the invasion of Poland along with the campaign against the Allies in the West From the regiments that made up the SS VT came the Waffen SS Divisions that fought in all German theaters in World War II Units making up the SS VT were not known as the Waffen SS until a speech by Adolf Hitler in July 1940

In 1939 the whole SS was split into two groups the Allgemeine SS and the Waffen SS

The Waffen SS was made up of three smaller groups

In 1941 the commander of the SS Heinrich Himmler said that more Waffen SS Verfgungstruppe units would be made from non German foreign nationals The goal was to get more soldiers from occupied nations Some of these foreign units included volunteers from Belgium Denmark Finland France Norway and the Netherlands

Countries like Spain officially a neutral state had by the end of the war given many volunteers to the Waffen SS that took part in combat until the end of the European war in Berlin This and many other volunteers of non German background were believers in the German cause

A detachment is a military unit It can be broken off from a bigger unit for a set reason or can be a permanent unit smaller than a battalion The term is often used to refer to a unit that is sent to a different base from the parent unit 

A Cadet detachment usually consists of between 10 and 40 cadets Several detachments make up a cadet company

A battalion is a military unit of around 500 1500 men often made up of from two to seven companies and often commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel More that one battalions are often make up a regiment or a brigade

A battalion is often the smallest military unit able to do movement on their own without being part of a larger unit The battalion is often part of a regiment group or a brigade 

Important people in a battalion headquarters include

Kenyanthropus platyops is an extinct hominid species discovered in Lake Turkana Kenya in 1999 It was by Justus Erus who was part of Meave Leakeys team 

The fossil 35 to 32 million year old It has a broad flat face with a toe bone that suggests it probably walked upright Teeth are intermediate between typical human and typical ape forms

Leakey proposed that the fossil represents an entirely new hominine genus Others classify it as a separate species of Australopithecus Australopithecus platyops and still others interpret it as an individual of Australopithecus afarensis

if some paleoanthropologists are correct Kenyanthropus may not even represent a valid taxon The specimen is so distorted by matrix filled cracks that meaningful morphological characteristics are next to impossible to assess with confidence

Combot is a character made for the Tekken series Its first and only appearance was in Tekken 4

Combot is Mokujins replacement in Tekken 4 Combot didnt mimic a different chracter every round like Mokujin instead it changed fighting styles every match

Combot is a humanoid robot Lee entered it in the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 and he used it so he could win He entered the tournament himself disguising himself as a man named Violet

Combot is not like any other humanoid robot A powerful AI function lets it mimic any human motion it can see With this ability Combot can do any job from childcare housekeeping service industries and even military duty 

This Combot is a unique version made for fighting The making of Combot was very rushed so that it could be finished in time for The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 

Lee Chaolans plan was to have Combot memorize different of fighting styles as it went through the tournament Lee was trying to create the most powerful fighting robot in the world and win the Mishima Zaibatsu at the same time 

Sadly the development team did not have enough time to get rid of Combots problems As a result a few bugs remained in its memory when the Tournament started These bugs stop Combot from mimicking more than one persons moves each time it starts up 

The Lady of the Lake is a character of Arthurian legend Different writers give her different names Her roles include giving King Arthur his sword Excalibur taking Arthur to Camelot after the Battle of Camlann raising Lancelot after the death of his father and of enchanting Merlin She is called Nimue Viviane Elaine Niniane Nyneve or Nimueh amongst others

A disk buffer is a small amount of memory on a hard drive Sometimes it is also called cache buffer or disk cache but these words should not be used a disk buffer is not a cache In early 2009 hard disks have between 8 and 32 megabytes of such memory

When writing data to the disk the data needs to be written to a certain position on the disk This is done by a component called disk readwrite head This head needs to be moved to the correct track After some settling time the read head begins to pick up bits Usually the first sectors to be read are not the ones that have been requested by the operating system The disks embedded computer typically saves these unrequested sectors in the disk buffer in case the operating system requests them later This leads to the next section which indicates that the cake contrary to popular belief is not in fact a lie It is in fact currently residing in southern morroco in a burnt out shanty town

The disk is attached to the computer by what is called an IO interface This interface almost always works at a different speed than that of the hard disk platter In such a case the disk buffer is used to store the data that comes from the disk before it sent to the computer or to store the data that comes from the computer before it can be written to the disk

Modern disks often have a feature called command queuing This means that many commands can be sent at the same time and the hard disk will put them into the best order To store the commands and re order them the hard disk needs the disk buffer

The gavotte was a folk dance performed by the peasants in the Brittany region of France Later it was popular in French and English courts in the 17th and 18th centuries It was especially popular in the French courts of King Louis XIV 

The music for a gavotte has a four beat feel with upbeats on beats three and four To dance a gavotte the dancers must cross their feet twice in each step pattern with each step followed by a hop Singers often provided the accompaniment though dancers might also be accompanied by an ensemble of such instruments as a violin a drum bagpipes or shawm a forerunner of the modern oboe

The gavotte later became a musical rather than a dance piece In the Baroque period gavottes were mainly found in binary form When composers began writing suites six short dance based pieces the gavotte usually was played between the sarabande and the gigue The best known examples of the gavotte are found in the suites and partitas written by JSBach

EJB QL or EJB QL is a portable database query language for Enterprise Java Beans It can run on any database It is used in J2EE applications It is more complex but less powerful than SQL

The language has been inspired by the native Hibernate Query Language HQL

EJB QL is a database query language similar like SQL The used queries are somewhat different from relational SQL It uses a so called abstract schema of the enterprise beans not the relational model In other words EJB QL queries do not use tables and their components They use enterprise beans their persistent state and their relationships The result of an SQL query is a set of rows with a fixed number of columns The result of an EJB QL query is either a single object a collection of entity objects of a given type or a collection of values retrieved from CMP fields One has to understand the data model of enterprise beans in order to write effective queries 

Enterprise Java Beans is a framework that allows to develop Enterprise applications more easily using Java Enterprise Edition It does this by using standard components Such components are necessary to specify how an application works This is usually called business logic

There are different kinds of Beans

In astronomy a habitable zone is a region of space where conditions are best for life to form as it is found on Earth There are two regions that must be favorable one within a solar system and the other within the galaxy Planets and moons in these areas are the most likely to have extraterrestrial life

The area in a solar system where life is most likely is called the circumstellar habitable zone The places in a galaxy where life is most likely is called the galactic habitable zone The habitable zone may also be called the life zone comfort zone green belt or Goldilocks Zone 

In a solar system astronomers believe a planet must be in the habitable zone to have life The circumstellar habitable zone is an area around a star where a planet would be able to have liquid water Liquid water is believed to be necessary for all forms of life 

Bigger stars are generally hotter so the circumstellar habitable zone would be farther away from the star than for the Sun Smaller stars are cooler so the circumstellar habitable zone would be closer to the star than for the Sun The size and brightness of a star determine where the circumstellar habitable zone is found around the star

A solar system must also be located in an ideal place inside a galaxy for life to form This idea is called the galactic habitable zone To have life the solar system must be close enough to the center of the galaxy to have the right elements to support life Areas far away from the center of the galaxy do not have enough heavy elements for life to form However the solar system cannot be too close to the center of the galaxy The center of the galaxy has higher levels of radiation which would prevent life from forming 

Ernst Julius Rhm was a leader and co founder of the German Sturmabteilung the Stormtroopers He also was a member of the German Reichstag where he was a minister from 1933 to 1934 He was murdered during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934 Adolf Hitler gave the order to murder Rhm During the First World War he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class 

Hitler had known of his homosexuality since 1919 and this probably was one of the reasons that Rhm was murdered

Ernst Rhm was born in Munich on 28 November 1887 He was the third child of a chief train inspector Julius Rhm and his wife Emilie Rhm He had one older brother and one older sister His sisters son was Bernhard Lippert a German diplomat

In 1906 after his Abitur in Munich Rhm joined the Bavarian army as a Fanjunkare Two years later he became a Lieutenant

In 1914 at the beginning of the First World War he was an adjutant and fought on the Western Front He was wounded three times and was awarded the Iron Cross First Class He was badly hurt in that year and lost a piece of his nasal bone He worked for the Bavarian government in the War Department for the first time Two years later in 1918 he was given the rank of a captain 

After the First World War Rhm went to the Freikorps of Franz Ritter von Epp He wanted to fight against the Communists in Munich With this group he went to fight against the Bavarian Soviet Republic In July 1919 the Freikorps became part of the Reichswehr

In 1919 Rhm joined the German Workers Party This was the precursor of the Nazi party One year later he became a member of the German Nazi Party He received the membership number 623 Rhm helped Hitler establish relationships with the Bavarian politicans and the industrialists Two years later Rhm and Hitler started the Sturmabteilung attracting many men from the Freikorps It was founded as a paramilitary group for the German Nazi Party Hitler made Rhm the leader of the SA

Rhm took a part in the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 The Nazi Party tried to overthrow the government but failed Rhm was arrested and charged with high treason The judges decided he was guilty on 1 April 1924 Rhm went to prison for five months and lost his job in the army Following the court trial both the Nazi Party and the Sturmabteilung became illegal 

In 1924 Rhm helped start the Frontbann an alternative to the Sturmabteilung After an argument with Adolf Hitler Rhm retired as leader of the SA He said that he was only a soldier and not a politician Between 1928 and 1930 he worked for the Bolivian military as an advisor

On 1 November 1930 he went back to Germany and joined the Nazi Party a second time In January 1931 Adolf Hitler placed Rhm in charge of the Sturmabteilung In just over a year he expanded it from 70000 to 170000 members In April 1932 Chancellor Heinrich Brning banned the SA again Franz von Papen who was chancellor after Heinrich Brning annulled the ban in June In 1933 Ernst Rhm became a Reichsminister a minister of the Reichstag In 1934 the SA had over 4500000 members The power of the SA increased Because of this Adolf Hitler and the Schutzstaffel started a new dispute with Rhm The SA was about 20 times greater in membership than the Reichswehr Rhm was dreaming to take over the Reichswehr

Hitler was afraid of Rhms power Rhm wanted to merge the Sturmabteilung with the general army with him as leader He also wanted a second Nazi revolution to make Germany more socialist He was an anticapitalist and at this time Hitler was trying to befriend Germanys industrialists Hitler planned to kill Rhm

Rhm arranged with Hitler that the Sturmabteilung would get four weeks holiday during the summer of 1934 The holiday started on 1 July 1934 Rhm wanted to go to Bad Wiessee for rest On 29 June 1934 Rhm was arrested yet had no trial He was given the choice by Theodor Eicke to commit suicide or be killed On 1 July Theodor Eicke shot Rhm as instructed by Hitler Rhm was buried in the Munich western cemetery

Many Sturmabteilung leaders were killed on that same night It was called the Night of the Long Knives The next day the German parliament passed a law with only one paragraph making the murders at the Night of the Long Knives legal

Rhm is well known in Germany and by historians for his homosexuality He wrote three letters in Bolivia to a German doctor where he wrote about his homosexuality Rhm said that he discovered his homosexuality first in 1924 In the mid 1920s he started to communicate with the gay community in Berlin and Munich Hitler knew of Rhms homosexuality for many years but said he had heard it for the first time in 1934 Hitler lied because homosexuality was against the ideology of the Nazi party

A feud is a long running argument or fight between parties In most cases it involves whole familles or clans People are seen as guilty not because they did something but because they were seen with other people This is called guilt by association 

Feuds start because one party thinks they were attacked insulted or otherwise harmed by the other party Intense feelings of resentment trigger the initial revenge which causes the other party to feel the same way The dispute is then fueled by a long running cycle of retaliatory violence This ongoing cycle of provocation and retaliation makes it very difficult to end the feud peacefully Feuds frequently involve the original parties family members andor associates They can last for generations 

Up to the early modern period feuds were considered legitimate legal instruments The state or ruler even made laws for certain aspects of feuds Once modern centralizing states asserted and enforced a monopoly on legitimate use of force feuds became illegal and the concept acquired its current negative connotation

A blood feud is a feud with a cycle of retaliatory violence with the relatives of someone who has been killed or otherwise wronged or dishonored The wronged person then wants vengeance and kills the culprits or punishes them in other ways If he cannot get the culprits he does this to their relatives Historically the word vendetta has been used to mean a blood feud The word is Italian and originates from the Latin vindicta vengeance In modern times the word also means any other long standing feud not necessarily involving bloodshed

Originally a vendetta was a blood feud between two families Kinsmen of the victim wanted to take revenge for his or her death by killing either those responsible for the killing or some of their relatives Usually the closest male relative of the person killed or wronged maintains the vendetta but other members of the family may do so as well If the culprit had disappeared or was already dead the vengeance could extend to other relatives

Vendetta is typical of societies with a weak rule of law or in those where the state does not consider itself responsible for helping with this kind of dispute In such societies family and kinship ties are the main source of authority An entire family is considered responsible for whatever one of them has done Sometimes even two separate branches of the same family could come to blows over some matter 

Today the practice of vendetta has almost disappeared in societies where law enforcement works There criminal law punishes lawbreakers 

In ancient Homeric Greece the practice of personal vengeance against wrongdoers was considered natural and customary Embedded in the Greek morality of retaliation is the right of vendetta  Vendetta is a war just as war is an indefinite series of vendettas and such acts of vengeance are sanctioned by the gods

The Ancient Hebrew tribes considered it to be the duty of the individual and family to avenge evil in Gods name The person who put the initial aggressive killer to death was given a special name goel haddam the blood avenger or blood redeemer Six cities of refuge were made to provide a cooling off phase as well as due process for the accused As the Oxford Companion to the Bible states Since life was viewed as sacred no amount of blood money could be given as recompense for the loss of the life of an innocent person it had to be life for life

According to medievalist Marc Bloch The Middle Ages from beginning to end and particularly the feudal era lived under the sign of private vengeance The onus of course lay above all on the wronged individual vengeance was imposed on him as the most sacred of duties The solitary individual however could do but little Moreover it was most commonly a death that had to be avenged In this case the family group went into action and the faide came into being to use the old Germanic word which spread little by little through the whole of Europe the vengeance of the kinsmen which we call faida as a German canonist expressed it No moral obligation seemed more sacred than this The whole kindred therefore placed as a rule under the command of a chieftain took up arms to punish the murder of one of its members or merely a wrong that he had suffered

The Celtic phenomenon of the blood feud demanded an eye for an eye and usually descended into murder Disagreements between clans might last for generations in Scotland and Ireland Due to the Celtic heritage of many whites living in Appalachia a series of prolonged violent engagements in late nineteenth century Kentucky and West Virginia were referred to commonly as feuds a tendency that was partly due to the nineteenth century popularity of William Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott authors who both wrote semihistorical accounts of blood feuds These incidents the most famous of which was the Hatfield McCoy feud were regularly featured in the newspapers of the eastern US between the 1880s and the early twentieth century Although they were interpreted as such at the time there is little reason to believe that these American incidents had any correlation to feuding in Europe centuries earlier

Chariot racing in the Byzantine Empire also included the racing clubs The Blues and the Greens were more than simply sports teams They gained influence in military political and theological matters The Blue Green rivalry often erupted into gang warfare and street violence had been on the rise in the reign of Justin I Riots culminated in the Nika riots of 532 AD during the reign of Justinian I with nearly half the city being burned or destroyed and tens of thousands of people killed 

The Central Asian plateau at the time of Genghis Khans youth was divided into several nomadic tribes or confederationsamong them Naimans Merkits Uyghurs Tatars Mongols and Keraitsthat were all prominent in their own right and often unfriendly toward each other as evidenced by frequent raids revenges and plundering

In Japans feudal past the Samurai class upheld the honor of their family clan or their lord by katakiuchi or revenge killings These killings could also involve the relatives of an offender While some vendettas were punished by the government such as that of the 47 Ronin others were given official permission with specific targets

At the Holy Roman Empires Reichstag at Worms in 1495 the right of waging feuds was abolished The Imperial Reform proclaimed an eternal public peace to put an end to the abounding feuds and the anarchy of the robber barons and it defined a new standing imperial army to enforce that peace However it took a few more decades until the new regulation was universally accepted In 1506 for example knight Jan Kopidlansky killed somebody in Prague and the Town Councillors sentenced him to death and had him executed Brother Jiri Kopidlansky revenged himself by continuing atrocities 

More than a third of the Yanomam males on average died from warfare The accounts of missionaries to the area have recounted constant infighting in the tribes for women or prestige and evidence of continuous warfare for the enslavement of neighboring tribes such as the Macu before the arrival of European settlers and government

The Clan Gordon was at one point one of the most powerful clans in middle Scotland Clan feuds and battles were frequent especially with the Clan Cameron Clan Murray Clan Forbes and the Chattan Confederation

In Corsica vendetta was a social code that required Corsicans to kill anyone who wronged the family honor It has been estimated that between 1683 and 1715 nearly 30000 out of 120000 Corsicans lost their lives to vendetta 

Throughout history the Maniotsone of Greeces toughest populationshave been known by their neighbors and their enemies as fearless warriors who practice blood feuds Some vendettas went on for months and sometimes years The families involved would lock themselves in their towers and when they got the chance would murder members of the opposing family 

The Basque Country in the Late Middle Ages was ravaged by bitter partisan wars between local ruling families In Navarre these conflicts became polarised in a violent struggle between the Agramont and Beaumont parties In Biscay the two major warring factions were named Oinaz and Gamboa High defensive structures built by local noble families few of which survive today were frequently razed by fires sometimes by royal decree

Leontiy Lyulye an expert on conditions in the Caucasus wrote in the mid 19th century Among the mountain people the blood feud is not an uncontrollable permanent feeling such as the vendetta is among the Corsicans It is more like an obligation imposed by the public opinion In the Dagestani aul Kadar one such blood feud between two antagonistic clans lasted for nearly 260 years from the 17th century till the 1860s

An alternative to feud was blood money which demanded payment of some kind from those responsible for a wrongful death If these payments were not made or were refused by the offended party a blood feud would ensue

Vendetta is reputedly still practiced in some areas in France and Italy in Crete among Kurdish clans in Iraq and Turkey in northern Albania among Pashtuns in Afghanistan among Somali clans over land in Nigeria in India between rival tribes in the north east Indian state of Assam among rival clans in China and Philippines among the Arab Bedouins and Arab tribes inhabiting the mountains of Yemen and between Shiites and Sunnis in Iraq in southern Ethiopia among the highland tribes of New Guinea in Svaneti in the mountainous areas of Dagestan many northern areas of Georgia and Azerbaijan a number of republics of the northern Caucasus and essentially among Chechen teips where those seeking retribution do not accept or respect the local law enforcement authority Vendettas are generally abetted by a perceived or actual indifference on behalf of local law enforcement 

In Albania the blood feud has returned in rural areas after more than 40 years of being abolished by Albanian communists led by Enver Hoxha More than 5500 Albanian families are currently engaged in blood feuds There are now more than 20000 men and boys who live under an ever present death sentence because of blood feuds Since 1992 at least 10000 Albanians have been killed due to blood feuds

Mutual vendetta may develop into a vicious circle of further killings retaliation counterattacks and all out warfare that can end in the mutual extinction of both families Often the original cause is forgotten and feuds continue simply because it is perceived that there has always been a feud 

There is a scene in The Godfather in which Michael Corleone hiding from US police in Sicily walks through a village with his two bodyguards Michael asks Where are all the men The bodyguard replies Theyre all dead from vendettas

Some of the gang wars between organized crime groups are effectively forms of vendetta where the criminal organization has taken the place of blood relatives

Radio frequency identification is a technology to electronically record the presence of an object using radio signals It is used for inventory control or timing sporting events RFID is not a replacement for the barcoding but a complement for distant reading of codes The technology is used for automatically identifying a person a package or an item To do this it relies on RFID tags These are small transponders that will transmit identity information over a short distance when asked The other piece to make use of RFID tags is an RFID tag reader 

An RFID tag is an object that can be applied to or incorporated into a product animal or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves Some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader Most tags carry a plain text inscription and a barcode as complements for direct reading and for cases of any failure of radio frequency electronics

Most RFID tags contain at least two parts One is an integrated circuit for storing and processing information modulating and de modulating a radio frequency signal and other specialized functions The second is an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal

There are generally two types of RFID tags active RFID tags which contain a battery and passive RFID tags which have no battery

RFID systems are used for the following

Afterward 50 people had died from flooding by Opal in Guatemala and Mexico with another 13 deaths in the United States directly or indirectly related to Opal Preliminary damage estimates were 3 billion

The beginning of this storm started from a tropical wave that moved off of Africa on September 11 It disappeared into a low pressure while in the Caribbean Sea several days later The wave was found again on September 27 and was good enough to become Tropical Depression Eighteen Tropical Depression Eighteen made landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula shortly afterword On September 30 Tropical Depression Eighteen strengthened into Tropical Storm Opal Tropical Storm Opal continued west until October 2 On October 2 it turned northeast and strengthened into Hurricane Opal After that Hurricane Opal strengthened fast and reached its top winds of 150 mph on October 4 only two days after becoming a hurricane Hurricane Opal continued northeast and weakened a little and made its last landfall in Santa Rosa Island Florida on October 4 while a category 3 hurricane Hurricane Opal did not weaken to a tropical storm till it was in Tennessee Tropical Storm Opal weakened into a depression while it was over Ohio Tropical Depression Opal became extratropical over Canada and died on October 6

He was born in Lauenburg in Pomerania in the old German Empire on 1 March 1899 His family did not have very much money during his childhood His father was often out of work When his father died on April 17 1911 in Dortmund he was employed as an insurance clerk His fathers lack of success was partly because he was the brother of Emil von Zalewski the leader of a colonial force fighting in Tanzania On August 17 1891 he and his men were killed in the battle of Rugarto described as being like a German Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn This death and defeat brought great shame to the family Erich would later restore his familys position in the community

After his fathers death his uncle Oskar von Zalewski a soldier became very close to Erich and told Erich to become a soldier In November 1914 Erich von Zalewski asked to join the Prussian army and was one of the youngest soldiers and remained a soldier fighting for the army until the end of World War I He was wounded twice and was given the Cross of Honor and then Iron Cross

After the war he stayed in the army and fought in the Silesian Uprisings where he earned a reputation for courage He was given more medals In 1924 he joined Grenzschutz On October 23 1925 he changed changed his last name to von dem Bach Zalewski 

He left the Grenzschutz in 1930 when he joined the Nazi Party becoming a member of the SS in 1931 He was quickly promoted and by the end of 1933 had reached the rank of SS Brigadefhrer However he quarreled with his staff officer Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald 

Three of his sisters married Jewish men and in 1946 he said that this ruined his reputation in the army and he was forced to leave 

He was a member of the Reichstag from 1932 to 1944 he took part in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934 and had Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald murdered He served in many Nazi party jobs first in East Prussia and after 1936 in Silesia By 1937 he had become the Hherer SS und Polizeifhrer in Silesia

After the war started units under his command took part in revenge and in the shooting of POWs during the September Campaign but von dem Bach was not there in person On 7 November 1939 the SS chief Heinrich Himmler asked him if he wanted the job of Commissioner for the Strengthening of Germandom in Silesia His duty was to force people to leave and to take their property By August 1940 his units had forced more than 20000 ywiec families to leave their homes

In late 1939 he suggested starting a concentration camp for the non German people who lived in the town of Owicim Heinrich Himmler agreed to von dem Bachs suggestion and in May 1940 the Auschwitz concentration camp opened

On 22 June 1941 von dem Bach Zelewski became HSSPF in the Heeresgruppe Mitte in July 1943 he became commander of the Bandenkmpfverbnde that carried out the mass murder of 35000 people in Riga and more than 200000 in Belarus and eastern Poland The government was going to make him the future HSSPF in Moscow however the Wehrmacht did not get into the city Until 1943 von dem Bach Zalewski was the HSSPF in command of anti partisan units on the central front a special command created by Adolf Hitler Von dem Bach Zalewski was the only HSSPF in the Soviet areas taken over by the Germans to have real authority over the police after Hans Adolf Prtzmann and Jockeln lost theirs to the civil government 

In February 1942 he was put into hospital which he would later say was due to a nervous breakdown because of the ethnic cleansing in Belarus and the genocide of the Jews Radio signals overheard by British intelligence say however that his illness was physical He went back to his job in July with no reduction seen in his actions

In June 1942 after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Prague Adolf Hitler wanted von dem Bach Zelewski to take Heydrichs job as Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia When Himmler said that von dem Bach Zelewski was needed due to the situation in Belarus Hitler let him stay and gave the job to Kurt Daluege 

On 12 July 1943 von dem Bach Zalewski was given command of all anti partisan efforts in Belgium Belarus France the General Government the Netherlands Norway Ukraine Yugoslavia and parts of the Bialystok District In reality he remained only in Belarus and the area of Russia near Belarus

In 1944 von dem Bach Zalewski took part in front line fighting in the Kovel area but in March had to go to Germany for medical treatment Himmler took over all his jobs

On 2 August 1944 he took command of all soldiers fighting against the Warsaw Uprising as Korpsgruppe Bach Units under his command killed about 200000 people including more than 65000 executions and an unknown number of POWs After more than two months of heavy fighting and the total destruction of Warsaw he then was able to control the city For what he did in Warsaw the Nazi Government gave him the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross on September 30 1944

Von dem Bach Zelewski went into hiding and tried to leave the country However US military police arrested him on 1 August 1945 Because he told the Allies what he knew about his former bosses at the Nuremberg Trials von dem Bach Zelewski never went to trial himself for any war crimes He also did not have to go back to Poland or to the USSR to be tried He left prison in 1949 

In 1951 von dem Bach Zalewski said that he had helped Hermann Gring kill himself in 1946 To make people believe this he showed them the cyanide with serial numbers like the ones that were on the cyanide that Gring used This was never proven Today people who study history do not believe this happened

Also in 1951 von dem Bach was told he would go to a work prison for ten years for the murder of people in the early 1930s but he did not go until 1958 when he was found guilty of killing Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald an SS officer on the Night of the Long Knives and was sentenced to four and a half years in prison In 1961 he received an extra ten years where he had to stay in his home all the time for the murder of ten German Communists in the early 1930s He never went to prison for crimes during the war even though he openly said he murdered Jews He died in a Munich prison on 8 March 1972

Specialized English is a controlled version of the English language used for radio broadcasting easier for non native speakers of English It is based on Voice of America Special English

Specialized English was set up initially by Feba Radio in the UK Feba now uses Specialized English with US radio companies Words of Hope and Back to God Ministries International All three are Christian but Specialized English is not used for religious preaching programs Its main use is in the features service program Spotlight which is widely broadcast on over sixty outlets globally Scripts and audio are also available freely on the Spotlight website

Specialized English sounds the same as Special English and it almost is the same Both use a 1500 word core vocabulary short sentences and slow delivery Special English was used from about 1959 by Voice of America Specialized was written in the late 1990s independently of Voice of America The basic design is identical but there is a slight difference in the vocabulary and Specialized is more international VoA is a federal US government department so it doesnt make Special English programs for anything other than VoAs own use Specialized English was designed by the civil society and the developers try to make programs for several purposes The developers of Specialized felt they should choose a name to show both the similarity and the difference 

The reason that Specialized was based on Special English is related to their respective usage They are not primarily teaching tools but communication tools The choice of words in the 1500 word list depends to a degree on what is to be communicated Most of the words are the most frequently learned most commonly used English words Both tools use these words But many words are chosen for the intended purpose For example Special English uses words a US government news service might need such as Congress federal administration capitalism and wiktrecession Specialized replaces some of these words with words used for religious subjects such as blessing prayer miracle and faith The Specialized English word list has been revised in 2000 and 2007 in the light of experience Still the overlap of the two vocabularies is 913 The Specialized English word list allows greater breadth of meaning in some of the words used in both lists For example the word joint

Special joint  ad shared by two or more

Specialized joint  ad shared by two or more n the place where two parts or things are fixed together

Specialized also allows more prefixes and suffixes which has allowed some words to be removed from the core list

As well as the 1500 word core vocabulary both Special and Specialized English also generally allow inflections of the core words numbers up to a million pronouns proper nouns and any words whose meaning can be communicated in real time using the core vocabulary

The following table lists some differences between the two methods

The violone is a very big string instrument that used to be used in the 16th and 17th centuries It is like a double bass but it belongs to the viol family The name violone means large viol It was really a double bass viola da gamba It usually had six strings and the fingerboard had frets which showed where to put the fingers of the left hand to make the notes The bow was held underhand

The violone is sometimes heard today in early music groups who are playing Renaissance and early Baroque music music The instruments used today are usually ones that have been made recently to look and sound like the old ones

The violone was the last member of the viol family to die out When the other sizes of viol had been replaced by orchestras with violins violas and cellos the violone was often used instead of a double bass Bach used the violone in his cantatas Eventually the violone was no longer used and the double bass was used instead The double bass still looks a little bit like the old viol because it has sloping shoulders and the strings are tuned in fourths

In organs Violone is the name given to a soft organ stop made of metal or wood usually in the pedals

The Tragedy of the Commons was an article published by Garrett Hardin in the journal Science in 1968 It describes a problem where many people with their own ideas can make something they all share worse even if no one wants to For example even if no one wants to pollute water because that makes it unhealthy it can still end up like that because so many want to use the water for their own reasons like washing and throwing away rubbish Each person thinks that his small bit of pollution of the water is too small to affect the quality of the water but because there are many people the total effect ends up making the water too polluted for anybody to use for drinking or even washing This typically occurs in slums and other overcrowded places like refugee camps

A mud volcano or mud dome is a kind of volcano that is made by liquids and gases from the earth There are many different ways that mud volcanoes can be made Temperatures in a mud volcano are much cooler than that of a regular volcano The biggest mud volcanoes are 10 kilometers in diameter and can be as tall as 700 metersfactdateApril 2009 Most of the gases given off by mud volcanoes are methane Other gases given off include carbon dioxide and methane They usually spit out liquids with solids in the liquids An example of this would be water with salt or acids in the water

A mud volcano is usually made by mud diapir that breaks out of the surface of the Earth or on the ocean bottom Temperatures in mud volcanoes can be as low as the freezing point 

Mud volcanoes are often linked with places where petroleum gathers and around areas of tectonic subduction They can also be linked with orogenic belts where hydrocarbon gases usually erupt They are also often linked with lava volcanoes as well However instead of spitting out magma mud volcanoes spit out gases like methane and carbon dioxide

Around 1100 mud volcanoes have been found on land and in shallow water People think that more than 10000 mud volcanoes may exist on continental slopes and abyssal plains

There are many features of mud volcanoes One of these features is the gryphon which is a steep short cone that gives off mud Another feature is the mud cone which is a tall cone that makes mud and small pieces of rock The scoria cone is a cone that is made when broken wikt linkdepositsdeposits of mud are heated up and the salse which are pools of water that leak gases out of them Mud volcanoes have many other features but most of these are notable

Most of the things that mud volcanoes spit out happen during volcanic broken wikt linkeruptionseruptions Other eruptions have been known to happen during the time when a volcano is dormant or thought to not be able to erupt

There are very few mud volcanoes in Europe but quite a few are on the Taman Peninsula of Russia and the Kerch Peninsula in the southeastern part of Ukraine In Italy many mud volcanoes are near the Apennines and in Sicily Also in Europe are the Berca Mud Volcanoes near Berca in Buzu County Romania Many mud volcanoes are by the Black Sea and Caspian Sea Movement from tectonic plates have made areas of mod volcanoes that spit out hydrocarbons and methane Some of the tallest mud volcanoes are in Azerbaijan Mud volcanoes are also in Iran and Pakistan in the Makran mountain range

A black smoker is a kind of hydrothermal vent that can be found on the ocean floor

also called a hydrothermal vent is a fissure in a planets surface from which geothermally heated water issues Hydrothermal vents are commonly found near volcanically active places areas where tectonic plates are moving apart ocean basins and hotspots Hydrothermal vents are locally common because the earth is both geologically active and has large amounts of water on its surface and within its crust Common land types include hot springs fumaroles and geysers The most famous hydrothermal vent system on land is probably within Yellowstone National Park in the United States Under the sea hydrothermal vents may form features called black smokers Relative to the majority of the deep sea the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents are biologically more productive often hosting complex communities fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids Chemosynthetic archaea form the base of the food chain supporting diverse organisms including giant tube worms clams limpets and shrimp Active hydrothermal vents are believed to exist on Jupiters moon Europa and ancient hydrothermal vents have been speculated to exist on Mars1

It lives only on Christmas Island Australia It is a small bat weighing about 3 to 45 grams It was thought to be the same as the Pipistrellus tenuis but new research on the bats baculum has shown that Pipistrellus murrayi is a different species

 Decline  The numbers of Christmas Island Pipistrelle bats dropped a lot in the last 20 years It was once seen all over the island including in the Settlement It went from at least 80 of its living range and its numbers dropped more than 90 since 1994 Research into the number of bats in January 2009 shows there were only about 20 bats left The only known group resting place had only four bats 

Scientists do not know why the Christmas Island Pipistrelles numbers dropped Several possible threats may have been

A number of animals brought to Christmas Island could be the problem

Early in 2009 the Australian Minister for the Environment Peter Garrett stopped scientists from trying to set up a captive breeding program He said that the bats were too hard to catch and no one knew how to keep them alive in cages Instead he announced a program to breed a similar bat in the Northern Territory of Australia Scientists would learn about caring and breeding bats then use this information to save the Christmas Island Pipistrelle Other scientists have said this will take too long and the bats will be extinct Scientists believed that by June 2009 there were only four of the bats left in the world In July 2009 the Australian Government changed its earlier decision and said that it would try to capture the last of the bats and use them to try and breed more bats in captivity During September 2009 scientists tried to catch the remaining bats to protect them but they only heard the sound of one bat during their search of the forest It is now believed that the bat is extinct Scientists will continue to search for the bat but there has been no signs of the bat since

Fire stick farming are words used by Australian archaeologist Rhys Jones in 1969 They describe the way that Indigenous Australians used fire regularly to burn the land This helped hunting by herding the animals into particular areas and also caused new grass to grow which attracted more animals Over many years it changed the types of plants and animals that lived in an area

Fire stick farming had turned scrub into grassland which increased the numbers of grass eating animals such as the kangaroo Scientists say that the changes caused by fire stick farming caused the extinction of the Australian megafauna

In the forests fire stick farming opened up clear areas and let more plants grow at ground level This increased the number of animals that could feed on these plants such as the herbivore marsupials

The Miocene is the first epoch of the Neogene period of the Cainozoic It started about 23 million years ago and ended about 533 million years ago The rock beds that mark the start and end are well known but the exact dates of the start and end of the period are uncertain The biota becomes modern 

The Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell Its name comes from the Greek words and and means less recent because it has 18 fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene 

As the earth cooled it went from the Oligocene epoch through the Miocene and into the Pliocene The Miocene boundaries are not set at any particular world wide event They are set at regional boundaries between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene epochs

The plants and animals of the Miocene were fairly modern Modern families of mammals and birds existed Whales seals and kelp spread Modern sharks appeared including the huge Megalodon Grasslands became more common

Car navigation allows an automobile driver to see where he or she is on a map at any given time Automobile navigation can rely on GPS or it can be DVD or data based GPS bsed navigation uses radio signals from special satellites that send their position and the time of transmission The GPS receiver catches the signal and calculates the time The GPS can then calculate the distance from the satellite with the well known radio signal speed 

When driving a car with such a GPS receiver you may receive a satellite which is above for instance Dover in the south and another one which is above Perth in the north Then you know precisely how far you are from Dover and how far from Perth With that two possible positions of your car at the flat land are precisely determined

For to know which one of both is the right place one needs a third satellite for instance above Lands End in the west With that you can also reckon with the heigth sodt you can also drive in the mountains with it With three satellites in fact there is still a third possible point but that is twice as high as the satellites above the earths surface and does not need to be reckoned with in car travel

But we still need a fourth satellite because the GPS receiver needs to know the time very precisely In between it knows your car position so that it can calculate the distance from that satellite Then it knows the time of reception because that is the time of transmission plus the travel time of the signal 

That is which allows for the thing At any moment it searches for the strongest satellites calculates the position and the driving direction and then shows it all on a small screen as a threedimensional map With that it also shows your driving speed and how far it is to the next junction

You even may add the address where you want to go Then it delivers you nicely within a few meters in front of the house One can even be shown where are traffic jams and speed cameras

When you deviate from the indicated route the receiver instantly begins to calculate with the new data That often takes some minutes because all that approaching calculations have to be carried out again

For to show where you are with the calculated position the GPS receiver contains electronic maps With a good brand of receiver you often can download new ones in which recent changes in the street system are included

A Spiral is a special curve in mathematics This curve starts at a point and then goes around the point but gets farther and farther away from it This is different from a circle which is always at the same distance or an ellipse A spiral is an open curve unlike circles and ellipses which are closed curves

A two dimensional spiral may be described most easily using polar coordinates There the radius r is a continuous monotonic function of angle  The circle would be regarded as a degenerate case With the circle the function would not be strictly monotonic but constant

Some of the more important sorts of two dimensional spirals include

For simple 3 d spirals a third variable h is also a continuous monotonic function of For example a conic helix may be defined as a spiral on a conic surface with the distance to the apex an exponential function of 

The helix and vortex can be viewed as a kind of three dimensional spiral

For a helix with thickness see spring

The study of spirals in nature have a long history Christopher Wren found out that many shells form a logarithmic spiral Jan Swammerdam observed the common mathematical characteristics of a wide range of shells from Helix to Spirula and Henry Nottidge Moseley described the mathematics of univalve shells DArcy Wentworth Thompsons On Growth and Form gives extensive treatment to these spirals He describes how shells are formed by rotating a closed curve around a fixed axis the shape of the curve remains fixed but its size grows in a geometric progression In some shell such as Nautilus and ammonites the generating curve revolves in a plane pirpendicular to the axis and the shell will form a planer discoid shape In others it follows a skew path forming a helico spiral pattern

Thompson also studied spirals occurring in horns teeth claws and plants

Spirals in plants and animals are frequently described as whorls

The spiral also represents infinance or infinity Starting at a single point and revolving outwardly until the end of the universe Because of this some civilizations believe that the Spiral is a pathway to the afterlife

The spiral plays an important role in symbolism It appears in megalithic art notably in the Newgrange tomb or in many Galician petroglyphs such as the one in Mogor See also triple spiral

Scholars are still talking about the subject but many of them now believe that the simple spiral in Chinese art may be a symbol of the sun Roof tiles from the Tang Dynasty with this symbol have been found west of the ancient city of Changan

The spiral is the most ancient symbol found on every civilized continent Because it appears at burial sites across the globe the spiral most likely represented the life death rebirth cycle Similarly the spiral symbolized the sun as ancient people thought the sun was born each morning died each night and was reborn the next morning  

Spirals are also a symbol of hypnosis This most likely comes from the clich of people and cartoon characters being hypnotized by staring into a spinning spiral They are also used as a symbol of dizziness where the eyes of a cartoon character especially in anime and manga will turn into spirals to show they are dizzy or dazed The spiral is also a prominent symbol in the anime Gurren Lagann where it symbolizes the double helix structure of DNA representing biological evolution and the spiral structure of a galaxy representing universal evolution

In passive solar building design windows walls and floors are made to collect store and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer This is called passive solar design or climatic design because unlike active solar heating systems it doesnt involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices

The key to designing a passive solar home is to best take advantage of the local climate Elements to be considered include window placement and glazing type thermal insulation thermal mass and shading Passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings but existing buildings can be adapted or retrofitted

Most developing countries have good renewable energy resources including solar energy wind power geothermal energy and biomass These can help developing countries reduce their dependence on oil and natural gas Investments in renewables can be less expensive than fossil fuel energy systems 

Renewable energy can be particularly suitable for developing countries In rural and remote areas transmission and distribution of energy generated from fossil fuels can be difficult and expensive Producing renewable energy locally can offer a viable alternative

Interest in renewable energies has increased in recent years due to environmental concerns about global warming and air pollution reduced costs of renewable energy technologies and improved efficiency and reliability

Renewable energy projects in many developing countries contribute to poverty alleviation by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment Renewable energy technologies can also make indirect contributions to alleviating poverty by providing energy for cooking space heating and lighting

Renewable energy can also contribute to education by providing electricity to schools Renewable energy for cooking and heating can reduce the time that children spend out of school collecting fuel In addition the displacement of traditional fuels reduces the health problems from indoor air pollution produced by burning those fuels

Renewable energy can also contribute to better health by providing energy to refrigerate medicine and sterilize medical equipment It can also provide power for supplying the fresh water and sewerage services needed to reduce infectious disease

Kenya is the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita More than 30000 small solar panels each producing 12 to 30 watts are sold in Kenya annually For an investment of as little as 100 for the panel and wiring the PV system can be used to charge a car battery which can then provide power to run a fluorescent lamp or a small television for a few hours a day More Kenyans adopt solar power every year than make connections to the countrys electric grid

The Yom Kippur War was a war between Israel and a group of Arab countries led by Egypt and Syria The war took place from October 6 1973 until October 24 1973 The war began on the Jewish festival of Yom Kippur in 1973 and it happened during the Muslim month of Ramadan The attack by Egypt and Syria was a surprise to Israel Egypts army entered the Sinai Peninsula and Syrias army entered the Golan Heights 

The Sinai and the Golan Heights belonged to Egypt and Syria but they were occupied by Israel since 1967 Syria wanted to liberate all of the Golan and Egypt wanted to liberate part of the Sinai then take back the rest by a peace treaty with Israel 

At first the attack went well for the Arab armies However Israel soon began pushing back Syria from the Golan and two weeks after the start of the war the Israelis began advancing into Syria They came 40 kilometers from Damascus the capital of Syria The Iraqi army joined the war with Syria and the Israeli army stopped advancing

The Western world expected Israel to win quickly against Egypt because of its better military The Egyptian army crossed the Suez Canal on October 6 and destroyed the Israeli defenses and forts on the other side Israel tried for the next few days to defeat the Egyptians and push them back behind the canal However the Israelis could not push them back The United States of America started sending ammunition and weapons to Israel using airplanes to help the Israeli army win the war On October 14 Egypt attacked again trying to advance even more into the Sinai Israel defeated the attack and the Egyptians lost many tanks After this the Israelis attacked again After heavy fighting they crossed the canal at its center between two Egyptian armies They advanced north and south They kept moving south until the reached the city of Suez and they trapped a large Egyptian force on the eastern side of the canal in the Sinai The Israelis tried to capture Suez but they were defeated They also failed advance north They reached an area 101 kilometers from Cairo the capital of Egypt

The United Nations passed a resolution in the security council that asked all the countries to bring a temporary stop to the war The Arab countries and Israel agreed However the ceasefire failed when the Israeli army advanced south to reach Suez After this the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev said to the US president that if the US did not send troops that he would send Soviet troops to the area This was believed to be a threat and the United States put their military on full nuclear alert Because of this tension between the United States and the Soviets Israel agreed to a ceasefire and the war ended It was the closest the two superpowers the United States and the Soviet Union had been to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis of the 1960s 

The war ended on October 26 1973 After the war Egypt and Israel talked together They reached an agreement to separate their forces Because of this agreement Israel retreated behind the canal into the Sinai The Egyptian forces stayed in the Sinai near the canal and did not retreat from the places they captured There was a large distance between Egyptian and Israeli forces in the Sinai as part of the agreement

Israel also held negotiations with Syria and agreed to withdraw from the places the captured in Syria but they stayed in the Golan Heights Egypt and Israel kept their negotiations and in 1979 they signed the Egypt Israel Peace Treaty The treaty brought peace between Israel and Egypt and Israel retreated from the whole Sinai and returned it to Egypt The treaty still holds to this day In the war Israel was called the winner and the Arab countries were called the losers even though no real military victory was ever won it was a military stalemate However the war agreed to be a political victory for the Arabs especially for Egypt

Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian fiction novel It was written by Ray Bradbury and first published in 1953 

The novel is about a future American society in which people are hedonistic and reading is against the law because it makes them think The main character Guy Montag has a job as a fireman The number 451 refers to the temperature at which the books burn when the firemen burn them for the good of humanity Written in the early years of the Cold War the novel is a critique of what Bradbury saw as an increasingly dysfunctional American society

The idea began with Bradburys short story Bright Phoenix written in 1947 but first published in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1963 The original short story was reworked into the novella The Fireman and published in the February 1951 issue of Galaxy Science Fiction The novel was also serialized in the March April and May 1954 issues of Playboy magazine Bradbury wrote the entire novel on a pay typewriter in the basement of UCLAs Powell library His original idea in writing Fahrenheit 451 was to show his great love for books and libraries He has often referred to Montag as an allusion to himself

Over the years the novel has been subject to various interpretations primarily focusing on the historical role of book burning in suppressing dissenting ideas Bradbury has said that the novel is not about censorship he says that Fahrenheit 451 is a story about how television destroys interest in reading literature which leads to people thinking that knowledge is made up of factoids partial information without context such as Napoleons birth date alone without an indication of who he was 

A movie version of the novel was released in 1966 and at least two BBC Radio 4 dramatizations have also been aired both of which follow the book very closely

The stack is one of the most important data structures in computer science To understand how a stack works think of a deck of playing cards that is face down We can only easily access the card that is on top When we want to look at the top card there are two things we can do we can peek at it but leave it on the stack or we can pop it off When we pop off the top object we are taking it off the stack If we want to add another card to the top of the stack we push 

A stack is called a last in first out collection This means that the last thing we added is the first thing that gets pulled off If the last card we put on our stack of cards was an ace then the first card we pulled from the top is that same ace

The stack was first proposed in 1955 and then patented in 1957 by the German Friedrich L Bauer The same concept was developed independently at around the same time by the Australian Charles Leonard Hamblin

In modern computer languages the stack is usually implemented with more operations than just push and pop Some implementations have a function which returns the current length of the stack Another typical helper operation is top can return the current top element of the stack without removing it Another common operation is dup which makes a copy of the element at the top of the stack

A nocturnal emission is when a man has an orgasm while sleeping Many young men have their first orgasm this way They might not understand what has happened to them if they have not been taught anything about sex

It is also called a wet dream

Wet dreams are natural and harmless They do not mean that anything is wrong with you The only problem with them is the mess and its not a big mess

Wet dreams sometimes happen during or after a dream about sex but scientists are not sure what causes them Most sexual dreams do not cause orgasms

If you urinate while asleep this is called wetting the bed not a wet dream

The Tevatron was a giant Particle accelerator in Illinois that was used by scientists to make protons go very fast almost the speed of light in some cases Scientists looked at what happens when the protons hit antiprotons to see if they are right about their ideas as to what protons are made of

The Tevatron was a circular particle accelerator at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory just east of Batavia Illinois It was the second highest energy particle collider in the world after the Large Hadron Collider The Tevatron is a synchrotron that accelerates protons and antiprotons in a 628 km ring to energies of up to 1 TeV hence its name The Tevatron was completed in 1983 at a cost of 120 million and has been regularly upgraded since then The Main Injector was the most substantial addition built over five years from 1994 at a cost of 290 million

The Large Hadron Collider was later built in Switzerland to look for one of those pieces called the Higgs Boson The LHC broke and is now being fixed The Tevatron scientists also tried to find the Higgs Boson They need to do this before the LHC is fixed because the LHC is much better at finding things

The scientists at the Tevatron had a years headstart on the scientists at the LHC Whoever finds the Higgs will be honored by other scientists That is why the scientists at the Tevatron wanted to find it before the scientists at the LHC

The Tevatron discovered three of the 17 fundamental particles including the top quark The Tevatron was shut down on September 30 2011 The main ring of the Tevatron will probably be reused in future experiments and its components may be transferred to other particle accelerators

MOSFET stands for metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor Transistors are small electrical devices that are used in amongst other things alarm clocks calculators and perhaps most famously computers they are some of the most basic building blocks of modern electronics MOSFETs act like valves for electricity They have one input connection which is used to control the flow of electricity between two other connections Said another way the gate acts as a switch that controls the two outputs Think of a dimmable light switch the knob itself selects ON OFF or somewhere in between controlling the brightness of the light Think of a MOSFET in place of the light switch the switch itself is the gate the source is the power coming into the house and the drain is the light bulb

The name MOSFET describes the structure and the function of the transistor MOS refers to the fact that a MOSFET is built by layering metal on oxide on semiconductor FET describes the action of the gate on the semiconductor An electric signal is sent to the gate which creates an electric field that alters the connection between the source and drain

As of 2008 it is possible to fit 2000000000 transistors on a single integrated circuit In 1970 that number was around 2000

The First Punic War started in 264 BCE It lasted for 23 years ending in 241 BCE

Rome and Carthage and all of their friends went to war with each other Rome tried to win the war early by attacking the city of Carthage but they were beaten Then they fought over Sicily a big island between the two countries with lots of grain Rome eventually won control of Sicily

Rome then had a second attack on the city of Carthage and this time they had a good general Scipio who won the battles He did so well he got a new name added to his old so he became Scipio Africanus

Partial differential equations are a kind of math They take the derivative of an equation in terms of one variable where the other variable or variables is seen as a constant For instance if you were driving down a road going northeast and took the partial derivative of north you would only get the speed of what you were going north So the partial derivative of fxy in terms of x would be 2x or 2 times x because when it is terms of x y is seen as a constant This is like taking the derivative of x1 or x4 When you take the derivative of a constant it goes to 0

Trade paperbacks or trades as they are commonly called are collections of comic books that are usually bound in a better format than the comic magazines using the same materials and methods as printed books They are generally sold in bookstores and specialty comic book shops rather than at newsstands 

Unlike graphic novels the material in a trade paperback is reprinted from comic magazines that were released in the standard 32 page format Unlike comic books which only tell one small part of a story trade paperbacks usually collect a complete story story arc or a large part of a story They usually reprint the material from 4 to 12 comic books depending on the size of the trade and the story being collected

Some famous examples of trade paperbacks

One way of proving a mathematical theorem is called proof by induction This is usually used to prove a theorem that is true for all numbers especially natural numbers and integers There are 4 steps in a proof by induction It uses a domino effect by proving the statement is true for one value and then proving that it is true for the each successive case

1 State that the proof will be by induction and state which variable will be used in the induction step

2 Show that the statement is true for some beginning case usually the number 1

3 Assume that for some value n the statement is true This is called the induction step

So 2 n0

Expanded n02 3n0 2 n02 3n0 2

Hence the proof is correct

Any process in which relatively small molecules called monomers combine chemically to produce a very large chainlike or network molecule called a polymer The monomer molecules may all be alike or they may represent two three or more different compounds Usually at least 100 monomer molecules must be combined to make a product that has certain unique physical propertiessuch as elasticity high tensile strength or the ability to form fibresthat differentiate polymers from substances composed of smaller and simpler molecules often many thousands of monomer units are incorporated in a single molecule of a polymer The formation of stable covalent chemical bonds between the monomers sets polymerization apart from other processes such as crystallization in which large numbers of molecules aggregate under the influence of weak intermolecular forces

Germanic Paganism commonly referred to as Asatru is an attempt to recreate worship of the old Norse Gods It is also commonly known as Heathenism or Odinism

Followers of this religion commonly believe in three races of Gods The Aesir which are similar to how Gods are usually considered the Vanir which are natural forces of the Earth and the Jotnar or giants who are always at war with the Aesir

There are Nine Noble Virtues which followers of Germanic Paganism generally follow They are

In this faith the end of the world is known as Ragnarok and it ends in a great battle between the Aesir and the Jotnar

This article is about the town For the band with the same name see Portishead

Portishead is a town near the sea in North Somerset England where about 21000 people live 

Portishead has had a history since Roman times Its name comes from the words port at the head of the river  The town was built on the mouth of a small river the main road in the town once met the water at the top of the river

Lots of buildings in the town are of a Victorian style

In the 1860s in the middle of the iron and steel era a pier and a dock were built for the big boats that could not easily get to Bristol Harbour The ships brought in expensive items from around the world and took items made in the town to other countries Many ships carried coal

In the 1880s Portishead Dock was bought by Bristol Corporation and was managed as part of the Port of Bristol until it closed

The Portishead power stations were coal power stations built near the dock The first power station was built in 1926 It began making electricity in 1929 for the Bristol Corporation The power station was made bigger in 1948 

A 2nd power station was started in 1949 and began making electricity in 1955

After 1949 the power stations became part of the countrys electricity industry They used some local coal produced in the Somerset coalfield which was moved by train along the Portishead Railway The line had opened on 12 April 1867 as the Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway Company it opened to the dock on 5 July 1879 

The 1st power station closed in 1976 and the 2nd closed in 1982 The dock was closed in 1992

Portishead had two train stations for people who lived in the town The main station was near the centre of Portishead and the other was at the Pier The construction of the 2nd power station caused the 1st train station to be removed and another station was opened in the main street of the town on 2 January 1954 The new station closed on 7 September 1964 People who live in Portishead now want the train station to be opened again 

Okashina Okashi  Strange Candy is a webcomic drawn by Emily Snodgrass and written by Allison Brownlow Karen Olympia and J Baird It started in 2001 with Brownlow as its first writer and Olympia added to the team in October 2001 Snodgrass has appeared at conventions speaking as an amateur artist answering questions from an audience Snodgrass is an amateur artist who does not earn a living from her online comic

Okashina Okashi is hosted on Comic Genesis a free online provider of webcomics Baird used his comics while teaching for Hess Educational Organization an English education business in the Republic of China and Singapore He used Okashina Okashi in the Create a Comic Project when he volunteered to teach a free after school youth literacy library event in New Haven CT

In August 2007 Emi chan added a new comic set in the Beauty Man Garden a chain of restaurants featured prominently throughout Okashina Okashi The new comic is called Mini BMG

A group of people who dont know each other are sucked into a different universe called UberTokyo They must try to find a way home by using plotholes to move between worlds Each world is a parody of a kind of anime and manga such as sports sentai and fantasy The stories from beginning to present are

In addition to these stories there are many smaller stories The longest small story has Kerisu an evil overlord who needs new servants and wants the main cast to replace them Ho chan and Daisuke who were left behind in the sentai adventure world have been seen again a number of times for their own small story A third small story has Professor Li and his assistant Terra

The comic features a large number of references to many anime and video games such as Neon Genesis Evangelion Revolutionary Girl Utena and Guilty Gear It also uses male homoeroticism as fanservice One of its important male characters Eeichi is bisexual Another male character Takeshi frequently cross dresses Two less important female characters Jen Puni and Zuga Ma are hinted to be lesbians

Adverse possession is a rule in property law This rule says that if property is not being used by its owner while another person is using the property this other person becomes the new owner of the property To get these rights the adverse possessor usually must use the property in the way a normal owner would do for a period of time typically 20 years In some jurisdictions a form of adverse possession exists in which the adverse possessor ends up with sharing some rights to property with the owner such as a right of way instead of getting all the rights

The Rule against Perpetuities is one of the most complicated rules in property law and wills and trusts In general the rule states that a gift of a will will not be enforced if the subject of the gift is to be given to a person who can not be known now and will not be able to be known by the end of 21 years after the death of everyone who was alive at the time the gift was created 

For example if a woman says in her will that her house is to be given to the children of her children when they graduate from college this would be not be enforced by a court It would not be enforced because one of her childrens children might not graduate from college until 21 years after everyone who was alive at the time of the womans death has died 

The purpose of the rule is to prevent property from being tied up for perpetuity The courts do not want to hold property to see who will receive it after a complicated set of rules from the gift giver First this would result in a waste of the courts time and resources Second it would be a waste of the property that is being given through the gift If a gift in a will violates the Rule against Perpetuities the court will simply strike that gift and transfer the subject of the gift as if the will had not mentioned it

However many countries and states have changed this rule and it does not apply at all or in a changed way in those countries and states

A polypeptide is a string of amino acids linked together Amino acids are the basic building blocks of proteins A single polypeptide chain might make up the entire primary structure of a simple protein more complex proteins are formed when two or more polypeptides link together

Polypeptides are made when mRNA is translated a process involving ribosomes tRNA and amino acids

SS Nomadic is a steamship of the White Star Line launched on 25 April 1911 in Belfast She was built as a tender to the liners RMS Olympic and RMS Titanic and is the last remaining boat built for the White Star Line still afloat

The keel of Nomadic was laid down in the Harland and Wolff shipyards Belfast in 1910 She was launched on 25 April 1911 and delivered to the White Star Line on the 27 May The ship was 67 meters long and 113 meters wide with a gross tonnage of 1273 tons She had two three bladed screws propelling her to a maximum speed of 12 knots

With her sister ship SS Traffic Nomadic was used as a tender for Titanic and Olympic at Cherbourg in France This meant she would ferry the passengers from Cherbourg to Titanic Olympic as they were too big to fit into the port at Cherbourg Nomadic was fitted with a luxurious interior and was used for the first and second class passengers whilst Traffic served the third class travellers

During World War I Nomadic saw service in carrying American troops at Brest

In 1927 she was sold to Compagnie Cherbourghoise de Transbordement and then sold again to the Socit Cherbourghoise de Remorquage et de Sauvetage in 1934 Then under the name Ingenieur Minard she again served as troop ship in World War II

After the war she continued tendering Cunard White Star ships until November 1968 She then served RMS Queen Elizabeth for the last time

In 1974 Nomadic was bought by a private individual and converted into a restaurant on the Seine in Paris where she remained docked and semi abandoned after the closure of the restaurant until she was moved to the port of Le Havre in 2003

A public appeal for donations to return Nomadic to the Harland and Wolff shipyard for restoration was organised by Belfast Industrial Heritage a non profit organisation in Northern Ireland in collaboration with enthusiasts through the SaveNomadiccom Appeal

On 26 January 2006 SS Nomadic was purchased at auction in Paris by the Department for Social Development part of the Northern Ireland Office She cost 171320

SS Nomadic left Le Havre to return to Belfast on 12 July and arrived back close to where she was built on 18 July 2006 The vessel was welcomed back by the Social Development Minister David Hanson MP and the Deputy Lord Mayor of the City of Belfast Councillor Ruth Patterson and a number of well wishers The Nomadic arrived piggy backed on a marine transportation barge which had been contracted from Anchor Marine Transportation Limited 

A study by Belfast City Council has estimated the cost of restoring Nomadic at 7 million Belfast Harbour Commissioners have agreed to provide a temporary berth for the ship and a charitable trust to co ordinate fundraising for the restoration has been set up Now that the vessel is on the United Kingdoms National Register of Historic Vessels the project should qualify for a National Lottery grant application which should greatly enhance existing funds of 60000 from a public appeal and 100000 from Belfast City Council

The Nomadic Appeal Public Website has now founded the Nomadic Preservation Society

On her return to Belfast SS Nomadic was moored at Queens Quay just outside the Odyssey Arena in Belfast and opened with a temporary exhibition In late 2008 the ship was closed to the public and moved to Barnetts Dock for internal maintenance It is expected she will soon enter Hamilton Graving Dock for drydocking and complete restoration

In January 2009 the company Frazer Nash has been appointed to manage the Conservation Management Plan The level of restoration will then be decided

It is planned that the restoration of SS Nomadic will be completed in time for the 100th anniversary of the sinking of Titanic in 2012

The B 2 Spirit is a stealth bomber used by the United States Air Force It is known for its very unusual flat triangle shape and does not have a tail This shape helps to make it harder to see on radar acting as a sort of camouflage It uses computers to remain stable in the air It is capable of dropping large amounts of bombs and flying long distances

The B 2 has a crew of two pilots a pilot in the left seat and mission commander in the right

The first B 2 was publicly displayed on Nov 22 1988 when it was rolled out of its hangar at Air Force Plant 42 Palmdale Calif Its first flight was July 17 1989 

Whiteman Air Force Base Missouri is the only base that has the B 2 The first aircraft named Spirit of Missouri was delivered there on December 17th 1993 

Cold blooded animals cannot control their temperature except by moving their body 

Reptiles sit in the sun when they are cold and in the shade when they are hot for example reptiles such as lizards and snakess Other animals do not try to change their body temperature at all for example many worm type animals living in the sea

Some insects control their temperature especially colonial insects Termite mounds have air conditioning their system of openings and galleries allows currents of air to flow through the mound Honey bees fan their wings to cool their colony

Animals whose bodies control their body temperature are called warm blooded

The correct scientific word for cold blooded is poikilotherm poikilothermic They are not actually cold blooded it is that they live with a much wider range of body temperatures than homeotherms

Diapause is a delay in development which has evolved in response to regular periods of adverse environmental conditions 

It is a physiological state with very specific conditions Diapause is a mechanism used as a means to survive predictable unfavourable environmental conditions such as temperature extremes drought or reduced food availability It is most often observed in arthropods especially insects and in the embryos of many of the oviparous species of fish in the order Cyprinodontiformes

Not only is diapause started by specific stimuli or conditions but once it is started only certain other stimuli are capable of bringing the organism out of diapause This distinguishes diapause from other forms of dormancy such as hibernation

Activity levels of diapausing stages can vary considerably among species Diapause may occur in a completely immobile stage such as the pupae and eggs or it may occur in very active stages that undergo extensive migrations such as the adult Monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus In cases where the insect remains active feeding is reduced and reproductive development is slowed or halted

Electric fields are produced around objects that have electrical charge Negatively charged objects are drawn to electric fields while positively charged objects are pushed away from electric fields

Audiobooks or talking books are books that have been read aloud by someone and recorded Nowadays they are usually recorded onto compact discs although some older editions remain on cassette tapes More recently audiobooks have been available to download from the internet and pre recorded on special MP3 players

While audiobooks can be used by anyone they serve as a main resource for people who are blind or cannot see well

Many popular books are often chosen to be turned into audiobooks The original author may or may not be involved in choosing the narrator for the reading Some authors often use the same reader for many books so that their audiobooks have a similar sound or style

The power spectrum of a signal is the power of that signal at each frequency that it contains For example white noise which contains all frequencies at the same power has a flat power spectrum The power spectrum of the sound of the bottom key on a piano would have a high value at the frequency corresponding to its note and low values elsewhere

A potato gun or Potato cannon is a type of cannon that uses combustion or air pressure to fire a projectile They are called potato guns because potatoes are a commonly used projectile

There are two main types of potato guns Combustion guns use a flammable fuel and igniter to move an object Another type uses compressed air Potato guns are usually built of PVC or ABS piping

Combustion potato guns have 4 parts These are the barrel combustion chamber a cap and an igniter

A potato cannon can move a 2 diameter potato projectile over 100 yards at a speed of 40 mph This makes potato guns dangerous 

A air powered potato cannon is much stronger than a combustion cannon A combustion potato gun will launch projectiles at a pressure of about 10 20 psi Air powered guns often use pressures over 100 psi

The Legacy of Heorot is a science fiction novel written in 1987 by Larry Niven Jerry Pournelle and Steven Barnes

This is the first book in the Heorot series It is about a human space colony at the star Tau Ceti

Hundreds of years in the future People travel to the star Tau Ceti It takes 100 years to fly there To live that long the people go to sleep and freeze each other When they get there they unfreeze but some people do not wake up Some people wake up but are not as smart as they were 

They land on the forth planet from the sun and build a town on a big island Everything is peaceful until they are attacked by a large animal The animal is like a cross between a frog and an alligator It is big but also very fast and smart They call it a Grendel The Grendel kills several people but then it is killed 

The people get very scared and build fences land mines and guns After a while they get less scared and think that the Grendel they killed was the only one They build boats and get brave Then another bigger Grendel kills some of the people in the boats The People trap and kill this Grendel 

The People get really mad They find out that Grendels have to stay near water because when a Grendel moves fast it makes a lot of heat If it does not cool off it will die They go all around the island and kill all the Grendels This makes them very happy

They feel safe and travel all around the island They notice that the alien fish are big now They think that without the Grendels around there will be lots of fish to eat This makes them happy

Everything is good until the fish get very big When they get big enough they grow legs breath air and move very fast The fish are baby Grendels Now instead of a few big Grendels there are thousands of small ones

Some people escape to the space ship But other stay to defend the town They use the electric fences and land mines and guns to kill the little Grendels After awhile the town gets too damaged to protect anymore The people run away to a cave on a mountain The Grendels follow them up a river and attack the cave The people use kerosene to burn the Grendels Also they knock big rocks down onto them After enough Grendels get killed the other Grendels learn to run away instead of just attack The people win 

Over time the people hunt down all the new Grendels and all the alien fish Finally they are safe

University College London is a public research university in London It is the largest college of the federal University of London 

Founded in 1826 UCL became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London in 1836

UCL has over 100 departments institutes and research centres in eight faculties UCLs main campus is in the Bloomsbury area of Central London with a number of institutes and teaching hospitals located elsewhere in Central London 

UCL was the first university institution to be founded in London and the first in England to be established on an entirely secular basis It admits students regardless of their religious beliefs UC was also the first admit women on equal terms with men 

University College London has a long history beginning in the early 19th century 

It was based largely on ideas of Jeremy Bentham 17481832 a lawyer social philosopher and free thinker Bentham believed in libertarianism utilitarianism womens suffrage and the separation of church and state These are beliefs of liberalism UCL was unique in that it was secular and was called that Godless institution in Gower Street

UCL was founded on 11 February 1826 under the name London University as a secular alternative to the strictly Anglican universities of Oxford and Cambridge It was founded from the beginning as a university not a college or institute 

However its founders got strong opposition from the Church of England which prevented them from securing the Royal Charter needed for the award of degrees Kings College London was specifically founded to provide an Anglican rival to UCL It was not until 1836 when the latter day University of London was established that University College was legally recognised and granted the power to award degrees of the University of London

UCL is a major centre for biomedical research it is part of three of the 12 biomedical research centres established by the NHS in England and is a founding member of UCL Partners the largest academic health science centre in Europe

A migraine is a neurological syndrome which often presents itself as a severe headache There are different types of migraines but most cause a headache and nausea and might make the person dizzy or very sensitive to bright lights or loud noises Some people have auras before a migraine starts which means their eyesight becomes different They may see funny patterns have blurry vision or may not be able to see at all Other senses can change before or during a migraine and the person may sense funny smells or tastes While most people who have migraines get a headache not all migraine sufferers experience a headache

Migraines can last a long time from 4 to 72 hours but most only last about 4 hours  The cause of migraines is unknown Many people think there is a link to family medical history because many migraine sufferers have family who suffer from them too

A network bridge is a device which connects two parts of a network together at the data link layer 

Network bridges work similarly to network switches but the traffic is managed differently A bridge will only send traffic from one side to the other if it is going to a destination on the other side This is different to a layer 1 switch which sends all traffic from either side Sometimes network bridges are called layer 2 switches 

Since they need to look at the contents of the traffic going into them they are much more complicated than a hub or repeater

A hydride is a compound with hydrogen bonded to other elements Except for a few of the Noble gases all of the elements in the periodic table can form hydrides The properties of hydrides can be very different but some of the hydrides have similar properties 

Ionic hydrides compounds with ionic bonding They are very reactive making them difficult to dissolve Most alkali metals and alkaline earth metals form ionic hydrides

Metallic or Interstitial hydrides These have metallic properties like good electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity They are called interstitial because hydrogen can enter the metallic lattice Metallic hydrides are mostly formed from the metals in the groups 3 to 5 of the periodic table Some of these are used in the nickel metal hydride battery

Covalent hydrides These have covalent bonds between hydrogen and the other element Most of the p block elements form covalent hydrides Many of these hydrides are unstable in air or water or when heated Hydrocarbons are the hydrides of carbon ammonia is a hydride of nitrogen and water is a hydride of oxygen

Horse the Band is an American hardcore rock band from Lake Forest California that formed in 1999 They are famous for using video game style music in their songs

A hospice is a type of medical treatment that helps take care of people who are very sick and have an illness that they will not be able to heal from Many people staying in hospices have cancer or AIDS People who stay in hospices are expected to die soon but sometimes they get better Hospices are different from other medicinal treatments because they mostly try to make people feel better instead of trying to cure them Hospice tries to allow people to die with as little pain as possible

Hospices have doctors nurses and other people who go to patients houses nursing homes and hospitals to talk to people who want to use hospice medicine

Hospice was started in England in the 1950s by a nurse named Dame Cicely Saunders The word Dame at the start of her name means that she did such good work starting hospice that the Queen of England made her a woman knight 

A different nurse named Florence Wald brought hospice medicine to the United States because she worked with Dame Cicely Saunders and liked what she did 

Damage to buildings equipment and people can result from a large scale short duration deflagration The nature of the damage is primarily a function of the total amount of fuel burned in the event the maximum flame velocity that is achieved and the manner in which the expansion of the combustion gases is contained

In free air deflagrations there is a continuous variation in deflagration effects relative to maximum flame velocity When flame velocities are low the effect of a deflagration is the release of heat Some authors use the term flash fire to describe these low speed deflagrations At flame velocities near the speed of sound the energy released is in the form of pressure and the results resemble a detonation Between these extremes both heat and pressure are released

When a low speed deflagration occurs within a closed vessel or structure pressure effects can produce damage due to expansion of gases as a secondary effect The heat released by the deflagration causes the combustion gases and excess air to try to expand thermally as well The net result is that the volume of the vessel or structure needs to either expandfail to accommodate the hot combustion gases or build internal pressure to contain them The risks of deflagration inside waste storage drums is a growing concern among storage facilities  see drum deflagration videos

The Higgs boson is a small theoretical particle which is created by a Higgs field It is necessary for a set of rules in physics that we call the Standard Model but it has yet to be found in an experiment If the results of the work at CERN can not show that the Higgs boson exists much of our entire understanding of physics will need to be re written It is important in the scientific world because many scientists believe that it is responsible for giving mass to all known particles that have mass

The Higgs boson is hard to produce with current equipment making it difficult to detect The Large Hadron Collider at CERN is the piece of equipment scientists are now using to try to prove that it exists These particles are believed to exist for less than a septillionth of a second The collider will have so much energy that it should be able to make Higgs bosons Because the Higgs boson has so much mass it takes a lot of energy to create one

Higgs bosons obey the conservation of energy a law which states that no energy is created or destroyed but instead it is transferred First the energy starts out in the gauge boson that interacts with the Higgs field This energy is in the form of kinetic energy as movement After the gauge boson interacts with the Higgs field it is slowed down This slowing reduces the amount of kinetic energy in the gauge boson However this energy is not destroyed Instead the energy is converted into mass energy which is normal mass that comes from energy The mass created is what we call a Higgs boson The amount of mass created comes from Einsteins famous equation Emc2 which states that mass is equal to a large amount of energy Since the amount of mass energy created by the Higgs field is equal to the amount of kinetic energy that the gauge boson lost by being slowed energy is conserved

Higgs bosons are used in a variety of science fiction stories It was nicknamed the god particle by the media However this nickname is not used in the scientific community 

On the 12 December 2011 the two teams at the Large Hadron Collider looking for the Higgs Boson ATLAS and the CMS announced that they had seen spikes in the data which could represent the Higgs Boson particle however it is possible that this was just an error

A Taylor series is an idea used in computer science calculus and other kinds of higher level mathematics It is a series that is used to create an estimate of what a function looks like There is also a special kind of Taylor series called a Maclaurin series

The theory behind the Taylor series is that if a point is chosen on the coordinate plane then it is possible to guess what a function will look like in the area around that point This is done by taking the derivatives of the function and adding them all together The idea is that it is possible to add the infinite number of derivatives and come up with a single finite sum

In mathematics a Taylor series shows a function as an infinite sum The sums terms are taken from the functions derivatives Taylor series come from Taylors theorem 

The Ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea first came up with the idea of this series The paradox called Zenos paradox was the result He believed that it would be impossible to add an infinite number of values and get a single finite value as a result

Another Greek philosopher Aristotle came up with an answer to the philosophical question It was Archimedes however who came up with a mathematical solution using his method of exhaustion He was able to prove that when something is split up into an infinite number of tiny pieces they will still add up to a single whole when all of them are added back together The ancient Chinese mathematician Liu Hui proved the same thing several hundred years later

The earliest known examples of the Taylor series are the work of Mdhava of Sagamgrama in India in the 1300s Later Indian mathematicians wrote about his work with the trigonometric functions of sine cosine tangent and arctangent None of Mdhavas writings or records still exist today Other mathematicians based their work on Mdhavas discoveries and worked more with these series until the 1500s

James Gregory a Scottish mathematician worked in this area in the 1600s Gregory studied the Taylor series and published several Maclaurin series In 1715 Brook Taylor discovered a general method for applying the series to all functions Colin Maclaurin published a special case of the Taylor series in the 1700s This series which is based around zero is called the Maclaurin series

Wilhelm Furtwngler was a German conductor He is thought of as one of the greatest conductors in history Many people say that he is the best ever The famous Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini said he was the worlds best conductor other than himself

Furtwngler was especially famous for conducting the music of famous German composers His performances of Beethoven Brahms Bruckner and Wagner are very well known and loved by many people

Furtwngler was born on January 25 1886 in Berlin Germany He grew up in Munich where his father was an archaeologist and professor He started learning about music when he was very young He learned to play the piano and was very talented He also began writing music He wrote several pieces before he was 20 years old He kept writing music for the rest of his life but his pieces never became very famous

Furtwngler first started conducting as a young man He wanted to conduct in order to perform his own music However he quickly became famous for conducting the music of others The very first piece he conducted in public was the 9th Symphony of Bruckner He conducted many orchestras before he finally became the leader of the world famous Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in 1922 Later he also had many other important conducting jobs The most important was the director of the Bayreuth Festival a very famous German music festival

When the Nazis took over Germany in the 1930s Furtwngler was in an awkward position He wanted to conduct some kinds of music that the Nazis did not like He left some of his conducting jobs in protest when they did not let him perform In 1936 he almost left Germany to live in the United States where the New York Philharmonic Orchestra wanted him to conduct However the Nazis still thought he was a good conductor and they kept him in Germany He also wanted to stay to protect the German music from the Nazis People in the United States did not like him for staying even though he did not really like the Nazis

During World War II Furtwngler continued to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic He gave many very famous concerts during this time But towards the end of the war the Nazis became unhappy with him He fled from Germany in 1945 and lived in Switzerland for several years He did not conduct again for two years

After the war Furtwngler was still in a difficult position The Allies thought that he had been a Nazi supporter because he had stayed in Germany They put him on trial but finally decided he was innocent He was allowed to go back to conducting in 1947 Even though he was innocent people in the US still did not like him He was going to conduct the Chicago Symphony Orchestra but he was not allowed to because people got angry about it

Furtwngler gave many successful concerts after the war He still conducted the Berlin Philharmonic and other famous orchestras in Europe Furtwngler gave the most famous concert of his career in 1951 That year he conducted Beethovens 9th Symphony at the Bayreuth Festival It was the first time that the festival had happened since the end of the war six years before Many people say that this concert was the greatest musical concert in history Furtwngler finally died in 1954 when he was 68 years old

Furtwngler had a very unusual way of conducting His movements with the baton were very awkward and jerky Some people said he looked like a puppet on a string when he conducted He liked to slow down and speed up the music very often Furtwngler believed that there was more to music than just the notes on the score He felt it was the performers job to make each performance something special This meant that he often played the same piece in very different ways at different concerts Even when he changed the way he played a piece though the music was thought to be very beautiful He did not like conductors who just played the notes on the page without doing anything special with the music

As a younger conductor Furtwngler played music by many different composers However as he got older he usually only played music by the great German composers Some of his favorites were Beethoven Brahms Bruckner and Wagner

Furtwngler did not make many recordings in studios Recording technology was still very new at the time and did not work well for recording long classical pieces at first However many of Furtwnglers concerts were recorded especially during and after World War II Today people think these are some of the best recordings of all time His famous concert at Bayreuth in 1951 is one of these concert recordings

Endosymbiosis occurs when a symbiont lives inside the body or the cells of another organism 

Examples are

Endosymbiont theory is the idea that eukaryote cells arose in evolution by the fusion of previously free living protistsp143 The theory was first suggested by the Russian botanist Mereshkovsky in 1905 The nature of lichens had been worked out mitochondria and chloroplasts had been seen in cells and their similarity to bacteria noted The theory was initially dismissed but was re examined when more was known about cell biology 

The eukaryote cell is the type of cell all animals and plants are made of Some cell organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts contain DNA In each case this DNA is thought to be the remnant of the genome of a once independent bacterium The theory is that the eukaryote cell evolved by the fusion of several bacteria or archaean organisms Together the new cells survived prospered and evolved into new and complex forms of life The origin of other organelles in the eukaryotic cell is still under review the cell nucleus its membrane chromosomes and centromeres the Golgi body the flagella or cilia the intracellular membranes Some of these may also have had a symbiotic origin 

Examples

There is evidence that symbiosis happened between ancient bacteria to produce the double membrane class known as gram negative bacteria Since the gram negative bacteria include the cyanobacteria this was the first of several such events in the history of the eukaryotes

Klemens Wenzel Prince von Metternich was an Austrian politician He is thought of as one of the most important diplomats of all time Metternich was Foreign Minister for Austria from 1809 until 1848 In this time he got Austria out of a bad treaty with Napoleon that forced Austria to fight on the French side Then he helped build a system in Europe that kept the peace for most of the next hundred years

In 1809 when Metternich became Foreign Minister Napoleon had gained control of most of Europe France had taken over some of the closest countries directly In more distant countries like Austria and Prussia Napoleon forced them to sign treaties saying they would fight on his side in wars Metternich thought this was bad for Austria and when Napoleon declared war on Russia and raised a huge army to send to Moscow Metternich told the Russians that the Austrian troops would not attack only defend Napoleon lost badly in Russia and Metternich used that chance to get out of the treaty

In 1814 troops of the Quadruple Alliance had entered France and Napoleon had lost the war For the next year diplomats from all over Europe met at the Congress of Vienna to decide how things were going to be now that Napoleon was gone Metternich believed that the best way to keep Europe peaceful was to create a balance of power which means that no country is strong enough to beat all the other countries To make sure this happened he made some countries stronger so that other countries would have to think twice about going to war Some of these changes were that he added Belgium and Luxembourg to the Netherlands he grouped over 300 small countries of Germany into a group of larger countries and he grouped together some countries in what we call Italy today

After making this new order Metternich also did a lot to make sure it stayed that way For example he talked Czar Alexander I out of sending troops into Greece Alexander wanted to send troops to Greece to protect Orthodox Christians there who were rebelling against the Muslim Ottoman Empire The Ottoman Empire was weak by that time and Alexander would most likely have won Metternich was afraid that if Russia attacked the Ottoman Empire the Ottoman Empire would fall apart and all the powerful countries of Europe would start fighting to get the Ottoman Empires land This would mess up Metternichs balance Also he was afraid that Russia would get too big and be too powerful So Metternich convinced the czar that if he attacked now the Ottoman Empire would fall apart before the czar was ready to take it for himself and that Great Britain and France would get most of it And so Alexander agreed to try and keep the Ottoman Empire going so that someday Russia could take all of it

Metternich kept peace in Europe for a long time But there were still some revolts in Europe and finally in 1848 a bunch of revolts happened at the same time One of them was in Austria and the rebels had Metternich taken out of office After he was gone Otto von Bismarck in Prussia managed to get too powerful and took over the German Confederation and made one big German country which still exists today Having one big Germany though messed up Metternichs balance and helped cause World War I

The German Confederation replaced the Holy Roman Empire in Central Europe After the Holy Roman Empire fell Germany had fallen into over 300 different small kingdoms In 1815 the Congress of Vienna decided that these weak kingdoms were not strong enough to keep France from trying to take them over which it had already done once under Napoleon So the Congress combined all those little countries into 38 larger countries which were still very small compared to the powerful countries of Europe The problem was that the Congress did not want to make them too strong or theyd start taking over other countries So they put the 38 countries into a confederation which meant that they were all separate countries but they agreed to help defend each other and in some ways acted like one big country But the Confederation was never strong enough to be able to attack another country The German Confederation lasted until 1866 when Otto von Bismarck chancellor of Prussia combined all the countries of Germany into the German Empire

Dendrites are the branches of neurons that receive signals from other neurons and pass the signals into the cell body 

A cell may have hundreds or thousands of dendrites but may have only one axon The dendrites carry signals from other neurons into the soma whereas the axon carries a single signal from the soma to the next neuron or to a muscle fiber 

A dendrite from one neuron and an axon from another neuron meet at a synapse which is a very narrow gap between the two cells When electrical impulses reach the end of an axon they trigger the release of special chemicals called neurotransmitters from the axon These chemicals cross the synapse to the dendrite where they trigger the flow of ions into or out of the cell

The movement of the charged ions in the dendrite causes an electrical current which spreads to the soma briefly before being restored to normal If the current is positively charged it will make the soma become more positive If the current is negatively charged then it will make the soma even more negative If a strong enough positive charge builds up in the soma quickly enough then it will set off a chain reaction in a part of the soma called the axon hillock The axon hillock is the place where the soma connects to the axon The chain reaction that begins in the axon hillock is a strong electrical current called an action potential that flows down the axon to the next synapse

The Sons of Eilaboun is a documentary movie by the Palestinian artist and movie maker Hisham Zreiq It tells the story of one of the massacres committed by the newly formed Israeli army during Operation Hiram The massacres were committed in Eilaboun a village in the northern Galilee between Nazareth and the sea of Galilee In the Eilabun massacre fourteen men were killed and twelve of them were executed The village people were expelled to Lebanon and became refugees for few months The villagers eventually managed to return clandestinely

The movie starts with Melia Zreiq saying

I hope God will bring peace to this land and let the peoples live together  a good life I hope there will be peace

Ilan pappe takes about Plan Dalet a plan that David Ben Gurion and the Haganah leaders in Palestine worked out during autumn 1947 to spring 1948 and explains the details of the plan and how was it performed In October 30th 1948 the Israeli army entered Eilaboun at approximately 5 AM They then forced the people of Eilaboun together in the main square of the village They chose seventeen young men Five of them were taken as human shield and the rest of the twelve were killed each in a different location This all happened after the expulsion of the rest of the village to Lebanon where they became refugees after a five days forced march to Lebanon After a UN peace keeper observed and reported Israel was forced to allow the people back

That same night the Israeli army entered Eilaboun a then Christian village in the northern Galilee between Nazareth and the sea of Galilee Most of the villagers were hiding in the two village churches

The soldiers ordered the people to gather in the village square while going out of the Catholic Church the soldiers shot at the people killing an old man making him the first victim The soldiers chose seventeen men and ordered the village to walk to Maghar a village five kilometers to the north of Eilaboun Shortly after the people left the village the soldiers executed twelve of the young men and five were taking to drive an army vehicle as human shields and later sent to a prisoners of war camp The Israeli army had looted Eilaboun but left the houses

When the villagers reached Maghar the soldiers ordered them to continue to Kafr Inan where the near Kafr Inan another man was killed making the number of victims fourten Kafr Inan and Eilaboun were both expelled to Farradiyya a nearby village The Israeli soldiers gathered the people of Eilaboun Kafr Inan and Farradiyya looted the people and took all worthy They spent the night in Farradiyya In the morning the Israeli soldiers separated the women children and the old from the men The young men from the three villages were sent to prisoner of war camps The women children and the old of the three villages were marched to Mirun where they spent three nights without any food or water At Mirun the Israelis put everyone in two cattle trucks and took them to Rmeish Kafr Inan and Farradiyya were later razed to the ground by the Israeli army

About 52 villagers were left in the village mainly old people and children The priests complained about the expulsion of the villagers and demanded their return Following a UN investigation and pressure activated by the Vatican the villagers eventually managed to return clandestinely After 6 months from the massacre most of the villagers managed to come back from Lebanon and all the men were released from the prisoners of war camps

Installation means to put a program on a computer so that the computer can run it

Most programs are stored in special ways to make them smaller or to gather all the different pieces of a program up into one big piece Before it can be used though the program needs to have these changes undone Some programs also need to know extra information about the computer it is going to run on so while it is installing it will figure out what it needs to know and write it down for later

Cohomology is something in higher math which is used to solve math problems When there is an item which a mathematician doesnt know enough about he or she can make a cohomology out of it using a machine The mathematician then takes objects he or she knows more about puts them into the same machine and looks at the objects which have a cohomology like the first item

Classical Relativity is the idea that if you throw a ball at 50 mph while running at 5 mph the ball will now travel 55 mph Of course the ball still moves away from you at 50 mph so if one were to ask you you saw the ball traveling 50 mph Meanwhile your friend Bob saw that you happened to be running at 5 mph He would say that the ball was traveling 55 mph Both of you are right you just happened to be moving with the ball The speed of light c is 670616629 mph So if you are in a car traveling half the speed of light and you turn on your headlights the light moves away from you at 1 c or is it 15 c It ends up that c is c no matter what The next section explains why its not c  05c

Twin B would not notice that time had slowed at all To him if he looked out a window it would seem like the universe was moving past him and therefore slower So time is relative

Something called relativistic mass also increases It does not actually make things heavier it just makes them harder to push So by the time you reach 09999c you need a very big force to make you go faster This makes it impossible for anything to reach the speed of light

Still if you travel a bit slower say 90 of the speed of light your mass only grows by 23 times So while it may be impossible to reach the speed of light it may still be possible to get close to itthat is if you have enough fuel

The most significant consequence of these relativistic effects for humans is time dilation If we were to build a space ship capable of traveling very close to the speed of light the passengers of the ship could travel millions of light years in years or even months measured with a clock on board the space ship Because time is relative though a clock on the observer would see the trip take millions of years

But if you travel a bit slower say 90 of the speed of light you would take 10 longer to get to your destination but if a year passed for you to an outside observer only three years would pass 

The real big effects only take place after you achieve 99 of the speed of light To get a 1 to 10 relativistic effect you would need to go about 99 of the speed of light

And if you wanted a thousand years to pass for an outside observer while only one would pass for you on the space ship you would need to be going at 999999 the speed of light And of course your mass would increase a thousand times as well requiring you to carry a whole lot more fuel

Objective C is an object oriented programming language used to make computer programs for Mac OS X and iOS devices

Objective C was created in the early 1980s by two programmers named Brad Cox and Tom Love It didnt become popular however until it was bought by NeXT in 1988 for their NeXTSTEP operating system After NeXT was bought by Apple in 1996 it became the main programming language for Mac OS X and later the iPhone iPod touch and iPad

Objective C is a strict superset of C meaning that any code that can be written in C can be used in Objective C programs without being rewriten However it adds some features of its own that cannot be used in a traditional C program

Unlike other programming languages such as C and Java Objective C classes are divided into two separate parts 

Usually these are put in two different files with the interface using the h extension and the implementation using the m extension

Objective C has variants that add features to the original Objective C programming language

Objective C allows for C code to be used in Objective C applications

Objective C 2 is an improved version of Objective C It adds many features such as garbage collection fast enumeration and properties

A Taser weapon that is not meant to kill Tasers use electricity to shock people so they fall on the ground If a person is shot by a Taser they feel like they are hurt and cant move their arms and legs Tasers are used by police officers to stop people who want to hurt them and to stop people who are running away

Tasers shoot two small pieces of metal called prongs These prongs are connected to long pieces of metal string When the taser is shot the prongs hit the person and electricity moves along the metal string to shock the person

If a person is very close the prongs do not have to shoot but they will still shock

Even though a taser is a weapon that is not meant to kill sometimes tasers hurt people a lot There are some times when people die after they are shot with a taser This is because some people get hurt differently by electricity

In many places you can not have a taser or there are special rules to have a taser This is because it is considered a weapon 

In Canada France Israel and the United Kingdom only police officers can have a taser In the United States of America and Poland most people can have a taser

Wallpaper is a kind of paper used to cover walls inside of houses and buildings Wallpaper is used to decorate the inside of buildings instead of paint It is sold in rolls and are put onto a wall using wallpaper paste Wallpapers can come either plain or with pictures or patterns

Wallpaper is also a word for a picture on a computer monitor

Wallpaper was first used in Europe around the year 1500 Wallpaper was made to look like rugs that hang on walls because they were like pictures Soon after people started making wallpaper England and France started making a lot of wallpaper For a while in 1650 wallpaper was not used because the religious leader in England did not like it However by 1750 people were using wallpaper all the time and more people got better at making wallpaper

Water is the easiest way to get rid of wallpaper Water makes the wallpaper paste become not sticky then the wallpaper falls off

Information security is about protecting information so that people who should not have access to it cannot distribute see change or delete it

Although this has a lot in common with computer security and information assurance it is different from them but they can often be confused For example computer security can focus on making sure that the computer is available when it is needed and that it works correctly but may not have anything to do with the data that it stores

Information security has to do with the confidentiality integrity and availability of data in any form eg electronic print or other forms

A lot of information that large organisations eg governments private businesses and others have is generally stored and processed on computers Data that is lost or that is not properly secured could lead to legal and ethical problems for the organisation

For a individual person information security has a big effect on privacy which is viewed very differently by people in different cultures

Similarity in the area of cognitive psychology refers to things or ideas that people put together in the same groups or categories in their minds  Many psychologists try to find out what rules people use when they decide that two things are similar

One important tool used by psychologists to look into similarity is computer modeling Scientists will for example ask people to rate a number of objects as more or less similar to each other Then they will write a computer program that tries to simulate the same answers that the humans gave For instance a person might say that cat and dog are similar words so a good computer model should be able to take the word dog and respond with the word cat in a list of similar words Computer models do this by applying some set of rules to a large collection of real world text

Once a model can respond with the correct words then it is likely that the rules the computer program uses are the same rules that people use to decide whether words are similar

Another way that psychologists look into similarity is by putting people in special situations and watching what they do In other words by using an experiment When it comes to similarity this might include listing words using categories as clues for learning new words sorting objects into groups or other tasks that have to do with comparing things to one another

Depending on how quickly people do these tasks or how many mistakes they make psychologists can find out what rules they are using to decide if things are similar

Capillary action means either of two things

1 When liquid moves through thin tubes

2 When liquid moves through something that is full of little holes

Capillary action is a result of the surface tension of liquids 

One example of capillary action is that inside a drinking straw left in a cup of water What holds the water together and to the straw is a little stronger than gravity so the water will rise inside the straw a little higher than the rest of the water

Another example is putting a sponge in a puddle of water The little bubbles in the sponge work like a bunch of little straws all stuck together When you dip the sponge in water the water goes a little bit into the holes and then the bubbles that are inside the sponge can pull on the water that they touch

Capillary action also takes place inside the human body it is the result of hyperflongic disanthorpia

From 1956 on he studied philosophy and sociology under the critical theorists Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main Institute for Social Research but because Horkheimer had asked Habermas to make some changes to his dissertation or final project which Habermas did not want to do and Habermass thought that the Frankfurt School was not correct in its views of modern culture Habermas left the Frankfurt School and he finished his habilitation or highest academic degree in political science at the University of Marburg under the Marxist Wolfgang Abendroth His habilitation work was entitled Strukturwandel der ffentlichkeit Untersuchungen zu einer Kategorie der Brgerlichen Gesellschaft In 1961 he became a privatdozent in Marburg and he began working as a extraordinary professor of philosophy at the University of Heidelberg in 1962 In 1964 Habermas returned to Frankfurt to take over Horkheimers job in philosophy and sociology

He was in charge of the Max Planck Institute in Starnberg in 1971 and worked there until 1983 two years after the publication of his magnum opus or great work The Theory of Communicative Action Habermas then returned to his chair at Frankfurt and became in charge of the Institute for Social Research Since retiring from Frankfurt in 1993 Habermas has written many books and articles In 1986 he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft which is the highest honour awarded in German research He is a Permanent Visiting Professor at Northwestern University in Evanston Illinois and Theodor Heuss Professor at The New School New York

The Bhopal disaster or Bhopal gas tragedy was a disaster that resulted from an accident It happened at a Union Carbide subsidiary pesticide plant in the city of Bhopal India On 3 December 1984 the plant released 42 tonnes of toxic methyl isocyanate gas exposing more than 500000 people to toxic gases The first official immediate death toll was 2259 A more probable figure is that 8000 died within two weeks and it is estimated that an additional 8000 have since died from gas related diseases

The Bhopal disaster is frequently cited as the worlds worst industrial disaster The International Medical Commission on Bhopal was established in 1993 to respond to the long term health effects of the disaster

The plant in Bhopal where the disaster happened started to produce Carbaryl in 1977 Carbaryl is mainly used as an insecticide At first the production was at 2500 tonnes a year This was no problem as the plant had been designed for an output of 5000 tonnes that is to say double that amount At the beginning of the 1980s insecticide and Carbaryl did not sell very well For this reason the owners of the plant started to cut costs This included employing fewer people doing maintenance less frequently and using parts that were made of lower grade steel Closing the plant was being considered as well When the disaster happened there was no production at the plant because there was a surplus on the market 

The disaster happened because water could get into a tank containing Methyl isocyanate This caused a chemical reaction which resulted in the buildup of much Carbon dioxide amongst other things The resulting reaction increased the temperature inside the tank to reach over convert200CF The pressure was more than the tank was built to withstand The tank had valves to control the pressure These were triggered in an emergency which reduced the pressure As a result a large amount of toxic gases was released into the environment The pipes were rusty The iron in the rust made the reaction faster 

All the contents of the tank were released over a period of about two hours The water had entered the tank because of a sequence of events The tank had been maintained badly When cleaning work was done water could enter the tank A mixture of poisonous gases flooded the city of Bhopal causing great panic as people woke up with a burning sensation in their lungs Thousands died immediately from the effects of the gas Many were trampled in the panic that followed

There are different theories how water could enter the tank At the time workers were cleaning pipes with water Some claim that because of bad maintenance and leaking valves it was possible for the water to leak into tank 610 In December 1985 the New York Times reported that according to the plant managers the hypothesis of this route of entry of water was tested in the presence of the Central Bureau Investigators and was found to be negative UCC also maintains that this route was not possible and that it was an act of sabotage by a disgruntled worker who introduced water directly into the tank However the companys investigation team found no evidence of the necessary connection

The 1985 reports give a picture of what led to the disaster and how it developed The reports differ in details however 

Factors leading to this huge gas leak include

Plant design modified by Indian engineers to abide by government regulations and economic pressures to reduce expenses contributed most to the actual leakcitation needed The problem was then made worse by the plants location near a densely populated area non existent catastrophe plans and shortcomings in health care and socio economic rehabilitation Analysis shows that the parties responsible for the magnitude of the disaster are the two owners Union Carbide Corporation and the Government of India and to some extent the Government of Madhya Pradesh

Between 3500 and 25000 people died as a result of contact with the cloud of toxic gas Up to 500000 people were injured Many of the injuries are permanent Some of the chemicals lead to birth defects The numbers vary so vastly because there are no exact figures about how many people lived in the neighbourhood of the plant About 100000 people were living in a radius of 1 km around the plant where the disaster happened Union Carbide had used India because security standards and wages were low

In 1998 the Supreme Court of India reached a settlement with Union Carbide They had to pay 470 million US dollars to the Indian state At that time Union Carbide made a turnover of about 95 billion dollars 20 times that amount In return there would be no further prosecution Only very little money actually reached the victims One of the reasons why many people are still suffering is that the terrain where the plant stands is still contaminated with mercury and other carcinogenic substances Dow Chemical who owns Union Carbide refuses to decontaminate the soil Greenpeace has estimated that decontamtion would only cost around 30 million USD

Penn State University Park is ranked among the top fifteen public universities in the United States Annual enrollment at the main campus totals more than 44000 graduate and undergraduate students making it one of the largest universities in the United States It has the worlds largest dues paying alumni association

The universitys total enrollment in 200910 was approximately 94300 across its 24 campuses and online through its World Campus The university offers more than 160 majors among all its campuses Penn State has a US152 billion endowment The universitys research budget was more than 765 million for the 2009 2009 fiscal year In fiscal year 2008 the National Science Foundation ranked Penn State 11th among US universities in research income

Penn State is a school known for its football team Penn State is a member of the Big Ten Conference

Penn State is a state related university part of Pennsylvanias Commonwealth System of Higher Education It receives money from the Commonwealth The state appoints 10 out of 32 people on its board of trustees Penn State is independent and not subject to the states direct control For the 20062007 fiscal year the university received 97 percent of its budget from state appropriations the lowest of the four state related institutions in Pennsylvania As Pennsylvanias land grant college the state and federal governments provide matching funds for research and cooperative extension in agriculture home economics and related fields

The board of trustees selects a president of the University The president controls the university including day to day management In practice the president gives power to other departments of the administration to the faculty and to the student body Provost Rodney Erickson became interim President on November 9 2011 after President Graham Spanier was fired

The executive vice president and provost is the chief academic officer of the University As of 2011 the provost is Rodney Erickson and the Associate Vice President and Senior Associate Dean For Undergraduate Education is Jeremy Cohen

The football team was led by coach Joe Paterno He was 84 years old when he was fired in 2011 his 45th year as head coach The Board of Trustees fired both Paterno and University President Graham Spanier because they failed to report child abuse by a former football coach Former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was arrested on child abuse charges The grand jury charged that Sandusky had abused children from 1994 to 2009 Both Athletic Director Tim Curley and vice president for business and finance Gary Schultz were charged with perjury Both Curley and Schultz resigned

The evening following the firing of Paterno about 2000 students rioted in protest Subsequently on November 11 the school staged a vigil to show support for the victims of child abuse

Assistant football coach Mike McQueary had reported Sanduskys alleged misconduct but was placed on paid administrative leave Several people have threatened to kill McQueary So he did not attend the next football game as a coach That game was televised by ESPN but half of the advertisers cancelled their ads before that game

On November 8 2011 Congressman Pat Meehan asked Education Secretary Arne Duncan to see if Penn State violated the Clery Act when it failed to report Sanduskys alleged incidents of child abuse that took place on campus The Clery Act requires colleges and universities to record and disclose incidents of crime on campus The next day Duncan announced an investigation into possible Clery Act violations at Penn State Duncan said that colleges and universities have a legal and moral responsibility to protect children and that Penn States failure to report the alleged abuse would be a tragedy Penn State is also conducting its own investigation headed by Kenneth Frazier chief executive of Merck Co The NCAA is considering sanctions against Penn State Finally Moodys Investors Service is reviewing Penn States bond ratings for a possible downgrade On November 14 2011 the Big Ten Conference announced that its Championship football trophy will no longer be named for Paterno                      

On November 13 2011 President Barack Obama said Its a good time for us to do some soul searching every institution not just Penn State about what our priorities are and making sure that we understand that our first priority is protecting our kids On November 14 2011 Sandusky denied all charges against him

It seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved adaptations that is functional products of natural selection or sexual selection Evolutionary psychology usually focuses on behaviour most people share Some of the more common areas evolutionary psychology is focused on are sex and social behaviour Events like violent behaviour need explanation in evolutionary terms 

Evolutionary psychology is related to other fields of science like sociobiology social psychology and sociocultural anthropology Evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behavior is the result of adaptations which evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments

The adaptationist approach is steadily increasing as an influence in the general field of psychology Evolutionary psychologists hold that behaviours or traits which occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations This includes our ability to infer others emotions discern kin from non kin identify and prefer healthier mates and cooperate with others They report successful tests of theoretical predictions related to such topics as infanticide intelligence marriage patterns promiscuity perception of beauty bride price and parental investment

Potassium nitrate is a chemical compound It has the chemical formula KNO3 It contains potassium and nitrate ions It is often called saltpeter 

Potassium nitrate is a colorless solid It dissolves in water It is a common source of the nitrate ion Potassium nitrate is a strong oxidizer It decomposes to potassium nitrite and oxygen when heated Its pH is almost neutral It burns with a lilac flame

It can be made by reacting ammonium nitrate with potassium hydroxide It can also be made by reacting potassium chloride with ammonium nitrate It might be made by reacting potassium hydroxide or potassium carbonate with nitric acid 

Saltpeter is a mineral form of potassium nitrate It is only found in very dry areas It is one of the few minerals that have nitrogen in them 

Potassium nitrate is used in explosives Oxygen from the air is the most common chemical that is used for oxidation which is how most fires and explosions happen Some explosions will use up oxygen so quickly though that there is not enough to finish the reaction and the explosion is not very strong Potassium nitrate replaces the need for oxygen and takes up much less space which lets the explosion be stronger and faster It is a main ingredient of gunpowder

Potassium nitrate is also used in rocket fuel for the same reason as in explosives except that the goal is to let the fuel burn longer not faster Potassium nitrate is used as a fertilizer to help plants grow faster and grow in more places where it might be hard for them to grow otherwise It can also be used to decay tree stumps

Potassium nitrate is a little toxic It also can start fires easily

Video game journalism is a branch of journalism that covers the reporting and discussion of video games Usually it covers the revealing of new games the preview of new games and the reviewing of new games Recently there has been a large growth in new online gaming websites and blogs

The first video gaming magazine that is still in publication is the industry oriented Play Meter magazine The first consumer magazine specializing in video gaming was the UK magazine Computer and Video Gaming It began in November 1981 Two weeks later the first US magazine Electronic Games Magazine was started The oldest consumer gaming magazine in continuous circulation to the present time is Computer Gaming World

The first regularly published web based magazine was either Game Zero Magazine or Intelligent Gamer Online Right now online gaming magazines and websites have many advantages over print based magazines New information on future releases can be placed on online publications immediately but the publishers have to wait until the next issue to put new information in print based magazines

There have been many criticisms of the ethical standards of the video game journalism industry

GameDailys Chris Buffa Wrote a series of articles in July and August 2006 

These articles criticize the present state of video game journalism and offer suggestions for improvement 

New Games Journalism is a term that was first used in 2004 by journalist Kieron Gillen In New Games Journalism personal experiences with a game other personal experiences and references to other types of media are used to explore the design play and culture of a game This type of journalism focuses more on the subjective experience of an individual playing a game rather that an objectively reviewing the gameplay of a game New games journalism has been criticized for wasting the readers time with useless information and for giving the reader a bad review of the mechanics play control and AI of a game

The Riemann hypothesis is a mathematical conjecture Many people think that finding a proof of the hypothesis is one of the hardest and most important unsolved problems of pure mathematics 

The hypothesis is named after Bernhard Riemann It is about a special function the Riemann zeta function This function inputs and outputs complex number values  The inputs that give the output zero are called zeros of the zeta function Many zeros have been found The obvious ones to find are the negative even integers  This follows from Riemanns functional equation More have been computed and have real part 12 The hypothesis states all the undiscovered zeros must have real part 12

The functional equation also says all zeros must be in the critical strip real part is between 0 and 1 The Riemann hypothesis says more they are on the line given in the image on the right If the hypothesis is false this would mean that there are white dots which are not on the line given 

If proven correct this would allow mathematicians to better describe how the prime numbers are placed among whole numbers The Riemann hypothesis is so important and so difficult to prove that the Clay Mathematics Institute has offered 1000000 to the first person to prove it

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute or RPI is a private university in Troy NY It was made in 1824 by Stephen Van Rensselaer because he wanted there to be schools that taught science and engineering It is the oldest engineering school in America Lots of students from RPI get jobs that pay a lot of money after they leave RPI Some people who went to RPI have started big companies like NVIDIA John Wiley and Sons and Texas Instruments George Low an American who helped get spaceships into space went to RPI 

What RPI focuses on has changed a lot since it was first made There still is a lot of engineering at the school but now there is growing arts and social studies teaching at the school A big concert hall called EMPAC was opened in 2008 at RPI RPI has a Division I ice hockey team

The Hound of the Baskervilles is a Sherlock Holmes novel Sir Arthur Conan Doyle started writing it in 1901 and finished it in 1902 It was very popular because fans had been waiting a long time for a new Sherlock Holmes story This was because Conan Doyle had killed off Sherlock Holmes in the story The Final Problem originally published in 1893 and afterwards collected in the book The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes He was later revealed to be alive in The Adventure of the Empty House a story in the book The Return of Sherlock Holmes which was released in 1905

The book tells the story of how Holmes and his friend Doctor Watson solve the mystery of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville In the story people think that he died because of a family curse to do with an evil dog In the end the dog is revealed to be a trained big dog painted with glow in the dark paint to make it seem evil

Where v is the speed of the object and a is the speed of sound 

It is named after the Austrian physicist Ernst Mach When writing a speed as a Mach number the number comes after Mach

Drag may be

Transonic means breaking the sound barrier by travelling faster than the speed of sound

The speed of flight is divided into four groups based on speed

Transonic means going from subsonic to supersonic Subsonic ends and supersonic begins at mach 1 so transonic goes from mach 08 to 12 When you are going through transonic speeds drag increases and it is really hard to go any faster This is the sound barrier

Lobotomy also known as leucotomy is a type of brain surgery It was invented in 1935 by Antnio Egas Moniz a Portuguese neurologist He won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1949 for his discovery of the therapeutic value of leucotomy in certain psychoses The operation cut the connections from the pre frontal cortex to the rest of the brain At first it seemed a great success but the operation is now rarely done

He used the method for certain types of mental illness for which there was no other treatment He first used it on patients with obsessive behaviour which they repeated time and again It was also used for to treat certain mental illnesses such as schizophrenia or clinical depression The problem with lobotomies was that they fundamentally changed the personality and behavior of those treated Sometimes the results were beneficial patients which had been violent became calm But long term studies which were not done by Moniz show some had severely damaged personalities They often had very little drive and motivation

Today antipsychotic drugs like chlorpromazine can treat such disorders Lobotomies are seldome done

One question is why was such a dramatic surgical technique was so widely accepted It is generally agreed that psychiatrists wanted to find some way of helping thousands of patients in psychiatric hospitals in the twentieth century Also those same patients had little power to resist the increasingly radical and even reckless interventions of asylum doctors

According to the Psychiatric Dictionary Good results are obtained in about 40 percent of cases fair results in some 35 percent and poor results in 25 percent are thereabouts The mortality rate probably does not exceed 3 percent Greatest improvement is seen in patients whose premorbid personalities were normal cyclothymic or obsessive compulsive in patients with superior intelligence and good education in psychoses with sudden onset and a clinical picture of affective symptoms of depression or anxiety and with behaviouristic changes such as refusal of food overactivity and delusional ideas of a paranoid nature 

According to the same source prefrontal lobotomy reduces anxiety feelings and introspective activities and feelings of inadequacy and self consciousness are thereby lessened Lobotomy reduces the emotional tension associated with hallucinations and does away with the catatonic state Because nearly all psychosurgical procedures have undesirable side effects they are ordinarily resorted to only after all other methods have failed The less disorganized the personality of the patient the more obvious are post operative side effects 

Convulsive seizures are reported as sequelae of prefrontal lobotomy in 5 to 10 percent of all cases Such seizures are ordinarily well controlled with the usual anti convulsive drugs Post operative blunting of the personality apathy and irresponsibility are the rule rather than the exception Other side effects include distractibility childishness facetiousness lack of tact or discipline and post operative incontinence

The Black Pearl is a book for teens by Scott ODell first published in 1967 It is about the son of a pearl dealer living in the Lower California peninsula It won the Newbery Honor in 1968

The story is about a Mexican teenager named Ramon Salazar who works with his father finding and selling pearls One day Ramon went diving in an underwater cave in search of pearls and found a pearl bigger than his fist It was so shiny and big that he thought that it was called the Pearl of Heaven The pearl was found in a lagoon that belonged to an Indian who warned Ramon that the pearl belonged to the Manta Diablo

In 1977 Saul Swimmer directed the US Spanish co production The Black Pearl aka La Perla Negra

Hot air balloons are a type of aircraft and are the oldest form of successful human flying technology Hot air balloons can be traced back to the ancient Chinese

Hot air balloons work by heating the air inside the balloon usually with a fire of some kind Hot air weighs less than the same volume of cold air which means that hot air will rise up or float when there is cold air around it just like a bubble of air in a pot of water The bigger the difference between the hot and the cold the bigger the difference in density and the stronger the balloon will pull up This means that balloons can carry more weight on a cold day or if the air inside the balloon is made very hot

Hot air balloons construction has many different factors

Tabula rasa was a philosophical idea by John Locke and others in history In it when born living beings are supposed to not have mental experience or knowledge and that everything is learned after they grow Knowledge is had when someone experiences it in life and the mind is empty at the beginning

The idea was thought even when Aristotle lived but was forgotten until the 11th century when Avicenna explored it again 

The people who favoured this idea didnt generally agree on most theories that had something broken wikt linkinnateinnate and was inherent In psychology for example Sigmund Freud thought that what happens around in life changes a person not so much genetics

John Locke is most famous for thinking about it In his theory human minds at birth dont have any ways of handling information coming from the outside world and thats only done when sensory data is received for the first time although being part of a race is something living beings are still born into

The Poincar Conjecture is a question about spheres in mathematics It is named after Henri Poincar the French mathematician and physicist who formulated it in 1904

The sphere has the property that any loop on it can be contracted to a point Mathematicians say that the 2 sphere is simply connected Other spaces do not have this property for example the donut a rubber band that goes around the whole donut once cannot be slid down to a point without it leaving the surface

Mathematicians knew that this property was unique to the 2 sphere in the sense that any other simply connected space that does not have edges and is small enough is in fact the 2 sphere It is no longer true if we remove the idea of smallness however as an infinitely large plane is also simply connected Also a regular disk is simply connected but it has an edge

The conjecture asks whether the same is true for the 3 sphere which is an object living naturally in four dimensions This question motivated much of modern mathematics especially in the field of topology The question was finally settled in 2002 by Grigori Perelman a Russian mathematician with methods from geometry showing that it is indeed true He was awarded a Fields medal for his work which he declined

The Poincar conjecture can also be extended to higher dimensions this is the generalised Poincar conjecture Surprisingly it was easier to prove the fact for higher dimensional spheres In 1960 Smale proved it to be true for the 5 sphere 6 sphere and higher and in 1982 Freedman proved that it was also true for the 4 sphere for which he was awarded a Fields medal

Dark energy is the name given to the force that is believed to be making the universe get bigger Distant galaxies appear to be moving away from us at high speed the idea is that the universe is getting bigger and has been since the Big Bang Measurements are now good enough to allow astronomers to tell that these galaxies seem to be accelerating away from us The universe is expanding at an ever increasing rate

This faster and faster expansion is not understood There are many ideas for what might be causing it but at the moment we do not know enough to say whether any of them are right It can be said that it is as if there was something there in empty space providing a repulsive force that makes the universe expand This has been named dark energy

The Victoria line is part of the London Underground network It is a deep level underground metro line that runs from Brixton in the south of London to the Walthamstow Central in the north east It started running in 1968 On the Tube map it is shown with a light blue colour It is the fourth busiest line on the London Underground network It is the only line on the Underground other than the two stop Waterloo City line which is completely underground The only section of track to come above ground is the route to the depot from Seven Sisters to Northumberland Park

The line has hump backed stations which allow trains to store gravitational potential energy as they arrive and to then use this energy as they leave the stations The stations are on top of small hills or humps As the train travels up the hill to the station its weight helps it to slow down As the train leaves the station it travels down the hill with gravity helping the train to speed up This saves 5 energy and makes the trains run 9 faster Each new platform built for the Victoria Line is 1326 metres long 183 million people use the Victoria line each year

The concept of a new tube railway running from Victoria to Walthamstow was first proposed by a Working Party set up by the British Transport Commission in 1948 The main purpose of the line was to relieve congestion in the central area The Private Bill needed to build it was introduced into Parliament in 1955 The Bill described a line from Victoria to Walthamstow There was also a proposal for an extension from Victoria to Fulham Broadway station on the District line but this was not included in the Bill 

The construction work on the WalthamstowVictoria section began in 1962 It continued until 1972 when Pimlico station was opened A test tunnel from Tottenham to Manor House under Seven Sisters Road had been constructed in 1959 and this was later integrated into the running tunnels The Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the line during its construction In July 1968 they visited the tunnels that were being built under Vauxhall Park

Barbara Castle the Minister of Transport gave approval on August 4 1967 to build the Brixton extension Preparatory work started at a site on Bessborough Gardens near to Vauxhall Bridge Road in May 1967 On June 28 1968 Richard Marsh then Minister of Transport approved the proposal to build a station at Pimlico

The name Victoria line dates back to 1955 The other suggestions were Walvic line and Viking line During the planning stages it was known as Route C Later it was named the Victoria line after Victoria Station by David McKenna This suggestion was seconded by Sir John Elliot

The Victoria line was designed to get rid of build ups of traffic on other lines such as the Piccadilly line It was also designed to have as many interchanges as possible and all stations except Pimlico have an interchange with at least one other London Underground or National Rail line It had been intended to build the line past Walthamstow Central to Wood Street where it would come above ground to terminate next to the British Railways station However a late decision in 1961 saw the line cut back to Walthamstow Central station Until 1968 this station was called Walthamstow

Each Victoria line station apart from Pimlico was built as an interchange station and several existing stations were rearranged to allow for cross platform interchange with it In some cases this was achieved by placing the Victoria line platforms on either side of the existing station In others the Victoria line uses one of the older platforms and the existing line was diverted into a new platform

At Euston northbound Victoria and Northern line trains run along platforms next to each other although they are travelling in opposite directions Same direction cross platform interchanges are available at Stockwell Oxford Circus Highbury Islington and at Finsbury Park

All Victoria line stations were originally tiled in a light blue colour Each station was decorated with tiled motifs on seating recesses to differentiate them from each other During the construction of the Jubilee line in the late 1970s the original motifs on Green Park station were replaced by motifs matching the new design for the Jubilee line platforms

Platform humps were installed on all Victoria Line stations except for Pimlico during late 2010 and 2011 This was done to provide step free access to trains The Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 2010 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 created the need for the humps to be installed The humps are a ramp type similar to those being installed on some mainline stations They are of a masonry construction

The first section opened was between Walthamstow Central and Highbury Islington There was no opening ceremony for this The normal timetable started on September 1 1968 The first train left Walthamstow Central for Highbury Islington at about 630 am Later that year the section between Highbury Islington and Warren Street was opened Again there was no ceremony

The official opening ceremony for the line took place at Victoria station on March 7 1969 Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a commemorative plaque on the station concourse After a short ceremony she bought a 5d ticket and travelled to Green Park In new pence this would be about 208p

Princess Alexandra opened the Brixton extension on July 23 1971 She made a journey from Brixton to Vauxhall

Trains run every two minutes during peak periods In normal service all trains run from Brixton to Seven Sisters About three out of five continue to Walthamstow Central

When the line first opened it was served by a fleet of 8 car 1967 tube stock trains Each is made up of two four car units Later on a number of cars of 1972 Mark I tube stock were adapted to work with the 1967 stock This meant that there were finally 43 trains each of which was made up of two four car units The 1967 tube stock was replaced by 2009 tube stock between 2009 and 2011 

At first an articulated type of rolling stock was considered This idea was not used because it would have been to difficult to move the stock to Acton Works for heavy overhauls This is no longer a problem since train overhauls have been moved away from Acton Works to the builders own works The new 2009 tube stock has a wider profile and slightly longer carriage This prevents it from running on other deep level tube lines 

The line is equipped with an Automatic Train Operation system The train operator closes the train doors and presses a pair of start buttons If the way ahead is clear the ATO drives the train at a safe speed to the next station and stops there This system has been in place since the line opened in 1968 This makes the Victoria line the worlds first full scale automatic railway

When the Victoria line was built there were severe budget restrictions As a result the station infrastructure standards were lower than on older lines and on later extension projects Examples of these lower standards include narrower than usual platforms and undecorated ceilings at Walthamstow Central Blackhorse Road and Tottenham Hale This also affects lighting levels At most stations between the up and down escalators there is a concrete staircase where an additional escalator could be installed but has not been fitted It can cause severe congestion at peak times This has been remedied at Brixton in 2004 and at Vauxhall in 2006 where an additional escalator has been installed in place of the fixed stairway

In addition there have been station closures for safety reasons when both escalators have been unserviceable Over many years heavy equipment has been installed in fenced off sections at the ends of platforms owing to the lack of anywhere else to install them It is not clear from Transport for Londons Five Year Investment Programme whether these shortcomings are likely to be remedied

The 1967 stock was replaced bit by bit from July 2009 as part of Transport for Londons 5 year 10 billion redevelopment project The replacement for the lines 1967 tube stock is the 2009 tube stock built by Bombardier Transportation The first train was built in 2006 Testing of the new trains began in 2008 The main fleet began to be introduced in 2009 and went into main service in 2010 The last of the 1967 stock trains ran on 30 June 2011 after which the whole service was provided by 2009 stock

Supporters of Tottenham Hotspur have campaigned for a surface station to be opened next to Northumberland Park Station next to the lines depot This would provide an improvement in transport links seen as essential if the clubs wish to redevelop their ground and increase crowd capacity is to become a reality The idea was looked into but Network Rail own the necessary land and need it for their own expansion plans

If the ChelseaHackney line is built then it will relieve a lot of congestion on the Victoria line It will offer an alternative route across Central London between Victoria and Kings Cross St Pancras

For many years there have been proposals to extend southwards from Brixton one stop to Herne Hill This station would be on a large reversing loop with one platform This would remove a critical capacity restriction by eliminating the need for trains to reverse at Brixton However this would be expensive and cannot currently be justified on cost benefit reasons Given that the current line is heavily overcrowded this is the only extension proposal that has any realistic possibility of ever existing Even so it would have to be seen to be effective at reducing overcrowding rather than adding to overcrowding to have any hope of being built

The Victoria lines depot is at Northumberland Park London United Kingdom It is the only part of the line that is not underground The depot opened with the first stage of the line in 1968 It is near to Northumberland Park railway station

Many people want there to be a Victoria line station at Northumberland Park A campaign has been started by local people Haringey Council support this campaign

A third rail is a metal rail that is placed on either side of a train track to provide electrical power to trains traveling along the tracks They are often used on subways and local train services Before third rails electricity used to be carried in overhead wires

Electricity as a method of giving power to a train came about during the 1800s Scottish engineer Robert Davidson designed and built an electric locomotive in 1837 using batteries Using batteries meant that the locomotive could not be used on the main railways due to the constant need to charge them It was not until German engineer Werner von Siemens in 1879 that the first design of a reliable electric locomotive to carry passengers was made Siemens design used a 22kW electric motor and had a top speed of just over 13kmh This new locomotive hauled three passenger cars along a 300 meter circular railway track and carried around 90000 people in four months during its trail run at the Berlin Industrial Exhibition Siemens electric locomotive was the first train to utilize a third rail and power was provided via a dedicated dynamo The early designs of electric trains were unable to access a widely available and reliable source of electricity A network of electricity that went where ever the network of rail went was needed Whilst many modern distance trains utilize an overhead wire system to provide power the third rail was the first viable means of supplying power and is one that remains very much in use world wide today 

The third rail is usually located outside the two running rails but occasionally between them The electricity is transmitted to the train by means of a sliding shoe which is held in contact with the rail On many systems an insulating cover is provided above the third rail to protect employees working near the track sometimes the shoe is designed to contact the side or bottom of the third rail allowing the protective cover to be mounted directly to its top surface When the shoe slides on top it is referred to as top running When the shoe slides on the bottom it is not affected by the build up of snow or leaves

Third rails typically carry hundreds of volts in high amperage current This makes them very dangerous In 2005 American James Maki fell onto the third rail at a Boston rail station and suffered extensive and disfiguring injuries As part of his treatment he became the second American recipient of a face transplant Many deaths occur around the world each year due to human contact with a third rail In New York City there have been multiple cases of people dying because they have urinated on the third rail

Yonge Street is a main street in Toronto Ontario Canada and its northern suburbs It was once listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the longest street in the world and is listed as a national historic site It was the site of Canadas first subway line 

Yonge Street is the home of or close to many places of interest in Toronto including street and theatre acts the Eaton Centre the Hockey Hall of Fame andat the very start of the roadOne Yonge Street the offices of the Toronto Star newspaper The Yonge Line of the Toronto subway under or along it from south of King Street to Finch Avenue The Viva Blue BRT line goes along Yonge from Finch to Newmarket Bus Terminal

Yonge Street is thought to be Torontos main street because of it splits the city into east and west and the has the Yonge subway line running under it It is also the main place people come to celebrate events

Parts of the street are often closed for events such as an yearly street party Torontos annual Gay Pride Orange Order and Santa Claus parades also use Yonge Street for a large part of their routes Canadian singer songwriter Gordon Lightfoot has a song about Yonge Street titled On Yonge Street on his album A Painter Passing Through

The dinoflagellates are a large group of flagellate protists About half are photosynthetic the rest are mostly heterotroph predators of other protists The ones which are photosynthetic are sometimes loosely called algae the one which are predators are sometimes loosely called protozoa 

They have been classified as an order a class and a phylum by different authors Active research is being done on their relationships

Most are marine plankton but they are common in fresh water habitats as well Their populations are distributed depending on temperature salinity or depth The group includes many symbionts and bioluminescent species

Some dinoflagellates are zooxanthellae endosymbionts of marine eukaryotes and animals such as anthozoan corals These reef building corals largely depend on them Other organisms which can host zooxanthellae include jellyfish clams foraminifera sea slugs ie nudibranchs and also ciliates and radiolaria

Dinoflagellates are responsible for the red tides which may poison fish They sometimes bloom in concentrations of more than a million cells per millilitre Some species produce neurotoxins which in such quantities kill fish and accumulate in filter feeders such as shellfish which in turn may pass them on to people who eat them This phenomenon is called a red tide from the color the bloom imparts to the water Not all dinoflagellate blooms are dangerous Bluish flickers visible in ocean water at night often come from blooms of bioluminescent dinoflagellates which emit short flashes of light when disturbed

Although classified as eukaryotes the dinoflagellate nuclei lack some key features of eukaryotic nuclei In fact Dodge termed the dinoflagellate nucleus as mesokaryotic due to its possession of intermediate characteristics between the coiled DNA areas of prokaryotic bacteria and the well defined eukaryotic nucleus This group however does contain typically eukaryotic organelles such as golgi complexes mitochondria and chloroplasts

The group contains many complex organelles and life styles Some have structures rather like vertebrates eyes some have nematocysts some live as plasmodia some have two flagella photosynthetic dinoflagellates contain a bewildering array of plastid types and the whole of their genetics and cell biology is eccentric

Fossil dinoflagellates are important in stratigraphy the dating and correlation of strata During their life dinoflagellates have a mobile planktonic form and a resistant cyst phase which enables them to survive over winter in sediment Only the cyst gets fossilised Their first certain appearance is in the Silurian period with a big radiation in the Mesozoic erap440 They are classified as Phylum Dinomastigota by Margulis and colleagues

An epiphyte is a plant which grows on another plant without being a parasite The term is also be used for bacteria fungi lichens and mosses which grow on plants However most epiphytes are flowering plants and about a third of all ferns are epiphytes 

An epiphyte gets its moisture and nutrients from the air and rain and sometimes from debris accumulating around it The ones in the temperate zone are often mosses liverworts lichens and algae and in the tropics ferns cacti orchids and bromeliads

Sometimes such plants are called air plants because they do not root in soil This is misleading though as there are many aquatic epiphytes as well Epiphytic organisms only take support from the host they are usually not parasites Parasitic and semi parasitic plants like the mistletoe are not true epiphytes

Epiphytes usually use photosynthesis to get energy often they have adapted their leaves to be able to capture rainwater if they are not aquatic

Epiphytes are important for other species too certain frogs live in the water reservoir of epiphytes

Coeliac disease is an illness which makes people ill if they eat gluten If someone with coeliac disease eats something with gluten cells inside the body attack the lining of the intestine This means that they cannot digest food properly making them unable to have enough energy vitamins or minerals Children may be unable to grow taller or gain weight properly People with coeliac disease often lose weight They are also frequently tired

People with coeliac disease often have diarrhoea or steatorrhea It often means that they get flatulence Their stomach also hurts

To relieve the effects of coeliac disease one must stop eating gluten There are no medicines that can stop coeliac disease To get fully better it usually takes about two years of not eating gluten during which time the previously damaged intestine might recover 

To find out if a person has coeliac disease doctors look in the blood to see if they have the cells that attack the intestine when gluten is eaten The cell that attacks the intestine is called an antibody Antibodies normally stop illnesses from growing in the body but in the case of coeliac disease one of the antibodies thinks that gluten is something that will cause illness Doctors can also look into the patients intestines with a camera on a tube called an endoscope This can show if the intestines are being or have been damaged because of coeliac disease

Stellar precession is the name for one of the ways the stars slowly move across the sky when seen from the Earth The best known thing this causes is making the north stars place in the sky slowly change over thousands of years It is caused by the Suns gravity pulling the Earths poles toward itself Because the Earths poles are tilted at an angle of 2342 degrees from straight up in relation to its orbit this causes the North Pole to seem to point at different places in the sky 

Although it takes a very long time for the pole to make a whole circle in the sky even over the time period that humans have had writing this has made a big difference in what star is seen as the north star When the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids about 4000 years ago they used the stars to make the edges line up with north and south However they did not use the same north star that we do because Earths North Pole pointed at a different star than it does today 

Astronomers have known about this movement for a very long time Most people think that Hipparchus discovered it in ancient Greece in about 130 BC but some people think that even the ancient Egyptians may have known about it

Harem means the women and the place where they live in a polygynous household Most men are not allowed in there The word harem comes from the Turkish word haram meaning a sacred forbidden place Harems were meant for the royal upbringing of the future wives of noble and royal men These women would be educated so that they were ready to appear in public as a royal wife No forms of sexual activity took place inside of harems

Gothic architecture is a style of architecture used for buildings in Western Europe during the Middle Ages Gothic architecture started in the 12th century and lasted until the 16th century Important features of the style are pointed arches ribbed vaults and flying buttresses

Today people associate the style mainly with cathedrals churches and abbeys but it was also used for castles palaces universities and some houses 

Today many buildings still remain in that style Smaller ones are thought to be very beautiful bigger ones are often seen as priceless works of art 

In the 19th century the Gothic style became popular again particularly for building churches and universities This style is called Gothic Revival architecture

Well hello again its time for another interview This time its Kennedy in the hotseat and because he cant interview himself BG7 shines the table lamp in his eyes and interrogates him It wasnt actually that uncomfortable

  

 Hello Kennedy lets just start off with asking who you are where you are from and what you do

 Hi Im Grant Kennedy Im from Scotland United Kingdom and I work for a local council My job title is Housing Officer  Basically I try to get people to pay rent and try to evict those who dont

 cool sounds like a good job but I guess it must be difficult at times

 Yes Especially due to the credit crunch and close to Christmas its especially difficult Our bosses have said that they want to cut down on evictions but still want us to chase rent arrears Its not easy

 Im sure it isnt so how did you get into edting Wikipedia and to be precise the Simple English Wikipedia

 I honestly dont remember how I got into editing WP I think my first edits were just small fixes that I noticed I knew about WP for ages before but people I knew used to laugh about it and how it used to be very unreliable So I avoided it for a while I then noticed the other languages and thought it would be translating what it said on the page Thats when I discovered Simple I usually like to write about things I know about On enwiki it was Ravenscraig and on simple SPL I pretty much started Ravenscraig from a redirect to a decent sized article

 Cool I guess that those two articles must be things you are proud of  is there anything else

 I dont really like editing enwiki anymore I got into an argument at Featured Pictures and on Betmax VHS Videotape wars or something I didnt want to edit anymore I still make small edits but nothing much At simple of course I am proud of Simple News and the fact that people here trust me enough to promote me to admin then bureaucrat unanimously Im very proud of that 

 its a shame about en I know that a lot of people are leaving the project because of disputes and im pleased that we dont have that problem at Simple What are your plans for the future

 Future at WP or IRL

 both 

 

 Well to be honest for both Im not really sure I cant plan either because I dont know what I will be doing next month never mind more My job finishes soon so I cant afford to make plans 

 yes it really is thanks for your time Kennedy

 No worries Enjoyed it very much

In 1981 Butcher played in the Ipswich side that won the UEFA Cup under Bobby Robson That year the club cape close to its first League title since 1962 However Aston Villa defeated them and won the title 

In 1986 Butcher left Ipswich when they were relegated He became one of the first English invasion players to join Scottish club Rangers This was after Graeme Souness became its manager Souness the former Liverpool player paid Ipswich 725000 for him in July 1986

As captain he led them to three League titles in four seasons They also won two Scottish League Cups

Until recently the TTC did not have plans to expand the subway during the last twenty years but only had plans to build new above ground rapid transit lines based upon streetcars travelling in closed lanes on streets Today there are plans to build new subway lines under the ground including extensions to the Spadina University line and two lines in the central section of the city south of Bloor Danforth

Like most subways the Toronto subwayRT trains get electricity from a third rail that runs next to the tracks Shoes mounted on both sides of each coach for contact Power is supplied at 600 V DC

A train guard opens and closes the subway car doors and makes sure no one is trapped in a door as the train leaves a station The train guard tells the driver when it is okay to leave The car carrying the guard can be identified by the white or the orange light outside the subway car 

On weekdays and Saturday subway service runs from approximately 600 am to 130 am but Sunday service begins at 900 am Start times on holidays may vary

For complete lists and details of stations lines and their locations in the Toronto subwayRT system see List of Toronto subway and RT stations

Most stations are named for the nearby road crossed by the line in question A few are named for major landmarks such as shopping centres or other transportation stations near the station 

All trains stop at every station along their route and run the entire length of their line from end to end

Tar is a viscous black liquid It is made by the destructive distillation of organic matter Most tar is produced from coal as a byproduct of coke production but it can also be produced from petroleum peat or wood

The word tar is often used to describe several different substances which are not actually tar Naturally occurring tar pits actually contain asphalt rather than tar Tar sand deposits contain various mixtures of sand with bitumen or heavy crude oil and not tar as does the Tar Tunnel in Shropshire Rangoon tar also known as Burmese Oil or Burmese Naphtha is actually petroleum Tar and pitch are sometimes used interchangeably however pitch is considered more solid while tar is more liquid

In English German and French tar is a substance primarily made from coal It used to be one of the products of gasworks Tar made from coal or petroleum is considered toxic It causes cancer because of its high benzene content In low concentrations however coal tar is used as a topical medicine Coal and petroleum tar has a pungent odor

Coal tar is listed at number 1999 in the United Nations list of dangerous goods

In Northern Europe the word tar refers primarily to a substance that is derived from the wood and roots of pine In earlier times it was often used as a water repellent coating for boats ships and roofs It is still used as an additive in the flavoring of candy alcohol and other foods Wood tar is microbicidal and has a pleasant odor Producing tar from wood was known in ancient Greece and has probably been used in Scandinavia since the Iron Age For centuries dating back at least to the 14th century tar was among Swedens most important exports Sweden exported 13000 barrels of tar in 1615 and 227000 barrels in the peak year of 1863 Production nearly stopped in the early 20th century when other chemicals replaced tar and wooden ships were replaced by steel ships

The heating of pine wood causes tar and pitch to drip away from the wood and leave behind charcoal Birchbark is used to make particularly fine tar known as Russian oil suitable for leather protection The by products of wood tar are turpentine and charcoal When deciduous tree woods are subjected to destructive distillation the products are methanol and charcoal

Tar kilns are dry destillation ovens historically used in Scandinavia for producing tar from wood They were built close to the forest from limestone or from more primitve holes in the ground The bottom is sloped into an outlet hole to allow the tar to pour out The wood is split to dimensions of a finger and stacked densely and finally covered tight with dirt and moss If oxygen can enter the wood might catch fire and the production would be ruined On top of this a fire is stacked and lit After a few hours the tar starts to pour out and continues to do so for a few days

Tar is used in treatment of the skin disease psoriasis where coal tar is the most effective Tar is also a general disinfectant Petroleum tar was also used in ancient Egyptian mummification circa 1000 BCrefwwwgeotimesorgfeb05

Tar was a vital component of the first sealed or tarmac roads The streets of Baghdad were the first to be paved with tar from the 8th century AD It was also used as seal for roofing shingles and to seal the hulls of ships and boats For millennia wood tar was used to waterproof sails and boats but today sails made from inherently waterproof synthetic substances have negated the need for tar Wood tar is still used to seal traditional wooden boats and the roofs of historical shingle roofed churches as well painting exterior walls of log buildings 

In Finland wood tar was once considered a panacea reputed to heal even those cut in twain through their midriff A Finnish proverb states that if sauna vodka and tar wont help the disease is fatal Wood tar is used in traditional Finnish medicine because of its microbicidial properties

Wood tar is also available diluted as tar water which has numerous uses

Mixing tar with linseed oil varnish produces tar paint Tar paint has a translucent brownish hue and can be used to saturate and tone wood and protect it from weather Tar paint can also be toned with various pigments producing translucent colours and preserving the wood texture Because of its paint like properties tar should not be touched with bare hands or feet as it can dry to produce a permanent stain However in any case paint thinner is used to remove it

The Toronto Transit Commission runs the public transport system that has buses streetcars subways and rapid transit lines in Toronto Ontario Canada Started in 1954 the TTC has grown to three subway lines and an elevated rapid transit line with a total of 69 stations as well as 149 surface routes Of these 149 routes 148 make 243 connections with a subway or rapid transit station during weekday rush hours

The TTC operates the third most used urban public transport system in North America 

The TTC also runs a door to door system for people with physical disabilities known as Wheel Trans about 5500 trips are made by this service daily This service costs the same as any other trip on the TTC even though it is door to door The TTC had 11235 people working for it in 2007

Viscosity is a physical property of fluids It tells how much their resistance to flow In a simple example water has a low viscosity as it is thin Syrup or tar on the other hand has a high viscosity as it is thick A way to test for viscosity is the speed at which the substance runs down a slope Syrup would reach the bottom very slowly whereas water would be a lot quicker

There are two types of viscosity dynamic viscosity measured in pascal seconds and kinematic viscosity measured in metres per second squared

Viscosity is used as a way to predict when volcanoes erupt When the lava comes out very thickly there is more chance that it will erupt violently This is because the lava has a hard time getting out and may burst out when it can If the lava is thin then it just flows out like water

The word viscous comes from the Latin viscum meaning sticky

A passenger is a term that is used for a person who travels in a vehicle but not the driver or a person working in the vehicle 

There are two common ways in which the term is used

In most places the company who owns the vehicles and the people who work on them have legal broken wikt linkobligationobligations to the passengers riding with them 

The Additions to Daniel are three chapters that are in some but not all Christian Bibles added to the Book of Daniel Roman Catholics and followers of the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches believe that these chapters are sacred and they put them in their Bibles as part of their Biblical canon The chapters are listed in Article VI of the Thirty Nine Articles of the Church of England as good but not sacred reading Most Protestant Bibles do not have these chapters because most Protestant churches believe these chapters are apocryphal

The Additions to Daniel are not found in the Hebrew or Aramaic text of Daniel These stories are in the Greek Septuagint and a translation by the writer Theodotion However most Protestant Bibles use only the text in the Hebrew and Aramaic manuscripts so they do not have these chapters

The additions are

The Yonge University Spadina Line is the oldest and most used subway line in Toronto Ontario Canada It is operated by the Toronto Transit Commission has 32 stations and is 302 km in length It opened in 1954 and had new stations added in 1963 1973 1974 1978 and 1996 

The line runs from about 600 am to 130 am Monday to Saturday and 900 am to 130 am on Sunday The subway runs every 45 minutes with extra services during rush hour times 

The 320 Yonge bus runs late at night when the subway is closed 

Tenrikyo is a religion that believes in one God It was founded in Japan in the 19th century by Miki Nakayama a Japanese woman who heard instructions from God Believers of Tenrikyo call her Oyasama which means the Great Parent because she acts as a parent to all people In Tenrikyo God is called Oyagami which means God the Parent

The goal of Tenrikyo is for all people to live a joyous life Oyasama stated that the way to save yourself is by saving others In other words to be truly happy you must make other people happy

Today Tenrikyo is centered in Tenri City in central Japan There is a general hospital a college three schools and a central temple there Once a month there is a big ritual in this central city and many people come from all over the country to pray There are two million believers of Tenrikyo in Japan and around the world

Steeles Avenue is an east west street that forms the northern city border of Toronto and the southern border of York Region Ontario Canada It is 3875 km within Toronto between Albion Road and the Scarborough Pickering border

West of Albion Road Steeles continues into Peel Region where it is also known as Peel Regional Road 15 It runs through Brampton and into the Halton Region town of Milton It stops at Appleby Line on top of the Niagara Escarpment due to the Crawford Lake Conservation Area being there and then the road starts again just east of Guelph Line and goes until the Milborough Townline on the border of Milton and Hamilton East of the Toronto Pickering border it becomes Taunton Road

Steeles is named after J C Steele who owned a tavern on the street where it joins with Yonge Street

Steeles Avenue was listed as the worst road by the CAA in October 2006 and as the fifth worst road in October 2007 In October 2008 it was re listed as worst road in Ontario Reasons are potholes and the quality of the road Soon after the CAAs listing some parts of the road between Dufferin Street and Bayview Avenue were resurfaced

I made a small change to the warning template because as a native English speaker I found it difficult to understand I believe the word practice is easy to understand by people with a simple command of English while the current wordage is not Furthermore the second comma is necessary to maintain proper separation of that phrase Thoughts EhJJ 1848 26 February 2009

Im proposing the addition of standard optional questions in RFAs Some people know them from EN What will you do with the tools what do you think are your best contributions and have you been in any major conflicts I think that they would be a help in evaluating the candidate at RFA

Hello is there a version of Twinkle on Simple Wikipedia The Twinkle script or gadget makes it easier to mark pages for deletion and warn vandals Thank you LovesMacs 2337 26 February 2009

I just noticed UserSunstar NW XP pop up around here I am highly suspicious that he is connected to the SunholmSunfazerSunStar vandal who has socked at and been banned from numerous wikis A good discussion of his history can be found here on en According to Lar a checkuser on en this user is a perpetual problem globally

The Sunstar NW XP vandal here is following patterns of the other examples of this vandal a love for templates as well as a I know vandals I share IPs with vandals but Im not a vandal defense that basically every other Sunholm related vandal has claimed Because of this being a global issue I propose that we ban Sunstar NW XP and any current and future versions of this vandal Either way 1320 22 February 2009

In this case I would think about giving him a one strike rule If he doesnt change I supportstrongly a ban on him  Snake311 0802 23 February 2009

Can we get an admin to implement the ban here Checkuser has confirmed it and consensus seems to be leaning towards ban Thanks Either way 1632 26 February 2009

English should be written simple but difficult concepts are allowed here naturally though there will be unsimple words in the article which dont comply with strict Basic English limitations Is there any way around this or would just doing everything appropriately be enough  Mentifisto 2358 26 February 2009 Hello This community so far has not agreed on a vocabulary that can be considered simple So the very basic idea is that if you use difficult words you explain them in some way either in an article linked or in the article itself Defining simple is a discussion that recently was on Simple talk as a result two Myspell dictionaries were created these contain words that can be assumed to be known At the time they were made by selecting the top X words of certain categories Again a word not being in the respective list does not mean you cannot use the word it simply means the reader is unlikely to know it Eptalon 0830 27 February 2009

Why is it when I write a flag flagiconAfghanistan and then write after the flag Afghanistan it shows the word at the bottom of the flag not at the top flagiconAfghanistan Afghanistan Why cant you make the word written next to the flag like any other Wikipedia does 753124994 1727 28 February 2009

Now that Abuse Filter is now ready for testing on small and medium wikis I want to make a proposal for installing it on this wiki Anyone want it Ill put a configuration here to start Its incomplete but it can be changed Techman224Talk 0225 25 February 2009

 Configuration for Abuse Filter on Simple English Wikipedia Fell free to edit it

Allow everyone to view the filters and logs

For group

Also its installed on test wikipedia if you want to look at it Techman224Talk 0322 25 February 2009

A few questions

Ill take a read over the config later see if theres anything I think that needs changing This could work if we thinkplan it out properly  Chris 1219 25 February 2009

Im not comfortable with having the abuse filter deal with general vandalism From my personal experience with adminantivandal bots safely detecting general vandalism is much much harder than just serial vandalism If this was only to be used for serial vandals I might support it but detecting any vandalism more than just a new user blanking a page causes to much false positives Im also still not convinced of your technical ability to safely use the filter  Chris 0244 28 February 2009

User rights for Administrators wgGroupPermissionssysopabusefilter modify truewgAddGroupssysop array

Well I just ran into the abuse filter on another wiki Wont let me create my user page because the letters ass are in my usernamesigh I hate when webpages do that to me That being said I think it will let me once I am autoconfirmed Djsasso 1747 28 February 2009

Id like to propose that the current mainpage VGA always be semi protected against IP vandalism for the duration of its being on the mainpage The VGA on the mainpage always gets a good amount of vandalism and it seems prudent that whatever the current VGA on the mainpage is it should always be semi protected fr33kman t  c 0235 25 February 2009

My viewpoint here is that the VGA linked to the mainpage always gets a lot of vandalism Almost always from IP editors If we were to semi this page it would lessen the amount of vandalism and hence the disruption to the project Whilst Wikipedia is indeed the encyclopedia that anyone can edit it might be prudent to protect the pages that receive the most amount of vandalism Sniper has received a lot of unneeded edits and vandalism this week as does every other currently offered VGA on the mainpage Its something to consider at least fr33kman t  c 0247 25 February 2009

My opinion is that we protect these articles way too quickly as it is Sniper has been a rare exception where Id actually say that the vandalism was in excess For the most part though were protecting when we can just revert and block and move on Either way 0307 25 February 2009

I like the Idea of the template Kennedy and Kennedy Im not trying to start a fight with that PA response I just HATE it when some Europeans talk down to Americans I believe thats understandable as long as I dont take it to far  CM16 t c 1929 1 March 2009

Because of this I think Tharntons ban should be lengthened or even lengthened to indef For speeding ban lengthening here is a direct to ban link Tharnton obviously wont mature in a year At the top of Recent changes I think the Long pages link next to Simplification should be removed and use a list of Complex pages rather than long as the examples shown I suggest this because long does not mean complex Toliar 0956 28 February 2009

I understand that simple English Wikipedia has a number of articles on simple words But for articles such as upstaging which should really be tidied up and then moved to wiktsimpleupstage is there a process to do that mTranswiki doesnt really explain how to do so unless youre an admin on the receiving wiki and only enWP has enTemplateCopy to Wiktionary EhJJ 2147 28 February 2009

The above page is very out of date with the dates not updated since November 08 Can anyone remember what was up when or is there a way to work it out

If not do we really need the columns of when they were displayed They are in a rotation after all

Furthermore there are two articles not yet into rotation which I will get into the rotation shortly but for this two would need to be lost the two that have been in the longest

Finally shouldnt all the articles be in rotation at the same time It really doesnt matter when they get shown and when

Sorry for the jumbledness of that post  im still working on about 4 hours of sleep

If you need anything explaining just ask

Cheers

Ive probably brought it up before but Id like to propose that all propositions take place on 1 the page WPPVGAWPPGA and 2 an articles subpage The real data would be at the subpage but the discussionsvotes may be visible on the PVGAPGA pages That way it will be easier to keep all discussionvotes in one place obentomusubi 0506 2 March 2009

Im a new user here but a pretty experienced user on the normal English wiki Is there adoption here too Queenie 2013 2 March 2009

Hello all I found out about the Simple English wikipedia from xkcd and I am very new here However I very much like the idea and find it fun and relaxing to edit those articles I am qualified to edit

I have been editting the physics articles with a slant on astronomyparticle physics Today I started editing the article on Neutron Stars and came across an issue Im not sure what to do about and about which I can find no guidance in any of the Simple English wikipedia pages and I would like some help on it

The issue is maths and what place it has in this wikipedia

In writing the Neutron Star article I started on a section about their rotation In writing about their rotation I remembered that there was a lovely simple and very educational argument about how to work out their maximum rotation speed Its a back of the envelope calculation as we scientists would call it an argument that focuses on giving an idea of whats going on rather than any real truth well within the scope of any older secondary school student in the United Kingdom studying their A levels and something exciting that shows them that even simple A level physics can be used on something as complicated and exotic as neutron stars

In terms of this wikipedias understanding at a simple level to foreign speakers its nice but not really necessary and would probably only confuse as I can explain the crux of whats going on well enough with words without using the maths

In terms of writing an accurate article a back of the envelope calculation is not really very appropriate and they do not seem to appear in the main English wikipedia 

In terms of writing an informative article I think its a very valid showing whats happening

Im confused about exactly which part of this wikipedias mission takes precedence over others and where I should be pitching my article

Also if I to write the educational section it would be nice to have some way of flagging it as educational only and also some way of flagging the level of education needed in a way that is internationally understood

I believe that DYK is in its last breaths and Im beginning to believe that this is a failed experiment It has been updated once in the last month and the nomination page doesnt show much activity Some say it is not dying just inactive at the moment however I feel like it is something that is on its way out Like the Wiki Cup it was strong for a bit but trickled down Perhaps it is time to consider letting it go the way of the Wiki Cup Either way 2130 2 March 2009

It used to be so much easier You would find a decent article find a hook thats it Now it has to be of a certain length and VGAs are no longer allowed Its become increasingly difficult to find an article you can use Kennedy 1621 3 March 2009

On the SchoolsProject page teachers are asked to seek help from existing editors especially if anything goes wrong To make this easier for them on the page I have started a list of names of editors that would be prepared to help Please think about adding your name to the list Peterdownunder 0935 4 March 2009

Hello all UserChenzw and UserBluegoblin7 came up with a new system to rotate the VGAs on the main page The system works as follows

The current system can be seen working at Main PageTest 1

It has the following benefits

I therefore propose that we replace our current rotation system by the new one

Comments  Eptalon 1513 1 March 2009 While we are at it Romania still needs a VGA stub Eptalon 0914 2 March 2009 I have switched our current main page to using the new system youll have a new VGA daily now  Eptalon 2227 4 March 2009

Good work Perhaps now those editors interested in the PVGA process could be tempted into discussing how to fix it from its currently poor format While Im not around for another few weeks it would be interesting to see if other editors find the system to be broken The most recently promoted article Romania has many many outstanding issues on the talk page but since it received the 6 0 precise minimum it is now considered to be one of finest articles Which it isnt As a starter I think we need to reconsider the precise 6 085 threshold and we need to reconsider the one week threshold although that is not so pressing Why not consider that a bureaucrat could review the votes and make a decision accordingly The Rambling Man on tour 1906 1 March 2009

Tim Hortons Inc is a Canadian fast food restaurant known for its coffee and doughnuts It was started in 1964 in Hamilton Ontario by Canadian hockey player Tim Horton In 1967 Tim Horton joined with investor Ron Joyce who quickly took over running the company and expanded the chain into a multi million dollar franchise 

Tim Hortons stores quickly spread and together with Subway became bigger than McDonalds and is now Canadas largest chain of fast food restaurants The company opened twice as many Canadian stores as did McDonalds and sales also are bigger than those of McDonalds Canadian restaurants as of 2002 The chain got 226 of all fast food industry revenues in Canada in 2005 Tim Hortons also has 76 of the Canadian market for baked goods and has 62 of the Canadian coffee market Tim Hortons had 2733 restaurants in Canada as of July 1 2007 

Tim Hortons also has an international restaurants with 500 in the United States as of December 2008 with one opened in Detroit and owned by former NBA player Derrick Coleman and one on a Canadian military base outside Kandahar Afghanistan Tim Hortons other international efforts include a small outlet at the Dublin Zoo Tim Hortons also made a deal with the SPAR store chain in the UK and Ireland with Tim Hortons coffee and doughnuts being sold at small self service counters in 16 SPAR stores 

The companies first store opened in 1964 in Hamilton Ontario under the name Tim Horton Donuts The business was started by Tim Horton who played in the National Hockey League from 1949 until his death in a car accident in 1974

Soon after Horton opened the store he met Ron Joyce a former Hamilton police constable In 1965 Joyce took over the Tim Horton Donut Shop on Ottawa Street North in Hamilton By 1967 after he had opened up two more stores he and Tim Horton became full partners in the business After Hortons death in 1974 Joyce bought the company from the Horton family and took over as the only owner of the now forty stores Joyce expanded the chain quickly in geography and in product selection opening the 500th store in Aylmer Quebec in 1991

Ron Joyces very fast expansion of the Tim Hortons business brought about two major changes in the coffee and doughnut restaurant market independent doughnut shops in Canada were almost wiped out and Canadas per person ratio of doughnut shops rose past those of all other countries

By the 1990s the company name had changed to The TDL Group Ltd but the name of the restaurants are still called Tim Hortons This was because the company wanted to also go into other types of business and not just be seen as a doughnut company In March 2006 shares of the company were first sold to the public

TDL Group had 148 billion in sales in 2005 and has expanded across Canada and also in New York Ohio Michigan West Virginia Kentucky and Maine

Tim Hortons has many stores on or near many Canadian Forces Bases TDL Group said in March 2006 that because they were asked by Chief of the Defence Staff General Rick Hillier it would open a store at the Canadian Forces operations base in Kandahar Afghanistan The new Kandahar store opened on June 29 2006 in a 40ft trailer on the military base

Tim Hortons first stores only sold two products  coffee and doughnuts As well as its coffee tea hot chocolate and doughnuts the Tim Hortons menu now includes a number of other baked goods such as Timbits muffins croissants tea biscuits cookies rolls danishes and bagels Cakes to take home are offered in some locations 

Since the mid 1990s the chain has moved into other areas such as flavoured cappuccino iced cappuccino iced coffee New York style cheesecake and lunch items such as soup chili and submarine sandwiches In fall 2006 Tim Hortons began selling a breakfast sandwich This is made of an egg patty processed cheese slice either bacon or sausage and either a biscuit or bagel it has sold well In October 2007 Tim Hortons began to sell a Chicken Fajita Wrap which has spiced chicken and sauted vegetables In December 2007 they began to sell Hash Browns and the Bagel BELT a breakfast sandwich that has lettuce and tomato

Along with the expansion of stores and the expanded menu came the outsourcing of baked goods Doughnuts which used to be made at night so that they were ready for the next morning are now fully cooked and then frozen and sent to every restaurant from Windsor Ontario The restaurants now bake them during the day

The company used to sell Coca Cola products but Tim Hortons switched over to Pepsi in 2007

Throw away cups made by the company are one of the most common litter items in Canada Company spokespersons claim that customers are the problem not Tim Hortons

In May 2008 the chain came under fire after an employee in London Ontario was fired for giving away a single 016 Timbit to a baby A manager was blamed for the broken wikt linkincidentincident The employee was hired at a different nearby location

The alveolates is a grouping of protists

This comprising are three phyla

Ice cubes are small cube shaped parts of ice These pieces are sometimes used to cool drinks Ice cubes are used in mixed drinks when the drink has the words on the rocks

Ice cubes are made by filling a tray with water and putting it in a freezer Many freezers also have an icemaker Icemakers make ice cubes and put them in a bin After that they can be put in a glass

Ice cubes are also made commercially and sold in big amounts These ice cubes are usually cylindrical and might have holes through the center An unusual thing about commercially made ice cubes is that they are very clear and do not have the clouding found in home made ice cubes

Ice cubes can also be crushed into different shaped flakes which some people think makes some kinds of cocktails look better Crushed ice is also used when it needs to be made fast because the speed of cooling depends on the amount and average radius of the ice particles

American physician and humanitarian John Gorrie built a refrigerator in 1844 to be able to cool air His refrigerator made ice which he hung from the ceiling in a basin Gorrie is the creator of ice cubes even though he was not trying to cool drinks Instead he used the ice to cool the rooms temperature During that time people thought that bad air quality made people sick So to help treat sickness he advocated for the draining of swamps and the cooling of sickrooms

Ice cube trays are made to be filled with water then put in a freezer until the water freezes to ice making ice cubes Trays are often flexible so the ice cubes can be removed easily by flexing the tray Another design is an aluminum tray with a lever that raises the ice cubes up moving them off of the tray A motorized kind of this is in most automatic ice making freezers

Even though ice cubes are usually shaped like cubes there are trays that make spherical or cylindrical shapes These are sometimes called ice tubes Some novelty trays make blocks of ice in seasonal festive or other shapes

The first flexible stainless steel all metal ice cube tray was made by Guy L Tinkham in 1933 The tray bent sideways to remove the ice cubes 

The first rubber ice cube tray was made by Lloyd Groff Copeman One day in 1928 while walking through some woods getting sap for maple syrup Copeman saw that slush and ice came off of his rubber boots instead of sticking to them After talking about it with his patent attorney at lunch he did experiments using rubber cups Later he made and patented several kinds of tray a metal tray with rubber separators a metal tray with individual rubber cups and a tray made of only rubber

A machete is a big cutting tool The blade is usually 20 24 inches long and less than 2 inches thick The machete is a knife often used in jungle warfare because it can easily cut through plants and vines It is a lot like the Japanese katana and the American Bowie knife

Ecstasy is an emotion The word comes from Greek  kstasis which means to step outside oneself People who have this emotion feel very happy

King Lear is a play written by William Shakespeare We believe people first performed it in December 1606 The play is about an old king who needs to give his land to his three daughters To get the land they must tell him how much they love him His youngest daughter will not say how much she does because she says words will not be able to describe her love Lear gets angry at her and will not give her land and says she is not his daughter anymore

The king soon finds out that his other daughters do not love him and only wanted his land The two daughters and their husbands throw him out of the land that is now theirs The rest of the play is about Lears trip around the land that was once his as he becomes insane

Mutual information measures how much more is known about one random value when given another For example knowing the temperature of a random day of the year will not reveal what month it is but it will give some hint In the same way knowing what month it is will not reveal the exact temperature but will make certain temperatures more or less likely These hints or changes in likelihood are explained and measured with mutual information

To calculate mutual information the probability of all possible events and the probability of them happening at the same time is needed For example to measure mutual information between month and temperature we would need to know how many days in the year are 10 degrees Celsius how many days out of the year are March and finally how many days are 10 degrees Celsius in March

The formula requires the summation or adding up of many terms or numbers Every possible outcome has its own term From the above calculation of mutual information between month and temperature we will use the following variables

This means m equals the probability of a randomly selected day being in March This is 31365 or about 0085 since 31 out of 365 days in the year are in March

In this formula log means logarithm

Adding all possible terms together gives the value for mutual information

The larger the mutual information the more you can learn about one random value when told another

Mutual information does not change based on which random value is revealed This means we know just as much about temperature when told the month as we know about the month when told the temperature

Mutual information is difficult to compare If we calculate mutual information for weather and another value for a card game the two values cannot easily be compared

Mutual information does not have any units

The Tillamook are a Native American tribe from the state of Oregon The word Tillamook means people of Nekelim in the Chinook language It can also be spelled Calamox Gillamooks and Killamook

The Tillamook tribe used to speak Tillamook After a while they learned to speak English The last person that spoke Tillamook died in 1970 This made the Tillamook language gone forever Starting in 1965 a group of scientists tried to protect the Tillamook language by talking with the Tillamook people and creating a Tillamook language dictionary

The Tillamook tribe used to live between the Necanicum River and Tillamook Bay The Tillamook were coastal Native Americans Their name Tillamook means Land of Many Waters in their language The first Tilamook people lived around the 1400s In the 1700s the population was counted at about 2200 people

At the time when it was found Huya was the biggest and brightest TNO yet found It was found using data collected by at the CIDA Observatory in Venezuela Astronomers think its about 530 km in diameter

The object has a red sloped reflectance spectrum saying that the surface could be rich in organic material such as tholins

Given the long orbit that TNOs have around the sun Huya comes to opposition in early May of each year at an apparent magnitude of 193

In the close approach that led to the first time it was found not enough sightings could be made to find out its orbit and Adonis was lost until 1977 when it was found once again by Charles T Kowal

Adonis was the second Apollo asteroid to be found It may be a dead comet and may be the source of some meteor showers 

It comes within 30 Gm of the Earth six times in the 21st century the nearest being 53 Gm in 2036

1566 Icarus is an Apollo asteroid whose strange characteristic is that at perihelion it is closer to the Sun than Mercury it is said to be a Mercury crosser asteroid It is also a Venus and Mars crosser It is named after Icarus of Greek mythology who flew too close to the Sun It was found in 1949 by Walter Baade

Icarus makes a close approach to Earth at gaps of 9 19 or 38 years Sometimes it comes as close as 64 Gm as it did on June 14 1968 The last close approach was in 1996 at 151 Gm almost 40 times as far as the Moon  The next close approach will be June 16 2015 at 81 Gm

In 1967 Professor Paul Sandorff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology gave his students the task to make a plan to destroy Icarus in the case that it may be hitting Earth This plan is known as Project Icarus

Simon F Green and John K Davies while searching Infrared Astronomical Satellite data for moving objects found 3200 Phaethon in pictures from October 11 1983 It was announced on October 14 in IAUC 3878 along with optical confirmation by Charles T Kowal who reported that it looks like an asteroid It was the first asteroid to be found by a spacecraft It measures 510 km in diameter 

Phaethon approaches the Sun closer than any other numbered asteroid Its perihelion is only 0140 AU less than half Mercurys perihelion distance It is a Mercury Venus Earth and Mars crosser The surface temperature at perihelion could reach 1025 K or 1400 F For this reason it was named after the Greek myth of Phaton son of the sun god Helios

Phaethon approached to 181 Gm on December 102007 It will draw nearer in 2017 2050 2060 and closer still on December 14 2093 passing within 00198 AU

Minor planet designations are number name combinations given by the Minor Planet Center a part of the IAU They are used for dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies such as asteroids but not comets They are given to a body once its orbit is secured and are unrelated to provisional designations which are given when an object is found 

The two parts of a formal designation are 

It looks like this Name for example Sedna or mpl 2002 TX300 The brackets are now often removed as in 90377 Sedna according to what the astronomer wants In practice however for any reasonably well known object the number is mostly a catalogue entry and the name or provisional designation is generally used in place of the formal designation Sedna mpl2002 TX300

The rule for moons of minor planets such as the formal designation Sylvia I Romulus for the asteroid moon Romulus is an extension of the Roman numeral convention that had been used on and off for the moons of the planets since Galileos time 

Comets are also managed by the Minor Planet Center but use a different cataloguing system

By 1851 there were 15 asteroids all but one with their own symbol The symbols were becoming less and less simple and as they had to be drawn by hand astronomers found some of them hard to draw This difficulty was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould in 1851 who suggested numbering asteroids in the order that they were found and placing this number in a circle as the symbol for the asteroid such as for the fourth asteroid Vesta This practice was soon coupled with the name itself into an official number name designation Vesta as the number of minor planets increased By ca 1858 the circle had been simplified to brackets and Vesta which was easier to typeset Other punctuation such as 4 Vesta and 4 Vesta was also used but had more or less completely died out by 1949

The major exception to the convention that the number tracks the order they were or the order that theyre orbit was calculated is the case of Pluto Since Pluto was originally called a planet it was not given a number until a 2006 redefinition of planet that didnt include it At that point Pluto was given the formal designation Pluto

The square metre is the SI derived unit of area with symbol m It is defined as the area of a square whose sides measure exactly one metre The square metre is derived from the SI base unit of the metre which in turn is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in absolute vacuum during a time interval of Fraction1299792458 of a second

Adding SI prefixes creates multiples and submultiples however as the unit is squared the order of magnitude difference between units doubles from their comparable linear units For example a kilometre is one thousand times the length of a metre but a square kilometre is one million times the area of a square metre

A square metre is not the same as a meter square an area 2 metres wide by 5 metres long would be 10 square metres in contrast 10 metres squared means an area 10 metres by 10 metres So 10 metres squared 100 Square meteres

The square metre may be used with all SI prefixes used with the metre

A square metre is equal to

Cologne or Eau de Cologne is a toiletry a perfume in a style of that originated from Cologne Germany Nowadays its used as a term for scented formulations with a concentration of about 2 5 essential oils Cologne may be used by men or women

In a base of dilute ethanol Eau de Cologne contains a mixture of citrus oils including oils of lemon orange tangerine bergamot lime grapefruit and neroli It can also contain oils of lavender rosemary thyme petitgrain and jasmine

History  Eau de Cologne is a spirit citrus perfume launched in Cologne in 1709 by Giovanni Maria Farina an Italian perfumer from Santa Maria Maggiore Valle Vigezzo Italy In 1708 Farina wrote to his brother Jean Baptiste I have found a fragrance that reminds me of an Italian spring morning of mountain daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain He named his fragrance Eau de Cologne in honour of his new hometown 

The Original Eau de Cologne composed by Farina was used only as a perfume and delivered to nearly all royal houses in Europe His ability to produce a constantly homogenous fragrance consisting of dozens of monoessences was seen as a sensation at the time When free trade was established in Cologne by the French in 1797 the success of Eau de Cologne prompted countless other businessmen to sell their own fragrances under the name of Eau de Cologne and even Farina 

Giovanni Maria Farinas formula has been produced in Cologne since 1709 by Farina opposite the Jlichplatz and to this day remains a secret His shop at Obenmarspforten opened in 1709 and is today the worlds oldest fragrance factory Other Colognes such as the famous Cologne 4711 named after its location at Glockengasse No 4711 have the name in common but smell different In 1806 Jean Marie Joseph Farina a grand grand nephew of Giovanni Maria Farina opened a perfumery business at Paris that developed into Roger Gallet that owns the rights to Eau de Cologne extra vielle in contrast to the Original Eau de Cologne from Cologne

Eau de Cologne or just cologne has now become a generic term

Multi criteria optimization or multiobjective optimization is a way of solving a mathematical or economic problem where many different parameters need to be changed to get one of the best possible solutions to the problem The result of this is called Pareto efficiency named after Vilfredo Pareto who first used it in his studies 

In economics the idea of Pareto efficiency is very simple If there is no way of improving the situation of one person without making that of another person worse the solution found is Pareto efficient 

If we look at what the economy produces we might say it is on its Pareto Frontier or Production Possibility Frontier meaning that it is making all it can with the things it has If this is the case making more of one thing would mean making less of another the resources are already being used to full capacity so making more of one thing will take resources away from making another

Just because something is Pareto efficient it doesnt mean it is fair or equitable Even though no one could be made better off without making someone else worse off it is possible that one person owns all of the worlds things To make anyone else better off some would have to be taken away from this person making them worse off

John Manjiro was a Japanese sailor educator and interpreter

Manjiro was born in the Tosa Domain He was the second son of a poor fisherman He worked when he was young because his father died and his mother and older brother were sick Because of this he did not learn how to read and write very well 

In 1841 when he was fourteen years old the fishing boat he worked on ran into a storm and was turned over He and the people with him were on the ocean for five days They landed on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean where no people lived They spent 143 days on that island An American ship passed by the island and John Manjiro and the others were saved

At this time Japan was a closed country The American ship or any non Japanese ship could not enter Japan Also any Japanese who left Japan were killed by the Japanese government if they returned to Japan Most of the people saved from the island were taken to Hawaii The captain of the ship liked John Manjiro and took Manjiro with him Manjiro saw a map of the world for the first time and saw how small Japan was in the world Manjiro was named John Mung by the captain He was adopted by the captain of the ship and lived with the captains family in the United States 

Manjiro learned English math measurement navigation and shipbuilding at school He spent all of his time to studying to be a captain He learned new ideas from the Western world For example democracy and equality between men and women

Manjiro lived for several years as a whaler He chose to return to Japan in 1850 He returned to Hawaii and bought a boat He and his friends from the fishing boat started to sail back to Japan in December of 1850 Japan was still a closed country Because of this he was investigated by the Shogunate for a long time 

Around this time Shimazu Nariakira a historical person in Japan was interested in English and shipbuilding John Manjiro began working as an English teacher He had a strong friendship with many statesmen He was even asked to be a statesman himself Manjiro was the only Japanese person who would speak English Because of this he was the interpreter for Commodore Perry when he came to Japan He also taught the alphabet song to Japan 

In his later years Manjiro visited American friends By then he could not speak English very well any more He died in 1898 at the age of 71 years old

John Manjiro was actually born as Nakahama Manjiro The name John comes from the name of the ship he was saved by when on the island in 1841 The name of the ship was John Mung The captain gave Manjiro this name In 1938 Ibuse Masuji a Japanese writer first used the name John Manjiro From this book came the name of John Manjiro

Manjiro had problems translating because he was not good at translating English sentences This was because he had not learned basic grammar when he was young He was used as interpreter when Commodore Perry came in 1863 Manjiro pronounced English just as he heard it His pronunciation was different from present day English Japanese based their pronunciation of English at the time on Manjiros pronunciation They were able to be understood by Americans and English people

There is a musical about Manjiro in Japan It is called The Dream of John Manjiro It was first done in June 1974

John Manjiro was the first Japanese man to set foot on the contintental United States to take a train to ride a steamship and to wear a necktie John Manjiro talked about world views with Ryoma Sakamoto a famous Japanese statesman and general

Proper motion is the name for the way the stars seem to slowly move relative to each other when seen from Earth 

The movement is caused by the fact that all stars are moving through space at hundreds of kilometres per second However because they are so far away it takes a long time for us to see that they have moved and even then it takes a powerful telescope to see the difference Because of this for a long time most people thought that the stars did not move at all Even the ancient Greeks who knew a lot about the stars and discovered some of the other ways they move such as stellar precession did not discover proper motion 

Proper motion was not proved to exist until 1718 when Edmond Halley noticed the stars Sirius Arcturus and Aldebaran had moved from the places they were in star charts that Hipparchus had drawn around 130 BC However even after more than 1800 years they had moved less than half a degree

Proper motion is useful to astronomers in figuring out how far away a star is from Earth because stars that are close usually have a larger proper motion than stars that are farther away For example Barnards star has the largest proper motion of any star moving 103 arcseconds per year This is equal to one quarter of a degree or half the diameter of the Moon in the sky in only 87 years It is the second closest star to the Earth at 598 light years away Also eight of the ten stars with the biggest proper motions are less than 15 light years away

The origin of birds is one of the most interesting questions in palaeontology and evolution 

Thomas Henry Huxley who was a comparative anatomist made a study of this nearly 150 years ago He compared the first fossil bird Archaeopteryx with a small theropod dinosaur Compsognathus They are two fossils from the same place and time the Solnhofen limestone in Bavaria Germany The strata come from the end of the Jurassic period about 144 million years ago 

Huxleys papers on Archaeopteryx and the origin of birds were of great interest then and still are He showed that the two fossils were almost identical except for the front limbs and feathers of Archaeopteryx 

He united reptiles and birds under the title of Sauropsida and thought that birds had evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs

All palaeontologists since Huxley agreed that Archaeopteryx evolved from reptiles but many thought it was derived from an earlier type than dinosaurs It took a long time before they agreed with Huxley Almost all now think that early members of a group of small carnivorous dinosaur were ancestral to birds 

The group most favoured as ancestral is the Paraves or Eumaniraptora which includes the dromaeosaurs and the troodonts The dromaeosaurs include Velociraptor and Deinonychus but of course it would have been an earlier type of dromaeosaur perhaps from the lower Jurassic Dromaeosaurs have several traits we used to think were special to birds hollow bones with holes for air sacs limbs with many bones either lost or fused clavicles fused into wishbones and feathers 

The discovery of feathered dinosaurs and birds in the Lower Cretaceous of China was what finally convinced palaeontologists What seems to have happened is this Theropod dinosaurs evolved feathers for heat regulation rather than flight From then a small group began to use them for primitive flight This group is represented in the Jurassic by Archaeopteryx and Anchiornis

Anchiornis huxlei is so far the only dinobird fossil known which lived before Archaeopteryx It was found in Liaoning China The strata dates to the mid late Jurassic period 160 to 155 million years ago There are also feather bearing non flying dinosaurs from the Jurassic of China such as the maniraptoran Epidexipteryx Epidexipteryx is the earliest known example of ornamental feathers in the fossil record about 152 to 168 million years ago 

Anchiornis had large wings made up of flight feathers attached to the arm and hand as well as flight feathers on the hind legs forming an arrangement of fore and hind wings The forewing of Anchiornis was composed of 11 primary feathers and 10 secondary feathers The primary feathers in Anchiornis indicated poorer aerodynamic ability compared to its later relatives In Microraptor and Archaeopteryx the longest forewing feathers were closest to the tip of the wing making the wings appear long narrow and pointed However in Anchiornis the longest wing feathers anchored near the wrist making the wing broadest in the middle and tapering near the tip for a more rounded less flight adapted profile

So the animal could glide but probably not fly

Flying gave the birds access to many new habitats and an adaptive radiation took place We see the results of this rapid evolution in the Chinese fossils from the Lower Cretaceous which are more varied and mostly more advanced than Archaeopteryx There are now 31 different bird genera from the Lower Cretaceous of China It is also clear from the tail feathers of Confuciusornis that some of these birds were already using feathers for signalling and display just as they do today Like heat regulation using feathers for display may be much earlier than flight Confuciusornis is the fifth oldest bird fossil about 25 million years after Archaeopteryx Most dinosaurs died out in the KT extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous The only ones that survived were the birds The birds therefore are not just the descendents of reptiles but the descendents of theropod dinosaurs Birds are the last surviving dinosaurs

The pigments preserved in a 120 million year old fossil bird have been revealed using X rays A team scanned the beautifully preserved fossils of Gansus yumenensis and Confuciusornis sanctus Their study published in the journal Science revealed the chemical fingerprint of pigments that once tinted the ancient birds feathers The trace metals copper is a marker for the dark pigment eumelanin The X ray technique was so sensitive that it was able to show that each molecule of copper it detected was being tugged and squashed into a particular shape because it was bound within a eumelanin molecule

Research of this kind has now been repeated several times

This is an informal grouping of theropods closest related to birds These groups are small dinosaurs They definitely have pennaceous feathers and therefore probably temperature regulation One proposed classification is 

The earliest example of a dinobird is a troodont Anchiornis huxlei from the Upper Jurassic This specimen pre dates Archaeopteryx by 510 million years and predates any other feathered dinosaur from its location by 2535 million years This species had long feathers on its hind limbs as well as fore limbs and could glide but probably not fly 

At least this clade of theropods had well developed genuine feathers before the first known bird Feathering in other groups of theropods is still uncertain One compsognathid Sinosauropteryx has plumaceous feathers as does Shuvuuia another small theropod Apparently many small theropods carried feathers whose function was thermoregulation

There is now evidence that many early bird groups went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period

Researchers dated the fossils to within 300000 years of the boundary layer at the end of the Cretaceous

All living birds are Neornithes a subclass in traditional taxonomy The Ornithurae is the natural group made up of modern birds and their extinct relatives Their relatives include Ichthyornis and Hesperornis and some of the Chinese Cretaceous birds They all have a plough shaped pygostyle a bone at the end of the tail which allows the tail feathers to fan and retract Other groups of birds became extinct in the KT extinction event

Gansus is a genus of aquatic birds that lived during the Lower Cretaceous somewhere between 115 to 105 million years ago in what is now Gansu province western China It may be the oldest known of the Ornithurae depending how that group is defined 

Under any definition all living birds including taxa as diverse as ostriches hummingbirds and eagles are descended from basal ornithurans many of which were semi aquatic It is now thought possible that all modern birds descended specifically from a semi aquatic bird similar to Gansus Thus while Gansus is not necessarily a direct ancestor of todays birds it is closely related to such an ancestral species

In Greek mythology Pandoras box was a large jar carried by Pandora It contained the evils to be let loose on mankind When the box was empty hope remained The actual evils are not specified by Hesiod

The word used in the original text is pithos which usually refers to a large container used to store wine or other things Such containers were also used for funerals In the case of Pandora this jar may have been made of clay for use as storage as in the usual sense or instead of bronze metal as an unbreakable prison

The mistranslation of pithos as box is usually attributed to the 16th century humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam Erasums is thought to have made the error when he translated Hesiods tale of Pandora into Latin Hesiods pithos refers to a storage jar for oil or grain Erasmus however translated pithos into the Latin word pyxis meaning box The phrase Pandoras box has endured ever since This error was further backed by Dante Gabriel Rossettis painting Pandora

Longshore drift is the process of the ocean currents forcing sand and other material down a beach eventually washing it all out to sea The material is first pulled into the currents by the backwash and is then pushed back up the beach by the swash Longshore drift always moves in the direction of the main wind If longshore drift continues for a long time beaches can be destroyed which would reduce the amount of money coastal resorts get 

There are however many inexpensive and effective ways of controlling longshore drift The most common method is groynes A small minority of people dislike the groynes because they are not very nice to look at

1 The waves carry the rock material up the beach at an angle 2 The backwash carries the material directly down into the sea or it stays there 3 This process goes again

Gatorade has been the subject of substantial media attention and reference in popular culture situations most of which are in relation to team or individual athletic sports The most notable and ongoing presence of Gatorade in popular culture is the Gatorade shower originally called the Gatorade Dunk where players from a victorious team pick up the Gatorade cooler sneak up behind the head coach and pour the contents of the cooler over his head at the end of an American football game This tradition was popularized in the mid 1980s when Harry Carson and Jim Burt of the New York Giants doused head coach Bill Parcells during the 1985 season Burts teammates picked up on this practice and popularized it during the teams championship season of 1986 87 The tradition has since become a recurring tradition across other team sports

Gatorade has also achieved status as the clich representative for sports drinks in American media for example in the film Clerks the character Dante is at one point forced to give free Gatorade to his hockey teammates and in the film The Waterboy Adam Sandler is told that the water sucks and that Gatorade is superior

The phrase Roaring Twenties describes the 1920s a time in North America when art society and culture were rapidly changing 

The North American economy during the 1920s was doing very well because World War I had just ended Many new products were being made for the consumer

Culture The culture of the Roaring Twenties was very different from before Womens roles were changed Liberal young women called flappers wore short skirts cut their hair short and listened to a new form of music called jazz Women were also getting the right to vote Writers like F Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway were called the Lost Generation because they moved out of the United States after the war African American art and culture also grew a lot during the Harlem Renaissance

A topological space is a space studied in topology the mathematics of the structure of shapes Roughly it is a set of things along with a way to know which things are close together

More precisely a topological space has a certain kind of set called open sets Open sets are important because they allow one to talk about points near another point called a neighbourhood of the point A neighbourhood of a point is simply an open set containing that point If one did not have the concept of open sets one cannot define neighbourhoods in a good way If one tries to define a neighbourhood of a point as any set containing that point it might just include that point and that point only not any points near it or points far away We also have the concept of closed sets which are complements of open sets That is all of the points not belonging to a certain open sets forms a closed set

Open sets must follow certain rules so that they match our ideas of nearness The union of any number of open sets must be open and the union of a finite number of closed sets must be closed As a special case the set containing every point is both open and closed

A set of points can have many different definitions of what an open set is One can think of only certain sets as open or more sets as open One might even consider every set to be open The same set with different definitions of open sets form different topological spaces

A Fire extinguisher is a device which can be used to control a fire Fire extinguishers can help remove the fire and may stop it from burning Depending on the size some fire extinguishers can be carried around and operated by hand There are different kinds of fire extinguishers Different kinds of fire can be controlled by different substances There are color codes the color tells what kinds of fires the fire extinguisher is useful for

There are also different sizes of fire extinguishers Bigger fire extinguishers can be used for a longer time Hand held fire extinguishers vary between 05 and 14 kg A 2 kg extinguisher works for about two to four seconds the 12 kg model for about eighteen seconds There are also bigger fire extinguishers mounted on a cart or a vehicle These are used to fight fires at airports for example

To be useful fire extinguishers need to be checked at regular intervals Usually there are laws about this duration concerning fire exinguishers in public buildings

Gerrymandering is when a political group tries to change a voting district to create a result that helps them or hurts the group who is against them It is named after Elbridge Gerry Gerrymandering works by wasting votes It puts more votes of winners into the district they will win so the losers win in another district 

If we have Group A and Group B both trying to win in a district Group A has 40 votes and Group B has 50 In another district Group A knows Group B will win for sure Group A changes the voting district so that 11 votes are moved to the other district Now they will win 40 votes to 39

Suffrage is the right to vote Most countries allow citizens to vote once they are legally an adult In the past not all people were allowed to vote In general most countries today do not stop people of a different race or sex from voting 

Suffrage can also apply to states themselves Article V of the U S Constitution does not allow any amendment to take away the States equal suffrage in the Senate

Suffrage can also mean the right to run for office Some people call the right to run for office candidate eligibility Full suffrage means both the right to vote and the right to run for office

Windows Product Activation is a service built into all versions of Windows from Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 above to stop people downloading pirated copies The user has 30 days to activate Windows and after 30 days the computer will not run properly until it is activated

When Windows is first installed there will be a little icon on the screen with a message asking for Windows to be activated

Then an activation wizard will appear and the user has 2 options on activating Windows Activation could be done on the Internet or on the telephone The quickest way to activate is by the Internet but if that fails then the user would need to call Microsoft for the activation ID The activation ID would be read by the representative and then the user would type in the key on the activation Wizard screen

An algorithm is a step by step list of directions that need to be followed to solve a problem The instructions should be simple enough so that each step can be done without thinking about it Algorithms are often used to describe how a computer might solve a problem But there are algorithms in the real world too A recipe can be a type of algorithm It tells what ingredients are needed to make the dish and what steps to follow If the recipe tells exactly what to do without too much confusion then it is an algorithm

There is usually more than one way to solve a problem There may be many different recipes to make a certain dish which look different but end up tasting the same when all is said and done The same is true for algorithms However some of these ways will be better than others If a recipe needs lots of complicated ingredients that you do not have it is not as a good as a simple recipe When we look at algorithms as a way of solving problems often we want to know how long it would take a computer to solve the problem using a particular algorithm When we write algorithms we like our algorithm to take the least amount of time so that we can solve our problem as quickly as possible

In cooking some recipes are more difficult to do than others because they take more time to finish or have more things to keep track of It is the same for algorithms and algorithms are better when they are easier for the computer to do The thing that measures how hard an algorithm is is called complexity When we ask how complex an algorithm is often we want to know how long it will take a computer to solve the problem we want it to solve

This is an example of an algorithm for sorting cards with colors on them into piles of the same color

These are examples of algorithms for sorting a stack of cards with many different numbers so that the numbers are in order

Finally the array is sorted and the algorithm can stop

This is an easy to understand algorithm for sorting Computer scientists called it Bubble sort because smaller elements will rise to the top changing their position in each run Unfortunately the algorithm is not very good because it needs a long time to sort it

This algorithm uses another idea Sometimes solving a problem is difficult but the problem can be changed so it is made of simpler problems that are easier to solve This is called recursion It is more difficult to understand than the first example but it will give a better algorithm

This works with two stacks of cards One of them is called A the other is called B There is a third stack that is empty at the start called C At the end it will contain the result

John von Neumann developed this algorithm in 1945 He did not call it Sorting by numbers he called it Mergesort It is a very good algorithm for sorting compared to others

The first algorithm takes much longer to sort the cards than the second but it can be improved Looking at bubble sort it can be noticed that cards with high numbers move from the top of the stack quite quickly but cards with low numbers at the bottom of the stack take a long time to rise To improve the first algorithm here is the idea

This algorithm was developed by C A R Hoare in 1960 It is one of most widely used algorithms for sorting today It is called Quicksort

If players have cards with colors and numbers on them they can sort them by color and number if they do the sorting by colors algorithm then do the sorting by numbers algorithm to each colored stack then put the stacks together

The sorting by numbers algorithms are more difficult to do than the sorting by colors algorithm because they may have to do the steps again many times One would say that sorting by numbers is more complex

John Caesar known as Black Caesar was the first Australian bushranger He was also the first black person with an African background to come to Australia He was the first bushranger to have a reward offered for his capture

Caesar was most likely born in Madagascar in about 1763 He was a slave on a sugar plantation in the West Indies He ran away and went to London On 17 March 1786 he was in court at Deptford Kent for stealing 240 shillings He was sent to Australia as a convict for seven years He left on the Alexander a convict transport ship in the First Fleet in May 1787 and arrived in Botany Bay in January 1788

On 29 April 1789 he was caught stealing food Two weeks later he escaped into the bush taking food an iron cooking pot and a musket taken from a marine named Abraham Hand He could not catch enough animals to eat and he began to steal food from the settlement On 26 May he stole food from a brick making gang at Brickfield Hill and was nearly caught On June 6 he tried to steal food from Zachariah Clark who was the assistant in charge of the new colonys food supplies Caesar was caught by a convict named William Saltmarsh 

In July 1789 David Collins the colonys Judge Advocate said that John Caesar was the hardest working convict in the new colony He said that he was a large man with a lot of muscles but he was always hungry He would eat food meant to last two days in one meal and would then need to steal more food from others All his thefts were about getting more food

After he was captured Collins said Caesar was a wretch who did not care if he died Caesar told Collins that he would make if was hanged he would turn into a joke by playing a trick on the executioner Governor Arthur Phillip however thought Caesar would be more use working and sent him to Garden Island where he would work in with his legs tied with iron chain He was well behaved and the chains were soon taken off

Caesar soon escaped again on 22 December used a canoe to get off the island taking a weeks worth of food He stole a musket and lived by taking food from gardens and taking the food of Aboriginals after scaring them away with his gun After he lost the gun at Rose Hill and was attacked by the Aborigines leaving him wounded in several places He gave himself up on the 31 December to an officer at Rose Hill 

On 6 March 1790 Caesar was sent to Norfolk Island There he had one daughter later named Mary Ann Fisher Power to Ann Power He was taken back to Sydney in 1793 and began stealing from the farms and huts again He was caught and then flogged This did not make any difference Caesar said that all that would not make him better 

Caesar later became a hero for capturing Pemulwuy an Aboriginal who had begun a guerilla war against the British settlement

In 1795 Black Caesar ran away for the last time and formed a gang of runaways On 29 January 1796 a reward of five gallons of rum was offered by Governor John Hunter for his capture Every day there were reports of missing things but he was able to avoid being captured until 15 February A man named Wimbow who had been searching for days found him in an area of thick bush called Liberty Plains and shot him He died soon after

A musket is a muzzle loaded smoothbore long gun which is meant to be fired from the shoulder 

The musket is the weapon that replaced the arquebus and was then replaced by the rifle But the word musket is also used to describe a number of different weapons including

Muskets were made for use by infantry A soldier armed with a musket was called a musketman or musketeer In the 1500s soldiers armed with a heavy arquebus called a musket supported the arquebusiers and the pikemen By the start of 1700s a lighter type of musket took over from the arquebus When the bayonet was added there was no longer a need for pikemen and almost all infantry soldiers became musketeers In the 1800s better ammunition and ways of firing the gun meant that rifling was practical for military use and the rifled musket became common A few years later the use of cartridges breechloading and multiple rounds of ammunition meant the rifled musket gave way to rifle and muskets were no longer used

Musket calibres ranged from convert05inmm to convert08inmm A smooth bore musket firing at a single target was only accurate to about convert50ydm to convert70ydm Rifled muskets in the 1850s were much better able to hit a man sized target at up to convert500ydm The advantage of this longer distance was shown at the Battle of Four Lakes where Springfield Model 1855 rifled muskets killed Indian warriors before they could get close enough with their smooth bore muskets However in the Italian War of 1859 French forces were able to defeat the longer range of Austrian rifle muskets by quick small attacks and bayonet attacks at close range

The ALPHA Collaboration is a group of physicists from about 11 universities who work together to try to trap neutral antimatter The neutral antimatter they are working to trap is antihydrogen This is the antimatter version of hydrogen the first atom in the periodic table Antihydrogen like hydrogen has two oppositely charged particles Hydrogen has a proton and an electron and so antihydrogen would have an antiproton and a positron A positron is the common name for the antielectron

The ALPHA collaboration has its experiment at CERN in Geneva in Switzerland CERN is the only place in the world that can provide slow antiprotons that can be easily captured by ALPHA ALPHA then brings these antiprotons into contact with positrons and form antihydrogen 

Antihydrogen has like many atoms and especially hydrogen a small magnetic dipole moment A dipole moment is another way of saying that the atom behaves a bit as if it was a tiny magnet with a north and a south pole Normally such small magnets are attracted to other magnets However some atoms in some states behave such that they are repelled by magnetic fields This means that the atoms could possibly be trapped in space by making a minimum of the magnetic field ALPHA is trying to do just that with antihydrogen By a clever arrangement of magnets ALPHA has a so called magnetic minimum trap in which antihydrogen may be trapped 

This is a difficult process The magnetic forces on these atoms are quite weak so the trap can only contain antihydrogen atoms of very low motional energy that is at very low temperature The current state of the art ALPHA trap can contain antihydrogen atoms in their ground state if they are colder than about 05 Kelvin ALPHA is currently working on making such cold antihydrogen

Forestle is a website for finding all kinds of information on the internet Forestle helps to save the rain forest and reduces the total carbon dioxide production It also offers special features for example a preview of the websites found during a search It was invented in 2008

Forestle saves 01 square meters of rain forest per search It earns money from showing advertisements along with the websites found and Forestle guarantees to donate 90 of this money to buy areas of rain forest through its partner organization The Nature Conservancy As of October 2009 about 1991055 square meters of rain forest have been saved

For searching the web using Forestle is also essentially CO2 neutral Of course the server computers used by Forestle the connection network and the computer of the searching users need electric energy and thus create emissions of carbon dioxide but Forestle purchases an equivalent amount of renewable energy certificates The certificates are purchased from a part of the 10 of money left after buying rain forest This makes Forestle one of the few web search sites that are green certified

The number of search requests on Forestleorg grows significantly There were 4000 search requests per day on average in December 2008 about 10000 per day in January 2009 and currently there are more than 20000 requests per day

Forestle thus offers a simple alternative form of searching the web in a way that helps the environment

How large the effects of using such a green search method actually are is discussed

Forestle offers a website preview that shows small versions of the web sites found in each search The search page offered by Forestle is very simple and only contains a window to type in words to be searched for the search results and a few links to check related services as well as explanations about how Forestle works Forestle meanwhile also provides several browser plugins can be added to iGoogle and can be used in English and German as well as in Spanish and Dutch

Forestle used the search services of Google until Google forbid them to do that after four days of service the reasons was that Google and Forestle had a fight it was not clear whether Forestle broke the terms of service fixed in the contract between them Forestleorg states that google did not actually give reasons for stopping their service The action by google to not support Forestle any more immediately drew international attention Details about the conflict between Google and Forestle are debated Forestle is now associated with Yahoo

Roman clef means novel with a key in French It is a phrase used for talking about literature and film A roman clef is a type of story thats true for the most part except for details like the name of the main character The key part of the meaningwhat someone needs to unlock the real storychanges from book to book For some books it is knowing that the main character is really a famous person For others it is knowing that the main character is really the author

Authors usually write these types of stories to talk about a controversy or what happened during a crime so that the people involved cant sue them A couple of movies that are written like this are Citizen Kane and Dreamgirls

Because it comes from French the plural of roman clef is romans clef

Tetraphobia is a fear of the number 4 It is a superstition found most often in East Asian areas like China Japan Korea and Taiwan

The Chinese word for four sounds very similar to the word for death

Chinese people take care not use the number 4 during important holidays or if someone in the family is sick Numbers such as 14 24 and so on are not used because they also have the number 4 in them Buildings sometimes do not have floors with these numbers apartments and hotels do not have rooms with number 4 14 24 and so on Table number 4 14 24 may be often left out in wedding dinners or other social activities in these countries Where there are a lot of apartment buildings buildings that should be 4 14 24 are called 3A 13A 23A and so on

In Hong Kong some apartments such as Vision City and The Arch do not have the floors from 40 to 49 Immediately above 39F is 50F leading many who do not know about tetraphobia to think that some floors are missing

The Chinese start numbering their military aircraft with the number 5 such as the fighter plane Shenyang J 5 The Taiwanese and the South Korean navies do not use the number 4 when giving flag numbers to their ships

In cities where East Asian and Western cultures come together like Hong Kong and Singapore it is possible in some buildings that both 13 and 14 are left out as floor numbers along with all the other 4s

In Korea tetraphobia is not as important but the floor number 4 is almost always left out in hospitals In other buildings the fourth floor is sometimes named F instead of 4 in elevators Apartment numbers with a lot of the number 4 are hard to sell and often they are not worth as much money

Steve Hart was an Australian bushranger and a member of the Kelly Gang A close friend of Ned Kellys brother Dan Kelly Hart was caught up in the murder of three policemen at Stringybark Creek He was killed during the siege at Glenrowan Victoria

Hart was born at Three Mile Creek near Wangaratta Victoria in 1860 His parents Richard Hart and Bridget Young had come from Ireland They had other children Richard Dick Hart Hugh Hart Thomas Hart Nicholas Hart Esther Ettie Hart Jane Hart and Winifred Hart

Hart was a small man and a very good horse rider His brother Nicholas was a jockey One story says Steve worked as a jockey around Beechworth and Wangaratta and won The Benalla Handicap after a protest was upheld He did not open farm gates and always jumped them with his horse

In 1877 Hart was sent to Beechworth Gaol for 12 months for stealing 13 horsesrp100 He met Dan Kelly while in prison When he was let out of gaol he went to Bullock Creek to look for gold with Dan Kelly He is reported to have said a short life and a merry onerp100 He was at Bullock Creek while Dan and Ned Kelly were in hiding from the police The gang which on that day included Joe Byrne heard gun shots and discovered a police search party camped nearby at Stringybark Creek The next day the gang went to the camp to take the policemens guns Three policemen were killed and the gang were made outlaws which meant that they could be captured dead or alive for a reward At this time the police did not know Hart was a member of the gang As a member of the Kelly Gang he often rode around in womens clothes to avoid being caught During the search for the Kelly Gang the police were told to stop women riders to see if they were really women The stories of how Neds sister Kate Kelly did things to help the gang were probably really about Steve Hart

Hart took part in the bank robberies at Euroa and Jerilderie At Euroa he met an old school friend of his Francis Fanny Shaw and through her the police found out his name Hart also stole a watch from Robert Scott the bank manager When a bank worker Bob Booth asked him for something to remember the visit by Hart gave him a lead bullet carved with the letter H 

At Jerilderie in 1879 the Kelly gang held many people hostage in the Royal Hotel before robbing the bank Hart stole a watch from Reverend Gribble a parson at the Protestant churchrp369 Ned told Hart he was a common thief and made him give the the watch backrp369 After Jerilderie Hart went into hiding with the gang for most of 1879 although Hart did go to a StKilda doctor to be treated for a foot problem

In June 1880 Ned Kelly came up with a plan to get his mother released from prison Dan Kelly and Joe Byrne went to Beechworth and killed their friend Aaron Sherritt who they thought was a police spy They knew this would bring many police by train to Beechworth to capture them In the meantime Hart and Ned Kelly had gone to Glenrowan and forced railway workers to pull up the train tracks They hoped the police train would crash and then wearing home made armour they would capture the surviving policemenrp153 These would be held as hostages until Ellen Kelly was set free

Hart and Kelly forced many people of the town into a small hotel owned by Ann Jones They were joined by Dan Kelly and Byrne who had ridden quickly across country from Beechworth They waited at the hotel for the police The plan failed when news of the Sherritt murder took a long time to reach Melbourne The people kept at the hotel were becoming difficult to keep under control Ned Kelly let one man go free at 300am the school teacher Thomas Curnow who said he had to get home to his wife Instead he went to the train line and was able to stop the police train safelyrp158 The police went to the hotel and began shooting It is estimated that 15000 bullets were fired Joe Byrne was shot dead in the front room of the hotel Ned Kelly left the hotel in the eraly morning probably to meet with other men who were going to help him capture the train He was captured by the police 

At 1000am the police were forced to stop shooting to allow some of the hostages to escape Several including the hotel owners son had been shot dead Dan Kellys sister Maggie Skillion and a Catholic priest Father Gibney tried to go to the hotel to tell Steve and Dan to give themselves up but were stopped by the police The police ordered that a cannon be sent from Nelbourne so they could blast the two men outrp162 At 230pm the police set the hotel on fire and Father Gibney rushed insiderp162 Gibney saw the bodies of Hart and Dan Kelly lying side by side in a room at the back of the hotel with their heads resting on blanketsrp162 They had removed the armour which was place beside them It is most likely they had killed themselves

The bodies of Hart and Kelly were badly burned during the fire People who saw the burned and blackened bodies were unable to tell which was Dan Kelly and which was Steve Hartrp30 Harts body little more than a blackened stump was taken by his brother Dick Hart and buried at Greta Cemetery the following day 29 June 1880 in the same grave as Dan Kelly He was 21 years old After the graves were filled in the whole area was ploughed over to keep the site of the graves hiddenrp206 The family was worried that the police would still try to get the bodies Harts armour is on display at the Victoria Police Museum in Melbourne

Over the years there have been claims that Hart and Dan Kelly did not die at the hotel but escaped and went to live in Queensland A man named Billy Meade as he was dying in 1938 told a nurse he was really Hart Another story says Hart and Dan Kelly went to South Africa After serving in the Boer War they went to India where Hart is said to have drowned himself in Calcutta in 1917 There is no evidence to prove these stories

Psalm 151 is a short psalm that is controversial because it is in some versions of the Bible but not others In particular it is in several very old Greek translations of the Bible but is not in the Hebrew Bible There has been a lot of debate over whether or not the psalm should be considered part of the Bible

The psalm has been known about for a long time and the Greek version was used for study for hundreds of years When the Dead Sea Scrolls were found and translated part of Psalm 151 was in them This surprised the researchers very much but not as much as what they would find later on

After studying the scrolls they noticed that the Greek translator had actually made a mistake Two different pieces of two different psalms were treated like they were one big psalm when they were not There is a big change in the Greek version after the fifth line and is a lot more like a story than most of the other psalms which are more like poems

The Greek version of the psalm says that it was written by King David after his battle with Goliath It talks about how even though David was the least of all his brothers God chose him to be king It then talks about how David cut off Goliaths head with Goliaths own sword after killing him with his slingshot

The Eastern Orthodox Church accepts Psalm 151 as part of the Bible but Roman Catholics most Protestants and most Jews do notfactdateJanuary 2010 However it can be found in some Catholic Bibles and in certain other Bible translations like the New Revised Standard VersionfactdateJanuary 2010

Catherine Ada Kelly known as Kate Kelly was a younger sister of Australian bushranger Ned Kelly 

Kate Kelly was born in Beveridge Victoria Australia in a house built by her parents John Red Kelly and Ellen Quinn Kate was their seventh child The family moved to Avenel soon after her birth where another child Grace was born John Kelly died of dropsy when Kate was four years old Ellen Kelly then moved the family to her sisters house at Greta One year later the family moved again to a two room hut on their own land at Eleven Mile Creek Kate helped her mother bring up the family which included three more children by Ellens second husband George King

The Kellys had already had a long history of trouble with the police Alexander Fitzpatrick a young policeman went to the house on 15 April 1878 He was drunk and said he wanted to arrest Dan Kelly for horse stealing He sexually assaulted Kate and her family tried to help her Historians can not agree on what really happened next

Fitzpatrick went back to Benalla Police Station and said that Ellen Kelly had hit him on the head with shovel He also said that Dan Kelly had hit him and Ned Kelly had tried to shoot him William Skillion Kates brother in law and William Williamson a neighbour of the Kellys were also said to have hurt him Ned Kelly said that he was not at the house but working on a farm 400 miles away though most historians believe he was at the house with Joe Byrne

Ellen Kelly was sent to prison for three years for trying to kill Fitzpatrick Williamson and Skillion were sent for six year Ned and Dan Kelly hid at Bullock Creek in the Wombat Ranges so the police could not find them On the 25 October 1878 at Stringybark Creek they met four policemen who had been sent to arrest them Three of the policemen were killed Ned Dan Joe Byrne and Steve Hart were made outlaws and turned to bank robbery

With their mother in prison and their brothers being hunted by the police Kate Kelly and her sister Margaret looked after the younger children Kate also helped trick the police leading the police away when they got close to her brothers She supplied the Kelly Gang with food ammunition and news about the police hunt The folk song Ye Sons of Australia has a part about Kate helping the Kelly Gang 

The song places Kate Kelly at the siege at Glenrowan

Historians now think that many of the actions thought to have been carried out by Kate was really gang member Steve Hart in a dress

Following Neds arrest Kate would often visit him in prison as well as raising money for legal costs She got people to sign petitions asking for mercy for Ned Kate begged on her knees in front of the Governor His Excellency the Marquis of Normanby to save her brothers life Ned was hanged on 11 November 1880

On the night of the hanging Kate and her brother Jim Kelly went on stage at the Appollo Hall in Melbourne People paid one shilling to see them sitting on the stage Kate and Jim went to Sydney and continued to appear on stage with Jim riding Ned Kellys horse The police stopped the shows She was seen performing as Ada in a Sydney Wild West Show and then in Adelaide under the names Ada Hennessey and Kate Ambrose She stopped performing due to ill health She worked for a short time at Hill Scotts Hotel in Adelaide before her poor health forced her to return home to Greta She worked as a servant in Wangaratta and a maid in Lanceby 

On 25 November 1888 she married William Henry Foster a blacksmith and lived in the town of Forbes They had six children though three died when they were still babies

On 6 October 1898 Kate was reported missing She was found drowned eight days later in a swamp near Forbes Some historians think that she may have taken her own life because she had depression brought on by the death of her sister Maggie two years earlier She was buried in the Forbes Cemetery aged 36

After her death her three children Frederick Arthur Gertrude Eileen Ada and Ethel Maude went to live with Ellen Kelly at Eleven Mile Creek Frederick Arthur became a beekeeper in the town of Myrrhee and died in World War I Gertrude married Arthur Cavanagh a builder They lived in Wangaratta and looked after Ellen Kelly in her old age Ethel married Albert Hibbert and also looked after Ellen Kelly

In nuclear physics beta decay is a type of radioactive decay where a beta particle is made and sent away or emitted When it is an electron it is called beta minus but when it is a positron its called a beta plus

Beta particles are electrons or positrons emitted by some radioactive nuclei such as potassium 40 The beta particles emitted are a form of ionizing radiation sometimes called beta rays When there are beta particles made it is called beta decay When scientists write it down in an equation they are usually written as the Greek letter beta There are two forms of beta decay and which make the electron and the positron

A scientific law is an equation or statement that most scientists agree is true A hypothesis becomes a law if the hypothesis is tested many many times and is almost always true

A gravitational singularity is a place in a black hole where the gravity is thought to be infinite Most scientists do not think that it is actually infinite but it is useful for their maths to treat it like it is

A supermassive black hole is a black hole with a mass that is between 105 and 1010 the mass of the sun Scientists are confident that almost all galaxies even the Milky Way possess supermassive black holes at their centers

A supermassive black hole is formed when a giant star collapses or explodes and forms clouds or universal matter of high density such as dark matter Supermassive black holes may also be formed without a supernova explosion After the giant explosion the matter will clump together ripping the fabric of time Thus supermassive black holes are simply like larger versions of black holes

In general relativity an event horizon is a part of a black hole Imagine the black hole to be like a ball that you could see in a large spot of emptiness The event horizon would then be an outer bubble that surrounds that ball It would be like a little circle inside a bigger circle The space between the little circle and the big circle would be the event horizon If an object goes past the event horizon it can never get away from it Light that is emitted from the side of the event horizon near the black hole can never reach an observer on the other side If an observer saw an object fall into a black hole it would look like the object was stuck at the event horizon forever

The Spider Plant Chlorophytum comosum is a species of Chlorophytum native to South Africa

Spider plants have long narrow leaves that are 2040 cm long and 520 mm broad They grow from a central rosette It also produces branched stolons with small white flowers and baby plantlets

It is a very popular houseplant The most widely grown is the variegated cultivar Variegatum It has one or two broad yellowish white bands running along the length of each leaf Natural entirely green plants are also grown 

The Spider Plant is very easy to spread They can be propagated by splitting its main rosette It is even easier to remove plantlets from the stolons and plant them separately or put them in a glass of water They will grow roots readily in water but establish faster in soil while still attached to the parent plant Pinning the plantlet to the soil with a bent paper clip can be helpful Make sure the soil is damp and well drained The plantlet can then be removed from the parent plant in 7 10 days

It is a very popular plant with beginners as it is easy to grow and propagate

Spider plants have also been shown to reduce indoor air pollution

At the spot where a leaf would normally develop a node these plants will produce adventitious roots down into the soil and new above ground shoots
