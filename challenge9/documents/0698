Franois Couperin was a French composer who lived in the Baroque period Many of his relatives were composers He is often called Franois Couperin le Grand because he was the most famous of the Couperin family He is best known today for his harpsichord music He wrote several pieces which he called Ordres meaning the same as the word suite ie a collection of dance movements Sometimes these movements have strange titles and we cannot always be sure what they mean Some of them may have been nicknames of people he knew He also wrote important organ music He never had a family of his own before he died

Christoph Willibald Ritter von Gluck was a German composer  He is famous for his operas which were written in a new and exciting way He was not interested in writing operas which were just a series of songs for singers to show off He wanted to make his operas into good pieces of drama His operas had a big influence on later composers like Mozart Weber and Wagner He wrote Italian operas and French operas  Orfeo ed Euridice includes song Che far senza Euridice which is one of the best known opera songs ever written

Jan Ladislav Dussek was a Bohemian composer of the Classical period He travelled a lot living in Holland Lithuania Italy France and England He lived nearly twelve years in London where he was a fashionable teacher and famous composer He is best remembered now for his piano music

Johannes Brahms was a famous German composer He started his career as a pianist He was always very self critical and destroyed any composition he thought was not really good He thought that people were expecting him to be the next Beethoven and spent many years on his first symphony before he allowed it to be performed He wrote four symphonies four concertos a requiem piano music chamber music and songs Perhaps his best known tune is his Wiegenlied often called Brahms Lullaby used in many a childs musical box

Brahmss father was a double bass player in the Hamburg city orchestra He probably gave the young boy his first music lessons He soon was learning the piano with a teacher named Otto Cossel When Brahms played in a public concert in 1843 an American agent asked him to tour America but his teacher realized he was too young He said that Johannes should study with Eduard Marxsen a well known teacher in Hamburg By 1848 he was playing piano recitals He also started to compose and he sent some of his compositions to Robert Schumann to ask for his advice Schumann sent the parcel back unopened

At this time there were many Hungarian musicians in Hamburg Brahms liked their folk music with its unusual rhythms little triplet figures and sense of rubato It was to influence his own style of composition One of the Hungarians was called Remenyi He played the violin and Brahms often accompanied him at concerts They went on tour together and met famous people such as the composer Franz Liszt and the violinist Joseph Joachim who became a close friend of Brahms for many years Joachim told Brahms to go and see Schumann and his wife Clara in Dsseldorf Schumann liked Brahms and could see that he was going to be a great composer so he wrote an article in his music journal about him The article had the title Neue Bahnen Schumann turned out to be correct Brahms did become a famous composer and found new paths Brahms remained a very close friend of Schumann When Schumann had a nervous breakdown Brahms went all the way to Dsseldorf to see him Brahms soon fell in love with Clara who was 14 years older than himself He continued to be in love with her after Robert Schumanns death and they had a close relationship though Brahms became interested in other women and was briefly engaged However he never married

In 1859 Brahms settled in Hamburg He founded a womens chorus and wrote and arranged a lot of music for them His First Piano Concerto was a great success in Hanover and Hamburg but not in Leipzig where a lot of people preferred the wildly Romantic music of Liszt which was quite different from Brahmss style based on the Classical music style Brahms decided to go to Vienna He was to stay there for the rest of his life

In Vienna he soon made many friends who liked his music For a short time he was director of a choir called the Vienna Singakademie who sang some of his compositions He met Wagner Wagner was afraid that Brahms would start to write operas which would be more famous than his own So Wagner wrote an article saying that Brahms was a very bad conductor Wagner had made himself an enemy of Brahms who never did write any operas anyway 

In 1870 Brahms became director of a concert series called Vienna Gesellschaftskonzerte He became more and more famous as a composer but he was never very good at conducting and in 1875 a conductor called Hans Richter took over conducting the concerts During these years he finished one of his greatest works Ein deutsches Requiem as well as one of his most popular works the Variations on the St Anthony chorale

At last in 1876 he allowed his First Symphony to be performed It was not very successful at first but in Vienna the audience liked it He started to compose a lot of his greatest works and received many honours from universities In the winter he gave concerts and in the summer he spent his time composing He wrote his last symphony in 1885 and conducted it going on tour with the orchestra through Germany and the Netherlands

From 1889 Brahms spent each summer in Ischl where he had many friends By 1890 he had decided to stop composing although he did still write four beautiful works for clarinet after meeting the clarinettist Richard Mhlfeld In 1896 he wrote Four Serious Songs which were probably inspired by the sad death of Clara Schumann The next year Brahms died from cancer of the liver His father had died of the same illness

Brahms wrote a great deal of vocal music The greatest of these works is the German Requiem There were many works for choirs and a large collection of songs with piano accompaniment He wrote a lot of piano music which includes sonatas and many shorter pieces such as fantasias rhapsodies ballades intermezzos capriccios and romances His chamber music includes string quartets quintets and sextets and piano trios quartets and a piano quintet He wrote four symphonies and four concertos two for piano one for the violin and one for violin and cello The German Requiem is his greatest vocal work

Brahms was also very interested in old music and helped to edit music by Franois Couperin as well as the music of his friend Robert Schumann

Frederick Delius was an English composer At first his parents did not let him study music so he went off to Florida to work on an orange plantation He later returned studied music and settled in France for the rest of his life His music is often quite gentle and atmospheric with chords that shift about in unusual ways One of his best known orchestral works is On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring In his last years he was very ill but he still wanted to compose so he dictated the music he heard in his head to a man called Eric Fenby

Bla Bartk was a famous Hungarian composer and pianist He was one of the most important and original composers of the 20th century He showed great talent as a pianist at an early age He became very interested in folk music and travelled a lot in Hungary and other countries such as Romania listening to the folk songs which the country people sang He often used the style of these songs in his music He is famous for his piano music string quartets and several pieces for orchestra including one called Concerto for Orchestra Bartks harmonies and lively rhythms were sometimes quite new to classical music and some audiences found them difficult to understand at first

Bla Bartk was born in the small town of Nagyszentmikls In those days it was in the Austro Hungarian Empire but today it is in Romania When he was very small he showed great musical talent His mother taught him to play the piano

Bla was often ill when he was a child When he was seven his father died and his mother took him and his sister to live in Nagyszls and then to Pozsony There he gave his first public recital when he was eleven He included some music which he had composed himself

Soon he was studying the piano with Istvn Thoman who had studied with the famous Franz Liszt He had lessons in composition from Jnos Koessler at the Royal Academy of Music in Budapest There he met the composer Zoltn Kodly who was a great influence on him and who became a lifelong friend 

He soon started to compose longer pieces of music He liked the music of Richard Strauss and Claude Debussy and these influenced his style of music He started to be interested in folk music This can be heard in the first of his six string quartets

Bartk and Kodly travelled together into the countryside to collect and study old Hungarian folk melodies People in those days thought that real Magyar folk music was Gypsy music Bartk and Kodly showed that there were other traditions beside these They found music which used pentatonic scales similar to those used in some parts of Asia The two composers started to use these folk ideas in their own compositions Kodly often quoted actual folk songs in his own music while Bartk preferred to compose music which sounded like folksong without actually copying it

In 1909 Bartk married Mrta Ziegler Their son also named Bla was born in 1910

In 1911 Bartk wrote his only opera Bluebeards Castle There are only two singers in the opera Bluebeard and his wife Judith He also wrote a ballet called The Wooden Prince This started to make him famous abroad Another ballet The Miraculous Mandarin is even more famous today It shows the influence of Igor Stravinsky Arnold Schoenberg as well as Richard Strauss He wrote a lot of chamber music including a total of 6 string quartets 2 violin sonatas and a Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion He wrote some pieces for smaller orchestras Divertimento for strings and Music for Strings Percussion and Celesta

Bartk divorced Mrta in 1923 and married a piano student Ditta Psztory His second son Pter was born in 1924

When World War II broke out Bartk criticized the Nazis After they came into power in Germany he refused to give concerts there and did not use his German publisher His political ideas gave him a great deal of trouble in Hungary

Having first sent his manuscripts out of the country Bartk felt he had to emigrate to the USA with Ditta Psztory They lived in New York City Their son Pter joined them in 1942 and later joined the United States Navy Bartk s older son Bla stayed in Hungary 

Bartk did not feel comfortable in the USA and found it very difficult to compose He was also not very well known in America and not many people were interested in his music He and his wife Ditta gave concerts and for a while they were given some money to work on a collection of Yugoslav folk songs They did not have very much money although he had some friends who gave them enough to live on Serge Koussevitsky asked him to write the Concerto for Orchestra This soon became Bartks most popular work and brought him some money He was also asked by Yehudi Menuhin to write a Sonata for Solo Violin This seemed to make him interested again in composing and he went on to write his Piano Concerto No 3 and began work on his Viola Concerto

Bartk died in New York from leukemia on September 26 1945 aged 64 He left the Viola Concerto unfinished at his death it was later finished by his pupil Tibor Serly

Bartks music has many modern techniques such atonality bitonality and modern harmonies He often uses different kinds of scales and very complicated rhythms A lot of these are inspired by the folk music he heard He wrote a lot of piano music including some easy pieces for people who are learning the piano This includes a collection of pieces in six volumes called Mikrokosmos which are very popular with young musicians today

Edward Benjamin Britten Baron Britten of Aldeburgh OM CH was probably the greatest English composer of his time He came from East Anglia and he often thought about the East Anglian landscape and the sea when writing his music He wrote a lot of music for his long term partner the tenor Peter Pears His operas include Peter Grimes Billy Budd A Midsummer Nights Dream and Death in Venice His War Requiem was performed in Coventry Cathedral in 1962 after it had been rebuilt because the old cathedral had been destroyed in the war He wrote music for children which sounds like proper adult music Britten started the Aldeburgh Festival He was an excellent pianist and conductor

Britten started composing music at the age of five although he had no one to help him When he was ten years old he took part in an amateur music festival in Norwich A composer called Frank Bridge heard him and was so impressed that he offered to teach him composition He helped Britten to compose using proper musical techniques Britten started to get to know music by a lot of important modern composers including Schoenberg and Bartk In 1930 he went to the Royal College of Music He had excellent piano teachers but he did not learn much from his composition teacher John Ireland and most of the music he wrote was never performed Britten was more interested in music from abroad than in English music In 1934 he heard the opera Wozzeck by Alban Berg He wanted to go to Austria to study with Berg but he was not allowed to Meanwhile some of his first proper compositions started to be performed He wrote some music for movies that were being made by the General Post Office including one about a train delivering mail The music describes the rhythm of the train rushing along

While working on the movie music he met the writer W H Auden He started to be interested in political ideas  These can be heard in some works he wrote at this time such as Our Hunting Fathers and Ballad of Heroes When Auden emigrated to the United States Britten followed him With him was the tenor Peter Pears who was to become a lifelong friend and partner and who was to be the inspiration for many songs and operas

Britten wrote several compositions in the USA including Sinfonia da Requiem and his First String Quartet The following year he was reading about the poet George Crabbe who came from Suffolk the same part of England where Britten had grown up Britten suddenly became homesick He realized that he could not work and be himself in a foreign country So he returned with Pears to England

As soon as he was on the boat sailing back to England he started work on Ceremony of Carols Back in England Britten and Pears gave concerts to audiences of all kinds and took part in opera productions of Sadlers Wells Opera Company which was having a new theatre built On the 7 June 1945 the new theatre was opened with a performance of Brittens opera Peter Grimes This opera was to make Britten into the most famous English composer of his time It was soon being performed abroad as well as in England

Britten was now composing lots of music songs chamber music and a very popular piece called Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra This piece shows off each instrument of the orchestra in turn so that young people can get to know the sound of the musical instruments It is based on a tune written by Henry Purcell 300 years ago There were more popular works St Nicolas and the Spring Symphony There were not many opportunities for big operas to be performed so he wrote some chamber operas which only needed small orchestras and a small number of singers These were performed in places such as local churches by a group which called themselves English Opera Group He wrote The Rape of Lucretia and Albert Herring In 1948 the group helped to start a music festival in Aldeburgh Benjamin Britten spent the rest of his life mainly working on music which was to be performed at the Aldeburgh Festival He composed some of his greatest works for the festival and he took part in the performances as conductor and pianist

One of Brittens most popular pieces of music for amateurs including children was Noyes Fludde He wrote three church parables His large operas include Billy Budd which was soon produced in Covent Garden In June 1953 he wrote Gloriana an opera about Queen Elizabeth I written for the coronation celebrations of Elizabeth II When he travelled with Peter Pears to the Far East he was influenced by the music of Bali and he composed a ballet called The Prince of the Pagodas performed in Covent Garden in 1957 Another great work inspired by the East was the parable Curlew River The opera A Midsummer Nights Dream was written for the Aldeburgh Festival in 1960 In 1962 he wrote the War Requiem to celebrate the new Coventry Cathedral This is one of the greatest musical works of the 20th century

In 1961 he became friends with the great Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich He composed a Cello Sonata and a Cello Symphony as well as three suites for solo cello He travelled with Pears to the Soviet Union

In 1967 the Aldeburgh Festival had a new concert hall the Maltings at Snape His next opera was Owen Wingrave written for television but soon produced in Covent Garden In June 1973 Britten produced another great opera Death in Venice The main character called Aschenbach was perhaps the best music he ever wrote for Peter Pears It was performed at the Aldeburgh Festival but Britten was ill by this time and unable to be at the performance His heart condition made it impossible to work on any more large works but he still wrote some harp music for the harpist Ossian Ellis a song called Phaedra for Janet Baker and a Third String Quartet He died in Aldeburgh on 4 December 1976

Britten received many honours both in Britain and in other countries He became a Companion of Honour in 1952 a member of the Order of Merit in 1965 and in the year he died he was the first musician ever to receive a life peer

Brittens early works were often written for instruments His Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge for string orchestra is a very popular work today He often borrowed and reinvented themes by other composers During his last years he again gave much attention to instrumental music mainly chamber music

After he met Peter Pears much of his music was vocal This includes more than 100 songs a number of operas chamber operas as well as three works for tenor solo and orchestra Les Illuminations the Serenade for Tenor Horn and Strings and the Nocturne His songs are often grouped in cycles He also wrote many folksong settings These were very popular as encore pieces when he accompanied Peter Pears in song recitals

Britten wrote music for choirs including Hymn to St Cecilia The War Requiem is his greatest work which combines writing for choir and orchestra It describes the horrors of war

He wrote a lot of work for children There are even parts for children in some of his grand operas eg Peter Grimes The Turn of the Screw and Owen Wingrave He even wrote an opera in which all the main parts are sung by children The Little Sweep

Many of his great operatic roles from Peter Grimes to Aschenbach in Death in Venice deal with the theme of the outsider the person who does not quite fit into society or who is misunderstood Brittens gay character may have something to do with this He also knew what it was like to be an outsider when he tried to live in the United States and his refusal to fight in the war may have distanced him from some people

The Aldeburgh Festival at the Maltings in Snape continue to be a focus for Brittens music Every year the Brittens Pears School of Music organizes lessons and performance opportunities for young musicians A series of Prom concerts is held there every year in August

Claudio Monteverdi was the most important composer of the early Baroque period He lived at a time of great change in musical style The first opera ever written was composed in 1597 by a composer called Caccini who is not remembered much nowadays Just eleven years later Monteverdi wrote an opera Orfeo which was a really great work Other important operas of his are Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda and Il ritorno dUlisse in patria He wrote 9 books of madrigals He also wrote a lot of church music including the 1610 Vespers He was director of music at St Marks Venice which was the most important musical job in Italy

Monteverdi was the son of an apothecary and a doctor He was very talented as a young boy and was only 15 when he published his first pieces of music In the introduction to this music he says that his music teacher was Marc Antonio Ingegneri the maestro di cappella of Cremona cathedral  We cannot find anything that shows that he sang in the cathedral choir He probably had private music lessons He learned composition singing and how to play string instruments such as the viol and viola da braccio He got several compositions published in Venice By the time he got his first job he had already published two books of madrigals

His first job was working at the court of the Duke of Mantua In Mantua there was a small band of excellent musicians The musical director was the famous Giaches de Wert Monteverdi got to know many famous poets and there were famous singers at Ferrara which was not far away 

At first Monteverdi had a low paid job He married the daughter of one of the court musicians in the string band Monteverdi soon became well known He sent several of his compositions to be performed at Ferrara and he went with the duke to when his army was fighting the Turks

The young Monteverdi was developing a new musical style The old style was known as prima pratica and the new style was called the seconda pratica The prima pratica continued to be used for church music In this style of writing the music was thought to be more important than the words This meant that the music could be very contrapuntal with several things going on at once so that the words could not be clearly heard However in the seconda pratica the words were more important than the music ie it was important to be able to hear all the words clearly and the music had to be simple enough for this to happen This was particularly important in opera and in madrigals

There were a lot of arguments among musicians about these two styles of composition and this is perhaps the reason why there was a gap of 11 years between Monteverdis 3rd and his 4th book of madrigals His opera Orfeo was performed at least twice at court and several times at Salzburg Monteverdi was becoming famous all over Europe

Monteverdi went back to Cremona His wife died leaving him with their three small children It was a terrible tragedy for Monteverdi and he did not want to go back to Mantua but the Duke wrote to him telling him he must come back to provide music for the wedding of Prince Francesco Gonzaga and Margharita of Savoy

Monteverdi returned to Mantua where he composed his opera Arianna The performance was a great success and the audience were moved to tears by the music Ariannas lament This song is the only part of the opera that has not been lost

Although Monteverdis fame was increasing there were a lot of arguments with his employer Eventually he found another job this time as a church musician in the biggest church in Venice Monteverdi had a difficult journey from Mantua to Venice The passengers were robbed by highwaymen on the way He arrived in Venice in October 1613

The job of maestro at San Marco in Venice was perhaps the most important job for a church musician in the whole of Europe However the music was in a bad state because previous directors of music had not been very good Monteverdi started to reorganize the music there he bought new music for the library and got some new musicians He had to compose music for many special feast days during the year He was doing a good job and in 1616 his salary was increased to 400 ducats The duke of Mantua was probably cross that he had lost such a good musician He still asked Monteverdi to write music for him Monteverdi probably had to obey as he was still a Mantuan citizen He wrote music for important events such as weddings and carnivals at Mantua

By 1619 Monteverdi had published his seventh book of madrigals However he then started to publish less music Perhaps it was because he was so busy or perhaps because he no longer needed to look for fame He probably wrote a lot of church music which is now lost

During the 1620s continued his work in Venice although he may have tried to get other jobs His hobbies include alchemy He welcomed the composer Heinrich Schtz who visited Venice for a second time After the Duke of Mantua died in 1626 Monteverdi wrote less music for Mantua He was supposed to receive an annual salary from them but he often did not get it There was a war in Mantua a lot of buildings were destroyed and the invading armies brought the plague Monteverdi became a priest in 1632 It is not clear whether he did this because he really was religious or whether he thought it would help his career

In 1637 public opera was started in Venice Monteverdi who was now in his 70s wrote operas for Venice Il ritorno dUlisse in patria and Lincoronazione di Poppea form a brilliant end to his career After the performance of this opera he made a six month trip to Lombard and Mantua where again he had to argue at the court about not being paid his pension After he returned to Venice he was ill for nine days and then died

An oxbow lake is a lake or area of water in a curved shape It is made by special bends in a river called meanders getting farther away from the river until they become separate The river becomes straight and the bend becomes a lake

Water flows at different speeds at different parts of the river In the middle farthest away from the sides the water flows fastest At the banks the water flows slowest When the river bends water flows faster on the outside of the bend than the inside The fast water on the outside erodes the outside of the bend This means it breaks bits of the bank off At the same time the slow water on the inside of the bend leaves behind mud sand and parts of plants Together these make the bend move in the direction of the outside of the bend 

The bend moves farther and farther along until it leaves the river The river becomes straight and the bend is left as an oxbow lake

A materialist is someone who believes that the world around us is made of material that there are no other types of thing Everything is composed of material and things that are not made of material such as consciousness are the result of actions by material In other words matter is the only real substance Physicalism is a related term

Especially a materialist does not believe in gods or other supernatural entities Spiritual matters are either secondary actions of material or denied outright The existence of a spirit is either meaningless or not scientifically proven Therefore by definition materialists are also atheists though not all atheists are materialists

Modern philosophical materialists extend the definition of other basic entities proven by science such as energy forces and the curvature of space Matter and energy are known to be interchangeable and much else such as gravity is caused by matter However the concept of matter is itself not entirely clear

Other types of philosophy share some of the aims of materialism Examples would include reductionism logical positivism and empiricism

A dam is a large wall or barrier that obstructs or stop the flow of water forming a reservoir or a lake Most dams have a section called a spillway or weir over which or through which water flows either sometimes or always Dams generally serve the primary purpose of retaining water The tallest dam in the world is the 300 meter high Nurek Dam in Tajikistan

Some of the first dams were built in Mesopotamia up to 7000 years ago Modern dams are built with arched walls of steel rod reinforced concrete The arched wall is a very strong shape which helps the wall to withstand the huge weight of the water

There are a number of reasons that people build dams Some countries build dams to control the flow of water in the downstream river systems and prevent flooding Other countries build dams to generate electricity using hydroelectric turbine generators Other countries use dams to store water for use in irrigation

A sonata is a piece of music for one instrument or one instrument with another instrument accompanying The word comes from the Italian sonare which means to sound

A composer could call any solo instrumental piece sonata if he or she wants to but usually a sonata is quite a long piece with several movements 

The term sonata was used in the 16th century to mean anything that was not sung

In the Baroque period many composers like Arcangelo Corelli wrote sonatas with several movements There were two types sonata da camera which were for playing in peoples homes and sonata da chiesa which were for being played in churches The first type would have harpsichord accompaniment and the second type organ accompaniment There would also be a cello playing the bass line The solo instrument might be a violin flute recorder or oboe

At the end of the Baroque period Domenico Scarlatti wrote over 500 sonatas for harpsichord These are all short pieces in binary form

By the time we come to the Classical period sonatas have become longer pieces with three or four movements They would usually start with a fast movement then a slow one and then a fast one at the end If there were four movements the extra one would be a minuet and trio or a scherzo either before or after the slow movement The first movement would be in sonata form The most important composers of sonatas at this time were Haydn Mozart and Beethoven

Many composers in the Romantic period wrote sonatas for example Brahms wrote piano sonatas as well as sonatas for violin and piano cello and piano and clarinet and piano

In the 20th century composers who have written sonatas include Bartok Tippett and William Walton

Sonata form is a way of organizing a piece of music It has been used a great deal since the Classical period Listening to some pieces of music in sonata form will help to understand it fully It is helpful to know something about the different keys

Sonata form is not just used in sonatas It can be the form for movements from symphonies concertos overtures etc

In the Baroque period composers like Bach and Handel wrote a lot of dance movements such as minuets These were in binary form This meant that there were two sections The two sections were often the same length and were separated by a double bar line which meant that each section was repeated The music would not be in the same key all the time The first section would modulate and then the second section would gradually modulate back again so that it sounded finished at the end

Domenico Scarlatti wrote lots of sonatas for harpsichord which are in binary form but they started to get longer and more complicated The first section would start with a theme in the main key and then modulate to another key for a contrasting tune The second section might be longer than the first second starting off by modulating to strange keys before arriving back to repeat the main tunes This kind of piece is the beginning of sonata form

Haydn Mozart and Beethoven developed the idea of sonata form A movement in sonata form has three sections called exposition development and recapitulation

This way of building a piece of music was used by almost every composer from the mid 18th century onwards well into the 20th century It gives scope for a very dramatic piece Of course composers sometime use it differently There is often a sense of development during the whole piece not just during the so called development section The first movement of Beethovens Fifth Symphony spends all the time developing the famous idea heard at the beginning the first four notes Even the other three movements carry on developing this idea

There have been several The Lord of the Rings films based on the book The Lord of the Rings by J R R Tolkien

An aria is a long song accompanying a solo voice An aria is usually in an opera It is an Italian word of the 18th century meaning air

In operas of the Baroque period most of the music was either recitative or aria Recitative was sung quickly almost as if it were being spoken The singer was accompanied just by a few supporting chords usually on a harpsichord The story was being told in the recitative Once the situation in the story had changed there would be an aria The singer would sing a song which expressed his or her feelings The aria had more musical interest than the recitative Arias were usually in what we call ABA form or Da Capo form There was a main section then a middle part then the main section was repeated In the Da Capo section the singer usually improvised adding many embellishments and ornaments The aria gave performers the opportunity to show off their virtuosity 

The word aria is not just used in opera Arias can be found in cantatas or just by themselves Sometimes pieces for instruments are called aria These are often a tune with variations such as Handels famous Air with Variations for harpsichord also known as the The Harmonious Blacksmith

In the 19th century the difference between recitative and aria in opera started to disappear Composers like Richard Wagner made the music much more continuous He did not want audiences clapping in the middle of his operas He wanted the music to develop dramatically and continuously

Boccherini is famous for his chamber music He wrote more than 100 quintets for 2 violins viola and 2 cellos He also wrote 4 cello concertos

George Fredrick Handel was a German composer who went to live in England when he was a young man and later became a naturalised Briton Johann Sebastian Bach and Handel were born in the same year They were the greatest composers of their time but they never met Handel changed his name to George Frideric Handel when he became British he removed the dots above the a and changed the spelling of Georg and Friedrich The German spelling of his name is still used by German writers

Although they both lived in the late Baroque period Bach and Handels music developed differently Handel wrote many operas and oratorios and by them became very famous He took many trips including to Italy where he learned a lot about composition Bach never left central Germany and most of the time he was a church musician who was not well known by the general public

Handel wrote over 42 operas Later he wrote oratorios His most famous oratorio is the Messiah  He wrote anthems chamber music and orchestral music including the Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks

Handel was born in Halle in the northeast of Germany in todays Saxony Anhalt His father was a barber and a surgeon He started playing the harpsichord and the organ when he was very young He was given a clavichord when he was seven and he used to practice it in the attic where his father could not hear him At the age of nine he was already composing He had a teacher called Friedrich Wilhelm Zachau who was the organist of the big church the Liebfrauenkirche in Halle He learned the organ harpsichord and violin as well as composition harmony

Handels father did not want him to study music he wanted him to be a lawyer Although Handels father died in 1697 Handel enrolled at the University of Halles in 1703 He studied law for a year because his father wanted him to do so After that year Handel was unhappy studying law He decided to stop studying law and become a musician He became organist at the Protestant Cathedral in Halle The next year he moved to Hamburg where he got a job as violinist and harpsichordist in the orchestra of the opera house Here his first two operas Almira and Nero were produced early in 1705 Two other early operas Daphne and Florindo were produced at Hamburg in 1708 

Handel was becoming a good opera composer but he wanted to learn more so he went to Italy in 1707 He spent four years there His opera Rodrigo was produced in Florence in 1707 and his Agrippina at Venice in 1709 Agrippina was very popular and had 26 performances It made Handel famous He also had three oratorios produced in Roma He wrote sacred music and other pieces in an operatic style eg Dixit Dominus

In 1710 Handel became Kapellmeister to George Elector of Hanover who would soon be King George I of Great Britain The Elector agreed that Handel could have an immediate leave of 12 months so that he could go to London He visited London for eight months His opera Rinaldo was performed in 1711 It was the first time an Italian opera had been performed in England It was an immediate success Handel returned to Hanover in the summer of 1711 and spent a year writing chamber and orchestral music because there was no opera in Hanover He was also trying to learn English In 1712 the Elector allowed him to make another visit to England In England he had patrons He had a yearly income of 200 from Queen Anne He was having a lot of success so he stayed in England instead of going back to his job in Hanover 

In 1712 Queen Anne died and the Elector of Hanover became King of Great Britain Handel might have been in trouble According to one story the King forgave Handel because he wrote some lovely music called Water Music which was performed on a boat on the Thames at a royal water party This story about the king forgiving Handel is probably not true George would have known that Queen Anne was about to die and he would become King of Great Britain and therefore Handels master again In fact the new king doubled Handels salary A few years later his salary increased again when he taught music to Queen Carolines daughter

In 1724 Handel moved into a newly built house in 26 Brook Street London which he rented until his death in 1761 34 years later The house is now called Handel House Museum and is open to the public It was here that Handel composed some of his most famous music such as Messiahs Zadok the Priests and Fireworks Music

In 1729 Handels opera Scipio was performed for the first time The march from this work is now the regimental slow march of the British Grenadier Guards In the next year he took on British nationality

In 1731 Handel was commissioned to write four anthems for the coronation ceremony of King George II One of these Zadok the Priest has been sung at every coronation ceremony since 

Handel spent most of his time working on operas From 1722 1726 he was director of the Royal Academy of Music This was an organisation that put on opera performances It had nothing to do with the academy which is called the Royal Academy of Music today where young students study music Handel also worked in the management of the Kings Theatres and many of his operas were performed in the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden He sometimes travelled to Italy to find new Italian singers and persuade them to come to London London became world famous for operas In spite of everything Handel was doing for opera he had many enemies as well as friends There was a lot of rivalry especially with a composer called Bononcini whose music is forgotten today Handel gave up operatic management in 1740 after he had lost a lot of money in the business

In April 1739 age 54 he had a stroke It was probably this which left his right arm paralysed for a while so that he could not perform but he made an excellent recovery after six weeks at a health spa in Aix la Chapelle At this time he started to write oratorios instead of operas In 1742 his oratorio Messiah was first performed in Dublin Surprisingly it was not successful in London until 1750 when it was performed in aid of the Foundling Hospital Chapel Handel performed it every year there which brought the hospital about 600 for each performance Handel spent most of his time in these later years composing and producing oratorios Judas Maccabaeus was particularly popular The singers for these oratorios were English and Italian They were not world famous virtuosos but singers whom Handel had trained himself 

In August 1750 on a journey back from Germany to London Handel was seriously injured when his carriage overturned In 1751 he started to lose his eyesight He died in 1759 in London The last concert he went to was his own Messiah More than 3000 mourners went to his funeral He was buried with full state honours in Westminster Abbey Handel never married and kept his personal life very private  He left 20000 which was a lot of money for those days His niece inherited most of his money He also left some of it to friends servants relations and charities His autographs are now mostly in the British Museum

Handel adopted the spelling George Frideric Handel on his naturalization as a British subject and this spelling is generally used in English speaking countries The original form of his name is usually called in Germany but he is known as Haendel in France There was another composer with a similar name Handl who was a Slovene and is more commonly known as Jacobus Gallus This can be very hard for cataloguers

Richard Wagner was a German opera composer He was one of the most important opera composers in Germany during the Romantic period Apart from some music that he wrote as a student he wrote ten operas which are all performed regularly in opera houses today Most of his operas are about stories from German mythology He always wrote the words himself He changed peoples ideas of what operas should be like He thought that the drama was very important and he chose the singers for his operas himself so that he could train them into his way of thinking The music in his operas did not give the audience a chance to applaud after big solos as it had done in the 18th century it continues throughout the whole act He made his music tell the story by using what he called leitmotifs These were melodies or short musical phrases which belonged to particular characters in the opera or to particular ideas He had more influence on other composers than anybody else in his time largely because of his harmonies which became more and more chromatic using lots of sharps and flats changing key a lot of the time He built an opera house to his own design in the German town of Bayreuth Nearly all musicians in Europe tried to make a journey to Bayreuth to hear Wagners music The Wagner festival still takes place every year there

He studied at the University of Leipzig although he was not allowed to be a full student because he did not have proper school qualifications Although he lived a wild life he worked hard at his music He studied the scores of Beethovens string quartets and symphonies and he wrote his own symphony which was performed in 1833 at the famous Leipzig Gewandhaus He wrote his first opera Die Feen in Wrzburg He became the conductor of a travelling opera group and fell in love with one of the singers called Minna Planer and he married her in 1836 His second opera Das Liebesverbot based on Shakespeares play Measure for Measure was a failure

Wagner always liked spending money and he soon found he owed money to a lot of people so he went away to Paris where he lived for three years He was not successful at all there none of the French musicians showed any interest in him and he was very poor He still managed to write an opera Rienzi in 1841 and this was soon followed by Der fliegende Hollnder which still remains a favourite to opera lovers today It was first performed in Dresden in 1843 The audience did not like it much because they were used to operas like Rienzi which were written in the old way Wagner was given the job of court opera composer in Dresden He stayed there until 1849 During that time he worked very hard to make opera performances better improve the orchestra and train the singers In 1845 he wrote another great opera Tannhuser People gradually started to understand the way that Wagners music was telling the drama of the story After this all his operas were great successes although there always remained some people who hated his music eg the music critic Eduard Hanslick

In 1848 he finished working on Lohengrin but it was not performed because he was supporting the revolution joining in the demonstrations Although he did not take part in the fighting he was going to be arrested so Franz Liszt helped him to escape to Switzerland He lived in Zrich until 1858 There he wrote about music conducted and read stories from the Norse mythologies He was starting to think about writing operas about these stories It was something that would take him over 25 years to complete They were to become the four operas known as Der Ring des Nibelungen which together tell one long story The four operas which make up this famous Ring cycle are Das Rheingold Die Walkre Siegfried and Gtterdmmerung Because of the political situation in Germany at the time Wagner expected the rise of a socialist state The operas in the Ring cycle were a new kind of music drama These operas can be seen as describing a new kind of world in which humans are free The music used the idea of leitmotif where musical ideas represent characters or emotions and help the development and understanding of the story

By 1857 Wagner had written the first two operas as well as Acts One and Two of Siegfried However the third Act of Siegfried was not written until many years later because he could see that at that time there was no suitable opera house to have these operas performed He fell in love with a woman called Mathilde Wesendonk whose husband was very rich This affair led to a separation with his wife Minna He wrote an opera about an unhappy love affair Tristan und Isolde

Meanwhile he wrote another opera Die Meistersinger von Nrnberg It is different to his other operas because it is a comedy It is set in medieval Germany and is about a song contest 

By 1864 Wagner had spent so much money that he was in debt once more and he fled to Stuttgart to avoid being put into prison Then he had a big stroke of luck The new king of Bavaria Ludwig II who was only 18 years old adored the music of Wagner He had read the poem about the Ring of the Nibelungs King Ludwig invited Wagner to finish the Ring cycle for performances in Munich He gave him somewhere to live and his new operas were performed in Munich Tristan und Isolde in 1865 Die Meistersinger von Nrnberg in 1868 Das Rheingold in 1869 and Die Walkre in 1870 There were plans for a new opera house in Munich but it was never built because a lot of people were angry with Wagner for being in debt in spite of having lots of money from the king Another thing people did not like was that he fell in love with the wife of the man who had conducted his operas Hans von Blow Her name was Cosima Her father was the composer Franz Liszt who had not been married to Cosimas mother Wagner had already left Munich in 1865 but the king still supported him making it possible for him to live in a large house called Triebschen on Lake Lucerne Cosima divorced von Blow in 1870 and married Wagner in the same year

By now Wagner was working hard at the Ring cycle again He had promised the king that the four operas would be performed in Munich when they were ready but he realized that they would need a special kind of opera house So he designed his own opera house and had it built in the town of Bayreuth He spent a lot of time travelling and conducting in order to raise money for this huge project The King Ludwig also gave him a lot of money and a lovely new house in Bayreuth which Wagner called Wahnfried Finally the complete cycle of four operas was performed in August 1876 in the new opera house the The third and fourth operas of the cycle Siegfried and Gtterdmmerung were being performed for the first time

Wagner spent the rest of his life living in Wahnfried Sometimes he travelled He went to London and made several trips to Italy He wrote his last opera Parsifal which almost has a religious feeling to it The story is related to the legends about King Arthur and the Holy Grail Wagner dictated his memoirs to his wife His autobiography is called Mein Leben He died of heart failure when he was staying in Venice He was buried in the grounds of Wahnfried

Wagner had enormous influence on the development of music Many composers imitated his harmonies or let themselves be influenced by them By the early 20th century some composers like Arnold Schoenberg had gone even farther in making more and more complicated harmonies and composers had to find new ways of composing

Wagner made his orchestras much bigger than usual The woodwind for example need four of each instrument and there are extra instruments like the bass clarinet and Wagner tubas His ideas about music drama were very important His music helps the drama to be told because it develops all the time like the music in a symphony

A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Court is a book written by Mark Twain published in 1889 It is one of the first stories of time travel in literature even earlier than H G Wells The Time Machine

Hank Morgan an American from late 19th century Connecticut travels back in time to King Arthurs Camelot Because of his knowledge of science and technology Hank becomes very powerful and people call him The Boss There he tries to improve the medieval society according to the morals and technologies of his time In the end Merlin puts Hank in a magic sleep who wakes again in his own time

Juno in Roman mythology is the wife of Jupiter and the queen of the gods She was later identified as the equivalent of Hera the wife of Zeus in Greek mythology She was the goddess of marriage and childbirth With Jupiter and Minerva she was part of the Capitoline triad of gods 

Excalibur is a legendary big long knife or sword in the mythology of Great Britain It was owned by King Arthur

The sword and its name have become very widespread in popular culture and are used in fiction and films

The sword was obtained by the king with the advice of his wizard adviser Merlin But it was considered that there existed two Excalibur swords The first was the one Merlin put into the stone and said that the throne will be taken by the one who will take the sword out of the stone Young Arthur was the one to do it The second Excalibur was the one to which Merlin took the King The sword was located at a magical lake where the Lady of the Lake gave it to Arthur The Excalibur was made by an Avalonian elf Later the sword was stolen by his sister and it was the time when the scabbard was lost In the battle of Camlann Arthur was hurt and he told Bedwyzr to return the Excalibur to the lake

One of the earliest names of King Arthurs sword was Caladfwlch It is a Welsh word that comes from Calad Bolg Later it was changed to Caliburn by Geoffrey of Monmouth And today we know it as Excalibur due to French 

The legend of Excalibur is similar to the Irish hero C Chulainn who had a sword named Caladbolg or to Norse Legend of Sigurd All these swords were made by an elf Sometimes he is named Wayland and Gofannon

Clarent is one of King Arthurs two mythic swords The first is Excalibur the sword of war and the second Clarent the sword of peace Clarent sword is less known because it was used for peaceful acts whereas the Excalibur was well known for it was used to defend Camelot But by the legend the Clarent Sword play a very important role It was stolen by the traitor Mordred who later used it against Arthur and cut him to death 

Georg Philipp Telemann was a German baroque composer He wrote over 601 pieces of music many of which were published As publishing cost much money at that time this was quite unusual He mostly taught himself musically and knew how to play 10 instruments During his life people thought he was one of the greatest composers He also wrote lots of church music most of which is not common today

Giovanni da Palestrina was a very important Italian composer of church music of his time He lived in the period called the Renaissance Most of his music was choral It is very polyphonic This means that the different voices are often singing different words and different parts of the tune at the same time Many composers since have studied the way that Palestrina wrote because this is an excellent way to learn to write contrapuntal music

Palestrina took his name from the town where he was born We are not sure of the exact date of his birth Any records of his birth were destroyed when the town burned in 1577 He was probably a choirboy in Palestrina When he was grown up he got a job as organist and choir director at the Roman basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore He was not earning much money but he married a lady who came from a very rich family so he was comfortably off Pope Julius III heard about how good this young composer was He asked him to come and meet him He was given the job of master of the Capella Juliana the choir that sang at the services in St Peters Rome This was the top job in Italy and he was only 26  Of course Palestrina composed a mass in the popes honour

Palestrina composed 93 masses He also wrote motets and madrigals Palestrina and Lassus were the two greatest composers of the late Renaissance

Turing machine is a term from computer science A Turing machine is a system of rules states and transitions rather than a real machine It was first described by Alan Turing There are two purposes of a Turing machine Either it can be used to decide a formal language or it solves mathematical functions Turing machines are one of the most important formal models in the study of computer science

A Turing machine consists of the following components

Furthermore a working alphabet has to be defined 

When a Turing machine is started a word must be present on the infinite tape of the machine The readwrite device on the first character now reads the first character and depending on the current state of Turing machine the readwrite device overwrites the character with a new one or moves one cell to the left or to the right Furthermore the current state of the machine can be switched

A Turing machine is said to decide a language if it is always able to determine whether a given word is contained in a certain language or not Therefore the machine usually has two special states marked as Accept and Reject After a while one of the two states will be reached and the machine is halted If only one of the two states will ever be reached the Turing machine is said to semi decide a language

If a Turing machine is used for the computation of functions it only has one end state When the machine comes to that state it is halted and the result of the function can be found on the tape

Turing machines were not invented to be built in reality but they are very important for theoretical computer science as they are one of the simplest models for computers The Church Turing thesis states that all computers are only as powerful as Turing machines This can be used to prove if a problem is solvable by a computer or not

Canadian football is football generally played in Canada and follows much the same general rules as American Football Compared to American football the field is slightly longer and wider 110 by 65 yards rather than 100 by 53 13 yards and the endzones are 10 to 15 yards deeper There are also only 3 downs instead of 4 and the field goal posts are at the front of the endzone instead of the back There are 12 players per team on the field during play More than one play be in motion before the snap of the ball and the rules are more flexible about players position relative to the line of scrimmage

Cocaine is a white crystalline alkaloid obtained from coca leaves used especially as a local anesthetic It is sometimes referred to as coke Cocaine is a stimulant Most cocaine is used as an illegal drug by people who want to feel a happy feeling of having energy called being high Sometimes doctors or dentists use cocaine as a legal drug

Cocaine is made from the leaves of the coca plant Coca plants are mostly grown in South America in countries like Brazil or Argentina When coca plants were discovered by Spanish conquistadors it was sent back to Europe People started using cocaine for medicine because they did not know it was addictive

In America cocaine was used during operations or to treat toothaches It was also put in drinks When Coca Cola was first made in 1885 it got its name from the traces of cocaine added for energy The caffeine was from the Kola Nut making the name Coca Cola It was removed completely by the 1920s due to pressure groups in USA

When a person uses cocaine by inhaling it into their nose smoking it chewing or eating it or injecting it into their veins they feel euphoric alert and full of energy This feeling is called being high Some people who take cocaine begin to feel worried or anxious or even experience feelings of paranoia Sometimes the person shakes

Cocaine is illegal to produce sell and use recreationally in most countries When cocaine is used as an Illegal drug it stimulates the nervous system of the body and makes a person feel excited full of energy and happy People who take this dont know really what that are doing as they have hardly any control over themselves 

Another form of cocaine is crack or crack cocaine This is a cocaine which is turned into little crystals or rocks Both cocaine and crack are very addictive

There are many types of legal cocaine most of which get modified for street usage Mersh Cocaine is a cheaper alternative to cocaine but in many ways its its less harmful not as addictive and the cutting agents are usually other drugs or amphetamins such as MDMA which will give the drug a flowery smell and chemically taste and texture

If people use cocaine they may take too much and get sick or even die This is called an overdose When people take cocaine they get intoxicated as well When a person is intoxicated they may do dangerous things such as having unsafe sex with a person they do not know or getting into a violent fight with a person

If a person uses it for long they can start to get weird feelings like there are bugs crawling under their skin or they can get paranoia

Cocaine is a very addictive drug It can lead to psychological andor chemical dependency When a person is addicted to a drug they might do bad or criminal acts in order to get money for more drugs such as crimes

Another danger from using cocaine is risk of infection via unhygienic ingestion methods Use of such apparel can result in diseases such as AIDS or Hepatitis C

Cocaine is also occasionally used as a legal medicine in Australia and some parts of Europe if a person has a prescription from a doctor Doctors sometimes prescribe cocaine as an appetite suppressant for people who want to lose weight 

Dentists in countries like Australia sometimes use cocaine in dental operations as an anaesthetic Anaesthetics are medicines or drugs which stop a person from having feelings in their body Doctors surgeons and dentists use anaesthetics when they are doing operations so that the patient will not feel pain Dentists put the cocaine on the patients mouth so that the patient will not feel pain in their mouth during the operation

A viola is a musical instrument which is similar to the violin and cello The viola sounds lower than a violin but higher than a cello It has four strings called the C G D and A strings The highest note is the A The viola is played with a bow in the right hand Playing with the bow is called arco Sometimes the strings may be plucked

When people see the viola sometimes they think it is a violin This is because the viola is only a little larger than a violin and like the violin the viola is held on the players left shoulder It is also because the sound of the viola is only five notes lower than the sound of the violin The biggest difference between the viola and the violin is the different sound The violas lowest string is the C string and its highest string is the A string So to see whether an violin like instrument is a violin or viola one will need to pluck the thinnest string The violins lowest string is the G string and its highest string is the E string Even though the viola and violin can play many of the same notes they each have a special sound quality Sometimes people describe the violas sound as more dark earthy or mellow than the violins sound

The person that makes and repairs violas is called a luthier

People who write music often use the viola for harmony notes It is one of the main instruments in a string quartet along with two violins and a cello The viola is found in chamber ensembles of string instruments only and also in full symphony orchestras where strings woodwinds brass and percussion instruments play together The viola can also be a solo instrument but is mostly used in an orchestra The viola comes in many sizes The sizes are measured in inches such as a 14 inch viola The size of the viola is measured from the bottom to the neck of it

Generally string is a thin piece of rope or twine which is used to tie bind or hang other objects String can be made from a variety of fibres

The Renault Clio is a small car made by Renault since 1991 There are three generations of the Renault Clio The Renault Clio was a replacement for the Renault 5 The car was intended to compete against established rivals in the European supermini market such as the Ford Fiesta VauxhallOpel Corsa Volkswagen Polo Rover Metro and the Fiat Uno

The first Clio was produced from 1990 until 1998 The design was changed two times It was 3700 millimeters long 1670 millimeters wide and 1410 millimeters high This Clio was voted European Car of the Year in 1991 The car went on sale somewhat cheaper than most of its rivals but had a basic interior The previous Renault 5 continued to sell as a cheaper alternative to the Clio being badged as the Renault 5 Campus 

A sports version of the Renault Clio I with a 20l petrol engine was launched in 1992 This was called the Clio Williams and was designed to compete with other hothatches such as the Peugeot 205

Sales of the Renault Clio I were strong throughout Europe and it is often credited as the first Renault car to break into the British market as many previous models had sold poorly in the United Kingdom The Clio did not have to compete with the smaller Renault Twingo in the United Kingdom as this was only made available in continental Europe

The second Clio was produced from 1998 until 2005 Its design was changed three times the third design being called the Renault Clio Campus and marketed along side the Clio III The rounded design of the Clio II contrasted with the square Clio I Certain issues with the previous design were addressed for instance the front wings were made of plastic following problems with corrosion on the previous model

In 1999 the Renault Sport or Clio RS was launched as a hot hatch and as a replacement for the previous Renault Clio Williams This was entirely based on the Clio II

A saloon version of the Renault Clio II was launched in South America and Eastern Europe however was unavailable to customers in Western Europe

The third generation of the Clio has been produced since 2005 In 2007 has been started the production of the Clio Sportour the station wagon version The design has been changed in 2009 The Clio III achieved a 5 star NCAP safety rating leaving only the Twingo and the Kangoo in the range without one A proposed replacement is scheduled for 2012

The Clio Papa and Nicole adverts featuring a young promiscuous woman and her slow witted father ran throughout the cars early years and were voted one of the favourite adverts on television in the United Kingdom

A safety issue where the bonnet of the Clio II could come open whilst driving was highlighted by BBC consumer affairs programme Watchdog Some of these models were recalled by Renault Problems were also highlighed where hazard warning light could come on without notice being unable to be switched off

The Trojan Horse is a big wooden horse from the Trojan War in Greek mythology In the Trojan War the Greeks were fighting against the city of Troy 

The Greeks could not enter the city or win the war Because of this Odysseus one of the Greeks thought of a way to trick them The Greeks built a large wooden horse and left it outside the gates of the city as a present for the Trojans The Trojans took the horse and put it inside their city thinking it was a victory gift from the Greeks Odysseus chose a horse so that Poseidon would ensure them a safe trip back to Greece After the Trojan victory parties ended the Greeks who were hiding inside the horse came out of it They opened the city gates to let the other Greeks enter Troy The Greeks easily overpowered the Trojans and took control of the city Because of the Trojan Horse the Greeks won the Trojan War 

Today the word Trojan horse is used for things that are similar to that story something that looks good and okay but in truth has another purpose usually bad An example for this is the computer virus Trojan horse

Other airlines whom have ordered the A380 are Qantas Air France China Southern Airlines Lufthansa Kingfisher Airlines Korean Air Thai Airways Malaysia Airlines British Airways Qatar Airways Etihad Airways Virgin Atlantic and Air Austral

Airbus was going to make a version of the A380 which carried lots of cargo instead of lots of people This would look almost the same as the normal passenger version but it would have no windows and much bigger doors Some cargo companies ordered the plane like FedEx and UPS But because Airbus took too long to make the A380 orders for the plane have been cancelled Because Airbus has not got any orders for the plane anymore they decided to not make it for a while and focus on making the passenger version of the A380

Paris also called Alexandros is a person in Greek mythology He is an important person in the Trojan War and Homers Iliad

Both of these calculations can be computed efficiently using the square and multiply algorithm for modular exponentiation

When used in practice RSA must be combined with some form of padding scheme so that no values of M result in insecure ciphertexts RSA used without padding may have some problems

In practice the first two problems can arise when short ASCII messages are sent In such messages m might be the concatenation of one or more ASCII encoded character A message consisting of a single ASCII NUL character would be encoded as m 0 which produces a ciphertext of 0 no matter which values of e and N are used Likewise a single ASCII SOH would always produce a ciphertext of 1 For systems which conventionally use small values of e such as 3 all single character ASCII messages encoded using this scheme would be insecure since the largest m would have a value of 255 and 2553 is less than any reasonable modulus Such plaintexts could be recovered by simply taking the cube root of the ciphertext

To avoid these problems practical RSA implementations typically embed some form of structured randomized padding into the value m before encrypting it This padding ensures that m does not fall into the range of insecure plaintexts and that a given message once padded will encrypt to one of a large number of different possible ciphertexts The latter property can increase the cost of a dictionary attack beyond the capabilities of a reasonable attacker

Standards such as PKCS have been carefully designed to securely pad messages prior to RSA encryption Because these schemes pad the plaintext m with some number of additional bits the size of the un padded message M must be somewhat smaller RSA padding schemes must be carefully designed so as to prevent sophisticated attacks This may be made easier by a predictable message structure Early versions of the PKCS standard used broken wikt linkad hocad hoc constructions which were later found vulnerable to a practical adaptive chosen ciphertext attack Modern constructions use secure techniques such as Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding to protect messages while preventing these attacks The PKCS standard also has processing schemes designed to provide additional security for RSA signatures eg the Probabilistic Signature Scheme for RSA

Suppose Alice uses Bobs public key to send him an encrypted message In the message she can claim to be Alice but Bob has no way of verifying that the message was actually from Alice since anyone can use Bobs public key to send him encrypted messages So in order to verify the origin of a message RSA can also be used to sign a message

Suppose Alice wishes to send a signed message to Bob She produces a hash value of the message raises it to the power of d mod n and attaches it as a signature to the message When Bob receives the signed message he raises the signature to the power of e mod n and compares the resulting hash value with the messages actual hash value If the two agree he knows that the author of the message was in possession of Alices secret key and that the message has not been tampered with since

Note that secure padding schemes such as RSA PSS are as essential for the security of message signing as they are for message encryption and that the same key should never be used for both encryption and signing purposes

Romantic music is music written in the 19th century This was the period called the Romantic period by musicians In literature and some other arts the Romantic period is often said to begin and finish earlier around mid 18th to mid 19th century 

In the Classical period artists liked to see clear forms 18th century architecture nearly always shows a lot of symmetry The gardens of the palace at Versailles are a good example of this with their very tidy patterns of straight paths circular ponds and neatly clipped hedges

In music the Classical composers such as Haydn Mozart Beethoven and Schubert liked to compose music which had a clear plan like sonata form

In the Romantic period artists thought that feeling and passions were more important than formal plans This can be seen in the gardens designed by Capability Brown eg in at Blenheim Palace Oxford The gardens are made to blend into the nature

In music the Romantic composers may still use plans like sonata form but feelings and passions are important They often write what is called programme music which means music that describes something or tells a story Beethovens Sixth Symphony is called the Pastoral which means that it is about the countryside Although Beethoven is usually called a composer of the Classical period he is also an early Romantic Later composers such as Felix Mendelssohn wrote pieces like Hebrides Overture which describes the sea coming into Fingals Cave in the Hebrides Islands in Scotland Hector Berlioz wrote a lot of music which tells a story His Symphonie Fantastique is about an artist madly in love Berliozs whole way of life was wild and romantic He fell in love with an actress he saw on stage playing the part of Juliet in Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet and he actually married her Other composers who wrote a lot of programme music include Franz Liszt and Richard Strauss Strauss always wrote in a late Romantic style even although he lived well into the 20th century

The Romantic period was also the period of Nationalism Nationalism means being proud of ones country In the 19th century a lot of European countries as we know them were being formed In music a lot of composers were writing music which was typical of their country They often did this by using folk music Antonn Dvok and Bedich Smetana wrote music which sounds very Czech Pyotr Tchaikovsky wrote music with Russian folk songs in them Gustav Mahler used German folk songs in his symphonies and Ralph Vaughan Williams collected English folk songs and put them in his music One of those pieces was a Fantasy on the famous tune Greensleeves

The Nereids are the fifty daughters of the god Nereus and the Okeanid Doris in Greek mythology They are sea nymphs of the Mediterranean Sea

Romanticism is a style of art literature and music in the late 18th and early 19th century in Europe This movement said that feelings imagination nature and old folk traditions such as legends and fairy tales were important In part it was a reaction to the aristocratic social and political ideas of the Age of Enlightenment and the Industrial Revolution It was also a reaction against turning nature into a mere science It showed itself most strongly in arts like music and literature However it also had an important influence on historiography education and natural history 

The Seveso disaster was a chemical accident on July 10 1976 at the small Italian town of Meda 20 km from Milan in Lombardy There was an explosion at a chemical factory which released a lot of the toxic poison dioxin TCDD into the air The cloud of poison gas covered an area 6km long and 1km wide It was named after the municipality of Seveso It resulted in the highest known exposure to 2378 tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxin in residential populations There were many studies and new regulations after the accident The European Union directive covering the protection against such accidents is known as Seveso II directive today 

The company where the accident happened was called Icmesa It was owned by Givaudan who is owned by Roche Icmesa produced Trichlorophenol which is used to produce the disinfectant Hexachlorophene The company was located in four communes one of them Seveso 

None of the 20000 people who lived in Seveso died but the poison killed 3000 farm animals and pets Another 70000 animals had to be killed to stop the dioxin from getting into the food chain

Thirty years after the accident scientists reported that babies born in the area affected by the dioxin were six times more likely to have thyroid problems The affected children are being studied to see if this has stopped them growing properly or having problems with intellectual development

Majulah Singapura is the national anthem of Singapore It was composed by Zubir Said in 1958 as a song to be sung at official events arranged by the City Council of Singapore In 1959 the song was chosen as Singapores anthem when it got the right to rule itself When Singapore became a fully independent nation in 1965 Majulah Singapura was formally taken on as Singapores national anthem

Singapore law says that the anthem may only be sung with its original Malay lyrics However there are government approved translations of the lyrics in Singapores three other official languages English Mandarin and Tamil

The national anthem is regularly performed or sung in schools and military camps at ceremonies held at the beginning andor the end of each day At these ceremonies the national flag is also raised and lowered and the national pledge is said

Singaporeans are encouraged to sing the national anthem during times of national celebration or at important national events such as at the National Day Parade at National Day observance ceremonies held by government departments and educational institutions such as schools and universities and at sports events that Singapore teams take part in

The Aegean Sea is part of the Mediterranean Sea It is between the Greece and Anatolia It is connected to the Marmara Sea and the Black Sea by the Dardanelles and Bosporus

In ancient people thought differently about why it was named Aegean Maybe it was named after the town of Aegae or Aegea a queen of the Amazons who died in the sea Maybe it was named after Aegeus the father of Theseus Legends say that Aegeus killed himself in the sea when he thought his son was dead

The Greek name for the sea is  Aigaion Pelagos Modern Greek  The Turkish name is Ege Denizi Some people think that the name came from the dialect word waves 

In ancient times two groups of people lived near the sea  the Minoans of Crete and the Myceneans of the Peloponnese The city states of Athens and Sparta came later and were part of Ancient Greece Persians Romans the Byzantine Empire the Venetians people from Venice the Seljuk Turks and the Ottoman Empire later started around the Aegean Sea The people near the Aegean were very advanced in Ancient history and they sailed across it to talk to each other

There are seven groups of Aegean islands the Thracian Sea group the East Aegean group the Northern Sporades the Cyclades the Saronic Islands the Dodecanese and Crete The word archipelago used to mean these islands Many of the Aegean islands or chains of islands are part of the mountain ranges on the mainland One chain goes across the sea to Chios another one goes across Euboea to Samos and a third one goes across the Peloponnese and Crete to Rhodes This one divides the Aegean from the Mediterranean Many of the islands have safe harbours and bays but sailing in the sea is difficult Many of the islands are volcanos and marble and iron are mined on other islands The bigger islands have some green valleys and plains Turkey owns two big islands on the Aegean Sea Bozcaada and Gkeada

A given name is a name given to a person at birth or baptism Given names are referred as first names It is different from a surname A surname is the last name or family name

In most Western countries the given name comes first However in many Eastern countries such as Japan and China it comes after the last name or family name and occasionally also in Europe eg in Hungarian

Christians often call their first name their Christian name

A family name is a name shared by people in the same family Children have the same family name as one or both of their parents When a women gets married she may change her family name or surname to be the same as her husband

Each culture has a different order for a persons family name and given name In English the family name is always at the end so it is also called a last name 

A family name is also called a surname

The word Motet is used to mean a piece of music for a church service sung by a choir without instrumental accompaniment The words are usually in Latin If the words are written in English for the Anglican church it is called an anthem

Motets have been written since the Middle Ages Medieval motets often had very complicated rhythms The tenor often had the tune which might be a folk tune and two voices would put quite complicated accompaniments on top The most famous medieval composer who wrote motets was Guillaume de Machaut

In the Renaissance motets were usually polyphonic That means that the different voices would be singing different parts of the melody at the same time making it very beautiful but quite complicated to listen to Many composers of this time wrote motets The most famous was Giovanni da Palestrina

In the Baroque period one of the most famous composers was Heinrich Schtz who wrote motets which he called Cantiones Sacrae Johann Sebastian Bach wrote six wonderful motets with German texts Some people think that Bach may have used a few instruments to accompany these motets In three of them the choir divide into eight parts

The most famous motet from the Classical period is undoubtedly Mozarts Ave Verum Corpus

In the Romantic period Anton Bruckner wrote several motets which are still very popular with choirs both in services and at concerts

An anthem is a piece of music written for a choir to sing at an Anglican church service The difference between an anthem and a motet is that an anthem is sung in English Also most anthems are accompanied by an organ

The word anthem has come to mean a song of celebration This is why we also talk about National Anthems

Anthems for the church have been composed ever since King Henry VIII argued with the Pope and did not want to be Roman Catholic any more He founded the English Anglican church Church composers were told to write music in English The words usually come from the Bible We know that as early as 1502 the composer Fayrfax was paid 20 shillings for composing an anthem After the Reformation many anthems were composed At first they were like motets but in English Soon the English anthem developed differently from the continental motet Two kinds of anthem developed the Full Anthem in which the whole anthem was sung by the full choir and the Verse Anthem which was usually longer and had several verses which would be sung by soloists with choruses for the full choir in between

Almost every music director of cathedrals or large churches has written anthems A few of the most famous composers of anthems are

Thomas Tallis William Byrd Orlando Gibbons Henry Purcell George Frideric Handel William Boyce Samuel Sebastian Wesley Edward Bairstow William HHarris Herbert Howells William Mathias John Tavener John Rutter

Chinese characters are symbols used in writing Chinese and Japanese In the past Korean and Vietnamese also used them The beginning of these characters was at least 4000 years ago

By now there are still a lot of Chinese characters that were used in Japanese and Korean Generally the education level of a Japanese person is evaluated by the amount of Chinese characters understood by this person In Korean when people found some meanings cannot be expressed clearly by Korean people need to use Chinese characters as a note with a bracket Before 1446 Korean people only used Chinese characters 

Chinese characters are logograms they mainly represent words instead of sounds Most earlier Chinese characters were pictographs  simple pictures used to mean words but few modern Chinese characters are pictographs Many modern Chinese characters are a combination of two or more simple characters

Chinese characters are an important part of East Asian culture Chinese characters may be considered to be abstract art because of how the characters are made up of lines and points

Different from most spelling language Chinese characters writing is also a kind of art

Characters are a kind of graphic language much different from English The correct way is to remember the structure and meaning of every character not pronunciation because there is very close relationship between meaning and structure of characters Example  is a shape pronunciation character is for shape and is for pronunciation means door means A person lives behind a door pronunciation is Fang and tone is 1 pronunciation is also Fang but tone is 2

Improvisation in music is the art of playing an instrument in which the musician or musicians make up the music as they play Improvising is inventing at the same time as one does something Some musicians only play music when they have written music in front of them but it can be great fun to improvise music It is a way of composing Improvisation is common during a jam session

In Baroque times all musicians were taught to improvise because composers often did not bother to write all the notes down Musicians would have improvised lots of ornaments and even whole sections

Many great composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Liszt were famous for their keyboard improvisations

Organists are often expected to improvise during a service In this way they can fill in gaps in the service when there would otherwise be silence they can make a smooth link between one piece of music and the next and they can create the right atmosphere In Baroque times in the Lutheran church organists would improvise a chorale prelude This was a piece of music which uses the melody of the chorale that the congregation sang Bach was one of many composers who wrote many of his chorale preludes down In more recent times some famous concert organists often finish an organ recital by playing an improvisation This might be quite a long piece with several linked movements finishing with a fugue Somebody may give them the theme written on a piece of paper so that it is quite unprepared

A lot of people who play folk music improvise Traditional folk music would not have been written down

In traditional jazz the musicians usually improvise It is quite tricky when a group of people are improvising together They have to listen to one another and get ideas from one another It can be a very exciting way of making music

Improvisation also refers to a type of performance Improvisation is often used in comedy Actors or Improvisers will create an entire show that they make up as they go along They will often ask the audience for an idea or suggestion They will then do a short performance based on the suggestion This lets them do many different short performances during each nights show This is called Short form improv

Then it became the seat of the German parliament again in 1999 after a reconstruction led by British architect Lord Norman Foster

Todays parliament of Germany is called the Bundestag The Reichstag as a parliament dates back to the Holy Roman Empire and ceased to act as a true parliament in the years of Nazi Germany In todays usage the German term Reichstag refers to the building while the term Bundestag refers to the institution

Astrology is the study how the position of the planets changes our lives A person who does astrology as a job is called an astrologer

An astrologer looks at the planets positions and tries to understand a persons character or tries to predict the future Modern astrologers see astrology as a symbolic language It is also seen as an art or a kind of divination Astrologers often say that the position of the stars help them know the future

Astrology is the practice of mapping planetary positions for a given date time and place for the purpose of determining correlations between celestial phenomena and events on earth

Astrology and astronomy started out as the same thing but today they are very different 

A persons astrological sign is based on their birthday A list of astrological signs is below

The theatre of ancient Greece was at its best from 550 to 220 BC It was the beginning of modern western theatre and some ancient Greek plays are still performed today They invented the genres of tragedy comedy and satyr plays

The city state of Athens was a great cultural political and military power during this period Drama was at its centre Theatre was part of a festival called the Dionysia which honoured the god Dionysus In the Dionysia the playwrights presented their work to an audience It was a competition with a winner and prizes These two main genres were never mixed they each had their own typical structure Athens exported the festival to its numerous colonies and allies in order to promote their way of life 

Only men were allowed as actors The actors wore masks so that the people would know which person the actor played

The best known writers of plays are Aeschylus Sophocles Euripides for tragedies and Aristophanes for comedies

Some think early Greek religion and theatre were influenced by Central Asian shamanistic practices A large number of Orphic graffiti discovered in Olbia seems to show that the colony was a major point of contact Eli Rozik points out that the shaman can be seen as an early type of actor influencing the rituals of early Greek theatre

Greek tragedy as we know it was made in Athens some years before 532 BC when Thespis was the earliest recorded playwright He won the first theatrical contest held at Athens so he was the leader of the dithyrambs performed in and around Attica Dithyrambs were ancient hymns sung in praise of the god of wine and fertility Dionysus They had a wild and ecstatic nature

By Thespis time the dithyramb had evolved far away from its cult roots It had become a narrative ballad like genre Because of this Thespis is often called the Father of Tragedy The statesman Solon is said to have created poems in which characters speak with their own voice Spoken recitations known as rhapsodes of Homers epics were popular in festivals before 534 BC Thespiss contribution to drama is unclear but his name is remembered in the common term for performera thespian

The dramatic performances were important to the Athenians this is made clear by the Dionysian festival This was organized perhaps to foster loyalty among the tribes of Attica These had been recently created by Cleisthenes who founded Greek democracy The festival was created roughly around 508 BC 

Phrynichus was the first poet known to use a historical subject his Fall of Miletus 493 told the fate of the town of Miletus after it was conquered by the Persians He is also thought to be the first to use female characters

Until the Hellenistic period all tragedies were unique pieces written in honour of Dionysus and played only once so that today we only have the pieces that were still remembered well enough to have been repeated when repetition of old tragedies became fashion

After the Great Destruction of Athens by the Persian Empire in 480 BC the town and acropolis were rebuilt and theatre became an even more major part of Athenian culture and civic pride The centre piece was the competition between three tragic playwrights at the Theatre of Dionysus twice a year Each submitted three tragedies plus a satyr play From 486 BC each playwright also submitted a comedy Aristotle claimed that Aeschylus added the second actor and that Sophocles introduced the third Apparently the Greek playwrights never used more than three actors

Tragedy and comedy were viewed as completely separate genres and no plays ever merged aspects of the two Satyr plays dealt with the mythological subject matter of the tragedies but in a purely comedic manner However as they were written over a century after the Athenian Golden Age it is not known whether dramatists such as Sophocles and Euripides would have thought about their plays in the same terms

The power of Athens declined following its defeat in the Peloponnesian War against the Spartans From that time on the theatre started performing old tragedies again Although its theatrical traditions seem to have lost their vitality Greek theatre continued into the Hellenistic period The main Hellenistic theatrical form was not tragedy but New Comedy comic episodes about the lives of ordinary citizens The only playwright from the period whose work has survived is Menander One of New Comedys most important contributions was its influence on Roman comedy an influence that can be seen in the surviving works of Plautus and Terence

The plays originally had a chorus of up to 50 people who performed the plays in verse accompanied by music beginning in the morning and lasting until the evening 

The performance space was a simple semi circular space the orchestra where the chorus danced and sang The orchestra was on a flattened terrace at the foot of a hill the slope of which produced a natural theatron Later the term theatre came to be applied to the whole area of theatron orchestra and sken 

The theatres were built on a very large scale to accommodate the large number of people on stage as well as the large number of people in the audience up to fourteen thousand Actors voices needed to be heard throughout the theatre including the very top row of seats The Greeks understanding of acoustics compares very favourably with the current state of the art 

In 465 BC the playwrights began using a backdrop or scenic wall which hung or stood behind the orchestra which also served as an area where actors could change their costumes It was known as the skn In 425 BC a stone scene wall called a paraskenia became a common supplement to skn in the theatres The proskenion was columned and was similar to the modern day proscenium 

Greek theatres also had entrances for the actors and chorus members called parodoi They were tall arches that opened onto the orchestra through which the performers entered By the end of the 5th century BC around the time of the Peloponnesian War the skn the back wall was two stories high Some theatres also had a raised speaking place on the orchestra called the logeion

There were several scenic elements commonly used in Greek theatre

Although in the early days the chorus was much larger the numbers settled down to 12 or 15 in tragedies and 24 in comedies They usually play a group character such as the old men of Argos The chorus offers background information summaries and comments In many of these plays the chorus expresses to the audience what the main characters cannot say such as their hidden fears or secrets

The chorus might sing or might speak in unison The chorus made up for the fact that there were only one two or three actors who played several parts each

Before the introduction of several actors by Aeschylus the Greek chorus was the main performer opposite a solitary actor The importance of the chorus declined after the 5th century BC when the chorus began to be separated from the dramatic action Later dramatists depended less on the chorus

The mask is known to have been used since the time of Aeschylus in the 6th century AD It is one of the typical things they did in classical Greek theatre Masks were also used in the worship of Dionysius and that is probably how the tradition started

Most of the evidence comes from a few vase paintings of the 5th century BC which depict actors preparing for a Satyr play No physical evidence survived the masks were made of organic materials They were not considered permanent objects and were dedicated to the altar of Dionysus after performances There are however examples of statues of actors carrying a mask in hand

Masks were made for the actors and for the chorus who help the audience know what a character is thinking The chorus all wear the same mask because they represent the same character

In a large open air theatre like the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens the masks brought the characters face closer to the audience as they had exaggerated features and expressions An actor could appear and reappear in different roles since the audience did not identify the actor with one character Their variations help the audience to distinguish sex age and social status Also they could show a change in a characters appearance for example Oedipus after blinding himselfp70 Unique masks were also created for specific characters and events in a play such as The Furies in Aeschylus Eumenides and Pentheus and Cadmus in Euripides The Bacchae Worn by the chorus the masks created a sense of unity and uniformity a sort of multi voiced persona or single organism

Sophocles was an Ancient Greek writer who wrote 123 plays according to the Suda Only 7 of his tragedies have survived complete Sophocles was the second of the three greatest Ancient Greek writers of tragedies the others were Aeschylus and Euripides The most famous of Sophocles tragedies are those concerning Oedipus and Antigone these are often known as the Theban plays although each play was actually a part of different tetralogy the other members of which are now lost

Sophocles the son of Sophillus was a wealthy member of the rural community of Colonus Hippius in Attica which would later become a setting for his plays and was probably born there His birth took place a few years before the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC the exact year is unclear although 4976 is perhaps most likely Sophocles first great play was in 468 BC when he took first prize in the Dionysia theatre competition over the reigning master of Athenian drama Aeschylus According to Plutarch the victory came under unusual circumstances

In Oedipus the King Oedipus is the main character 

Oedipus death as a child is planned by his parents Laius and Jocasta to stop him fulfilling a prophecy A servant passes the infant on to a childless couple who adopt him not knowing his history 

Oedipus eventually learns of the Delphic Oracles prophecy of him that he would kill his father and marry his mother Then he thought this meant his adopted parents He flees to avoid his fate Oedipus meets a man at a crossroads accompanied by servants Oedipus and the man fight and Oedipus kills the man This man was his father Laius not that anyone apart from the gods knew this at the time 

Oedipus becomes the ruler of Thebes after solving the riddle of the sphinx and in the process marries the widowed Queen his mother Jocasta Thus the stage is set for horrors When the truth comes out Jocasta commits suicide Oedipus blinds himself and leaves Thebes and the children are left to sort out the consequences themselves

In Oedipus at Colonus the banished Oedipus and his daughters Antigone and Ismene arrive at the town of Colonus where they encounter Theseus King of Athens Oedipus dies and strife begins between his sons Polyneices and Eteocles

In Antigone the protagonist is Oedipus daughter Antigone is faced with the choice of allowing her brother Polyneices body to remain unburied outside the city walls exposed to the ravages of wild animals or to bury him and face death 

The king of the land Creon has forbidden the burial of Polyneices for he was a traitor to the city Antigone decides to bury his body and face the consequences of her actions Creon sentences her to death Eventually Creon is convinced to free Antigone from her punishment but his decision comes too late and Antigone commits suicide Her suicide triggers the suicide of two others close to King Creon his son Haemon who was to wed Antigone and his wife who commits suicide after losing her only surviving son

Running through such tragedies is the theme of fate which cannot be avoided A forbidden act is committed in innocence and the consequences follow remorselessly

Black pepper is a plant that grows in the tropics especially in India The plant is a perennial vine that bears flowers People cultivate the plant for its fruit the peppercorn The peppercorn can be used as a spice or condiment Usually it makes things hot

There are several different plants called Pepper all are in the Piper genus of Piperaceae

From the 16th century onwards people used the word pepper to also refer to the Chile peppers which come from a completely unrelated plant

Pepper is one of the most common spices used around the world It is very common in European cuisine and has been known and traded for a very long time Very often the peppercorns are ground and the powder is used to make things taste hot

Like all eastern spices pepper was historically both a seasoning and a medicine Long pepper being stronger was often the preferred medication but both were used

Black peppercorns are mentioned in Ayurveda Siddha and Unani medicine in India The 5th century Syriac Book of Medicines prescribes pepper for illnesses such as constipation diarrhea earache gangrene heart disease hernia hoarseness indigestion insect bites insomnia joint pain liver problems lung disease oral abscesses sunburn tooth decay and toothaches Various sources from the 5th century onward also say pepper is good to treat eye problems Often special ointments made with pepper have to be applied directly to the eye There is no current medical evidence that any of these treatments has any benefit pepper applied directly to the eye would be quite uncomfortable and possibly damaging

For a long time people believed pepper is the cause for sneezing this is still believed true today Some sources say that piperine irritates the nostrils which will cause the sneezing some say that it is just the effect of the fine dust in ground pepper and some say that pepper is not in fact a very effective sneeze producer at all Few if any controlled studies have been carried out to answer the question 

Pepper can irritate the intestines It is therefore eliminated from the diet of patients having abdominal surgery and ulcers The replacement is usually called a bland diet

Pepper contains small amounts of safrole a carcinogenic compound

Chile pepper is the fruit of a series of plants called Capsicum Those plants are now grown all over the world but originally they came from South America They are used as spices or as vegetables and also have some use in medicine

Chile peppers are completely unrelated to the Piperaceae genus which Black pepper is from

Aeschylus was an Ancient Greek poet and writer He wrote about 7090 plays Only six of his tragedies have survived complete Aeschylus was the earliest of the three greatest Greek writers of tragedians The two others were Sophocles and Euripides 

Aristotle said that Aeschylus added more characters into his plays His characters spoke to each other and not just to the chorus This made it easier to create drama between the characters

One of his plays The Persians was about the Persian invasion of Greece Aeschylus had fought in this war People studying Greek history use his play as an important source of information The war was so important to the Greeks and to Aeschylus that the writing on his grave only talks about his part in the Greek victory at Marathon There is nothing about the plays he wrote

Aeschylus was born about the year 525 BC in a small town called Eleusis which is about 27 kilometers northwest of Athens The date is based on counting back forty years from his first victory in the Great Dionysia His family was rich and his father Euphorion was a member of the Eupatridae the ancient nobility of Attica Pausanias wrote that Aeschylus worked in a vineyard until the god Dionysus visited him in his sleep The god ordered him to write the first tragedies His first play was performed in 499 BC when he was only 26 years old

In 490 BC the Persian army led by Darius landed in Greece and tried to take it over Aeschylus and his brother Cynegeirus joined the army from Athens and fought against the Persians at the Battle of Marathon The Athenians were able to defeat the much bigger Persian army This battle which stopped Darius was celebrated across the city states of Greece Cynegeirus died in the battle In 480 BC Xerxes I of Persia tried to capture Greece Aeschylus fought against them at the Battle of Salamis and at the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC His oldest surviving play The Persians performed in 472 BC is set during the Battle of Salamis This play won first prize at the Dionysia

Aeschylus was one of many Greeks who joined the Eleusinian Mysteries This was the religious cult of Demeter and based in his home town of Eleusis Members of the group learned mystical and secret knowledge Members were sworn under the penalty of death not to say anything about the Mysteries to anyone Aristotle wrote that some people thought that Aeschylus had shown some of the cults secrets on stage Other writers said that an angry mob tried to kill Aeschylus on the spot but he ran away Later Aeschylus said he did not know that he had shown any of the secrets He was saved from death only because of his brave service in the Persian Wars

Aeschylus made two trips to Sicily in the 470s BC He was invited by Hieron tyrant of Syracuse a big Greek city on the east side of the island On one of these trips he wrote The Women of Aetna in honor of the city founded by Hieron He also restaged his Persians By 473 BC Aeschylus was the yearly favorite in the Dionysia winning first prize in nearly every competition In 458 BC he returned to Sicily for the last time visiting the city of Gela where he died in 456 or 455 BC It is said that he was killed by a tortoise which fell out of the sky after it was dropped by an eagle This story is probably only a legend Aeschylus work was so respected by the Athenians that after his death his were the only tragedies allowed to be restaged in future competitions His sons Euphorion and Euon and his nephew Philocles all wrote plays as well

Greek drama began with festivals for the gods mainly Dionysus the god of wine During Aeschylus lifetime dramatic competitions became part of the citys Dionysia in the spring The festival began with an opening procession then a competition of boys singing dithyrambs and finally two dramatic competitions The first competition was for three playwrights each presenting three tragic plays followed by a shorter comedy A second competition of five comedic playwrights followed and the winners of both competitions were chosen by a group of judges

Aeschylus took part in many of these competitions in his lifetime Only six tragedies have survived intact The Persians Seven against Thebes The Suppliants and the trilogy known as The Oresteia consisting of the three tragedies Agamemnon The Libation Bearers and The Eumenides There is also the play Prometheus Bound but this was probably written by someone else All of the surviving plays won first prize at the City Dionysia One book the Alexandrian Life of Aeschylus said that he won the first prize at the City Dionysia 13 times Sophocles won 18 times out of his 120 plays and Euripides only had five wins out of about 90 plays

When Aeschylus first began writing the theatre was new Some playwrights like Thespis had made the cast bigger to include an actor who was able to talk with the chorus Aeschylus added a second actor allowing for more drama and the chorus became less important He is said to have been the first to use skenographia or scene decoration but Aristotle said the first person was Sophocles Aeschylus also added more details to the costumes and had his actors wear platform boots called cothurni to help the audience see them better When they walked on stage in the first performance of the Eumenides the chorus of Furies were so frightening in looks that they made young children faint old men urinate and pregnant women go into labor

His plays were written in the strict style of Greek drama They were in verse and no violence could be performed on stage The plays had to be set away from normal life in Athens either by telling stories about the gods or by being set like The Persians in a far away place Aeschylus work has a strong moral and religious emphasis The Oresteia plays were about mans position in the universe in relation to the gods the laws of the gods and punishment from the gods 

Fifty years after Aeschylus death the comic playwright Aristophanes praised him in the The Frogs Aeschylus is a character in the play and says that his Seven against Thebes made everyone watching it to love being warlike with his Persians he says he taught the Athenians to desire always to defeat their enemies He says that his plays helped the Athenians to be brave and virtuous

Euripides was an Ancient Greek writer who wrote about 90 plays Only 18 of his tragedies have survived complete

Euripides was the last of the three greatest Ancient Greek writers of tragedies the others being Aeschylus and Sophocles

Chard is a plant It is a vegetable It is in the same family with Spinach Amaranthaceae

The half life of a substance is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay The word half life was first used when talking about radioactive elements where the number of atoms get smaller over time It is now used in many other situations A Geiger Muller detector can be used to measure the half life it is the time when the activity is half of the original

Note that half life is defined as a probability Half life is the expected value when half the number of atoms have decayed Carbon 14 has a half life of 5730 years Taking one atom of C 14 this will either have decayed after 5730 years or it will not But if this experiment is repeated again and again it will be seen that the atom decays within the half life 50 of the time

Radioactive atoms have unstable nuclei Their nuclei are unstable because the arrangement of protons and neutrons in them are unsteady making them shake until that they begin to decay and change into completely different types of atoms by releasing certain types of radioactive particles such as alpha particles beta particles or gamma rays and possibly by fissioning into smaller nuclei This is known as radioactive decay For example a radioactive carbon 14 atom releases a beta particle to become nitrogen 14 As an example of fission decay a Fermium 256 atom can split into Xenon 140 and Palladium 112 atoms releasing 4 neutrons in the process

A Kyklops or Cyclops is a kind of giant in Greek mythology which has only one eye on its forehead They originally were children of Gaia and Uranos and were called Brontes Steropes and Arges

The most known is probably the cyclops Polyphemos in Homers Odyssey

In physics the magnetic field is a field that passes through space and which makes a magnetic force move electric charges and magnetic dipoles Magnetic fields are around electric currents magnetic dipoles and changing electric fields

When placed in a magnetic field magnetic dipoles are in one line with their axes to be parallel with the field lines as can be seen when iron filings are in the presence of a magnet Magnetic fields also have their own energy and momentum with an energy density proportional to the square of the field intensity The magnetic field is measured in the units of teslas or gauss

There are some notable specific kinds of the magnetic field For the physics of magnetic materials see magnetism and magnet and more specifically diamagnetism For magnetic fields made by changing electric fields see electromagnetism

The electric field and the magnetic field are components of the electromagnetic field

The forehead of humans is the flat space of skin above the eyes between the eyebrows and where your hair starts to grow It exists to make room for the brain inside the skull

A doctor or nurse will often touch someones forehead to check whether or not they have a fever This is because of the many blood vessels in the head and face

In ancient Greece individuals with large foreheads were classified as intellectual because of their incredibly large brain Nowadays this is not the case

James Prescott Joule was an English physicist born in Salford near Manchester In his time he had great contribution to the world of electricity and thermodynamics He was best known for discovering Joules law which described electric heating by saying the amount of heat produced each second in a conductor by a current of Electricity is proportional to the resistance of a conductor and to the square of the current The unit for this is joule equal to one watt second Later Joule worked with William Thomson to find out that the temperature of gas falls as gas expands This principle was then known as the Joule Thomson effect

The son of Benjamin Joule a wealthy brewer James Prescott Joule was born in the house next to the Joule Brewery in New Bailey Street Salford on 24 December 1818 James was tutored at the family home Broomhill Pendlebury near Salford until 1834 when he was sent with his elder brother Benjamin to study with John Dalton at the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society They only received two years of education in arithmetic and geometry before Dalton was forced to retire because of a stroke

Kinetics is the science of motion Joule was a pupil of Dalton and it is no surprise that he had learned a firm belief in the atomic theory even though there were many scientists of his time who were still skeptical He had also been one of the few people receptive to the work of John Herapath on the kinetic theory of gases He was further greatly influenced by Peter Ewarts 1813 paper On the measure of moving force

Andromache is a person in Greek mythology She is the wife of Hector of Troy and mother of Astyanax

Neoptolemos is a person in Greek mythology He is an important person in the Trojan War

Neoptolemus was the son of Achilles and Deidamea He was needed to win the Trojan War He killed King Priam and Astyanax sacrificed Polyxena to his dead father Achilles and took Helenus and Andromache with him as slaves

All planets in our solar system follow an elliptical path This path is known as an orbit Earths orbit is elliptical but so much like a circle that if you were to draw the Earths orbit on a sheet of paper as a perfect circle the width of the line would be larger than the elliptical path of the Earth 

The Earths orbit takes about 365 days this is also called a year This means that in 365 days the Earth has gone completely around the Sun From this we can find that the Earth is actually moving at about 67000 miles per hour through space 

The closest distance Earth is to the sun is 146 million km and the farthest is 152 million km It takes light just over eight minutes to travel from Sun to Earth

The seasonal changes on Earth are because of the 23 degree tilt of its rotation axis and slightly elliptical path around the Sun

The orbit varies over long periods of time according to the Milankovitch cycles These cycles are one of the main causes of climate change

Penelope is a person in Greek mythology She is the wife of Odysseus of Ithaca and mother of Telemachos She became a symbol for the faithful wife

When her husband Odysseus was on his long journey home many people thought he was dead Because of this many suitors came who wanted to marry Penelope because then they would own her land and wealth and become king of Ithaca Penelope thinks of several tricks so that she does not have to marry one of the suitors One trick is that she tells the suitors that she will first weave a cloth for the funeral of Odysseus father and when she was finished she would marry one of the suitors But every night she undoes her weaving again so that she never finishes it

When Odysseus finally comes back after twenty years he and his son Telemachos kill the suitors

Counterpoint is the art of composing music by combining different parts in a way that sounds nice Music composed like this is called contrapuntal

If the tune of Twinkle twinkle little star is played on the piano and then some chords are added this is harmony not counterpoint Instead if the tune of Twinkle twinkle little star was played while another melody was played this would be considered counterpoint

A different way of playing it would be to start the tune with the right hand Then in the second bar as the fifth note is played the left hand starts to play the tune an octave lower This works well for a time but in the fifth bar it starts to get dissonant so changes need to made to the left hand to make it sound nicer This way of writing with a particular number of parts is called contrapuntal music

In that example the left hand imitated the right hand at first This is called imitation

If the second part had continued to imitate all the way through the piece it would have been a canon But Twinkle twinkle does not work well as a canon One famous canon is by Thomas Tallis A canon that can be repeated is called a round This is all contrapuntal music

Counterpoint does not have to have imitation although it often does The important thing is that each part is equally important It is not one part singing the tune and the rest just accompanying

Counterpoint does not have to be one note against one note There can be two or more notes in one part against one in the other eg crotchets in one part and quavers in another There is a whole system for this called species

Counterpoint can be varied by inverting it ie putting the top part at the bottom When music is written so that the parts can be swapped round it is called invertible counterpoint

The word counterpoint comes from the Latin punctus contra punctum meaning point against point The word point meant note Several hundred years ago composers found how to write contrapuntal music They often took a main tune and then added one or two or more parts to it The more parts there were the harder it was to compose because it all had to fit so that it sounded good Music for several voices written in this way is called polyphonic music Polyphony was used in all church music in the Renaissance The greatest composer of polyphony was Giovanni da Palestrina Students learning the art of composition today still learn counterpoint by taking Palestrinas music as their model

Eugenics is a social and political philosophy It tries to influence the way people choose to mate and raise children with the aim of improving the human species 

Eugenics rests on some basic ideas The first is that what is true of animals is true of man The characteristics of animals are passed on from one generation to the next in heredity including mental characteristics For example the behaviour and mental characteristics of different breeds of dog differ and all modern breeds are greatly changed from wolves The breeding and genetics of farm animals show that if the parents of the next generation are chosen then that affects what offspring are born 

Negative eugenics aims to cut out traits that lead to suffering by limiting people with the traits from reproducing Positive eugenics aims to produce more healthy and intelligent humans by persuading people with those traits to have more childrenp85 In the past many ways were proposed for doing this and even today eugenics means different things to different people The idea of eugenics is controversial because in the past it was sometimes used to justify discrimination and injustice against people who were thought to be genetically unhealthy or inferior

Modern eugenics was first invented in 1865 by Sir Francis Galton a British scientist who was the cousin of Charles Darwin Galton believed that intelligence and talent were hereditary and were passed from parent to their children Based on this he thought that people could be bred to be smarter just like animals were bred to be larger or smaller Galton thought the best way to do this was to learn more about heredity and also to tell people that they should only marry people who were smart and strong Galton chose the name Eugenics because it was very similar to the Greek for well born 

Galton developed the idea of eugenics throughout his life He understood the two types of eugenics positive and negative eugenics One problem which critics brought up is the difficulty of agreeing on who is a healthy person genetically speaking and who is an inferior person Obviously opinions might differ

The rediscovery of the scientific work of Gregor Mendel in 1900 led to modern genetics and an understanding of how heredity worked Mendel himself experimented on peas and found that many characteristics of the pea plants such as their colour or their height could be turned on and off through heredity like a switch For example his peas could be either yellow or green one or the other 

When applied to humans people thought this meant that human characteristics like being smart or not could be influenced by heredity 

Another line of thought goes like this During their evolution humans were subject to natural selection like any other form of life On average healthy and intelligent people had a better chance of reproducing In modern civilisation however it often seems that this process does not apply Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin had discussed this very point with concernp70 In countries where statistics were collected those statistics showed that in many cases the poor had more children than the rich Also statistics showed that the total population of some great nations was decliningp73 One startling piece of information was produced by research directed by Karl Pearson the Galton Professor of Eugenics at University College London and the founder of the Department of Applied Statistics The finding was that half of each succeeding generation was produced by no more than a quarter of the previous generation and that quarter was disproportionately located amongst the dregs of societyp74 

The evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley was also a supporter of eugenics He used this argument several times 

The American historian of science Garland Allen commented The agricultural analogy appears over and over again as it did in the writings of many American eugenicists 

Similarly the American geneticist Charles Davenport was a lifelong promoter of eugenics and wrote one of its first textbooksChapter 3 There is no doubt of the support given to eugenics by professional scientists of undoubted repute 

In the United States eugenics became a very popular idea in the early 20th century People thought it would cure society of all of its problems at the time like crime and poverty because they thought that all aspects of human behavior were probably hereditary Very important scientists and politicians supported eugenics and most thought it was a very progressive and scientific philosophy 

But some of those who led the eugenics movement used it to justify racism and prejudice They used eugenics as an excuse to pass laws which to restrict immigration from countries that they did not like saying that the people in them were genetically unfit They also passed laws which said that people of different races could not get married to one another Most importantly they passed laws which said that people who were thought to have mental illness or mental disability could be sterilised against their will Under these laws over 60000 people were sterilised in the United States between 1907 and the 1970s

Today we know that interpreting statistics of this type is a complex business and that many of the studies published early in the 20th century have serious flaws Nevertheless what stopped the eugenics movement was not better science It was the realization after World War II of the effects of Nazi policies on race in Germany and other countries occupied during the war Such war crimes were not of course advocated by any eugenicist All the same there was a common theme This theme was the growing interest in the rights of individuals as against the rights of the state

With the end of the Second World War forced sterilisation ended in Germany It was continued in the United States until 1974 The main targets were at first those that were ill or that had some physical or mental disabilities Later on the focus shifted towards convicted criminals as well as black people 

Only in 1985 was a law of the Swiss canton of Vaud abolished This law allowed for the forced sterilisation of a certain group of people It was replaced by a law on the national level that tells under which circumstances people who are unable to consent may be sterilised

Though there are few people who openly advocate eugenics today many people wonder what improvements in genetic technologies will mean in the future 

Genetic counselling exists where parents can get information about their heredity and even prevent the birth of a child if it has a risk of hereditary illness Some people do not think the issue is so clear though and wonder if genetic screening genetic counselling and birth control are all just another type of eugenics Some people wonder whether eugenics is only bad if it is done coercively like the Nazis or if it is bad because it infringes human dignity Some people oppose eugenics and genetic counselling for religious reasons The idea of eugenics is controversial today for these reasons

Much of this concern is misplaced Genetic counselling is not going to change the genetic composition of the human population to any noticeable extent More relevant is the developing power to identify and then to change directly elements of the human genome This does have the potential to change the genetic structure of human populations

Yerevan is the capital and largest city of Armenia In 2004 about 1088300 people lived in Yerevan Some people write Yerevan as Erevan In past Yerevan was called Erebuni or Erivan

It is on the Hrazdan River and is the administrative cultural and industrial center of the country 

The history of Yerevan dates back to the 8th century BC with the founding of the Urartian fortress of Erebuni in 782 BC Eventually the letter b in the name Erebuni changed in the 5th or 4th century BC becoming v

The climate of Yerevan is relatively continental with dry hot summers and cold and short winters The temperature in August can reach 40C while January may be as cold as 15 C The amount of precipitation is small amounting annually to about 350 mm

As a centre of Armenian culture Yerevan is the site of Yerevan State University the Armenian Academy of Sciences a historical museum an opera house a music conservatory and several technical institutes The Matenadaran archives hold a rich collection of valuable ancient Armenian Greek Assyrian Hebrew Roman and Persian manuscripts Yerevan has several large public libraries a number of museums and theaters botanical gardens and zoos It is also at the heart of an extensive rail network and is a major trading centre for agricultural products In addition industries in the city produce metals machine tools electrical equipment chemicals textiles and food products 

Two major tourist attractions are the Opera House the ruins of an Urartu fortress and a Roman fortress The Armenia Marriott Hotel is in the heart of the city at Republic Square

The Yerevan Metro is a rapid transit system that serves the capital city Its interior resembles that of western former Soviet nations with chandeliers hanging from the corridors The metro stations had most of their names changed after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Independence of the Republic of Armenia

Yerevan is Armenias industrial transportation and cultural center Manufactures include chemicals primary metals machinery rubber products plastics textiles and processed food Not only is Yerevan the headquarters of major Armenian companies but of international ones as well as its seen as an attractive outsourcing location for Western European Russian and American multinationals  

Recently Yerevan has been undergoing an ambitious redevelopment process in which old Soviet style apartments and buildings are being demolished and replaced with modern buildings However this urban renewal plan has been met with opposition and criticism from some residents Jermaine Jackson has planned to build an entertainment complex in a new 5 star hotel which is being built in the city

Smallpox is a very bad disease with a high mortality rate It is caused by a virus There are two different kinds of viruses that cause the disease They are called Variola major and Variola minor Some people also call smallpox Variola named after the viruses scientific name

Only people can get this disease Variola major kills between 20 and 40 of those who get it Variola minor kills only about 1 Many people who survive become blind because of the damage the virus does to the eyes 

During the first half of the 20th century between 300 million and 500 million people died of this disease Even in 1967 about 15 million people caught the disease and about two million people died of it according to the World Health Organization 

The first broken wikt linkinoculationcure for smallpox used the results of cowpox infections A vaccine was developed and used to stop people getting smallpox This vaccine called vaccina was the first vaccine ever made and the word vaccine came from vaccina A vaccine is the real word for that shot we all have to get from time to time In 1979 the WHO said the disease no longer existed and no one would ever get sick from it again However live copies of smallpox are kept in different maximum security laboratories around the world

Some believe that smallpox could be used as an agent for purposely infecting enemies in a war Today most people no longer receive a smallpox shot but a few very very old people still need it

If somebody has got smallpox their entire body would be covered in bumps infiltrated by blood that are far worse than the chicken pox

Ancient China is a very old civilization People wrote about the history of China 3500 years ago China is one of the worlds oldest continuous civilizations Turtle shells with writing like ancient Chinese writing from the Shang Dynasty have been carbon dated to about 1500 BC They say that China began as city states in the Yellow River valley Many people say that China became a big Kingdom or Empire in 221 BC The Qin emperor Qin Shi Huang made everyone write the same way He also had ideas about the state which he based on legalism and fought Confucianism This began what we call the Chinese civilization Ancient China fought wars and Civil wars and was also sometimes conquered by other people

Shaka was the most important leader of the Zulu Empire He joined the Zulu tribal groups together into the beginnings of a nation This Zulu nation ruled over a large area of southern Africa between the Phongolo and Mzimkhulu rivers His leadership and his energy make him one of the greatest Zulu chieftains He has been called a military genius for his changes and new ideas However there were also brutal and cruel things that happened when he was in charge 

Shaka Zulu was born in about 1787 His father was a minor Zulu chief He lived with his mother in the court of the Zulu leader of the day He grew up to become a great military leader When the Zulu leader was murdered by a rival clan Shaka took over the throne 

During this time Shaka reorganized the Zulu into a military clan He soon made them into a force unchallenged in Southern African kingdoms He introduced the shorter stabbing spear the iklwa that replaced the traditional long and awkward throwing spear On the battlefield he developed the now famous horns of the bull formation Conquering tribe after tribe he joined all his conquests together into one Zulu nation making it grow with people and power This also caused the displacement of thousands of people His actions were partly responsible for spreading the Southern African tribes as far away as Mozambique 

This event was named the Mfecane  the crushing of people by the Nguni people The Sotho and Tswana called it the Difaqane  the scattering of tribes The Afrikaners and the British called it the Wars of Calamity By 1825 two and half million starving homeless people wandered about southern Africa looking for food and shelter

There were other things that led to the Mfecane Corn brought in from America grew easily in the mild seasons of southern Africa Because the farmers were not careful the corn used all the nutrients in the soil As the local population increased they needed more land to grow corn and to graze livestock Starting in 1800 a long drought then made southern Africa unlivable People moved in search of food and fought for what little food could be found The Mfengu called the drought madlatule  eat what you can and say nothing 

Shaka maintained a good relationship with the Europeans in Africa including the Colonial authorities He was disliked by other Africans including his own people who suffered under his long cruel and debilitating rule of constant war 

Ten years of continual warfare placed incredible strains on the Zulu nation Shaka always mentally unstable and obsessively worried about being replaced by an heir finally snapped into madness after the death of his mother in 1828 He imposed a year of celibacy on his people He executed anyone who did not show enough sadness at the death of his mother He was murdered within the year by his half brother Dingane who succeeded him as ruler 

Even though he created brutal conditions for his subjects he created the powerful Zulu Kingdom and consolidated a nation and its pride 

A halo is a ring of light that surrounds an object Also in much religious art it may be seen surrounding the heads of saintly people such as Jesus

It is believed by some Hindus that the halo shown around the heads of holy people is a depiction of their activated crown chakra

Halos are visual phenomena that appear near or around the Sun or Moon and sometimes near other strong light sources such as street lights There are many types of optical halos but they are mostly caused by ice crystals in certain types of clouds The shape of the crystals changes the type of halo seen Light is reflected by the ice and may split into colors similar to the rainbow

These rings destoyed all of humanity for 40 years and the flood was locked up until the release of the flood happened the covenant unlocked the doors and released the flood

The Mughal Empire was an empire in Asia which existed from 1526 to 1858 When it was biggest it ruled most of the Indian subcontinent then known as Hindustan and parts of what is now Afghanistan and modern Pakistan between 1526 and 1707 Babur founded the Mughal Empire in 1526 and ruled until 1530 He was followed by Humayun and Akbar Jahangir Shah Jahan Aurangzeb and Bahadur Shah Zafar II After the death of Aurangzeb the Mughal Empire became weak It continued until 1857 By that time India came under the British Raj

The Mughal dynasty was established by able Muslim rulers who came from the present day Uzbekistan The Mughal rule in India saw the country being united as one single unit and being administered under one single powerful ruler During the Mughal period art and architecture flourished and many beautiful monuments were constructed The rulers were skillful warriors and admirers of art as well The Mughals expanded empire to cover almost the whole of the Indian subcontinent and left a permanent mark on the society culture art and architecture of India

The British Raj is a term of history Raj is a word of Indian languages which means rule so British Raj means rule by the British in India This rule was before 1947 and was over parts of what are now four countries the Republic of India Pakistan Bangladesh and Burma At that time these four countries were all part of the British Indian Empire known at the time as the Indian Empire and sometimes now spoken of as the British Raj 

The British Raj is used to talk of the direct British rule over areas which had been conquered by the British known as British India and also the British influence over hundreds of independent princely states ruled by their own Indian rulers under the overall authority of the British crown

Undivided India is another term which is used to mean the whole area of British rule but it does not take in Burma which from 1937 was a British colony on its own The colony of Aden came under the same government in India from 1858 to 1937 and so did British Somaliland from 1884 to 1898 and Singapore from 1858 to 1867 

British rule in Pakistan and the East Bengal region ended on 14 August 1947 while British rule in the rest of what had been British India ended on 15 August 1947 however the boundaries came into effect on the 18th of that month as two countries 

A lever is a simple machine It is something that can be used in a lot of ways One way is by measuring things or by seeing which weighs more A lever is supported by a fulcrum which it uses to lifts weights It is one of six simple machines There are three types of levers First class Second class and Third class

The earliest remaining writings regarding levers date from the 3rd century BC and were provided by Archimedes Give me a place to stand and I shall move the earth is a famous quote of Archimedes who stated the correct mathematical principle of levers

There are three kinds of levers The difference between them is where the fulcrum is and where the forces are

A first class lever is a lever where the fulcrum is in between the effort and resistance

A second class lever is where the resistance is between the effort and the fulcrum

A pulley is something that is used to lift heavy objects It is a kind of simple machine It is sometimes called a block and tackle Pulleys are usually used in sets designed to make the amount of force needed to lift something smaller

Jzef Klemens Pisudski was an important leader of Poland

From 1795 to 1918 Poland was not an independent country It was divided into three parts between Russia Prussia and Austria Hungary Pisudski was born in the Russian part The government tried to make Poles become Russian but Pisudski was born in family of patriots In 1887 he got into trouble because he helped people who tried to kill the Tsar He was sent to Siberia When he came back from there he got more and more involved in politics

Later Pisudski became a soldier and wanted to make Poland independent again At the beginning of World War I most people who agreed with Pilsudski helped Austria Hungary because they preferred it to Russia When they stopped helping Austria Hungary and Germany Pisudski was arrested When the War was over he was freed He came to Warsaw in November 1918 and helped to organize Poland Then for a short time he became its leader Gabriel Narutowicz became Polands first president but he was shot by his enemy a few days later and Stanisaw Wojciechowski became the next president Polands situation was not good and the politicians argued a lot Many people especially the soldiers wanted Pisudski back so he told Wojciechowski to resign When Wojciechowski said no Pisudki took over with the help of the Army Parliament elected Ignacy Mocicki to be the new president but he had to do what Pisudski wanted him to do Together they changed the Polish constitution and made a lot of other changes

The Indus Valley civilization was an ancient civilization It was discovered by archaeologists in the 1920s It developed along the Indus River and the Ghaggar Hakra River in the area of modern Pakistan It started during the Bronze age The height of its development was between 2600 and 1900 BCE Including the civilizations directly before and directly afterward it may have lasted from the 33rd to the 14th century BCE 

The Indus Valley Civilization covered a large area  from Balochistan to Gujarat Today some old remains of the Indus Valley Civilization can be found in Afghanistan Turkmenistan and Iran The first city to be discovered by excavation was Harappa and therefore this civilization is also known as Harappan Civilization The bathrooms were attached to the rooms of the Harappa people They were considered to be good buildersIt brought tremendous change in the country in various ways The ruins of the sight reveal that the harappa civilization people were designed skillfullyOne of the unique features of the city was its elaborate drainage system A brick lined drainage channel flowed along side every street

Sumer was an ancient civilization in the southern part of Mesopotamia that started around 3500 BC It was one of the first civilizations in the world The Sumerian civilization grew along the Tigris and Euphrates This land was good for growing food Sumerian culture is famous for its written cuneiform script  where letters were formed by pressing a triangle shaped reed into wet clay tiles They are also credited with creating the wheel and dividing a day into 24 hours and each hour into 60 minutes

Sumerian communities were organized into city states each ruled by a priest or king One of the most famous Sumerian cities was Ur

The Sumerians lost their identity with their language around 2000 BC because a large group of different people the Amorites moved into their region

The Sumerians made their clothing by using the natural resources that were available to them Clothing was made from wool or flax which Sumerians could raise and harvest How thick or how coarse the clothing was meant the season in which the clothes would be worn Like us heavier clothing would be worn in the winter and lighter clothing would be worn in the summer

Men were barechested and wore skirt like garments that tied at the waist Women usually wore gowns that covered them from their shoulders to their ankles The right arm and shoulder were left uncovered Men were either clean shaven or had long hair and beards Women wore their hair long but they usually braided it and wrapped it around their heads When entertaining guests women would place headdresses in their hair

Although both rich and poor Sumerians wore the same style of clothing the wealthier Sumerians wore clothing that was made out of expensive and luxurious materials Wealthy women and princesses also wore clothing that was colorful and bright

Both men and women wore earrings and necklaces During celebrations even more jewelry was worn The wealthier Sumerians often wore beautiful gold and silver bracelets and earrings Sumerians also wore necklaces with bright precious stones Some of these stones were lapis lazuli and carnelian

Originally it only supported 100 MB disks but later versions began to support 250 MB and 750 MB disks Now capacities have reached 1GB and 2GB disks

Higher capacity Zip disks must be used in a drive with at least the same capacity ability Generally higher capacity drives also handle all lower capacity media However it is slower to write data on a 100 MB disk with a 250 MB Zip drive than with a 100 MB Zip drive

Zip drives can transmit data to the computer in various ways Internal drives have been made with IDE and SCSI interfaces External drives can use SCSI parallel port or USB interface

Zip disks are thicker than 35 floppy disks Nevertheless zip disks are quite similar in appearance to regular floppy disks This means the Zip drive slot is large enough to accept such a floppy disk

The Napoleonic Wars are wars that people fought during the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte over France They started after the French Revolution ended and Napoleon Bonaparte became powerful in France in November 1799 War began between the United Kingdom and France in 1803 This happened when the Treaty of Amiens ended in 1802 

These wars changed European armies and artillery They also changed military systems They were very big and destructive mainly because of conscription The French became powerful very fast and conquered most of Europe The French then lost quickly They invaded Russia which failed The Napoleonic Wars ended on 20 November 1815 This was just after the Battle of Waterloo a big battle that Napoleon lost and the Second Treaty of Paris in 1815 Napoleons empire lost the wars The Bourbon Dynasty ruled France again

Some people call all the time between April 20 1792 and November 20 1815 the Great French War On one side was the First Empire of France Kingdom of Italy and others On the other side was Great Britain Prussia Austria Russia Sweden Portugal Spain Sicily and others

On 18 May 1804 Napoleon Bonaparte was crowned Emperor of the French at Notre Dame The following year the Third Coalition started In respond Napoleon crowned himself King of Italy The Austrian Emperor Franz I was thrown into a rage and declared war on Napoleon beginning the War of the Third Coalition Although the British destroyed the French navy at the Battle of Trafalgar in December the Austrians and the Russians allied and met with the French at the Battle of Austerlitz The Russo Austrian army suffered a devastating defeat and had to sign a treaty with Napoleon In 1806 the War of the Fourth Coalition started The Kingdom of Prussia declared war on France first but was crushed by Napoleons troops at the Battle of Jena Napoleon captured Berlin before the Russians could help In 1807 Napoleon defeated the Russian army at the Battle of Ferdinand ending the Fourth Coalition In 1809 the War of the Fifth Coalition began when Austria declared war on Napoleon In the early phases of the war the Austrians had advantage of the war but later the French captured Vienna ending the Fifth Coalition At the height of his power in 1810 Napoleon had controlled France Spain northern Italy Germany all the way to Russia In 1808 the Pennisular War began when Napoleon crowned his brother Joseph Bonaparte as King of Spain and invaded English Spanish and Portugese troops In 1809 the Finnish War began between Russia and Sweden when Sweden and Portugal did not make peace with France This led to the annexation of Finland by Russia and decisive failure for Sweden In 1811 France and Russia made disagreements again and Napoleon allied with Prussia and Austria and invaded Russia

Napoleon staged a French invasion of Russia in 1812 just when the United States and England started the War of 1812 He quickly captured the cities on his way and finally occupied and burned the Russian capital Moscow However he found Moscow to be a city with no people because the Russian general Kutuzov had taken all the Russians out of Moscow Now that it was winter Napoleons Grande Armee were freezing to death and had to retreat to Paris but was defeated by the Russians Prussia and Austria later declared war after Napoleons failure beginning the War of the Sixth Coalition In the latter 19th century Leo Tolstoys novel War and Peace and Peter Ilyich Tchaikovskys music piece 1812 Overture celebrated the invasion of Russia

The English Spanish and Portugese had pushed Napoleons forces out of Spain following the Battle of Viotoria The Allies defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig and captured Paris in 1814 The brother of the formerly executed Louis XVI and self proclaimed French king Louis XVIII was sent by the Prussian forces to Paris and crowned Bourbon king Napoleon was forced to abdicate

Napoleon was later exiled to Elba and was nearly assassinated But then he and 200 other men escaped back to Paris and forced Louis XVIII off the throne beginning Hundred Days The former Coalition members formed the Seventh Coalition and the Duke of Wellington of Great Britain defeated Napoleon again at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 Louis XVIII was returned to the throne again and the Second Restoration began

The Etruscans were people in North Italy who became part of Rome Many of the Gods below became part of the Roman pantheon

Very little Etruscan writing has survived Only two short incomplete texts and some grave inscriptions No one can read or write the Etruscan language very well now Roman people wrote about the Etruscans but what they wrote is now lost

The main three gods were Tinia Uni and Menrva

A cantata is a type of singing which is done accompanied by an instrument By contrast acappella specifically refers to unaccompanied singing The word etymologically comes from the Italian word cantare which meant to sing The word cantata was used mainly in the 17th and 18th century to describe music with religious words that were sung by a choir or by soloists or both accompanied by instruments The most famous cantatas are those by Johann Sebastian Bach Nearly all his cantatas are sacred Very often he used Lutheran hymn tunes for the first and last movements In between there are movements for solo singers recitatives and arias A famous example is Bachs cantata no 80 which is based on the chorale Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott The whole work is about being safe in the hands of God This is what the sermon would have been about The congregation would join in singing the chorale towards the end of the cantata

Other composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti wrote cantatas which were secular The word cantata has also been used in the 20th century by composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Benjamin Britten

Thus the term came to apply to any and all forms of accompanied songs

A Clavichord is a musical instrument like a small keyboard which was very popular for many years especially in the 16th 17th and 18th centuries 

To play a note on the clavichord a key is pressed down This makes the other end of the key comes up That end has a thin metal blade called a tangent which hits the string The tangent stays on the string until the player takes his finger off the key

On some clavichords many of the strings share more than one note For example a C and C sharp might share the same string The tangent of the C sharp will be slightly nearer the bridge than that of the C This is the part of the string that vibrates So C and C sharp could not be played together Clavichords like these were called fretted If each string had its own note it was called unfretted A fretted clavichord was smaller and cheaper to make as fewer strings were needed

On a piano once a note has been played the sound cannot be changed any more All the player can do is hold it down and allow the note to fade in sound On a clavichord the player can shake the key up and down and this will make the tangent push the string up and down a little making it tighter or looser This was called Bebung in German It is like vibrato on a string instrument

The clavichord is a very quiet instrument It was not suitable for playing with other instruments because it was so quiet But it sounds very beautiful in slow expressive music It was used as a practice instrument by harpsichord players or by organists who wanted to practise at home instead of in a church They were so small that they could be lifted up and put on a table They could be put one on top of another so that an organist could practise music written for a two manual organ Sometimes they even had pedals for organists to practise their pedalling

Many German composers like Johann Sebastian Bach wrote music for the Clavier This meant any keyboard instrument harpsichord clavichord or organ The player could choose which they wanted to use

When the piano suddenly became popular in the 1760s and 1770s people started to forget about harpsichords and clavichords Today a few people make harpsichords and clavichords again so that those who want to can play Renaissance and Baroque music  the music from when the clavichord was popular

Harmony means playing several notes together to make chords The word comes from the Greek harmonia meaning to join things up  A tune by itself can sound nice but it can be harmonized by adding an accompaniment of chords Studying how to do this is called harmonization Music students learn which chords sound nice after one another These are called chord progressions Many music theorists have written books about harmony

Music which is made of a tune with harmony underneath is called homophonic In a way it is the opposite of polyphonic which means that each part is a tune in itself However even polyphony needs to make pleasant harmony Harmony as we know it in European music had become fully developed by the Baroque period

One can play a chord with three notes using the 1st 3rd and 5th notes of the scale of the whatever key the music is in This gives a chord which sounds like the home chord This means that at least three notes are needed for harmony In most homophonic music there are four for example a choir will normally divide into soprano alto tenor and bass or a string quartet will divide into violin 1 violin 2 viola and cello

Harmony which uses just the notes of the key is called tonal harmony

Harmony which adds lots of extra sharps and flats is called chromatic harmony

If music is not in any key at all like in some music by Arnold Schoenberg it is atonal Harmony can be atonal

A bow is a weapon used to shoot arrows It is used in hunting sport and a long time ago war

The use of a bow is called archery A person who uses a bow is an archer someone who makes arrows is a fletcher and a person who makes bows is a bowyer

A bow is made up of a long curved stick and a string which is tied to both ends Ancient bows were made of natural materials like wood or bone and sinew but today they are often made of plastic and similar materials

To shoot a bow the arrow is put on the bow with one end to the string which is pulled back When the string is let loose it throws the arrow forwards

There are many different types of bows for example the longbow or the automatic crossbow

Nuclear physics is the part of physics that studies the nucleus of the atom Everything on the earth is made up of atoms they are the smallest part of a chemical element that still has the properties of that specific element When two or more atoms combine they create what we know as the molecule which is the smallest part of a chemical compound which still has the properties of that specific compound Understanding the structure of atoms is key in studies such as physics chemistry biology etc 

Atoms are made up of electrons neutrons and protons The protons and neutrons are in the center of the atom which is called the nucleus The protons and neutrons are the heaviest part of the atom and make up most of its mass The electrons move around the nucleus very quickly making what is called an electron cloud The electron cloud has a very small mass but it makes up most of the space of the atom The electrons have a negative charge and the protons have a positive charge Due to the charges in the atom that is how the atom stays together by attraction of the electric charges present in the atom

Atoms have different features that single out one atom from another and show how each atom can change in different conditions These properties include atomic number mass number atomic mass and weight and isotopes

In an atom there are three fundamental forces that keep atoms together electromagnetic force strong force and weak force The electromagnetic force keeps the electrons attached to the atom The strong force keeps the protons and neutrons together in the atom The weak force controls how the atom decays 

In the early 20th century scientists had trouble explaining the behavior of atoms using their current knowledge of matter So to deal with this they made a brand new way to view matter and energy and they called it quantum theory Quantum theory explains how matter acts both as a particle and a wave

Atoms emit radiation when their electrons lose energy and drop down to lower orbitals The difference in energy between the orbitals determines the wavelength of the given radiation This radiation can be shown by visible light or shorter wavelengths

The Seljuk Empire was an empire of the Seljuk Turks a Muslim dynasty that ruled parts of Central Asia and the Middle East from the 11th to the 14th centuries The Seljuk Empire stretched from Anatolia to Pakistan

Central Asia is a region in Asia The countries in Central Asia are Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Uzbekistan Turkmenistan and Tajikistan The United Nations also includes Afghanistan and Pakistan as part of Central Asia

People have lived in the region of Central Asia since prehistoric times Most of the region was part of the Silk Road It was a part of the Persian Empire until Alexander The Great captured it When he died the land was given to his general Seleucus Seleucus slowly lost it to the Parthians When the Parthians lost power the Sassanids added it to their own Persian empire However a couple years later during about the 600s AD Arab armies spreading the faith of Islam quickly captured it A while later an Iranian dynasty got semi autonomy under the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad They were known as the Samanids The Samanids controlled most of Central Asia and Northwestern Iran They had power over this area during the 10th century With them Central Asian cities such as Bukhara and Samarkand grew in culture However Turkish armies from this area took the region away from them They were known as the Seljuk Turks At the same time Timur captured it After his death the Timurids could not hold unto their empire They lost it to the Mongols When the Mongols captured it burned it to the ground A while later some rulers decided to make their own empires under that of the Mongols These empires were known as Khanates But the Russians decided to take away these lands Many years later in 1991 all of the countries of Central Asia declared independence

Uzbekistan has much cotton Kazakhstan is wealthy because it has sold oil gas and metals to Europe and China Turkmenistan has adjusted better to independence from the Soviet Union than the other Central Asian countries but it has been run by a dictatorship Other than Kazakhstan most of Central Asia are mostly underdeveloped 

Turkestan means Land of the Turks and is a region in Central Asia

Mesoamerica is a geographical region It begins from around the Tropic of Cancer in central Mexico and ends near Costa Rica The term is especially used to mean the native peoples and cultures that were there before the Spanish took over that region

The cathode ray tube or CRT was invented by Karl Ferdinand Braun It is the display device that was used in most computer monitors and televisions before LCD and plasma screens started being used

A cathode ray tube is an electron gun It is a vacuumed glass container with a cathode at one end The heater is like a light bulb It heats up and gives out electrons The cathode repels the electrons towards the screen because they have the same charge The anodes attract and speed the electrons up because they have the opposite charge

When these electrons hit the phosphor screen they cause that small part of the screen to light up The 4 plates move the electrons up down left and right onto a spot on the screen

CRTs can also be used as particle accelerators

Recitative is music which is telling a story quite quickly as if it were being spoken The word means to recite ie to tell a story

Recitative is used in opera oratorio and cantatas When opera was invented around 1600 the composers needed to tell the story in music In recitative the story is sung quickly with maybe just a harpsichord playing a few chords After a while the situation in the story has changed and the singer can sing an aria which is more interesting musically

When recitative is just accompanied by a keyboard instrument it is called recitativo secco Sometimes the orchestra joins this This is called recitativo accompagnato There are no bar lines in recitative because there is no regular beat

tative is simple musically it can sometimes describe the words being sung in quite interesting or amusing ways Sometimes this might be improvised by the harpsichordist

In the 19th century the difference between aria and recitative gradually disappeared Wagner wrote operas where everything had musical interest and the various sections flowed into one another

Ancient India had a long lived civilization and culture It covered several countries including the Republic of India Pakistan and Bangladesh 

The Indus Valley Civilization flourished from about 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE It marked the beginning of the urban civilization on the subcontinent It was centred on the Indus River and its tributaries The civilization is famous for its cities that were built of brick had a road side drainage system and multi storied houses

In the Christian religion the Trinity is an idea used to explain that three different people are called God in the Bible God the Father God the Son and God the Holy Spirit Trinity states that these three people all form the same God

The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church describes the Trinity as the central dogma of Christian theology

Before the idea was made dogma at the First Council of Nicaea there were also other ideas on how to solve the problem These included

The English word Trinity comes from Latin Trinitas meaning the number three a triad This abstract noun is formed from the adjective trinus as the word unitas is the abstract noun formed from unus

The corresponding word in Greek is meaning a set of three or the number three

The first recorded use of this Greek word in Christian theology was by Theophilus of Antioch in about 170 He did not speak about the Trinity of god He wrote In like manner also the three days which were before the luminaries are types of the Trinity of God and His Word and His wisdom And the fourth is the type of man who needs light that so there may be God the Word wisdom man 

Tertullian a Latin theologian who wrote in the early third century was the first to use Trinity person and substance to explain that the Father Son and Holy Spirit are one in essence not one in Person 

About a century later in 325 the First Council of Nicaea established the doctrine of the Trinity as orthodoxy and adopted the Nicene Creed that described Christ as God of God Light of Light very God of very God begotten not made being of one substance with the Father

Most Christians worship God in the form of the Trinity In the Old Testament there are several places where there seems to be evidence for a Trinity Genesis 126 states that God said Let us make man in our image Deuteronomy 64 states that The Lord our God is one Lord The word that has been translated as one can also be translated as united  

The Trinity is also implied in the New Testament though that term is not used Jesus never explained it fully in his teaching to people but made a number of claims to be God The disciple John was one of Jesus best friends on Earth so understood Jesus better than many other people He starts his gospel by saying In the beginning was the Word The Word was with God and the Word was God He calls Jesus the Word because Jesus was how God told people about himself In John 858 Jesus said before Abraham was even born I AM I AM is what God said his name was to Moses meaning that he is always there anywhere in time or space In John 1030 and 1038 he tells people The Father and I are one and the Father is in me and I am in the Father Lastly he forgave people for sins which only God can do

When Jesus came the early Christians had to make sense of the fact that God had come among them through the power of the Holy Spirit Matthew wrote in his gospel Go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit Several things in the gospel of John are often thought to point to a God who is more than just one being The three persons of God are also mentioned in the second book of Corinthians

It was several hundred years after the life of Jesus before many Christians accepted the idea that God was a Trinity It was a difficult idea because the Hebrew scriptures talk about God being One The Greeks and the Romans could only understand Christ as a person who was bringing Gods Word It was not until the 4th century that the three were recognised as being the three parts of one whole God This was decided by the Council of Nicaea in 325 By the end of the century all Christians had come to believe in God as a Trinity

In the 5th century Saint Patrick brought Christianity to Ireland There is an old Irish legend which says that Patrick used the shamrock to explain the idea of the Trinity The shamrock has three small leaves Patrick told the people that the three leaves represented God the Father God the Son and God the Holy Spirit He said that the whole plant represented God 

In Christian churches the Sunday after Pentecost is called the Feast of the Holy Trinity This feast probably started in the 10th century In 1334 Pope John XXII made it official for the whole church In the Anglican and Lutheran churches the weeks that follow The Feast of the Trinity are dated  according to how many weeks after Trinity they are In the Roman liturgy these Sundays are dated after Pentecoste

Phobos is the larger of the two moons and is only 27 kilometers in diameter This is about as far as a car can travel on the highway in 15 minutes It is covered with craters as Earths moon is

It is named after the god Phobos in Greek mythology Its name means fear

Phobos is trapped into tidal drag and its lowering orbit roughly 18 meters per century In about 50 million years Phobos is likely to collide into Martian atmosphere or get torn apart and form some ring systems around Mars

The other moon Deimos is the smaller of the two

The Russians have sent at least two space craft to this moon Phobos 1 and Phobos 2 Both failed or lost contact with Earth but Phobos 2 managed to take some pictures of the moon

Charon is a moon of the dwarf planet Pluto It is half the size as Pluto and is much like the dwarf planet itself It was discovered much later after Pluto

It is named after Charon in Greek mythology a boatman who would carry the souls of dead people across the river Acheron to the underworld

Charon was found by astronomer James Christy on June 22 1978 when he was looking at highly blown up picture of Pluto on a photographic plate that taken a couple of months before Christy noticed that a slight bulge was able to be seen every now and then This finding was made public on July 7 1978 Later the bulge was confirmed on plates dating back to April 29 1965

Later observations of Pluto were able to figure out that the bulge was due to a smaller body The orbit of the bulge fit in with Plutos rotation period which was already known from Plutos light curve 

Any final doubts were erased when Pluto and Charon entered a five year period of mutual eclipses between 1985 and 1990 This happens when the Pluto Charon orbital plane is edge on as seen from Earth which only happens at twice in Plutos 248 year orbital period It was very lucky that one of these intervals happened to occur so soon after Charons discovery

Pictures showing Pluto and Charon as separate disks were taken for the first time by the Hubble Space Telescope in the 1990s Later after a new technology called adaptive optics was discovered it was possible to see Pluto and Charon as separate disks using ground based telescopes

In mythology Charon was the ferryman of Hades He was the son of Erebos and Nyx 

Charon took the newly dead people across the river Acheron to the Greek underworld if they paid him three obolus Because of this people in Ancient Greece were always buried with a coin under their tongue and one on each eye to pay Charon Those who could not pay him had to wander the banks of the Acheron for one hundred years

Don Bradman often called The Don was an Australian man who played cricket He was a batsman When he played his last Test match he only needed to score four runs to have a batting average of 100 runs over the whole of his Test Match career But he was out for a duck after facing only two balls so his average was 9994 which was still much higher than any other batsmans average Most cricket experts think he was the best batsman of all time He was a great hero in Australia and he was voted the greatest Australian of the 20th century

Before the first match of the tour England had not told Australia what they were going to do but when England named 5 fast bowlers It was not usual to have so many fast bowlers in one team so Bradman knew that England were about to try something new The new way of bowling was first tried in a warm up match which Bradman played in and as expected Bradman struggled Bradman did not play in the first Test Match of the tour which led some people to think this was because his had suffered a nervous breakdown England still tried their new way of bowling and won the match but the Australian team were not happy

Australian newspapers described this way of bowling as bodyline because the balls were often aimed fast at the body They felt that this bowling was unfair and dangerous as in 1930s batsman did not wear helmets Despite this the tour carried on and in the second Test Match Bradman returned In the first australian innings Bradman was bowled first ball Bradman guessed that the ball was going to be bounced high so he moved to one side and swung the bat so he could score a boundary The ball did not bounce as high as Bradman thought and it hit the stumps This was the first time he had been out on the first ball in his career at that point The crowd were shocked as they were used to seeing Bradman easily score hundreds Bradman had a better second innings and scored 103 runs With good bowling from Australian bowlers Bill OReilly and Bert Ironmonger this score helped Australia win the second match Australia were happy as they thought that they had beaten what they felt was unfair bowling

England won the last 3 test matches still bowling bodyline Bradman changed the way he batted a lot to try to score runs In bodyline England put a lot of fielders on the leg side so Bradman had the idea of moving backwards to hit the ball on the off side where there were few fielders This was not a normal way of playing but this helped him to get 5657 runs on average per innings in the tour Jack Fingleton thought that this tour changed Bradmans way of batting for the rest of his career

Bradman was married to Jessie Martha Menzies for 65 years until Jessie died in 1997 Bradman said on many occasions how important his wife was once saying I would never have achieved what I achieved without Jessie Don and Jessie Bradman had 3 children but family life was difficult Their first child died young in 1936 Their second child had a health problem called polio and their third child had cerebral palsy since birth

An overture is a piece of music for the orchestra to play at the beginning of an opera or ballet The word comes from the French word for opening because it opens the show

Overtures usually have tunes which are going to be heard during the opera or ballet In this way it prepares the audience for what is to come

Many overtures in the 18th century were simply background music to get the audiences attention Some composers like Gioacchino Rossini used the same overture again and again for his next operas or just changed bits of it

Composers like Christoph Willibald Gluck and later Richard Wagner were very careful to make the overture a dramatic beginning which prepared the audience for the story Wagner often called his overtures Vorspiel

Not all composers wrote overtures to their operas Giuseppe Verdi and Giacomo Puccini often go straight into the first act or they just have a very short prelude

In the 19th century many Romantic composers wrote concert overtures These pieces did not belong to any opera or ballet they were just written to be heard at concerts  They often had a descriptive title because they told some sort of story eg Felix Mendelssohn wrote an overture Fingals Cave which describes the sea coming into the cave in the Hebrides islands Sometimes these descriptive pieces were much longer than an overture so they were called tone poems

Pooles harbour is the second biggest in the world after Sydney in Australia but the water in Poole is very shallow which means that very big ships can not go into Poole It was used in World War II for some ships to set off for France on D Day

People have lived in Poole for 2000 years There were lots of Celtic people there Archaeologists found a boat in the harbour which they think was made in 295 BC When the Romans invaded Britain in the 1st century they landed in Poole In the Norman Conquest in 1066 Poole was used mostly for fishing but then became a port for trading things like wool In the 18th century Poole was one of the biggest ports in England

The harbour stopped being so useful because big boats could not get in so they went to places like Liverpool Southampton and Plymouth Even though the harbour can not be used that well due to the shallowness of the sea it is very beautiful and peaceful for people

Gorillas sleep in nests that they build on the ground At the end of each day each adult gorilla will spend a few minutes putting together a soft flat bed made of leaves branches and moss The young gorillas sleep with their mothers

The gestation period of a gorilla lasts between eight and ten months Gorillas almost always produce one offspring  twins are rare Gorilla babies begin to hang onto their mothers when they are only a few hours old and will continue to do so for the next three years Gorillas live up to 50 years in the wild and up to 54 years in captivity

The Emperor or Kaiser Wilhelm II went into exile in the Netherlands The new Republic was declared even before the end of World War I

Constantine I was a powerful general who reigned over the Roman Empire as emperor until his death He made the previously named city Byzantium capital of the whole Roman Empire As emperor he named the city Constantinople which means City of Constantine in Greek

Before Constantine became Emperor he was fighting for the throne at the Battle of Milvian Bridge When he saw a cross in the sky with the words in hoc signo vinces he changed his deity from Apollo to Jesus and won the battle 

In pagan Rome before this it had been against the law to believe in Christianity and Christians had been tortured or killed but Constantine made sure that this stopped and that they were given their property back He went on to organize the whole Catholic Church at the Council of Nicea even though he himself did not get baptized until near the end of his life

Constantine was also a big part of the beginning of the Orthodox religion after changing the point from which he ruled from Rome to Byzantium

Constantine is perhaps best known for being the first Christian Roman emperor His rule changed the Church greatly In February 313 Constantine met with Licinius in Milan where they made the Edict of Milan The edict said that Christians could believe what they wanted This stopped people from punishing Christians who had often been martyred It also returned the property which had been taken away from them The edict not only protected Christians but all religions allowing anyone to worship whatever they wanted In 311 Galerius had made a similar edict though it did not return any property to them 

Constantine did not support Christianity alone though After winning the Battle of the Milvian Bridge an arch was built to celebrate but the arch was decorated with pictures of sacrifices to gods like Apollo Diana or Hercules but did not have any Christian symbolism In 321 Constantine said that Christians and non Christians should all join the day of the sun His coins also had symbols of the sun cult until 324 Even after pagan gods disappeared from the coins Christians symbols never appeared on the coin either Even when Constantine dedicated the new capital of Constantinople he was wearing the Apollonian sun rayed Diadem

Cleopatra Queen of Egypt was one of the most famous women in history Her name was Cleopatra VII Philopator She was the last of the Pharoahs set up in Egypt by Alexander the Great By descent she was a Macedonian Princess After her death Egypt became the Roman province of Aegyptus

The main historical source for her life is Plutarchs Life of Antony available in translations Antony and Cleopatra is the famous tragedy by William Shakespeare believed to have been written sometime between 1603 and 1607 It was first printed in 1623 

Cleopatra was born in Alexandria then the capital of Egypt When she was 18 years old her father who was king died She and her brother Ptolemy XIII became the leaders of Egypt She was queen and her brother was king Her brother was only 12 years old so she was the real leader 

Cleopatra made some enemies amongst the courtiers The reign of Cleopatra was ended by a cabal of courtiers led by the eunuch Pothinus They removed Cleopatra from power and made Ptolemy sole ruler in about 51 to 48 BC She had to leave the country Ptolemy was king but because he was still a boy Pothinus and his friends were the real leaders of Egypt

At that time two Roman generals were fighting to be the leaders of the Roman Republic They were Pompey and Julius Caesar Julius Caesar defeated Pompey at the Battle of Pharsalus in Greece 48 BC Pompey fled to Egypt from Pharsalus and was murdered by the orders of Ptolemy 

Ptolemy and his supporters thought Caesar would be pleased but that was a big mistake Caesar had pardoned many of the senators who fought against him His reason was to lay the ground for peace in Rome The murder of Pompey cut right across Caesars plans Worse Pompey was a Roman Consul and the widower of Caesars only daughter Julia Worse still Pompey was beheaded in front of his fifth wife and children who were on the ship from which he had just disembarked This made sure that Pompeys powerful family and supporters would never forget and would always be enemies of Caesar

Then Caesar came to Alexandria the capital of Egypt Economically Egypt was a bread basket which could feed the people of Rome Cleopatra received Caesar in her own unique way She lay down on a carpet Then her servants rolled up the carpet with Cleopatra inside Then the carpet was taken to the palace where Caesar was staying The guards saw some people carrying a carpet and they did not stop them They carried the carpet to Caesar Then Cleopatra came out of the carpet Caesar fell in love with her and they became lovers At the time Cleopatra was 21 years old and Caesar was 52 years old

Caesar decided to make Cleopatra queen again Ptolemy did not like that There was a lot of fighting but Caesar won Ptolemy tried to leave but he fell in the river Nile and drowned Another younger brother became king but Cleopatra was again the real leader of Egypt Cleopatra did not marry Julius Caesar but they did have a son He was called Caesarion 

Soon after Caesarion was born Caesar was murdered as he walked to the Senate in Rome Cleopatra and her entourage were in Rome when Caesar was assassinated on 15 March 44 BC Cleopatra fled back to Egypt

Mark Antony who was Caesars military commander and Octavian Caesars legal heir defeated the group which had conspired against Caesar This group was led by Brutus and Cassius who took their army to the Eastern Mediterranean and controlled much of that area The issue was finally settled by the Battle of Philippi fought in Macedonia

Caesars place was taken by three joint Consuls the Second Triumvirate Their names were Octavian Mark Antony and Lepidus Lepidus was a minor character and the long term fate of the Empire was decided by a conflict between Antony and Octavian Mark Antony came to see Cleopatra and they fell in love though Antony already had a wife Cleopatra had three more children Two were twins and the father of all three was Mark Antony 

The conflict between Octavian and Antony became serious and soon there was war Cleopatra was wealthy and she used her money to help Antony But Octavian won the war He became the ruler of the Roman Empire and was known as Augustus or Caesar Augustus He took control of Egypt from Cleopatra After her kingdom was conquered she committed suicide by letting an asp bite her Antony also committed suicide 

Ceasarion was murdered by Octavian and her other children were taken as prisoners to Rome Two of them died of illness but her daughter Cleopatra Selene II married an African King Juba II of Numidia The couple were sent to Mauritania to rule by Octavian They lived a full life there and had children

There are many stories told of how rich Cleopatra was but we cannot be sure if these are true For example one story says that she took baths in milk to make her skin softer Another story says that she made a bet with Antonius that she could make the most expensive meal ever To win the bet she took a pearl earring and melted it in vinegar and drank it

Maurice Ravel was a French composer His name is often thought of together with that of Claude Debussy but their music is really very different Ravel liked children and animals and his music is often about them He liked to write about fairy tales and stories from far away lands He wrote some lovely piano music most of which is difficult to play Bolro is a 17 minute piece for orchestra A short version was used by ice skaters Torvill and Dean for the dance that made them Olympic champions in 1984

Maurice Ravel was born in Ciboure in France His father was an engineer Both parents were interested in culture Soon after he was born the family moved to Paris and stayed there

It soon became clear that Maurice was musically gifted so his father arranged for him to have piano lessons with a well known teacher In 1889 he entered the Paris Conservatoire

In 1889 there was a big international exhibition the Paris World Exhibition Ravel and Debussy both heard gamelan music from Java at this exhibition They were both influenced by it especially Debussy Ravel also heard Russian music at concerts given by Rimsky Korsakov He also made friends with a very talented Spanish pianist Ricardo Vies who was in the same class at the Conservatoire He heard the music of Richard Wagner and got to know the composers Chabrier and Satie

He left the Conservatoire in 1895 but went back in 1897 to study composition with Gabriel Faur and counterpoint and orchestration with Andre Gdalge At this stage Ravel was not sure of himself as a composer His first work that was to become very well known was the short piece for orchestra called Pavane pour une infante dfunte Faur had been a very good teacher for Ravel who dedicated his virtuoso piano piece Jeux deau and his String Quartet to Faur However Ravel never got a prize for composition so he left Faurs class in 1903

Ravel was starting to live the life of a dandy He always dressed very smartly and got to know people with similar tastes He tried to win the Prix de Rome in 1904 and again in 1905 However the judges liked traditional music and did not understand Ravels style There was a big argument at the Conservatoire which led to the director Dubois resigning and Faur taking his place Meanwhile Ravel left Paris for a time with some friends and started writing some of his best compositions These included Introduction and Allegro for seven instruments including harp the Rapsodie espagnole for orchestra his first opera Lheure espagnole and Gaspard de la Nuit a virtuoso piece for the piano In Paris the music critics continued to argue about Ravels music

In 1909 the Ballets Russes visited Paris They were the worlds most famous ballet group Their director Diaghilev asked Ravel to write a ballet for them Ravel took about three years to compose the music for Daphnis et Chlo Other works he completed before the war broke out include Shhrazade for soprano and orchestra and the Piano Trio

When World War I broke out Ravel felt very strongly that he wanted to do something for his country However he was not allowed to join the French army because he was 2 kg underweight So he became a driver for the motor transport corps In 1916 he became ill with dysentery After a time in hospital he was taken back to Paris to get better but then his mother died and this had a terrible effect on him The war years had slowed him down as a composer He had composed Le Tombeau de Couperin which looks back to the style of music in the Baroque period It took him a long time to finish La Valse one of his most popular pieces

After the war had ended Debussy was dead and Ravel was seen to be the greatest living French composer He was offered the award of Lgion dhonneur but he would not accept it He bought himself a house outside Paris Here he could compose in peace and quiet He wrote his opera Lenfant et les sortileges and the famous virtuoso piece for solo violin called Tzigane He toured in Europe and the United States and was welcomed everywhere as a great composer He was given an honorary doctorate at Oxford University

Ravel worked on several things some ballet music which resulted in the orchestral piece Bolro a Piano Concerto in G that could be played just with the left hand and several other projects which were not finished

In 1932 he started to become ill For several years he had already been finding it difficult to sleep and this may have been the beginning of the brain disease which would finally kill him A road accident in 1932 made it worse Soon he could no longer sign his own name he could hardly move and hardly speak He had a brain operation in 1937 but he died

Ravel was a very private man We know nothing about his sexual life His music came to him during walks on his own in the country or in Paris often at night and in any weather Then he would come home and write them down He worked at each composition until it was perfect and never showed it to anybody until it was ready He liked to collect little things such as toys and these objects often became part of the music Baroque music forms gamelan music Spanish music ancient modes and unusual harmonies were all important in his musical style He only had a few pupils including Vaughan Williams but no one could imitate his music because it is always so personal full of perfection and humour

Jean Philippe Rameau was a French composer He is famous for his music for harpsichord and for his operas His most well known operas are Hippolyte et Aricie Castor et Pollux and Dardanus He is also known for his one act opera Pigmalion which he is said to have composed in 8 days He is also known as an important music theorist by writing many books on the matter

Bedich Smetana was a Czech composer He was a Romantic composer Smetana Dvok and Leo Janek are the three most famous composers who wrote Czech nationalist music His music is typical of the Czech people His eight operas are about Nationalist stories He wrote six tone poems for orchestra called Ma Vlast which means My Home Country

Bedich was the 11th child in a German speaking family although he was only the first of the children not to die before they grew up His father was a brewer and a keen amateur violinist He learned the violin from his father and the piano from local teachers but he soon played better than his teachers Between the age of 12 and 20 he had no musical education Then he went to Prague and heard Liszt playing He wanted to leave school and study music but his father would not let him He was sent to Plze where he finished his schooling During this time he earned some money by playing the piano at the homes of rich people He played for dancing and he liked to dance himself He often danced with a girl called Kateina Kolov and he also played piano duets with her Later she married him

He returned to Prague and arranged to have lessons in harmony counterpoint and composition He gave a piano recital but nobody came to listen so he decided to start a school of music although he hardly had any money

In 1848 revolutions were taking place in central Europe including in Prague A strong feeling of nationalism was growing The Czechs wanted to be able to express themselves in their own language instead of in German which was still the official language in Bohemia Smetana who only spoke German agreed with the nationalists ideas but he still did not realize how important it would be for him in the future to be able to speak Czech 

Smetana married Kateina and they had four daughters but three of them died He still had very little money so he went to Sweden where he was very successful as a piano teacher and conductor He composed the first of his symphonic poems Richard III After three years in Sweden he decided to return to his homeland because of his Kateinas health but she died on the way Smetana spent two more years in Sweden He married again After the Austrian defeat by Napoleon III in 1859 it became clear that there were going to be big changes in his native country The Czechs were going to be allowed to have a national opera and put on plays in the Czech language instead of having to perform everything in German Smetana realized that this was an exciting chance for him After a big farewell concert in Stockholm to which the Swedish royal family came Smetana returned to Prague

Smetana now started to learn Czech a language he did not speak It was not easy for him in Prague because he was only known there as a pianist and teacher He put on a concert of music by German composers but nobody came He wanted to be director of the Provisional Theatre but the job was given to a man called Mayr who was not very good

Gradually Smetanas reputation grew and he started to write operas in Czech which became very popular The first one was called The Brandenburgers in Bohemia Mayr made things very difficult for Smetana but the audience loved the opera and it was performed ten more times His next opera is the one which has become his best known opera internationally The Bartered Bride Smetana got the job of director of the Provisional Theatre instead of Mayr Smetana made lots of improvements introducing well known German French and Italian operas to the audiences as well as new operas by young Czech composers The operas Dalibor was first performed on the day that the first stone was laid for the building of the National Theatre It was a great occasion although the music critics were unkind and said that his music sounded too much like Wagner His opera Libue was written for the coronation of Franz Joseph in Prague but that coronation never happened so the opera was not performed for another ten years when the National Theatre was opened He spent several years composing a cycle of six symphonic poems called Ma Vlast These are very popular today especially the second one Vltava which describes the river Vltava flowing from its source all the way to the sea

In his last years Smetana became totally deaf He was suffering from syphilis He heard horrible high squeaks in his ears a lot of the time He showed this when composing his String Quartet no 2 the first violin plays a very long high note for a long time in the last movement showing the audience what he had to suffer He became very depressed and his wife did not help by quarrelling a lot with him It became painfully difficult for him to compose In the end he was writing four bars a day His mental state got worse He was guarded all day in case he harmed himself He did not recognize his own family He was put in an asylum where he died shortly afterwards

As soon as the Czech people were allowed to produce plays and operas in their own language Smetana thought it was his duty to write a series of nationalist operas His operas were based on the nations history and legends His symphonic cycle Ma Vlast was programme music full of heroism often describing nature and the countryside Smetana also wrote a lot for piano He was the most important Czech composer there had been at that time Smetana and Dvok were the founders of modern Czech music

Dvok was born in a village near Prague Czechoslovakia Today Prague is the capital city of the Czech Republic but in those days it was part of the Austrian Empire His father was a butcher and innkeeper He also played the zither and composed a few simple dances

The young Antonn started to have violin lessons from the village schoolmaster Soon he was playing the violin in his fathers inn in local churches and in the village band Just before his 12th birthday he left school and started to learn how to be a butcher A year later he left home to go to school in Zlonice He learned a lot about music there and he also learned German His teacher persuaded Dvoks parents that he should have a musical career so they sent him to study music in Prague at the Organ School He continued to learn German and he became a good viola player and played in concerts and in the Estates Theatre when they needed a big orchestra for Wagners operas Lohengrin and Tannhuser

When Dvok had finished his studies he got his first job playing in a band in restaurants and for balls This was a time when there was suddenly a great interest in national culture in Bohemia Plays and operas were allowed to be performed in the Czech language The band he played with became part of the Bohemian Provisional Theater Orchestra which from 1866 was conducted by Bedich Smetana Dvok was principal viola player in the orchestra He earned extra money by teaching and he started to compose

In 1871 he left the orchestra so that he could spend more time composing For several years he still had to teach in order to earn enough money to live He wrote a cantata The heirs of the White Mountain which was a great success In 1874 he wrote an opera King and Charcoal Burner but the opera house did not want it This made Dvok realize that he had to be more self critical He destroyed a lot of his compositions which he thought were not his best works He decided he must not compose like Wagner but that he needed to find his own style of composing

In 1873 he married He got a job as church organist His Third Symphony was performed at a concert conducted by Smetana Dvok rewrote his opera King and Charcoal Burner using completely different music It was performed in 1874 He composed a lot more music

In 1877 he had a letter from Hanslick to say that he had won a prize of 600 gulden and that the great composer Johannes Brahms was interested in his music His music started to be published by Simrock a well known German music publisher and his music was performed in many countries even as far away as New York His fame spread Even his operas were performed abroad Dimitrij was particularly successful Brahms was a great friend and helped him a lot Brahms and Hanslick tried to persuade him to move to Vienna because it was a great musical city but Dvok wanted to stay in his own country

Dvoks Slavonic Dances were published in 1878 and have always been very popular The conductor Hans Richter conducted the Slavonic Rhapsody no 3 in Vienna His Stabat Mater was performed abroad and Dvok was invited to visit England in 1884 He became very popular in England and went there many times The English choirs liked to sing his choral works His Requiem Mass was given its first performance in Birmingham at the Triennial Music Festival He was given an honorary degree from Cambridge University Tchaikovsky invited him to Russia in 1890

From 1892 to 1895 Dvok was the director of the National Conservatory of Music in New York City He earned a lot of money 15000 a year Dvok was interested in the music of black Americans He met the student Harry T Burleigh one of the earliest African American composers who introduced him to traditional American Spirituals

In the winter and spring of 1893 while in New York Dvok wrote his most popular work the Symphony No9 From the New World He spent the summer of 1893 with his family in the Czech speaking community of Spillville Iowa where some of his cousins lived He also composed chamber music there including a String Quartet in F which is known as the American and a Sonatina for Violin and Piano

In 1895 Dvok wrote his Cello Concerto in B minor which was to become one of his most popular works However he wanted to go back to his own country He was also not being paid all his salary He heard that he had been made an honorary member of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna He decided to return to Bohemia and continue his job as professor of composition at the Prague Conservatory

During his last years Dvok spent most of his time writing operas Rusalka is particularly popular especially the famous aria for soprano To the Moon The opera is about a fairy tale and the story is based on Hans Andersons story of the Little Mermaid In 1896 he visited London for the last time to hear the first performance of his Cello Concerto In 1897 his daughter married his pupil the composer Josef Suk 

He died in 1904 after a short illness

Dvok wrote lots of kinds of music Although he based his style on the classical forms such as those of Beethoven they also show the influence of Czech folksong He lived at a time when Nationalistic feelings were felt very strongly by the Czech people Smetana wrote music which was very Czech in character Dvok learned from Smetanas music but never imitated his style Only five of his nine symphonies were known in his life time When the other four were discovered and published in the 1960s the symphonies were all renumbered The last three symphonies numbers 7 8 and 9 are the most often performed The Ninth Symphony From the New World is one of the most popular symphonies ever written The two sets of Slavonic Dances are extremely well known They are often played as a piano duet He wrote concertos for the violin cello and piano Dvok wrote many operas chamber music songs choral music and piano music

 Leo Janek was a Czech composer who lived at the end of the Romantic period and the beginning of the 20th century He wanted his music to sound typical of his country The rhythm of Janeks music sounds like the rhythm of the dialect he spoke This was quite close to Polish Janek is famous for his operas which are all based on Czech stories The Cunning Little Vixen is especially charming It is about animals in a forest

Most of his greatest works were written towards the end of his life At this time he was in love with a young woman called Kamila She was the inspiration for many of his last compositions

Janeks family were poor people who lived in the countryside in Moravia His grandfather and his father were both musicians and school teachers Leo was the fifth of nine children As the tiny house was so crowded he was sent to Brno when he was eleven There he went to a choir school but soon the choir had to stop He continued his music education there After his final exams he had an unpaid job as teacher for two years He became conductor of a monastery choir as well as a male voice choir called Svatopluk He made them a better choir and wrote music for them He studied at the Prague Organ School for a year but he was very poor and could not afford to go to concerts He continued to conduct choirs and became friends with Dvok He spent a short time in Leipzig and Vienna

When he returned to Brno he became engaged to his piano pupil Zdenka Schulzov who was only 14 She was still under 16 when they married Janek founded an organ school in Brno He was the director of this school He also taught music at the Old Brno Gymnasium His marriage was unhappy and although they remained married all his life they spent a lot of time separated He went on a journey to northern Moravia to collect folk songs which he used in some of his dances for orchestra

Janeks spent several years writing his opera Jenfa By the time he was finishing it his daughter had died Some of his sadness can be felt in the opera He also worked on a system of speech melody which was to influence his operas for the rest of his life Jenfa was very successful when it was first performed in 1904 By this time Janek was already 50

Janek was now doing less teaching and concentrating on organizing the Brno Organ School which had moved into a new building because it now had 70 students His next opera was called Osud but it was not performed during his lifetime The music is very good but the libretto were poor This is also true of his next opera Mr Broueks excursion to the moon He wrote chamber music during this period as well as some very good choral music

When World War I broke out Janek was 60 He was well known in Moravia but hardly known in other countries His compositions from the war years include Taras Bulba which is a work for orchestra which describes a story by the Russian writer Gogol He wrote a short patriotic opera to follow Mr Broueks adventures It was about a landlord from Prague who finds himself in the middle of the 15th century Hussite wars

In his final years Janek wrote most of the great works for which he is world famous His opera Jenfa was performed in Prague This made him internationally famous He was very proud when his country became independent after the war He was also very happy because he was in love with Kamila Stsslov who was 38 years younger than himself He wrote three of his finest operas Katya Kabanov The Cunning Little Vixen and The Makropulos Affair These operas were performed in Brno and then in Prague and they were also published He wrote two string quartets and a wind sextet Mldi By the time he was 70 he had retired from the Brno Organ School In 1926 he wrote an orchestral work Sinfonietta followed by a piano concerto for the left hand and chamber ensemble and the Glagolitic Mass All these works had enormous success in Czechoslovakia as well as abroad even as far away as New York

In 1921 he had bought a cottage in his birthplace Hukvaldy He spent a lot of time composing there away from the busy life in Brno In the summer of 1928 he went there and was joined for the first time in Hukvaldy by Kamila her 11 year old boy and her husband He was working on the third act of his last opera From the House of the Dead One day Kamilas son got lost in the forest They spent some time looking for him Janek got cold he caught pneumonia and died His funeral in Brno was a large public event at which some music from his opera The Cunning Little Vixen was performed

Janek grew up in the middle of the Romantic period but most of his best music was written in 1920s by which time musical styles had changed Although he never wrote music which sounded as modern as that of Stravinsky or Schoenberg his music is Romantic combined with Moravian folksong and sometimes with ideas from French Impressionist composers such as Debussy The music he wrote for choirs often continued in his operas His music for instruments often started as programmatic although a lot of it can be enjoyed without knowing the story it tells He learned to write operas by learning from the operas of Smetana but he made many changes such as shortening the duets and ensembles and using folksong in his melodies Janek was not just important as a composer but is remembered for his studies of folk music and as a music theorist and teacher

Sir Arthur Sullivan was an English composer In his lifetime people thought he was the best British composer but nowadays his serious works are rarely heard He worked with an author and poet called W S Gilbert and together they wrote fourteen comic operas Their names are always mentioned together Gilbert and Sullivan Their operas were very popular a hundred years ago and most still are The most popular are The Mikado HMS Pinafore and The Pirates of Penzance The two men were very different They argued sometimes but they worked together for 25 years from 1871 to 1896 

Sullivans serious works include one grand opera two dozen orchestral and choral pieces and many hymns and songs including Onward Christian Soldiers and The Lost Chord

Psychosis is the name used in psychiatry for a number of conditions People who suffer from psychosis are said to be psychotic Usually psychotic people lose touch with reality they have trouble telling what is real and what is not

The word psychosis has two parts The first part comes from psyche which means soul in Ancient Greek The second part is the ending osis which means illness or unnatural condition So literally psychosis means unnatural condition of the soul 

People with psychosis may have hallucinations which means they can experience things that are not really there They may also have delusions which are fixed beliefs and ideas that are usually false Sometimes their personality changes and they cannot think straight Some of these thoughts may be paranoid Not every psychotic person has all of these problems

Because of these psychotics often act in strange ways which also makes it difficult for them to live a normal life as part of society They often have trouble with making friends as most people do not understand them 

Psychosis can affect people to different levels Some people can continue with mostly normal lives while other people will need medical help

About 1 percent of people suffer from psychosis during their livesFactdateApril 2009

There are many things that can make someone seem psychotic These include poisons drugs diseases of the nervous system and other illnesses For this reason some people use the image of a fever of the central nervous system to talk about psychosis  a serious illness that may not have a very detailed explanation 

Many people have gone through unusual experiences that they believe are real Hallucinations connected to religion or paranormal experiences seem to be quite common Very often these experiences cannot be called psychosis in a medical sense of the word For this reason some people have said that psychosis may simply be an extreme case of something that is experienced by most People who have suffered from what could be called psychosis may simply have had experiences that were very strong or distressing

In movies and the media in general certain people who are shown as violent and antisocial are sometimes labelled psychotic This image of psychosis is wrong the people shown are usually psychopaths or sociopaths they usually do not have hallucinations or delusions

Psychosis is most associated with schizophrenia bipolar disorder depression drug addiction and brain damage but it can be caused by a wide range of conditions

Psychosis is not a disease but rather a name for a number of symptoms that can be caused by different diseases and conditions Very broadly speaking there are two types of causes for psychosis

Most psychoses can be treated so that those suffering from them can lead a normal life The treatment depends on the cause of the psychosis In general there are two different forms of treatment available

Samuel Johnson was a famous writer After publishing a famous dictionary he was given a doctorate which is why he often called Dr Johnson He wrote some of his own stories but more often he wrote criticisms about what other people had written He said a lot of witty amusing things which are still remembered today We know about some of the funny things he said because his friend James Boswell wrote a book about him

Samuel Johnson was born in Lichfield Staffordshire His father had a bookshop but he was very poor Samuel went to school in Lichfield When he was nineteen he went to the University of Oxford but he was so poor that he had to leave without taking a degree A few years later he married a woman 21 years older than he was They went to live in London where he tried to make a living by writing but for many years he was very poor

It was not until 1762 that he became famous and the government gave him a pension of three hundred pounds a year He started a club which included a lot of famous people like the painter Joshua Reynolds and the writer Oliver Goldsmith Johnson was now so famous that he was given an honorary doctorate from Trinity College Dublin in 1765 and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1775

Boswell and Johnson spent some time in Edinburgh and they travelled a lot to the Scottish islands Johnson died in 1784 and is buried in Westminster Abbey

Johnson spent several years writing his Dictionary of the English language It was a big job While he was writing it he could not be earning money so he needed a patron An important man called Lord Chesterfield said to Johnson that he would be his patron But he never gave him any money and Johnson never heard anything more from him until the dictionary was ready Then Lord Chesterfield wrote to Johnson saying that he hoped he would dedicate the dictionary to him The letter that Johnson wrote back to Lord Chesterfield is very famous It is very sarcastic Johnson said to him that it would have been nice to have had help when he was needing it He said sarcastically that a patron was someone who stands on the river bank watching a man drowning and then when then the drowning man is saved asks him whether he can help The letter made Lord Chesterfield look very silly

There were very few dictionaries in Johnsons day so it was a lot of work for him Nowadays a dictionary is made by a team of people Dictionaries like encyclopedias should just give facts But Johnson sometimes explained words in his dictionary in a way that showed his opinions

Examples

Although it shows his personal likes and dislikes the dictionary still deserves to be famous Johnson defined 43000 words It was the first time a dictionary had been published that gave examples of how the words had been used by well known writers

Nozomi trains are the fastest Shinkansen bullet trains in Japan They can reach Osaka from Tokyo in 2 and a half hours The trains are called bullet trains because they travel so fast like a bullet from a gun These trains have speeds of up to 300 kmh

The second fastest Shinkansen trains is the Hikari train The third fastest Shinkansen train is the Kodama train In the Japanese language Nozomi means hope Hikari means light and Kodama means Echo

Shinkansen means New Trunk Line in Japanese because it was built with all new bridges tunnels through mountains and water and special tracks for high speed trains so it could go directly from city to city Before the Shinkansen trains in Japan were slower because they were old and had to go around many mountains or share the track with cars on road crossings

The Advanced Photo System was a technology for photographic film and cameras People started using it in the year 1996

A coral reef is a large underwater structure made of dead and living corals In most healthy reefs stony corals are predominant They are built from colonial polyps from the phylum Cnidaria which secrete an exoskeleton of calcium carbonate The reefs are formed in tropical marine areas The reef acts as the home of many tropical fish and other animals Coral reefs systems are a major tourism attraction because of their beauty and color of the corals and their many associated animals 

People look at them while snorkeling and diving One example of a coral reef is in Malaysia at Pulau Tioman off the State of Pahang

Most present day coral reefs were formed after the last ice age when melting ice caused the sea level to rise and flood the continental shelves This means they are less than 10000 years old As coral reef communities were established on the shelves they built reefs that grew upwards keeping pace with the rise in sea level Reefs that did not keep pace became drowned reefs covered by so much water that there was insufficient light for further survival

Coral reefs are also found in the deep sea away from the continental shelves around oceanic islands and as atolls The vast majority of these ocean coral islands are volcanic in origin The few exceptions have tectonic origins where plate movements have lifted the deep ocean floor on the surface

Coral reefs are fragile ecosystems Because corals need warm sunlit water to live they often grow close to the top of the water Sadly being so close to land makes them often be damaged by poisons and dirt that can come from boats and the land nearby Dirt makes the water more cloudy which makes the sunlight less Poisons can bleach and kill corals Also they are hard for ships to see but easy to hit which makes ships often run into the coral damaging both the boats and coral Because of this many countries are trying to lessen the kinds of building that usually happen near beaches that have coral reefs nearby and be more careful about the boats that go around reefs

During a final night session of the negotiations the Greens tabled a demand that Hesse join the Shanghai Fugu Agreement This was accepted by their tired Social Democratic counterparts and became official state policy

The agreement was absolutely fictional but was neither discovered to be a joke by the Social Democrats during the nightly negotiations nor later by civil servants or the press who went through the coalition contracts It took years to be discovered as the joke it was

Over 60 of the total area of the Indus basin is in Pakistan and Pakistan administered Kashmir India Administered Kashmir has about 15 Tibet has about 10 and the Republic of India and Afghanistan each have about 7 of the Indus basin catchment area The Indus water system of rivers comprises the main Indus and its major tributaries the Kabul River and Kurram River on the right bank and the Jhelum River Chenab River Ravi River Beas River and the Sutlej on the left The first two join the Indus soon after it debouches from the mountains and the others lower down in the plains The whole of the Beas and the head reaches of the Ravi and Sutlej are in the Republic of India while those of the Chenab and Jhelum lie mostly in the disputed Kashmir state The entire basin covers an area of about 384000 square miles of open land of which 204000 lie in Pakistan In addition there are about 29000 square miles which lie outside the Indus basin but are dependent on the Indus river system for their water requirements and irrigation supplies But for the Indus waters the fate of agriculture in Pakistan would have been very uncertain Even now when Pakistan is being rapidly industrialised it cannot do without its water resources for a very big percentage of its existing and proposed industry has to draw upon the agriculture produce for its raw materials Almost all of the basin in Pakistan receives an overall rainfull of less than 15 inches 60 of its area receiving less than 10 inches while 16 receives less than 5 inches The rainfull is not evenly distributed throughout the year but is concentrated during the monsoons

Rising in western Tibet the Indus runs at first across a high plateau then the ground falls away and the river dropping rapidly gathering momentum and rushing north west collects the waters from innumerable glacier fed streams and runs north west between the worlds greatest mountain ranges the Karakoram and the Himalayas In Kashmir it crosses the United Nations cease fire line and in Baltistan District enters Pakistani Kashmir or Pakistan Administered Kashmir From here on it is Pakistans river Pakistans first town on the upper Indus Skardu at 7500 feet above sea level stands on a bluff near the junction of the Indus and one of its great right bank tributaries the Shigar The majority of the people live in Skardu town others inhabit small and scattered villages along the Indus and Shigar valleys or tiny hamlets high on the surrounding mountains beside tributary streams or springs

Walnuts grow along the Indus near Skardu and poplars and apples there are delicious melons and nectarines and apricots in the valley of Shigar but it is difficult to send them down country because they are easily spoilt in transit Potatoes maize and other crops need unremitting attention the patchwork of fields must be fed by small water channels led off from the upper streams of the Indus sometimes for hundreds of yards This means endless back breaking work in moving boulders to dam icy water in continually checking adjusting and repairing the flimsy clay dykes Strong winds funnel along the river and the fine soil blows away and must be replaced At this height the growing season is short and everyman woman and child is pressed into service Below Skardu the Karakorams and Himalayas close in towards the Indus

In a brief widening of its valley the clear jade green Gilgit River foams down to meet it from the Hindu Kush These mountains stand across the Induss path and the river is forced to turn to the south west The Astor joins it from the east Reinforced the Indus twists and swirls down a trough between the Hindu Kush to the west and the huge rampart of Nanga Parbat to the east In all these upper reaches of the Indus narrow alluvial fans spill down the occasional cracks in the mountain rock Good soil is rare here and perched on their mud platforms the few villages have to fight an endless battle against erosion by wind and climate Some villages never see the sun in winter others are so scorched in summer that the inhabitants must migrate to the uplands Every village lives under threat Appalling storms are commonplace especially where the Indus begins to reach the monsoon area Sometimes in the high mountains a glacier will slide across a tributary river and hold it back to form a lake when the ice dam breaks it releases a great gush of water and reaches high up the cliffs in the Indus narrows A landslide from the foothills of Nanga Parbat has even been known to block the Indus itself temporarily and the destruction downstream through was catastrophic Avalanches of mud and boulders suddenly poured down the mountainside overwhelming people and crops in their path Most terrible of all are the earthquakes This is a geologically unstable area and there have been many earthquakes the most recent being in the autumn of 2005 also known as the Kashmir Earthquake

The Indus is dammed to provide for irrigation and for hydro electricity

The largest dam on the Indus is Tarbela Dam When it was built 100000 people had to leave their homes

American English or US English is the dialect of English language spoken in the United States It is different in some respects from other variations of English such as British English Historically many types of American English can be traced back to old local dialects of England 

Awareness of American English is greater now in many parts of the world where another form of English is more common This is partly because of peoples exposure to American English via the media for example CNN television and the Internet where the most common form of English is American English

The increasing global awareness of American English as well as other versions of English may lead to localised versions of English continuing the English language tradition of absorbing new words For example the English language spoken in India which has more than one billion people will assume more American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words adopted into English usage in India from Indian languages such as Hindi

Sometimes people will learn American English as it is spoken in America  for example in telephone call centers in India and other places people often learn American English in order to sound more like their customers who call India from America These people frequently continue to use American English in everyday life

Many word definitions are different in American English Most languages change starting with minor issues like this  for instance Italian Spanish French all came from Latin due to many small usage shifts over centuries

Compared to British English in American English

There are also some words in American English that are a bit different from British English eg

African American Vernacular English is a lect that has features of 16th century English It originated in Black Culture but may be spoken by members of any group Its pronunciations and grammar are different from Standard English It is a distinct cultural variety of English something any non native English speaker would be familiar with 

It first emerged when blacks were taken en masse from their ancestral homes to North America Sold into slavery the captives developed a way to communicate among all their various tribes In 1996 Linguists proposed using AAVE to educate black children in Oakland California They asserted that AAVE is not an Indo European language There has been a new awareness of cultural linguistics since

British English is the version of the English language which is used in the United Kingdom and some other countries British English is a redundant expression because the English language comes from England which is a part of Britain

American English is similar to English with alterations in spellings and usage of some words

In British English dock refers to the water in the space between two piers or wharfs In American English the pier or wharf could be called a dock and the water between would be a slip

Music theory is all about trying to understand how music works Someone who makes a special study of music theory is a music theorist

People who think up their own music are composers People who play or sing music are performers It is important for both composers and performers to understand what makes the music sound the way it does In the times of the Ancient Greeks the famous philosopher Pythagoras tried to explain how instruments are tuned He understood the science of the good vibrations that the instruments make and explained how and why the octave is divided into twelve parts

In the Middle Ages there were several famous music theorists who wrote books about music theory Their ideas are very interesting for us because they tell us what people thought about music at that time

In the 18th century some composers wrote books on music theory Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach wrote a book called An Essay on the true art of playing the Keyboard Leopold Mozart wrote a book called The Art of playing the Violin Both these books were extremely well known in their day In spite of their titles the first halves of these two books are both about music theory They tell us a lot about how music was played in those days how some rhythms were played quite freely and how ornaments in the music were played

Today people who want to compose will study music theory perhaps at university or music college They will study harmony and counterpoint as well as form In this way they will understand what makes a good piece of music They will be taught rules These rules are not laws they simply mean the way that most great composers wrote music If composers want to break the rules when they write their own compositions they are free to do that

Music theory is important for people who perform music because all these things help people to understand the music they are playing Anyone who takes music examinations eg from the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music will be expected to know some theory and must take the grade five theory exam before progressing to grade 6 and higher practical exams 

Learning music theory helps people to become better musicians

Ayurveda is an ancient medical science The word ayurveda is composed of two words of Sanskrit ayur and veda Thus Ayurveda is a medical science of Ancient India It deals with matters relating to health day to day life and longevity 

Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine and medication based on experience and observation This system of medicine and medication is more than 3000 years old According to mythological story Dhanvantari was the first physician to use ayurveda In modern India also Ayurveda is being used It has also reached outside India in countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia and several persons from other countries also take advantage of ayurveda

Halima Sadia was an Arabic Beduin woman She was a Wet nurse and raised up the prophet Muhammad when he was a child and took care of him for the first two years of his life The Prophet was broken wikt linkentrustedentrusted to Halimah Sadia

After Amina bent Wahb the prophets mother had delivered Muhammad it was custom at that time in Makkah that the families send their children with a Beduin nurse to be raised up in the desert because it is more healthier for their bodies and much better for them to be in contact with the nature 

So when the group of nurses arrived at the Makkah city and they picked up most of the children the last nurse arrived with her husband riding a donkey and old camel She found only one orphan boy who had no father to pay her She was ready to go back but at the same time she did not want to return back without anything So she changed her mind and decided to return back and pick that orphan 

As soon as she lifted that boy her life changed and became filled with immense good fortune and blessings Both Muhammad and the nurses child were fully fed even though the previous night and before reaching Makkah there was no milk for her child The old camel which had not given a drop of milk was soon over flowing with milk Although she was the last women leaving makkah on her donkey she passed her friends This was indeed a great blessing for her and for this poor Bedouin family

There were many signs about how Halimahs life was changed to a better days Her goats used to come home full and over flowing with milk while the rest of the Bedouins goats used to come home broken wikt linkscraggyscraggy and empty That made them to complain to the shepherd to take the sheep and goats to the same place that Halimah takes her flock Halimah knew that she had a blessed child with all the miracles and blessings 

After two years Muhammad was returned to his mother Amina She told Amina about the great blessings that she had received when Muhammad was in her care but soon Amina was persuaded by Halima and her husband to return the child back with them for another two years to protect him from a spreading disease in Makkah

After two months A strange incident happened to the prophet He was playing with his foster brother with the goats at the back of their homes when two Angels appeared to them as two men wearing white clothes The Angels laid down the prophet and opened his chest took out his heart split it and removed a blood clot and washed it and his chest with ices until they became purified Then they returned the heart back to Muhammads body before going away 

His foster brother ran to Halimah and told her that Muhammad has been murdered She rushed out and found Muhammad standing with a pale white face She checked all over his body and found that he was fine and then she took him back to their home Due to that incident she was afraid 

Later and very shortly she returned Muhammed to his mother Amina found out from Halimah about that incident that had happened She assured Halimah that Muhammad was not under the influence of any devil or jinn and she told her about the dream that she saw when she was pregnant 

Then Muhammad was returned to the care of his mother Amina and continued to live with her until she died at 577 AD when he was six years old

Khadijah bint Khuwaylid was the first wife of the Muhammad an Islamic prophet Her nickname was Khadijah al Kubra She was the daughter of Khuwaylid ibn Asad and Fatimah bint Zaidah Khadijah is widely known as the first person to convert to Islam Khadijah was known as The morher of the mothers of the faithful

Electronic music is music which is made with electronic equipment such as synthesizers or computers Sometimes electronic music artists create special sounds using tape recorders too

After World War II when tape recorders had been invented and were becoming popular composers started to use them to make music The tape recorder was needed for the performance Composers used them to combine lots of different sounds Sometimes it was music played on ordinary instruments which was then changed in some way by the tape recorder Sometimes they took sounds from everyday life such as the sound of water traffic noise or bird song All these noises were put together in the way the composer wanted by using the tape recorder Tapes of sounds were often cut into pieces then the pieces were spliced put back together in a different order The results were often very interesting but there were problems Some people asked Is it music Others thought it was boring to just look at a tape recorder during a concert instead of being able to watch live musicians play

Composers in Paris were experimenting with electronic music in the 1940s They called it Musique concrte because they used natural concrete sounds The sounds were played back at different speeds combined in lots of ways played backwards or played continuously or played into a mixer and re recorded onto another tape recorder The sounds could be filtered Effects such as vibrato or echo could be added Sometimes composers used synthesizers which were machines that could make electronic music in real time They sounded more like normal instruments than the sound effects on a tape recorder

Computers have often been used for composing electronic music

Composers who have used these ways of making music include John Cage Bruno Maderna and Karlheinz Stockhausen Very often composers combined electronic music with ordinary instruments being played

In popular music the use of electronics to create new sounds began in the 1960s Producer Joe Meek and inventor Bob Moog both expanded the range of sounds that could be used in pop music and by the end of that decade electronics had become accepted in the industry In the next few years the work of people like Giorgio Moroder Jean Michel Jarre Brian Eno and Kraftwerk made electronic music famous

In the early 1980s electronic music became fashionable and bands like New Order The Human League Pet Shop Boys and Depeche Mode became famous Sometimes these bands would mix electronic music with rock music 

In the 21st Century electronics are so much a part of popular music that using it is no longer strange  in fact many artists use nothing else

A subgenre of electronic music is electronic dance music or EDM Electronic dance music is a form of electronica which is generally made with the intention of being danced to thus making it generally club friendly and often up tempo in nature Whilst a lot of electronic genres are also classified as EDM not all forms of electronic music fall within the specific category Examples of EDM genres include post disco house techno Eurodance trance trip hop drum and bass and dubstep as well as several others

Magnetic resonance imaging or nuclear magnetic resonance imaging are techniques that doctors use to give a visual representation of soft tissue inside the body Magnetic resonance uses nuclear magnetic resonance to generate these images

To take an MRI image the patient lies on a movable bed The bed enters a strong magnetic field and then a second magnetic field is applied for a short time in a different direction This sudden shift causes certain atoms in the patients body make special signals The MRI scanner detects those special signals The MRI scanner then sends the signal information to a computer and the computer creates an image of the inner body by using the signal information

The MRI is used to diagnose disorders of the body that cannot be seen by X rays The MRI is painless and has the advantage of avoiding X ray radiation exposure It is an expensive medical procedure to have  A person who has metallic objects or implants in the body cannot generally have an MRI and if the person is obese or claustrophobic they will not be able to go in The machine can make kidney problems worse

The MRI is also used to study nerves muscles bones and many other tissues in the body MRI are very useful for finding blood clots

An MRI scan can be used as an extremely accurate method of disease detection throughout the body

Neurosurgeons use an MRI scan not only in defining brain anatomy but in evaluating the integrity of the spinal cord after trauma An MRI scan can evaluate the structure of the heart and aorta where it can detect aneurysms or tears 

It provides valuable information on glands and organs within the abdomen and accurate information about the structure of the joints soft tissues and bones of the body Often surgery can be deferred or more accurately directed after knowing the results of an MRI scan

When there is a war or some other armed conflict in a country many people will try to flee from that country They will go to other countries around the country where there is no war Because they fled they are called refugees

If there are just a few refugees coming into a country it is generally no problem to get housing for them somewhere However if there are many refugees it may build what is called a refugee camp This is usually done by putting many tents and a few toilets and showers on an unused plot of land This is usually land where no one wants to live

Usually the governments hope that conflicts get resolved soon and that those camps are only temporary

This has not been the case for the refugee camps in the Gaza Strip for example Those camps have existed since the mid 1970s ImageElley Sinai refugee camp01jpgAv refugee camp in the Gaza Strip ImageRefugee camp in GuineajpgA refugee camp in Guinea ImageRwandan refugee camp in east ZairejpgA Rwandan refugee camp in east Zaire 

Rubber is the common name of a chemical substance with the ability to shrink and stretch Technically it is a polymer naturally found as a milky liquid in the sap of several types of plants mainly Hevea brasiliensis People may also make artificial rubber from mineral oil To distinguish the tree obtained version of natural rubber from the synthetic version the term gum rubber is sometimes used Some common things made from rubber are gloves tires plugs and masks

Hevea brasiliensis is the main source of natural latex because it produces more latex after the first cuts Other plants containing latex include figs Castilla euphorbias lettuce the common dandelion Taraxacum kok saghyz Scorzonera tau saghyz and Guayule 

South America was the main source of latex rubber during much of the 19th century However in 1876 Henry Wickham gathered thousands of seeds from Brazil to Kew Gardens England and sent the to Ceylon Indonesia Singapore and British Malaya Later Malaya became the biggest producer of rubber Experimental efforts to grow rubber in India were started as early as 1873 at the Botanical Gardens Kolkata The first commercial Hevea plantations in India were established at Thattekadu in Kerala in 1902 The Congo Free State in Africa was also a significant source of natural rubber latex at the beginning of the 20th century mostly gathered by forced labor Liberia and Nigeria also started production of rubber 

Charles Marie de La Condamine presented samples of rubber to the Acadmie Royale des Sciences of France in 1736 In 1751 Franois Fresneau read a paper to the Acadmie which described many of the properties of rubber This has been referred to as the first scientific paper on rubber

In 1770 British chemist Joseph Priestley noticed that rubber was very good for removing pencil marks on paper

Natural rubber melts in heat and freeze in the cold making it useless for many productsfactdateApril 2009 In 1844 Charles Goodyear found a way to improve natural rubber in a chemical process known as vulcanization

The Hajj is the pilgrimage to Mecca where the Kaaba is The Kaaba is a large black cube in The great mosque in Mecca

The pilgrimage is one of the five most important duties a Muslim must do These duties are called the Five Pillars of Islam 

Muslims must make the Hajj at least once in a lifetime if they can afford it Usually pilgrims go on a seven day roundtrip around the religious sites The Kaaba is a holy place for Muslims and shows Muslims that each and every Muslim is equal in the eyes of God and that he or she must be willing to give up anything are do anything for him When on the pilgrimage special plain clothes should be worn Men wear two pieces of white cloth that form a robe while women wear ordinary clothes long enough to cover the body from head to foot

The Hajj differs from an ordinary pilgrimage Umrah as it can only happen at a certain time of the year The right time of the year is from the 8th to 12th day of Dhu al Hijjah the 12th month of the Islamic calendar Because the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar eleven days shorter than the Gregorian calendar used in the Western world the Gregorian date of the Hajj is eleven days earlier from year to year

An ordinary or lesser pilgrimage Umrah can be performed at any time of the year The rituals of Umrah are also performed for Hajj but there are actions that are exclusive to Hajj

The pilgrimage to Mecca is very popular as millions of Muslims visit the Islamic city each year

English Civil War is a term used in history Basically it covers a period of fighting that took place between 1642 and 1651 among England Scotland and Ireland Some people consider it to be one big war while others think it should be seen as several different wars that were linked Some of these wars and conflicts have been given their own names such as

A civil war is a war where the sides involved in the fighting are both from the same country In the period of the English Civil War the King ruled England Scotland and Wales but the fighting that took place in each of these countries broke out at different times and for several different reasons 

The reasons for the fighting were mostly to do with power money and religion

After a few years of quarrelling the members of Parliament raised an army to fight against the King The King moved out of London and took the royal court to Oxford where he had more loyal followers than in London The first war was fought between King Charless army and the army of Parliament King Charless army were sometimes called Cavaliers and the army of Parliament were sometimes called Roundheads Parliament won the first war and King Charles was put in prison but he escaped and a second war broke out Parliament won the second war also and they put King Charles on trial because they did not want any more fighting He was found guilty of treason and was executed by having his head chopped off but this did not stop the fighting 

During the war a new leader had been found by Parliament a man called Oliver Cromwell who was very good at leading an army and also had ideas about how to rule the country Not everyone liked him but he was the strongest leader and in time he became the ruler of the whole country Cromwell took the title of Lord Protector rather than King because he did not think the country needed another king In the meantime King Charles Is eldest son the Prince of Wales had left Britain and set up his own royal court in Holland calling himself King Charles II of England He came back to fight another battle against the army of Parliament A lot of his support came from Scottish people because King Charles I had been born in Scotland and there were still many Scots who were loyal to the royal family The Third Civil War was fought between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament The Civil War ended when Parliament won the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651 Charles II had to disguise himself in order to escape the country

Franz Peter Schubert was an Austrian composer Although he died at the age of 31 he composed over one thousand pieces of music Some of his works are among the greatest music ever written He wrote wonderful melodies There were other great composers who lived and worked in Vienna Haydn Mozart and Beethoven but Schubert is the only one who was born in Vienna He was the last great composer of the Classical music period and one of the first of the Romantic period

Schuberts father was a school teacher Twelve children were born into the family but only four of them lived to maturity Schuberts father tried to persuade his sons to help at the school when they grew up As a boy the young Franz learned the violin piano organ singing and harmony He soon became very good at them all His teachers were all amazed at how quickly he learned He was also very good at other subjects in school

In the holidays he played string quartets with his two brothers and his father and he wrote his first string quartets for them to play By the age of 16 he had composed a lot of music including his first symphony His mother had died and his father soon remarried His stepmother was very kind to him and often lent him money He had one strange thumb on his right hand

By the age of 17 he was teaching at his fathers school He had been rejected by the army because he was too short and his sight was very poor He still had composition lessons from Antonio Salieri and he often went to the opera where he heard some of the finest music of the time He liked reading and one of his favourite books was Goethes Faust He wrote a song called Gretchen am Spinnrade which is about the young girl in the book who is sitting at the spinning wheel dreaming of her lover The piano has a gentle accompaniment which sounds like the throbbing of the spinning wheel The music stops for a moment when the girl imagines her lover is kissing her then the piano gradually starts again It is a very famous song Another song which soon made him famous in all Europe was Erlknig When it was first published another composer whose name was also Franz Schubert thought that somebody had published a song in his name because the music publishers sent it to him for correction He sent a very angry letter back saying he had not composed that rubbish

It was difficult to find enough time to compose because he was a teacher A man called Schober persuaded Schubert to give up teaching so that he could spend all his time composing Soon he had become well known in all the drawing rooms in Vienna where he met famous people many of them musicians These meetings were called Schubertiads because they played and sung his music He wrote so many wonderful pieces that it seems strange that the music publishers did not want to publish them They were only interested in publishing works written by performers but were not very interested in people like Schubert who just composed For a time he became music teacher for the two princesses of Count Johann Esterhzy but then he returned to Vienna to live with the Schober family During the last few years of his life Schubert was ill He had to leave the Schobers house and find his own rooms He was often desperately poor and composed in bed to keep warm

Although Beethoven and Schubert lived in the same town they only met once although they knew one anothers music Schubert visited Beethoven on 19 March 1827 Beethoven was dying Schubert was one of the torch bearers at his funeral A year and a half later Schubert too had died He asked to be buried near Beethoven Their graves were just three places apart

Schuberts songs are among the greatest ever written They are all settings of German poems German art songs are called Lieder and Schubert made his Lieder very special by making the piano accompaniments describe the action of the songs in many different ways If you try to sing them in a translation it is difficult to make it sound good It is best to hear them in German and to have a translation so that you understand what is being sung Some of the last songs he wrote make up a cycle called Die Winterreise The poems are about a man who is unhappy because his lover does not want him He goes out into the cold winter woods and all nature seems to reflect the way he feels inside The songs are usually sung by a male singer

Schubert wrote a great deal of chamber music Among his most famous pieces are several string quartets a string quintet and the Trout quintet There are sonatas and sonatinas for violin and piano and a sonata for an instrument called the arpeggione which was used for about ten years after it was invented and then it was forgotten The sonata is normally played on a cello or a viola nowadays There is lots of piano music including sonatas impromptus and also piano duet music Schubert wrote eight famous impromptus

Schubert wrote nine symphonies The last one is known as the Great symphony in C major The eighth is called the Unfinished There are only two movements instead of the usual four A lot of people still argue about why he left it unfinished Some people even think that he completed it and that the last two movements are either lost or are now known as movements from a piano duet We shall probably never know for certain

Most of his life he was supported by his friends who gave him manuscript paper when he could not afford it Many of his greatest works only became widely known in the 1860s long after his death The house in Vienna where Schubert was born is now a museum which people can visit

Cowpox is a disease This disease affects the skin It is caused by a virus that is related to the Vaccinia virus People who have the disease have red blisters The disease can be spread by touch from cows to humans The virus that causes cowpox was used to perform the first successful vaccination against another disease The disease vaccinated against was the deadly smallpox Smallpox is caused by the related Variola virus Therefore the word vaccination has the Latin root vaca meaning cow 

In 1798 the English physician Edward Jenner made a curious observation Jenner lived in the countryside not in the city Some of his patients had gotten cowpox and recovered from it He observed that those patients did not get the disease again they seemed to be immune against it What was more they also seemed to be immune against smallpox Smallpox was a deadly disease then that killed most of the people it infected So he used the fluid he got from cowpox lesions and scratched it into healthy people That way he could make those people immune against smallpox 

The Cowpox virus is found in Europe and mainly in the UK Human cases are very rare and most often contracted from domestic cats The virus is not commonly found in cows the reservoir hosts for the virus are woodland rodents particularly voles It is from these rodents that domestic cats get the virus Symptoms in cats include lesions on the face neck forelimbs and paws and less commonly upper respiratory tract infection Symptoms of infection with cowpox virus in humans are localized pustular lesions generally found on the hands and limited to the site of introduction The incubation period is 910 days The virus can be found mostly in late summer and autumn

Cowpox was the original vaccine of sorts for smallpox After infection with the disease the body gains the ability recognise the similar smallpox virus from its antigens and so is able to fight the smallpox disease much more efficiently

Later and still today another vaccine was used vaccinia Vaccinia is similar to cowpox but not the same

Chickenpox is a disease Usually it is children who get the disease but adults can also get it People who have it get blisters mostly on the body and in the face Those blisters are filled with a liquid At some point they will drain up and there will be an urge to scratch Burst blisters usually heal without leaving scars unless people scratch them open The symptoms come in 2 or 3 waves and are usually accompanied by fever

The disease can be very dangerous in pregnant women 

Chickenpox is caused by a virus of the herpes family The same virus can also cause shingles 

There is a vaccine against it Usually it is given to children if they did not have the disease before the onset of puberty that is aged 913 years old

Music has tonality if it uses the notes of a major or minor scale Such music is tonal It is in a particular key Nearly all Western music is tonal

All tonal music is based on a major or minor scale If the tune Twinkle twinkle little star is played starting on the note C the notes of a C major scale will be used The note C will sound like the home note and indeed the tune finishes on a C The tune could have started on any other note but a knowledge of scales would be needed as some sharps or flats will be required When singing the tune there is no need to think about the sharps and flats the singer does them quite naturally

A piece of tonal music will usually modulate after a while This means that it changes key But the music will not sound finished until it goes back to the original key If one sings The Star Spangled Banner and stops after the words our flag was still there the song sounds as if it has stopped in mid air It will not sound finished until it goes back to the first key in the last two lines

Most Western music from about 1600 onwards is based in a major or minor key This system of tonality was used by all the great composers up to the 20th century and in popular music and most folk music Listening to a symphony by Beethoven is like going on a journey through various key areas always returning to the original tonic at the end In some cases such as Beethovens Fifth Symphony it may start in the minor and finish in the major This is because minor keys can sound disturbed full of tension but major keys sound happier and more relaxed

The opposite of tonality is atonality An atonal piece is one where there is no feeling of a home key Playing lots of random notes will sound atonal Schoenberg wrote some atonal music Of course they are not just random notes so he had to find another way of giving his music shape That is why he invented the twelve tone system

Toucan are familiy Ramphastidae is a South American bird This social bird lives in small flocks in lowland rainforests It is a poor flyer and moves mostly by hopping around trees Toucans roost in holes in trees

Toucans are known for their huge beaks It can grow larger than their bodies They use their beaks for reaching over and plucking fruit from branches of trees The bright colors on the beak may help the toucans to recognize each other and to scare off other birds

The elbow is a hinge joint between the bones of the upper and lower arm It joins the humerus of the upper arm and the radius and ulna of the forearm together Everyone has 2 elbows It allows the lower arm to be extended or retracted The elbow also allows the arm to turn It moves by using three ligaments the anterior posterior ulnar collateral and radial collateral ligaments

The wrist is the joint that links together the lower arm and the hand

The knee is the joint that links 4 of the upper and lower bones of the leg which are called the femur tibia fibula and the patella The knee joint is the largest joint in the body and is an extensive network of ligaments and muscles Basically it is a hinge which allows movement of the lower leg in only one direction The lower leg can swing back from the knee and that is all

The knee is held together by ligaments which connect the bones and produces fluid which lubricates the movement at the joint The meniscus is a cartilage that lies on the inner and outer edges of the upper surface of the tibia These are the shock absorbers of the knee and supply proper weight distribution

In chemistry and physics atomic theory explains how our understanding of the atom has changed over time Atoms are the smallest pieces of matter The first idea of the atom came from the Greek philosopher Democritus  Atomic theory has chane earliest known atomic theories was explained by the Greek philosopher Democritus A lot of the ideas in the modern theory came from John Dalton a British chemist and physicist 

The theory applies to solids liquids and gases but it does not apply to plasmas or neutron stars where temperature and density stop atoms from forming

Democritus thought that if you cut something in half again and again you would at last have to stop He said that this last piece of matter could not be cut any smaller Democritus called these small pieces of matter atoms which means indivisible He thought that atoms would last forever never change and could not be destroyed Democritus thought that there was nothing between the atoms and that everything around us could be explained if we could understand how atoms worked 

Democritus was right about the composition of the matter In fact elements like oxygen nitrogen carbon and hydrogen were composed of atoms of just one type these being the fundamental basis to life and the explication to the constitution of the Universe By example the Universe contains in its composition a mass of 99 of hydrogen and helium the Earths crust has a mass of 743 of oxygen and silicon the atmosphere a 99 by mass of nitrogen and oxygen the human body 93 by mass of carbon and oxygen and sea water 55 chlorine and 306 sodium

However his theory was not valued at the time and the scientific investigation commenced in late 19th century remaining until that moment Aristotles theory about the continuity of the matter that meant it could subdivide infinitely in pieces every time more gradual therefore to know the composition of the matter is a theme that was suspended for a long time

In 1803 the English scientist John Dalton born in Cumberland United Kingdom retook Democritus theory specifying the following postulations about the constitution and conduct of the matter

Dalton postulations defined the atom as the basic unit of an element that can interfere in a chemical combination Many scientists started to investigate the atom after Dalton that could determine how matter is constituted the 

In 1850 Sir William Crookes constructed a discharge tube that is a glass tube with the air removed and metallic electrodes at its ends connected to a high voltage source When creating a vacuum in the tube a light discharge can be seen that goes from the cathode to the anode Crookes named the emission cathode rays

After the cathode ray experiments Sir Joseph John Thomson established that the emitted ray was formed by negative charges because they were attracted by the positive pole Thomson knew that the atoms were electrically neutral but he established that for this to occcur an atom should have the same quantity of negative and positive charges The negative charges were named electrons

According to the assumptions established about the atoms neutral charge Thomson proposed the first atomic model that was described as a positively charged sphere in which the electrons were inlaid It is known as the plum pudding model

In 1906 Robert Millikart determined that the electrons had a Coulomb charge of 16 1019 something that allowed calculation of its mass infinitely small equal to 9109 1031 kg

In the same time experiments by Eugene Goldstein in 1886 with cathode discharge tubes allowed him to establish that the positive charges had a mass of 16726 1027 kg and an electrical charge of 16 10 19 C Lord Ernest Rutherford later named these positively charged particles protons

In 1910 the New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford suggested that the positive charges of the atom were found mostly in its center in the nucleus and the electrons around it

Rutherford showed this when he used an alpha radiation source to hit the very thin gold sheets surrounded by a Zinc sulphide lampshade that produced visible light when hit by alpha emissions This experiment was called the GeigerMarsden experiment

Particle physics is a category of physics that studies really tiny pieces of things known as particles These particles are the really small pieces that build up the world around us 

Particles can carry fundamental forces For example the electromagnetic force is carried by photons The four fundemental forces are responsible for almost everything in all of physics including gravity radioactive decay and magnetism

One of the important concepts of particle physics is called the Standard Model The Standard Model is a theory which tries to explain the fundamental forces The Standard Model combined with General Relativity is currently the most accepted explanatin of how the Universe works 

The Standard Model is known to have problems For example there is not much in it explains gravity This is why General Relativity a different theory to explain how things have gravity needs to be included in order for physicists to explain the universe There is a lot of work to improve the theory andor find a better theory that is being done This work is often called theoretical particle physics beucase none of it has been actually proven Theoretical particle physicists make theories to try to improve the Standard Model One example of this is how there are many theories that predict undiscovered particles

Physicists find out about particles by studying collisions between different particles A good analogy of how physicists study particles through colliding is the car crash example Imagine a person wanted to look inside cars By crashing two cars together at very high speeds we can break the cars apart and see inside In the same way physicists crash two particles together in order to break them and study the inside

If particles are moving at very high speeds some of them will break apart when they collide When they break they create new smaller particles These particles are very hard to find and detect because they decay very quickly Modern particle physics involves colliding particles together very energetically to create new particles inside a particle accelerator This is called high energy physics due to the large amount of energy needed

However many particles do not simply break apart such as an electron Because it does not break apart the electron is called a fundamental particle If you were to smash to super fast electrons against each other they would not break but instead they might create more particles around them without breaking this is another form of decay known as a hadron jet The Standard Model says that there are 16 types of fundamental particles but there are actually twice as many because they can all be created out of antimatter

Particle physics can help us learn about the early universe because conditions that are similar to the early universe can be made in a small volume of space using the collisions of these particles The biggest particle accelerator in the world is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Europe

Minimalism is a way of making modern art or music that uses simple ideas sounds or shapes It was most popular in America in the 1960s and 1970s There are many different kinds of minimalism Sometimes a simple thing is repeated many times until it seems very complicated Today minimalism can be used to talk about many things such as design architecture poetry and movies

In music minimalism is a way of composing classical music which became popular during the second half of the 20th century It is a way of composing by using a simple idea which is repeated many times A minimalist piece of music usually takes a short idea which may be a melodic or a rhythmic pattern This idea is then repeated many times but each time it changes slightly Sometimes this may be done by two or more instruments which start off by playing their notes or chords together but as one is going slightly faster than the other they gradually become out of sync then eventually they catch up with one another again Usually this music is tonal so that it is firmly in one key A steady pulse is kept throughout the whole piece 

Composers who wrote minimalist music include Steve Reich Philip Glass and Terry Riley Other composers like John Adams have also used minimalist ways of composing but they combined these with other techniques so that their music is not just Minimalist

Minimalist music became popular in the 1960s and 1970s Minimalist composers started writing like this because a lot of new music at that time was very complicated and hard to understand It was often serial music which was atonal with no obvious melodies or ideas that were easy to remember

Minimalist music is not necessarily simple It can have a kind of hypnotic effect but this is part of what the composer wants Reichs Clapping Music just consists of hand broken wikt linkclappingclapping there is no melody He was thinking of African drum music when he wrote it Two performers begin by clapping a rhythm together After 13 seconds the second performer leaves out the first quaver and puts it at the end of the second bar After another 13 seconds this happens again so that in the end the two performers are together again This music has to be listened to in a different way from other kinds of music

Minimalism in visual art sometimes referred to as literalist art and ABC Art emerged in New York in the 1960s As a product it had much in common with earlier geometric abstraction and suprematism

The term minimalism was not generally embraced by the artists associated with it and many practitioners of art called minimalist by critics did not identify it as a movement as such

One of the first artists specifically associated with Minimalism was the painter Frank Stella whose early stripe paintings were highlighted in the 1959 show 16 Americans organized by Dorothy Miller at the Museum of Modern Art in New York The width of the stripes in Frank Stellass stripe paintings were determined by the dimensions of the lumber visible as the depth of the painting when viewed from the side used to construct the supportive chassis upon which the canvas was stretched The decisions about structures on the front surface of the canvas were therefore not entirely subjective but pre conditioned by a given feature of the physical construction of the support In the show catalog Carl Andr noted Art excludes the unnecessary Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint stripes There is nothing else in his painting 

These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy filled and emotionally charged expressionist paintings of Willem de Kooning or Franz Kline 

They leaned more towards the controoled somber color field paintings of Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko Although Stella received immediate attention from the MOMA show artists like Kenneth Noland Ralph Humphrey Robert Motherwell and Robert Ryman had begun to explore stripes monochromatic and hard edge formats from the late 50s through the 1960s

Igor Stravinsky was one of the most important composers of the 20th century He was brought up in Russia When the Russian Revolution started he moved to Switzerland and then to Paris and finally when World War II started in 1939 he moved to the United States

Stravinsky wrote music in different styles At first he wrote music similar to his teacher Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov He loved his native Russian music He wrote music which had very complicated chords and rhythms It is very lively music and some of his best known works of this kind were written for the ballet company of Sergei Diaghilev The Firebird Petrushka and The Rite of Spring They were written during the first two decades of 20th century

Then he changed his style and wrote in what is called a neo classical way He based it on music from the Classical music period but changed it His only full length opera The Rakes Progress was written in this way In his later years he wrote serial music

Igor Stravinsky was born in Oranienbaum a town which is now called Lomonosov His father was an opera singer who had a fine bass voice and sang at the opera house in Kiev and later at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg Igor was the third of four children all boys As a child he spent the winter months in St Petersburg and the summers in the country where several of his relatives on his mothers side had large estates

Igor was not particularly good at school but he often went to see the operas in which his father was performing He also went to ballets and even heard Tchaikovsky conduct in 1893 just before his death He learned to play the piano and also had lessons in harmony and counterpoint He enjoyed improvising and he started to be interested in composing He wrote some little piano pieces and showed them to the great composer Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov who was the father of his friend Rimsky Korsakov told him he ought to continue to have private music lessons instead of going to the conservatoire Shortly after this Stravinskys father died Rimsky Korsakov became a great friend and helped him a lot He met many musical people at his house and Rimsky Korsakov taught him a lot about how to write for the different instruments

For a short time Stravinsky studied law at the university of St Petersburg Then he gave up his studies and married one of his cousins They soon had a son and a daughter

In 1908 Rimsky Korsakov died Stravinsky met Sergei Diaghilev who was a famous impresario Diaghilev wanted to put on performances of new operas and ballets He needed a composer to write the music and he realized that Stravinsky would be the ideal person He asked him to write music for a ballet called The Firebird which was a Russian fairytale Stravinsky wrote it at Rimsky Korsakovs country house and finished it in St Petersburg The ballet was first performed at the Paris Opra on 25 June 1910 by the Ballets Russes who were very famous in Europe Mikhail Fokin was the choreographer It has remained one of Stravinskys most famous pieces of music Some of the music is often performed in a concert hall without the dancing This version is called a suite It shows his love of Russian folk melody

The success of The Firebird made Stravinsky world famous His music was especially well known in Europe and in Paris where the Ballets Russes were based The next work Stravinsky wrote for them was Petrouchka It was the story of a puppet which comes to life It was performed in Paris on 13 June 1911 and became just as famous as The Firebird This music too is often performed as a concert piece Stravinsky also made an arrangement of three of the dances for piano solo It is very hard to play and needs a virtuoso pianist

Stravinsky was becoming well known among musicians His friends included Debussy and Ravel He met Schoenberg in Berlin and was very impressed by his piece called Pierrot Lunaire He spent a lot of his time with his family in Switzerland where he had peace and quiet to compose

On 29 May 1913 a new ballet by Stravinsky called The Rite of Spring was performed at the Thtre des Champs Elyses in Paris It was an absolute sensation Some people loved it and others hated it There was a big fight in the theatre and the police were called in People were shouting so much that no one could hear the music Stravinsky became ill afterwards and spent some weeks getting better When the ballet was performed again people were quiet and listened to the music There were lots of new ideas in the music harsh chords and very complicated rhythms The music of The Rite of Spring had an enormous influence on the development of music in the 20th century

Stravinskys next idea for a ballet was one called Svadebka The title means The Wedding It is often called by its French title Les Noces Stravinsky went back to Russia to collect some things that would help him to compose it When he returned to Switzerland World War I started

Stravinskys family spent most of their time in Switzerland during the war He was short of money because there was no more income from the Russian estates The Ballets Russes could not perform any more in Paris Stravinsky spent a lot of time working at Les Noces He finished it in 1917 and played it to Diaghilev It was another six years before it was performed Stravinsky eventually chose to arrange it for four pianos percussion chorus and vocal soloists It was performed at the Thtre de la Gat Lyrique on 13 June 1923

Because Switzerland was neutral in the war Stravinsky was able to travel He went to Italy where he met Gerald Tyrwhitt and Prokofiev He wrote Reynard and Rag Time He performed in America with Ballets Russes

When the Russian Revolution broke out in February 1917 Stravinsky thought this would be good but when the Bolshevik Revolution followed it became obvious that he would never be able to go back to Russia He wrote Lhistoire du soldat It was performed in Lausanne with Ernest Ansermet conducting There would have been more performances but many people had influenza When the war ended Stravinsky decided to move to France He wrote a ballet called Pulcinella which was based on music by the 18th century composer Pergolesi It was performed at the Paris Opra on 15 May 1920

In 1920 Stravinskys family moved from Stravinsky to Brittany then the following year they moved to Biarritz Stravinsky composed a piece called Symphonies for Wind Instruments It was soon performed in London at a concert which also included The Rite of Spring conducted by Eugene Goossens in the Queens Hall He met a theatre designer called Serge Soudeikine and fell madly in love with his wife Vera Vera and Stravinsky saw one another as much as possible for the next 18 years Meanwhile Stravinskys mother managed to get out of Russia and she joined Stravinskys family in Biarritz Stravinsky had to support a large family and he decided he needed to work more as a conductor and pianist instead of composing large works He composed smaller pieces including the piano version of three dances from Petrouchka Later when his son was grown up he composed a Concerto for two solo pianos for himself to play with his son He did not compose any more for the Ballets Russes but he did compose Oedipus rex as a special tribute to them This work was a mixture of opera and oratorio The words were in Latin and were written by Jean Cocteau It was performed as a concert performance Although he did not write for Diaghilev any more he accepted an invitation from Ida Rubinstein to write a ballet called Le baiser de la fe which was based on music by Tchaikovsky Diaghilev was annoyed but then he died in 1929 and the Ballets Russes company no longer carried on

In 1926 Stravinsky who belonged to the Russian Orthodox Church had a deep religious experience which effected his music The best of these religious pieces is the Symphony of Psalms written for the Boston Symphony Orchestras 50th birthday celebrations

Stravinsky met the violinist Dushkin and composed a Violin Concerto as well as the Duo concertante for violin and piano which the two musicians played together at many concerts He became more and more in demand in the United States and wrote several works for American people He was offered a job as professor at Harvard University At this time a lot of his family were ill Then his daughter died his wife died and his mother died He was ill himself Then by September 1939 just as World War II started he was well enough to travel to North America

Stravinsky was immediately invited to conduct many concerts in America Vera arrived in America four months later and she and Stravinsky were married in Bedford Massachusetts They applied for American citizenship and settled in Hollywood He was quite short of money and he accepted any invitation to compose music He even accepted a private pupil

Stravinsky composed a mass It was not commissioned he just wanted to compose it It was performed in La Scala Milan in 1948 conducted by Ansermet He then decided to compose a full length opera in English This was The Rakes Progress It was first performed in Venice in 1951 It is the best of his works in the neo classical style Another work from this period is his Symphony in C It shows a different way of composing tonal music to the tonal works of classical composers

He met a man called Robert Craft who came to live with the family and helped Stravinsky sort out all his compositions and papers He was surprised to find that Stravinsky never visited Schoenberg who only lived a few streets away After Schoenberg died in 1951 Craft encouraged Stravinsky to listen to Schoenbergs serial music Soon Stravinsky started to use serialism in his own compositions Craft travelled with Stravinsky and helped him a great deal for example by conducting some of the concerts or rehearsing the orchestras before Stravinsky came

In 1962 he was invited to the White House by President Kennedy In the same year he returned to Russia for a visit He had not been there for nearly half a century It was a great success and people in the USSR became more interested in Stravinskys music It made Stravinsky very happy to know that Russians were interested in him again

During his last years he became rather ill Threni is one of his last compositions It is a setting of the parts of the Lamentations of Jeremiah for voices and orchestra He composed other religious works including Requiem Canticles In 1969 he moved with his family to New York where he died two years later

Stravinsky was buried in Venice near Diaghilevs grave

The technological singularity is the idea that the time people will take to make breakthroughs in different areas is getting shorter and that one day it will become so short that no one knows what will happen Predictions of the technological singularity come from people doing maths equations using different dates and using data to predict ahead or extrapolate 

The futurist and inventor Ray Kurzweil believes the Singularity will happen about the year 2045 The major impetus driving toward the singularity according to Kurzweil is that according to Moores Law computers are doubling in memory capacity every 18 months so according to Kurzweil by 2025 computers will be as intelligent as human beings The major event of the singularity Kurzweil asserts will be that the vast majority of the human race will be uploaded into a worldwide supercomputer to live inside it in virtual reality thus achieving immortality 

Nobody really knows what the technological singularity will do other than the uploading of the human race into the supercomputer or if it will even happen

Marseille is a city in the south of France in the Bouches du Rhne department About 15 million people live in the country and about 13 million in the city itself This makes it the second largest city in France by number of people but only the third largest when it comes to size The second largest is Lyon Marseille is located all in the south just at the Mediterranean sea It has the biggest commercial port in France The port is also among the most important ones in the Mediterranean 

Although part of the region of Provence Marseilles has a soul of its own Founded in 600 BC by the Greek sailors of Phocaea this city is the oldest in France and probably the most complex 

Halo 2 is an award winning first person shooter video game made by Bungie Studios and published by Microsoft for its own Xbox console It was released all over the world on November 9 2004 It is the second game in the Halo series the first being Halo Combat Evolved and the third being Halo 3 A Windows Vista version of the game was released in 2007 

The games story is based around a future war between a fictional alien race known as the covenant and the human race The player takes the role of Master Chief a genetically enhanced super soldier who fights for mankind The player is helped in their fight against the Covenant by human marines The game had many features that werent in the original Halo such as extra vehicles weapons and a greatly improved multiplayer mode including the ability to play over Xbox Live 

Halo 2 was the most popular Xbox Live game on its release It held that title until the release of Gears of War nearly two years later By June 20 2006 over 500 million games of Halo 2 had been played over Xbox Live It was and still is the best selling Xbox game of all time with over 8 million copies sold worldwide It broke sales records in the US many of which were only broken by its sequel Halo 3 in 2007 The Windows Vista version in 2007 was less successful as the fact it was released 3 years after the Xbox version gained many negative reviews

Halo 2 is a science fiction first person shooter based mostly on foot but with vehicle combat sections Halo 2 has many features that were not in the original Halo In Halo 2 players have the option to use two weapons at once called dual wielding This allowes the player much more firepower but does not allow the throwing of grenades The player can hold up to two weapons at once or three when dual wielding Weapons range from normal human weapons such as pistols and shotguns up to heavy weapons like rocket launchers and sniper rifles The player can also carry alien weapons like plasma rifles and needlers

The story mode continues the story started in Halo Combat Evolved There are nine levels in the story split between controlling Master Chief and the alien Arbiter There are four difficulties to the campaign easy standard heroic and legendary Completing them unlocks extras such as different dialogue in certain sections of the game and extra weapons in split screen multiplayer There are various skulls at hidden parts of the levels as in Halo 3 These skulls unlock helpful and or strange differences in the levels such as confetti and balloons appearing when the player scores a headshot The story can be played two player on the same console but not over Xbox Live 

Halo 2 allows up to four players to play on the same console or up to sixteen over Xbox Live The game was influential in changing the way games played over the internet Before in most online multiplayer games one player was the host who used their own connection for the game and chose the settings gametype etc In Halo 2 and most games since players choose a type of game they want to play and the game matches them with players of their own ability on a randomly chosen map

Some weapons and vehicles available in the story mode were not available in multiplayer as they would be too powerful and unbalance the game

The game is set in the same fictional world as the rest of the Halo series Much of the game takes place in the future year 2553 over 500 years from now In the storyline humans have developed faster than light travel and now live on many planets and moons of the Solar System On humanitys first try to build a settlement on a planet around another star they met the alien Covenant The Covenant declared religious war on humanity At the start of Halo 2 humans are losing the war and the Covenant have just discovered Earth 

The Halo of the games title is the name of a series of planets built by a mysterious race called the Forerunners a long time before the game The Halos are the last defence against another alien race known as the Flood The Flood want to use every living thing in the galaxy for food The Halos are actually giant super weapons that when activated kill all life in the galaxy This is the only way to stop the Flood to starve them by killing all their food The Covenant are not aware of this and are attempting to fire Halos as part of a false religious prophecy In the first Halo game Halo Combat Evolved the humans and Master Chief manage to stop the Covenant from firing one of the Halos They also destroy one of them in the process Just before Halo 2 begins the covenant discover another Halo that can only be got through a broken wikt linkportalportal found near Earth 

The game opens with the torture of an alien the leader of the Elites He is being tortured by the covenant because he failed to stop Master Chief destroying the first Halo in the original game The Elite commander is branded by the leader of the Brutes another part of the Covenant The player then takes control of Master Chief on board a spacecraft orbiting the Earth when the massive Covenant fleet arrives The Covenant have come to take the portal that will allow them to get to the new Halo so they can fire it The Covenant board the ship the player is aboard and attempt to plant bombs to disable it and the other ships in the human fleet The player must fight through Covenant forces to disable the bombs Once this is complete the human ship heads off following the Covenant flagship that just flew past Meanwhile in the cutscene we see the former elite commander being made into a religious warrior known as the Arbiter to make up for his failure to stop Master Chief in the original Halo 

In another cutscene a human ship with Master ChiefJohnson and Cortana aboard follows the covenant ship through the portal to the new Halo The player must now take control of Chief as he battles to stop the Covenant from firing the ring Eventually the player kills the Prophet of Regret a Covenant leader and stops the Halo from being fired Unfortunately before the player can recover the Index the control for firing the Halo they are captured by the leader of the Flood known as the Gravemind In a cutscene we see the new Arbiter sent down to the Halo to recover the Index before Chief can destroy it When he arrives though he and his followers are betrayed and their former allies begin to attack Here the player must control Arbiter and his followers as they attempt to escape the betrayal and ambush The arbiter is eventually also captured by the Gravemind and meets up with Master Chief The two of them break free of Gravemind whose Flood followers have now taken over a huge Covenant ship called High Charity Arbiter and Chief now controlled by the player again race to the Halo control to stop the Covenant from firing the ring one last time They are successful in stopping the Covenant but the Prophet of Truth the last of their leaders escapes on a spacecraft unharmed Chiefs AI companion Cortana stays behind on the Halo promising to destroy it if any Covenant ever return Chief and the Arbiter part ways with Chief hiding out on a fleeing Covenant ship and the Arbiter and his followers returning to High Charity in an attempt to save it from the Flood

Halo 2 was officially announced in 2002 A gameplay video was shown at E3 2003 The video showed new features in the game such as dual wielding and the improved graphics According to Bungie the cliffhanger ending of the games story was not originally intended but was a result of the rush to get the game out on time

Halo 2 was first released in North America and Australia on November 9 2004 It was launched in Europe a day later on November 10 Demand was high for the game and over 15 million copies were sold on pre orders alone It was the highest earning entertainment product launch of all time in the US earning 125 million dollars in its first 24 hours It held this record until the release of its sequel Halo 3 Halo 2 has sold over 8 million copies in the US making it the best selling original Xbox game of all timeFrom the day of its release until 2006 2 years later Halo 2 was the most played game on Xbox Live It was eventually beaten by the Xbox 360 game Gears of War 

The game was reviewed as excellent by most of the media The sound work such as the dialogue and soundtrack was often praised The game received an average score of 95 on Metacritic a website that puts together many reviews from different sources The games multiplayer was often seen as a good point making full use of the then new Xbox Live service Bad aspects pointed out included the short length of the story mode and the cliffhanger ending

Actuaries are people who are experts in mathematics probability economics and finance who figure out how much money businesses should charge for making promises to pay for something that may or may not happen 

Hundreds of years ago when people got sick or died it cost a lot of money to take care of them or bury them People had the idea of joining their money together to help each other out This was called pooling Eventually people started to make a business out of collecting enough money to help people who had big problems

Figuring out how much money needed to be collected from people to be used if problems happened was not easy Over hundreds of years the math needed for this was developed by many people from all over the world

Today actuaries use computers to figure out problems that were too difficult before

Actuaries now work in many places Most work for insurance companies but others work in all kinds of finance companies Actuaries still figure out how much money needs to be paid for life insurance as well as other kinds of money promises like pensions car insurance house insurance and similar

Actuaries also work with companies to figure out if making certain business deals are a good idea since actuaries work with figuring out what the probabilities are of different business situations happening

People who want to be actuaries need to take many tests The tests are not the same in different parts of the world

A thesaurus is a dictionary of synonyms Thesauruses often include related words that mean almost the same thing Some thesauruses also include antonyms

For example by looking up the word big in a thesaurus someone would find a list of other similar words such as huge and massive If the thesaurus also has a list of antonyms the person could also find words which mean the opposite like small and tiny 

Many students and writers use a thesaurus to help them find words when they are writing Using a thesaurus can help a person to improve their vocabulary

A boom can mean different things

Rumble can mean different things

to tell drivers that they must slow down or stop ahead The strips make a rumbling sound when a cars tires cross them

Rumble may also mean

Norfolk Island is a territory of Australia It is in the South Pacific Ocean between Australia New Zealand and New Caledonia It was one of the first British settlements in the Pacific Twice it was used as a penal colony People from Pitcairn Island were moved to Norfolk Island It is now a popular place for holidays

Norfolk Island is a small volcanic island Its size is about convert5mikm0lkonabbron by convert3mikm0lkoffabbron It is about convert1000mikm0lkoffabbron northeast of Sydney and convert600mikm0lkoffabbron north of Auckland Most of the island is convert350ftm0lkonabbron above the level of the sea There are two high points on the island about convert1000ftm0lkoffabbron above sea level South of Norfolk are two smaller islands Nepean Island and Phillip Island

The first people to visit Norfolk Island were probably from New Zealand The first European settlers found parts of a canoe and stone axes Later work by archaeologists in 1995 found the remains of a house in the sand dunes at Emily Bay It was lived in from about 1200 AD to about 1600 AD Scientists do not know why the people left the island

Norfolk Island was first discovered by Captain James Cook on October 10 1774 He was on his second trip around the world in his ship the Resolution He landed on the island which was uninhabited He found a flax plant and large trees now called Norfolk Island Pines He thought the flax could be used to make cloth for ship sails and the pine trees would make good masts for ships He used one of the trees to make a new top mast for the Resolution Cook wrote about the island in his book A Voyage towards the South Pole printed in London in 1777

The British government sent Captain Arthur Phillip with the First Fleet to start a penal colony in Australia in 1788 He was told start a small settlement on Norfolk Island as soon as possible to stop other European countries from claiming the island The French ships LAstrolabe and La Boussole commanded by La Prouse visited the island in early 1778 They could not land because the waves were too big and rough La Prouse thought the island was only suitable for angels and eagles

The first European settlers on Norfolk Island arrived on March 3 1788 After two days looking around the island the settlers landed at Emily Bay part of Sydney Bay on March 6 This day is now celebrated as Foundation Day They had come on the HMS Supply from the new settlement at Sydney New South Wales Philip Gidley King was in charge of a small group of 21 people including 15 convicts The convicts were to be people of the best character and included Richard Widdicombe aged 72 and Charles McLennan aged 16 The settlers were

During the first year of the settlement which was also called Sydney more convicts and soldiers were sent from New South Wales A second village was started at Ball Bay named after the captain of HMS Supply Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball On January 8 1789 the first child was born Norfolk King the son of Philip Gidley King and a convict Ann Inett

In March 1790 Governor Arthur Phillip decided to send King to England with important messages about the settlements in Australia Phillip sent Major Robert Ross in charge of the soldiers at Sydney to Norfolk Island to take over from King Food was running out in Sydney so Phillip also sent two companies of soldiers five free women and children 183 convicts and 27 children of convicts Phillip hoped there would be more food on Norfolk Island They were sent on two ships HMS Sirius and HMS Supply

On March 19 HMS Sirius smashed into one of the reefs in Sydney Bay Norfolk Island No one was hurt and Captain John Hunter was able to get all the people and most of the supplies safely to land 

HMS Supply went back to Sydney and Major Ross was left with over 500 people on the island He quickly did things to make sure there would be enough food Anyone taking food or killing animals for food without his permission would be hanged They were saved from starvation by the annual arrival of a sea bird a petrel which nested in holes in the ground Between 2000 3000 birds were killed for food every night They were also able to eat their eggs They called the petrel the Bird of Providence because they thought God must have sent the bird to save them People also ate the tops of the palm trees In August two ships arrived the Justinian and the Surprize which brought more food and 200 more convicts

King got back to Norfolk Island in November 1791 and Ross went back to Sydney More convicts were sent to the island and by September 1792 there were 1115 people living there King started building another landing place at Cascade Bay which meant ships had a choice depending on which way the wind was blowing The convicts had difficulty in making things from the flax plants Two Maori men were captured in New Zealand and taken to Norfolk to teach the convicts how to use the flax The two men Hoodoo and Toogee did not know much about flax in New Zealand this was a task done by the women King had the men taken back to New Zealand six months later 

By 1796 convert1528acreha0lkonabbron had been cleared of trees and crops planted These crops included maize wheat potatoes sugar cane bananas guavas lemons apples and coffee Farms animals included 12 cattle 6 horses 12 donkeys 374 sheep 772 goats and 14624 pigs There were two schools and an orphanage for little girls King had been in poor health and went back to Sydney and Captain Townson from the New South Wales Corps became the new Lieutenant Governor

 Lieutenant governors of the first settlement

 When Joseph Foveaux arrived as Lieutenant Governor in 1800 he found the settlement quite run down Not much had been done to keep it in good condition for four years He began fixing buildings and other public works and tried to improve education

In 1794 King suggested closing Norfolk Island as a penal colony It was too far away from New South Wales it was hard for ships to land there and it cost too much to keep it going In 1803 the Secretary of State Lord Hobart called for the moving everyone to Van Diemens Land because of the cost and the difficulties of travel between Norfolk Island and Sydney The settlers did not want to move they had worked hard to clear the land and set up their farms They wanted the government to pay them for having to move King now Governor of New South Wales did not want everyone moved he thought it would make a good prison for bad convicts from New South Wales It could also be a place to supply whaling ships or grow coffee

The British government decided to close down the island The first group of 159 people left for Van Diemens Land in February 1805 mainly convicts and their families and the soldiers Between November 1807 and September 1808 most of the people were moved By March 1810 there were only 117 left In 1813 the last settlers were taken to Van Diemenss Land the soldiers were taken to Sydney The British government did not want another country to be able to settle on the island so a small group stayed behind to kill all the animals that were left and destroy all buildings In February 1814 the last people left on the ship Kangaroo Only a few wild pigs and goats were left

In 1825 the British government decided to set up a new convict prison on Norfolk Island This was to be a prison for convicts from New South Wales who continued to break the law The Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane wanted it to be place from which there would be no return It was to be the worst punishment short of death Many of the convicts were lashed with a nine tailed whip This could be as many as 300 lashes at one time and many had been lashed over 1000 times Because it was to be a prison there were no free settlers allowed on the island and there were no women prisoners Only government ships or ships in distress were allowed to land at the island

After the prison was closed the British government gave the island to the people from Pitcairn Island Pitcairn with only 30 hectares of land suitable for farming could no longer cope with a large population All 194 people were moved to Norfolk in 1856 These people were descendants of the mutineers from HMS Bounty They arrived on the island on 8 June 1856 and the anniversary is celebrated every year as Bounty Day

Atlas is a Titan in Greek mythology He is the son of Iapetos He has seven daughters with the Oceanid Pleione They are called the Pleiades

After the war between the Titans and the Olympians Atlas was punished Zeus forced him to hold the heaven on the western edge of the world Later the story about him changed and it was said that he held the whole world on his shoulders Mostly in modern times he is shown holding a globe of the world 

Heracles came to Atlas and asked him to for help with one of his Labours He wanted Atlas to get the Golden Apples for him Atlas agreed but only if Heracles would hold up the sky Atlas was pleased to be free from its weight but Heracles tricked him into holding it again 

El Paso is a city in the US state of Texas It is in El Paso County and is the county seat It is at the western end of Texas and is along Interstate 10 The name comes from El Paso de Norte meaning The Passageway to the North which was shortened to El Paso

All living and non living thingsin a given area that interact with one other make up an ecosystem The non living part of an ecosystem includes water rocks air light and soil All the different organisms that live together in an ecosystem is called a community Each ecosystem has its own community A terrarium community for example can have small animals A desert communtiy may have cacti small snakes and scorpions A pond community can have frogs insects snakes and plants and a forest community may have rabbits foxes and pine trees Communities are also divided into populations A population is composed of only one type of species A species is a group of similar organisms for instance all humans belong to the same species but cats and dogs do not

A community works like a team Each member of the team has its own job to do but they are all interconnected For example in a forest community there are different populations such as grass rabbits and foxes The rabbits eat the grass The foxes eat the rabbits If there were no foxes the rabbit population would grow too quickly and there wouldnt be enough grass for all of the rabbits to eat Then the rabbits would begin to die and the foxes would soon die because there is nothing but grass too eat Predators and their prey are in every community They help to keep it balanced so that all the members can survive Three types of team members in a community help establish balance the Producers the Consumers and the Decomposers

Parasitism is a form of symbiosis It means that a parasite is any organism or living thing that benefits from another creatures harm In other words the parasites harm the host organism while the parasite benefits A parasitic relationship is the opposite of a mutualistic relationship Examples of parasites in humans include tapeworms and leeches World wide the most serious cause of human death by a parasite is malaria A definition

 Biological context  When the above definition is applied many organisms which eat plants can be seen as parasites because they feed largely or wholly on one individual plant Examples would include many herbivorous insects the Homoptera The larvae of Lepidoptera usually feed and mature on a single individual of the host plant species and what they eat accounts for most of the food for their complete life span Moreover caterpillars can and often do serious damage to the hosts foliage Other orders also have many parasitic herbivores Thysanoptera Hemiptera Coleoptera Diptera

Parasites of larger animals account for much research done for veterinarian and medical purposes These parasites include viruses bacteria protozoa flatworms nematodes arthropods Parasitic wasps and flies are of great interest to the entomologist and may be used in biological control

On the other hand many blood sucking insects have only brief contact with a host and so perhaps should not be regarded as parasites

A huge number of species are parasitic A survey of the feeding habits of British insects showed that about 35 were parasites on plants and slightly more were parasites on animals That means that nearly 71 of insects in Britain are parasitic Since British insects are better known than those elsewhere this means that the majority of insect species throughout the world are parasitic Also there are several other invertebrate phyla which are wholly or largely parasitic Flatworms and roundworms are found in virtually every wild species of vertebrate Protozoan parasites are also ubiquitous Hence parasitism is almost certainly the most common feeding method on Earth

 Ecology 

Parasites are adapted to small separated habitats For a parasite each host is an island surrounded by a hostile environment For a small organism the distances between hosts or groups of hosts is a hazard Adaptations to bridge this hazard are

So parasites exist in small genetically similar groups with little flow of genes between them In consequence they have adaptations to solve their problems of dispersal and reproduction

Parasites face an environment which varies in time and space Consequently both local races and polymorphism occur Both may occur in the same species Parasites are very specialised feeders many species have only one host at any stage of their life cycle A few use more than two host species

Many parasites have complex life cycles Tremadodes the flukes are a parasitic class of flatworms with over 20000 species Most of them infect molluscs in the first part of the life cycle and vertebrates in the second part The biology of scrub typhus is even more complex It involves these factors

The occurrence of all these factors together would be limited in space and brief in time This is typical of the ecology of parasitic infections

 Evolution 

Both evolutionary rates and speciation rates can be high Sibling species are very common in the bug Erythroneura in which about 150 transfers from one host to another has resulted in about 500 species in the genus

The clearest evidence comes from the large size of many parasitic families 

Sometimes there is good evidence of the speed of speciation For example five or more species of the moth Hedylepta must have evolved within 1000 years in Hawaii because they are specific to banana which was only introduced then

Adaptive radiation in parasites is extensive Its development in each taxon depends on

Diversity of hosts is a big factor If many related species of host are available then many related species of parasite will evolve Mites on Lepidoptera families or fleas on mammals and birds are good examples Eichlers rule goes as follows

The two British oaks support some 439 specieas of parasite directly and indirectly many hundred more which parasitise these parasites It would certainly be an underestimate to say that the two British species of oak are the primary products for a thousand species of parasite p28 Obviously the large size of these trees is a factor in the number of parasite species In general this holds whether the host is a plant or an animal A larger bird will harbour more species of ectoparasite than a small bird

One of the reasons large trees have so many parasites is that they may have lived a long time in a particular area compared with other types of plant They have had longer to accumulate parasites 

Parasites can be most useful in sorting out the phylogenetic relationships of their hosts Sibling host species have been discovered when their parasites diverged Common ancestors of present day parasites were themselves parasites of the common ancestors of present day hosts

As the host evolves defences so the parasite evolves to cope with this Compare two families of host plants the Umbellifers and the Graminae The umbellifers have many aromatic species and are chemically diverse and pharmaceutically interesting Their resins and oils are defences againt herbivory and parasitism On the other hand grasses have one big defence to herbivores their stony inclusions in their cells wear down the teeth of herbivorous mammals but they have few chemical defences Both families are attacked by leaf miner flies There are four times as many grass species as there are umbellifers but there are twice as many leaf miner species on the umbellifers 

This is speciation which does not require geographical isolation Ernst Mayr the chief exponent of geographical speciation admitted that host races of phytophagous animals constitute the only known case indicating the possible occurrence of incipient sympatric speciation

A moment of silence is a short time when people do not make noise People use a moment of silence to show respect for people who have died or when something else bad has happened

Moments of silence often last one minute but other amounts of time may be chosen Sometimes people choose the length of a moment of silence to connect with the event being honored For example a person might choose to have one minute of silence for each death being honored

During the moment of silence people often bow their heads remove their hats and do not speak or move A person in charge of a group will tell everyone when the moment begins and ends A moment of silence may come before or after other events with symbolic meaning Examples of these events are the ringing of bells the release of doves or balloons or a bugle song called Last Post

In the United States some people say that allowing prayer as part of a moment of silence means that moments of silence can make it hard to keep the separation of church and state

Moments of silence do not have to be time for prayers They can be used for other thoughts that are not religious Many people who want time for prayers in public schools and government meetings use moments of silence so that some people can pray and other people do not have to pray Because they represent the government and because the Constitution of the United States says that government cannot force people to do religious things these people cannot tell other people to pray 

When public schools have a moment of silence Buddhist students could meditate students with other religions such as Christianity Islam and Judaism could pray and atheist students could think about the day ahead 

Colin Powell a famous government leader likes having moments of silence in schools He has said that a simple moment of silence at the start of each school day is a good idea He also has said that students could use this time to pray meditate think or study

Many people believe that prayer is not allowed in United States public schools but this is not true The Supreme Court ruled in 1962 that students can pray in school but teachers and other school leaders cannot lead the prayers Students can form clubs where they can pray and they can pray alone but they cannot lead prayers at school events The reason prayer is not allowed at those times is because of the First Amendment The First Amendment says that government cannot force people to do religious things and public schools are part of the government

In 1976 the state of Virginia allowed schools to have a moment of silence at the start of the school day This moment would last one minute In 1985 the Supreme Court said that a moment of silence law in Alabama would not work with the United States Constitution and could not be used In 2005 the state of Indiana made a law that said all public schools had to give students time to say the Pledge of Allegiance and a moment of silence every day

In April 2000 Virginia changed its law to say that all public schools in Virginia had to have a moment of silence In October 2000 a judge named Claude M Hilton said that the moment of silence law was allowed by the United States Constitution Judge Hilton said that the law has a secular purpose that the law does not make religion more important or less important and that the law does not make government and religion be too close to each other Judge Hilton also said Students may think as they wish and that this thinking could be religious or not religious He said that the only thing students had to do because of the law was sit and be quiet

In March 2008 Illinois followed Virginia and made a compulsory 30 seconds moment of silence but was lifted in August

The American Civil Liberties Union thinks that these laws that say public schools should have moments of silence are a bad idea They think they are a bad idea because the laws are made to give students time to pray and that makes religion more important than non religion

Hindus believe in millions of female gods As a group these are called Hindu goddesses Each goddess of the Hindus has her own story and history They all look different too Some goddesses can change how they look so they have two or three different images Some learned persons think that all Hindu goddesses are different forms of a single big or supreme goddess Some learned persons also think that worship of goddesses by Hindus shows their respect for female gender

The Indus Valley Civilization was an old civilization of Ancient India It lasted from 3000 to 1500BC Archeologists found some female figures at some places of this civilization Some persons believe that these figures show the worship of goddess at that time Some learned persons think that people of that time worshipped a mother goddess This was similar to worship of a mother goddess in the Mediterranean

The Vedic period or Vedic civilization of India was a very old civilization Vedas tell about a number of goddesses Some of the names of goddesses are Ushas Prithivi Aditi Saraswati Vac Nirrti Ratri Beside them some more names of goddesses are there like Puramdhi Parendi Raka Dhisana Some more names are like Ila Bharati Mahi and Hotra

Some important goddesses of Hindus are Lakshmi Parvati Sita Radha Durga Kali Mahadevi Matrakas Tara Chhinnamasta Mahavidyas and many more Some goddesses are also connected with places and rivers

The concept of Goddess Bhuvaneswari as the supreme goddess emerged in historical religious literature as a term to define the powerful and influential nature of female deities in India Throughout history goddesses have been portrayed as the mother of the universe through whose powers the universe is created and destroyed The gradual changes in belief through time shape the concept of Bhuvaneswari and express how the different Goddesses though very different in personality all carry the power of the universe on their shouldersShe is almighty

Lakshmi also called Sri or Sri Lakshmi is an important goddess of Hindus Lakshmi is the epitome of everything good and prosperous in the world She as the power behind Lord Vishnu aids in the preservation of the world Lakshmi like Vishnu has many incarnation the most important ones being Sita and Radha

In Sanskrit language Parvati means a daughter of the mountains the Himalayas Goddess Parvati is the wife of Shiva one of the three main gods of the Hindus If she is shown seated by the side of Shiva she has two arms If she comes alone she has four arms She rides on a tiger or a lion

Saraswati is the goddess of speech and learning Vedas tells about her Her image shows that she has four arms In her hands she holds a book a rosary a pot of water and a lute 

In ancient times there was also a river named the Saraswati River The river dried up long ago This river was also considered a form of this goddess

Sita is one of the most popular goddesses of Hindus Hindus of north India especially worship her She is an avatar of Lakshmi She was married to Rama an avatar of Vishnu Hindu scriptures say that Vishnu and Laxmi are husband and wife

The word Radha means riches and success Her name comes with the name of Krishna another avatar of Vishnu Some Hindu scriptures describe her as a form or avatar of goddess Lakshmi

Muhammad Ali Jinnah also spelled Mohammad or Mahomed Ali Jinnah was an Indian Muslim After the partition of India he became the Governor General of Pakistan As a mark of respect Pakistanis call him as Quaid e Azam Quid e Azam is a phrase of Urdu language meaning the great leader People also call him as Baba I Quam another phrase of Urdu language meaning the father of the nation His birth and death anniversaries are national holidays in Pakistan

Jinnahs birth name was Muhammad Ali Jinnahbhai He was born in Karachi The earliest record of his school register gives his date of birth as 20 October 1875 Sarojini Naidu the author of Jinnahs first biography gives another date of his birth namely the 25 December 1876

His fathers name was Jinnahbhai Poonja and his mothers name was Mithibai Jinnah was the eldest of the seven children of Jinnahbhai Poonja and Mithibai His family had migrated to Sindh from the Kathiawar area of Gujarat India

His family belonged to the branch of Ismaili Islam Jinnah read in many schools His last school was named the Christian Missionary Society High School in Karachi At home his family talked in Gujarati language But the family members also knew Kutchi language Sindhi language and English language but widely understood although did not speak in Urdu

In 1887 Jinnah went to London and worked for few years for a company Before going to London he was married to Emibai She was his distant relative At the time of her marriage Emibai was around 14 or 16 years old But Emibai died shortly after Jinnah had gone to London At around the same time his mother also died

In 1894 Jinnah quit his job to study law He joined the course at Lincolns Inn and graduated in 1896 While still in London he also started to participate in politics He greatly admired Indian political leaders Dadabhai Naoroji and Sir Pherozeshah Mehta Gradually Jinnah was developing his own political outlook He was thinking on the line that India should have a constitutional self government

Around this time his father lost his business This put Jinnah under great difficulty In the meantime he had started to practice as a lawyer in Mumbai He also built a house in Mumbais Malabar Hill area The house is now known as Jinnah House

He became a successful lawyer Bal Gangadhar Tilak a famous leader of India once used Jinnah to work as a lawyer Tilak was facing charges of sedition against the British Raj Jinnah pleaded the case beautifully But Tilak was sent to prison

Jinnah had already joined the Indian National Congress in 1896 The Congress was the largest political organization in India Many members and leaders of the Indian National Congress favored a limited self government for India Jinnah also held the same view At that time his role model was Gopal Krishna Gokhale

On January 25 1910 Jinnah became a member on the sixty member Imperial Legislative Council He was an active member of the Council Like many other leaders of India Jinnah also supported the Great Britain during the World War I The leaders had supported the Great Britain thinking that after the war Great Britain shall grant Indians political freedom

At the beginning Jinnah had avoided to join the All India Muslim League another political organization of India Muslims had formed the League in 1906 In 1913 Jinnah became a member of the Muslim League In 1916 he became the president of the Muslim League He helped in making an agreement between the Congress and the Muslim League The agreement tried to present a united front to the British for giving India self government dominion status in the British Empire This was similar to the dominion status which Canada New Zealand and Australia had at that time

In 1918 Jinnah married again His second wife was Rattanbai Petit She was twenty four years younger to him She was the daughter of Jinnahs personal friend sir Dinshaw Petit Petit belonged to Parsi Zoroastrian community Many Parsis and Muslims did not like this marriage between persons of two religions The Jinnah couple resided in Mumbai and frequently traveled to Europe In 1919 his wife bore a daughter The daughter was named Dina

By 1918 Mohandas Gandhi had become one of the main leaders of the Congress Party Gandhi took a line of non violent protest for gaining self government for India Jinnah took a different line He wanted constitutional struggle to gain the self government for India Jinnah also opposed Gandhis support for the Khilafat movement Gradually many differences between them had arisen In 1920 Jinnah left the Congress party He became the president of the Muslim League At this time Jinnah brought out a program to reduce the differences between the Congress Party and the Muslim League The program had fourteen points of action Therefore it became popular as Jinnahs fourteen points But the Congress party did not accept these

All these years Jinnahs personal life had suffered This was the result of his political work Due to his political work he could not pay attention to his personal life Due to this reason his marriage also suffered Finally the couple separated in 1927 After a serious illness Rattanbai died

Around that time there was a conference of Indian leaders with the government of Great Britain It is known as the Round Table Conference It was held in London Jinnah criticized the policy of Gandhi The conference failed Jinnah was also not happy with the Muslim League He decided to quit politics He again started to work as a lawyer in England During all these years his sister Fatima Jinnah took care of Jinnahs affairs both at home and outside She also became a close advisor to him She helped him in raising Jinnahs daughter Dina Wadia The daughter married Neville Wadia a Parasi who had converted to Christianity Jinnah did not like this marriage but continued to correspond with his daughter

Many Muslim leaders of India like Aga Khan Coudhary Rahmat Ali and Sir Muhammad Iqbal requested Jinnah to come back to India 

The leaders of the Muslim league wanted to take charge of the Muslim League Jinnah agreed to come back to India In 1934 he left London and returned to India to reorganize Muslim league again But he could not revive the stature of the party till the elections of 1937 as Muslim League could not win much seats in it His differences with the Congress Party continued to become bigger In 1930 some Muslim leaders had argued for a separate country for Muslim of India At last he came to the conclusion that Hindus and Muslims cannot live in a single country Jinnah also started to have the idea of a separate country for Muslims of India Jinnah and the Muslim League started work to get such a separate country This country was to be named Pakistan

In 1941 Jinnah founded a newspaper named the dawn The newspaper published views and political thinking of the Muslim League During the World War II Jinnah supported the British but opposed the Quit India movement of the Congress party In 1944 Gandhi held 14 rounds of talks with Jinnah but they could not come to any conclusion By this time the Muslim League had formed governments in some provinces and had also entered the central government

After the Second World War the Great Britain started steps to give independence to India On 16 May 1946 the British announced plan for a united India One month after on 16 June 1946 the British announced another plan to partition the British Raj into two countries one for the Hindus and one for the Muslims

The Congress Party accepted the plan of the 16 May 1946 The Muslim League under Jinnahs leadership accepted both the plans But on 16 August 1946 Jinnah also announced the Direct Action to achieve independence for Pakistan a separate country of Muslims of the former British Raj After several rounds of discussion the British Raj was partitioned into two countries India and Pakistan In 1971 Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan

British Raj of India was partitioned into two countries namely India and Pakistan Jinnah became the first Governor General of Pakistan his sister Fatimah Jinnah became the Mother of the Nation He also became the president of Pakistans constituent assembly In an address to the constituent assembly on 11 August 1947 Jinnah told about the future of Pakistan as a secular state He told this in the following words

You may belong to any religion caste or creed  that has nothing to do with the business of the state In due course of time Hindus will cease to be Hindus and Muslims will cease to be Muslims not in the religious sense because that is the personal faith of each individual but in the political sense as citizens of the state

Jinnah also took the direct charge of the government After the partition large scale violence between Muslims and the Hindus took place Such violence was very serious in Punjab and Bengal Jinnah toured the areas with Hindu leaders from India to calm down the persons Several persons died in the violence The estimates of death vary from two hundred thousand deaths to over a million deaths Jinnah was personally very sad at all these happenings

Soon after independence of India and Pakistan armed conflict broke out in Kashmir Kashmirs king had agreed to become a part of India but mostly Muslims of Kashmir did not like this They started fighting in Kashmir India had to send his troops to Kashmir which had become a part of India India raised the issue to the United Nations The United Nations ordered the conflict to end and a Plebiscite This problem still continues to have a bad effect on the India Pakistan relationship

Jinnahs role in creation of Pakistan as a new nation was very important This made him very popular among the people of Pakistan In East Pakistan people opposed Jinnahs view that Urdu language should be the sole national language

Jinnah had been suffering from tuberculosis since the early 1940s Only his sister and very few other persons close to the family knew this After partition of India and creation of Pakistan he had become the governor general of Pakistan His work has increased but his health was deteriorating To regain his health he spent many months at his official rest house The rest house was located at a place named in Ziarat Jinnah could not regain his health He died on 11 September 1948 from tuberculosis and lung cancer

At the place of his funeral the government of Pakistan has constructed a big mausoleum His house named Jinnah House is under the possession of the government of India The government of India wants to give the house to the government of Pakistan But the position is not clear till now

In recent years some scholars have given some new views about Jinnahs actions Jinnah showed interest that some of the Hindu majority princely states should join Pakistan These scholars argue that this view was against Jinnahs declared view that Hindus and Muslims could live together

Some historians like H M Seervai and Ayesha Jalal say that Jinnah wanted a united South Asia He demanded a separate state for Muslims as the Congress leaders were not willing to share power with the Muslim League

Indian leaders belonging to the Bhartiya Janta Party like Lal Krishna Advani praised Jinnah Jaswant Singh was expelled from the party because he had praised Jinnah in his book Jinnah India Partition and Independence

In memory of Jinnah nations and people have done many things In Pakistan he is called Quid e Azam His pictures appear on many Pakistani banknotes and coins Karachis international airport is named after him In 1998 a new university in Karachi was named the Mohammad Ali Jinnah University

There are many other places and institutions bearing his name In many other countries also some places are named after Jinnah For example in Turkey a very large street is named after him In Iran one of the highways of its capital city Tehran bears his name in Mumbai Jinnah Hall a public hall is named after him

Jinnah was never against the Ahmadi sect in Pakistan and regarded them as Muslim brothers which was scorned by the Muslim Mullahs and also a part of their hatred

The first foreign Minister Of Pakistan in Jinnahs time was an Ahmadi Sir Muhammad Zafarullah Khan the only Foreign Minister who had a title and he was also called to the bar at Lincolns Inn as Magistrate as well as other achievements

Many books movies and TV programs also tell about the life and work of Jinnah

Gregor Johann Mendel was an Austrian monk and botanist 

He founded genetics by his work cross breeding pea plants He discovered dominant and recessive characters from the crosses he performed on the plants in his greenhouse What he learnt is known today as Mendelian inheritance

Mendel used the edible pea for his crosses He selected seven characters which were distinctive and never blended they occurred as either or alternatives Examples plant height colour of peas position of flowers 

When he crossed varieties which differed in a trait the first generation of hybrids showed only one of the two alternatives One character was dominant and the other recessive But when he crossed these hybrids with each other the recessive character reappeared in the second generation The proportion of plants showing the dominant as opposed to the recessive character was close to 3 to 1 Further analysis of the descendants of the dominant group showed that one third of them were true breeding and two thirds were of hybrid constitution The 31 ratio could therefore be rewritten as 121 meaning that 50 percent of the F2 generation were true breeding and 50 percent were still hybrid This was Mendels major discovery 

It could all be summed up by saying that inheritance was not blending as Darwin had thought it was particulate The factors were not merged or mixed they stayed separate and were passed on to the next generation unchanged

He published his work in 1865 but at the time no one saw how significant it was 35 years later the papers were rediscovered and immediately modern genetics began

An interplanetary internet does not exist yet When people talk about an interplanetary internet they are talking about a problem they are still trying to solve  the problem of making the internet to work between different planets

The way the internet works here on Earth is simple Computers need to connect to each and can share a network One computer sends another computer a message and then the other sends back a message saying it got it This works fine because the messages only take a second to get back and forth But if you were sending that message to Mars it would take about ten minutes for the message to get there and another ten for it to get back That means we need to completely change the way computers talk to each other if we are going to communicate between different planets That is the problem people are trying to solve when they talk about the interplanetary internet Its a new and a very interesting concept

The History of China covers thousands of years It covers many periods and dynasties It may be divided into the following parts

About a million years ago living beings that were earlier forms of human beings had lived in China These beings were called Homo erectus Long after about 65000 years before human beings reached China from Africa For food they used to hunt wild animals Then they also started to pick and to gather fruits Then these ancient Chinese learnt farming

Prehistory means history of a time before any written record In such cases it is very difficult to tell anything definite about the prehistory of China or any other country Even then historians believe some facts about the China of that period By 5000 BC people had learnt farming They had started cultivating millet a type of grain and possibly some more types of grains By 2500 BC Bronze Age has come to China Ruling class with kings and queens had come into society 

 Xia Dynasty  Some scholars think that about 4000 years ago Xia dynasty ruled China Xia was the first ruler of this dynasty But no one can say anything very definite about Xia and his time and other rulers of his dynasty 

From the time of the Shang Dynasty some written history is available Writings were done on Oracle Bones Several such bones and shells have been found Scholars believe that present day Henan was the last capital of kings of the Shang Dynasty Henan was the last and the ninth capital 

Most of the Chinese historians of that time think that one dynasty came after another But it is possible that two dynasties were ruling in different parts of China at the same time Therefore some scholars think that Xia dynasty and Shang Dynasty may be ruling at the same time but in different areas of China

About 3000 years before Zhou Dynasty defeated Shang dynasty and came to power They changed the capital from Henan to a place near present day Xian near the Yellow River The Zhou Dynasty also brought a new theory This theory told the people that kings had the order of the gods to rule the country Almost all dynasties of Chinese rulers continued to repeat this theory The kings of this dynasty won many new areas For the first time in the history of China large number of persons also moved from one area to other area for settlement

Spring and Autumn Period is another period of history of China The time was around 8th century BC Zhou dynasty continued but it lost its power Many kings ruled different parts of China China became like several small countries each ruled by a different king In some cases a king ruled just a village with a small fort 

During this period of China many new lines of thinking arose Some of them still continue to be important They are Confucianism Taoism Legalism and Mohism

Spring and Autumn Period continued for about 300 years By the 5th century BC only seven main Chinese rulers and states remained They had taken over all the smaller areas These states continued to fight each other Historians call this period as Warring States Period due to wars and fights among these states At last a king named Ying Zheng united all the seven states He made himself the Emperor of China and founded the Qin Dynasty

Qin Dynasty was a very important dynasty in the history of China They followed philosophy of Legalist Their capital was at Xianyang Under the kings of this dynasty China became a powerful country Many new things were done for the first time A tight legal system was followed Written language was developed Common currency was used The building of the Great Wall of China was started

The Han Dynasty came to power in 202 BC They followed the philosophy of Confucianism Under this dynasty china made much progress in arts and science The empire also became larger and larger China started trading with a number of other countries Merchants used the Silk Road to reach China The Han dynasty is important the Three Kingdoms period is a period in the history of China part of an era of disunity called the Six Dynasties following immediately the loss of de facto power of the Han Dynasty emperors

The Sui Dynasty was founded by Emperor Wen or Yang Jian Its capital was Changan The dynasty is important because it reunited Southern and Northern China and the Grand Canal was build in that time

The Tang Dynasty was founded by the Li family who came to power during the fall of the Sui Empire The dynasty was interrupted for a short time by the Second Zhou Dynasty when Empress Wu Zetian managed to claim the throne becoming the first and only Chinese Empress

The capital of the Tang Changan was the biggest city in the world at the time Many historians see the Tang dynasty as a high point in Chinese civilization and as a golden age of broken wikt linkcosmopolitancosmopolitan culture

The Yuan Dynasty was first ruled by Genghis Khan a Mongolian leader who took control from the Song Dynasty He was considered a barbarian and not civilized His grandson Kublai Khan was one of the most famous and liked rulers of the Yuan dynasty He opened up China to many other cultures and improved life for the Chinese very much

In 1368 a rebellion led by Zhu Yuanzhang broke out in southern China and eventually overthrew the Yuan Dynasty Then Zhu Yuanzhang founded the Ming Dynasty at Nanjing its capital until Emperor Yongle changed the capital to Beijing In the 15th century a man named Zheng He took the majority of the Ming navy and explored the Indian Ocean and brought wealth and power to the Ming Dynasty The empire experienced a prosperous period until 1449 when the Battle of Tumu Fortress broke out In the battle the Mongol descendants of Yuan captured the emperor and surrounded the capital After the war with the Mongols the Ming started to decline During this time the empire had two wars with the Japanese and one war with the Portugese of Macao These wars eventually weakened the declining empire In 1616 rebellions broke out at Manchuria and Shanxi Twenty eight years later the Manchus crossed the Great Wall invaded the capital and destroyed the Shanxi rebels

Queens University is a public university in Kingston Ontario Canada Queens University was started on October 16 1841 

A string quartet is a piece of music for four string instruments A string quartet can also mean the four people who play a piece for four string instruments The four instruments in a string quartet are almost always 2 violins 1 viola and 1 cello The reason that a double bass is not used is that it would sound too loud and heavy The balance between 2 violins viola and cello is perfect String quartets are the most popular form of chamber music Many composers have written string quartets

String quartet writing started in the 18th century Italian composers like Sammartini wrote music for two violins viola and continuo The continuo was either just a harpsichord or harpsichord with cello Gradually composers started to leave the harpsichord out The cello often played the same as the viola but one octave lower 

Composers of the Classical music period started writing cello parts which had a life of their own Joseph Haydn wrote many string quartets making it a very popular form His quartets from op33 were he said written in a new and special way All four parts were very clear and individual There were always four movements a fast movement a slow one a Minuet and Trio and a fast Finale Haydn often played in a quartet with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and two other players Mozart also wrote lots of string quartets and dedicated some of them to Haydn Three of Mozarts later ones were written for the King of Prussia who played the cello well so Mozart gave the cello lots of difficult music to play

By the time Ludwig van Beethoven was growing up string quartets treated each of the four instruments as important Beethoven wrote 16 string quartets The middle ones became particularly famous and later composers took ideas from them for example the slow introductions and the idea of having a fast scherzo instead of a minuet and trio for one of the middle movements Beethovens last quartets are very beautiful but also very complicated and sometimes quite aggressive Beethoven was becoming very frustrated because he was deaf and could not hear his own music but he could imagine it all in his head Franz Schubert admired them and wrote several string quartets himself

In the Romantic period many composers wrote string quartets Felix Mendelssohn Robert Schumann Johannes Brahms Pyotr Tchaikovsky Antonn Dvok and many others Some of them like Dvok included folk song from their own country in their quartets

In the 20th century composers have continued to write string quartets Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel each wrote one Arnold Schoenberg even added a voice to his first String Quartet Bla Bartk wrote six string quartets which are very hard to play They have very exciting rhythms which often come from his native Hungarian folk music as well as complicated harmonies Dmitri Shostakovich wrote fifteen and Benjamin Britten wrote three

Playing in a string quartet is great fun There are lots of great works by famous composers as well as some music which has been written for young players who are learning

There are professional players who form string quartets and who play together for many years In the early part of the 20th century the Ros Quartet was thought to be the best in Europe Later the Amadeus Quartet became very famous

Opus or the shortened form op after the title of a piece of music means work It is followed by a number When a composer writes his or her first piece of music it could be called opus 1 The next composition would then be called opus 2 etc

Giving pieces of music opus numbers helps us to know which piece of music it is For example Beethoven wrote lots of piano sonatas His Piano sonata in A flat major op26 is a sonata he wrote when he was a young man Many years later he wrote another piano sonata which is also in A flat major and that one has the opus number 110

You cannot always tell from a composers opus numbers the order in which the works were composed Until around the end of the 18th century opus numbers were only given to pieces of music which were published

Some musicologists have studied all the works by a famous composer and have given them a catalogue number For example Mozarts music does not have opus numbers Some of them are long operas others are tiny little pieces for the piano he might have written in a hurry one day A man called Kchel made a list of every single work by Mozart and gave them K numbers His numbering goes up to 622 This is useful for example to tell the difference between his Symphony in G minor K183 and his Symphony in G minor K550

The plural of opus is opuses in English This is because the Latin plural is opera which is rather confusing 

The word opus can also refer to the work of an artist

An artists magnum opus means his or her greatest work

History of India covers thousands of years It covers many periods and dynasties It may be divided in the following parts

Some old fossils found in India indicate presence of living beings called Homo Erectus Archeologists think that these beings were living in India between 200000 to 500000 years ago This period is known as the paleolithic era Human beings settled in the Indian subcontinent at least 12000 years before At that time the last Ice Age had just ended First settlements of human beings in India are found in Bhimbetka a place near Bhopal

Bronze Age was an important period of Indias prehistory From this time onwards a solid base for more development came 

The Vedas are the oldest texts of India There are four Vedas and the first one is the Rigveda The other three are Samveda Yajurveda and Atharvaveda The Vedas have verses in praise of gods and others They also have other information At that time the society was pastoral After the Rigveda society became more agricultural People became divided into four classes depending on the type of the work Brahmins were priests and teachers Khastriyas were the warriors Vaishyas did agriculture trading and commerce The shudras were the general working class This type of social division is called the Varna system in Hinduism 

During the period of the Vedic civilization there were many Aryan clans and tribes Some of them combined and became bigger like the kingdom of the Kurus

Islam spread across the Indian subcontinent over a period of 500 years In the 10th and 11th centuries Turks and Afghans invaded India and established sultanates in Delhi In the early 16th century descendants of Genghis Khan swept across the Khyber Pass and established the Mughal Dynasty which lasted for 200 years From the 11th to the 15th centuries southern India was dominated by Hindu Chola and Vijayanagar Dynasties During this time the two systems the prevailing Hindu and Muslim mingled leaving lasting cultural influences on each other

Out of the sixteen Mahajanapadas noted below kingdom of Magadha became most powerful It had a big army It started to rule other nearby kingdoms Ashoka was the most famous ruler of the Magadha empire

Many historians believe that the Shishunaga dynasty founded the Magadha empire in 684 BC Rajgriha was their capital city After some years they changed the capital from Rajgriha to Pataliputra Present day name of Pataliputra is Patna Shishunaga dynasty ruled till 424 BC Then Nanda dynasty came to power

During this period Buddhism and Jainism two religions became important

Nanda dynasty ruled India for about 100 years Mahapadma Nanda of this dynasty died at the age of 88 His rule lasted longest among other kings of this dynasty The last king of this dynasty was Dhana Nanda

In 321 BC Chandragupta Maurya defeated Dhana Nanda Chandragupta founded the Maurya dynasty Under his rule almost all parts of India become united under one single government Chandragupta Maurya conquered large parts of nearby areas At that time Indian borders touched Persia and Central Asia He also conquered Gandhara and made all several such areas part of India His son Bindusara also conquered many nearby areas 

Bindusaras son Ashoka continued to conquer more and more areas But when he saw so many dead persons in the Kalingas war he felt very bad He became a Buddhist and stopped the policy of fighting and conquering new areas He started to follow the path of Ahmisa He sent persons to several parts of India and nearby countries like China and Sri Lanka to preach Buddhism He also got messages engraved on rocks about Ahmisa Ashoka is considered one of the best rulers the world has ever seen 

After about 50 years of Ashokas death Shunga dynasty came to power in 185 BC Pusyamitra Sunga was the first king of this dynasty

The Satavahanas came to power from around 230 BC They are also called Andhras For about 450 years many Satavahanas kings ruled most parts of the southern and central India After that they became weak for various reasons Major reasons for their weakness was fights among themselves and fighting with the Sakas

For about 350 years from the years 35 405 Saka kings ruled India They ruled the western and central parts of India Now a days these areas are parts of the present days Indian states of Gujarat Maharashtra Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh There were 27 such independent rulers Collectively they are called the Kshatrapas 

The Gupta dynasty reigned from around 320 to 550 AD The Gupta Empire covered most of North central India the region Gupta Empire and what is now western India and Bangladesh Gupta society was ordered in accordance with Hindu beliefs The time of the Gupta Empire is seen as Golden Age of India Historians place the Gupta dynasty alongside with the Han Dynasty Tang Dynasty and Roman Empire as a model of a classical civilization

In the history of India Middle kingdoms of India covers a period beginning from around the 6th 7th century In South India Chola kings ruled Tamil Nadu and Chera kings ruled Kerala They also had trading relationships with the Roman Empire to the west and Southeast Asia to the east In north India Rajputs ruled in many kingdoms Some of such kingdoms continued for hundreds of years

The Pratihara kings ruled kingdoms in Rajasthan and some other parts of northern India from the 6th century to the 11th century The Palas ruled the eastern part of India They ruled over areas which are now parts of the Indian states of Bihar Jharkhand and the west Bengal and of Bangladesh The Palas ruled from 8th century to the 12th century In the southern parts of India Rashtrakutas of Malakheda ruled the Deccan during the 8th 10th centuries after the end of Chalukya rule All these three dynasties always tried to control the entire north India During all this time lasting for three to four hundred years the Chola kings were growing in power and influence

In the 6th century several Rajput kingdoms came into being in Rajasthan Many other Rajput kings ruled in different parts of north India Some of these kingdoms continue to survive for hundreds of years during different periods of the history of India

In 1336 two brothers named Harihara and Bukka founded the Vijayanagara Empire in an area which is now in Karnataka state of India The most famous king of this empire was Krishnadevaraya In 1565 rulers of this empire were defeated in a battle But the empire continued for about next one hundred years 

The Kingdom of Mysore was a kingdom of southern India People known as Wodeyars founded this kingdom in the year 1400 Later on Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan fought with the Wodeyar rulers They also fought with the forces of the British Raj but were defeated Under the British Raj Wodeyar kings continued to rule a large part of Karnataka When India became independent on 15th August 1947 Wodeyars kingdom chose to become a part of India

Guru Nanak founded Sikhism and his followers were called Sikhs The power of Sikhs continued to increase in the northwestern part of India The Sikhs became rulers of large part of the northwestern India This is called the Sikh Empire Ranjit Singh was the most famous ruler of the Sikh Empire He expanded the borders of the Sikh Empire and at the time of his death this empire covered areas of Punjab and present day Kashmir and parts of Pakistan The Sikhs and forces of the British Raj fought many wars Till Maharaja Ranjit Singh was alive Britishers were not able to cross the Sutlej river After his death the they took over the entire Punjab after battles with disorganised sikh troops

For a short period a person named Ahmed Shah Durrani ruled some parts of northwestern India Historians have named his rule as the Durrani Empire In 1748 he crossed the Indus River and attacked Lahore now a part of Pakistan He also attacked many parts of Punjab Then he attacked Delhi At that time Delhi was the capital of the Mughal Empire He took many valuable things from India This included the famous diamond named Kohinoor

Colonial period means the period during which Western countries ruled India These countries also ruled many other countries of Asia Africa and South America

Starting in the 1600s the British East India Company began a very profitable trading empire in India centered in Bengal In the mid 1700s Robert Clive lead the Company to an expanded influence in India with victories over the French the Bengalis and the Mughals With a victory at the Battle of Plassey in 1757 Clive became the first British Governor of Bengal

In the hundred years after the battle the East India Company conquered the entire subcontinent of India They did this by trade political intrigue and direct military action The British were very efficient administrators of their domains But in 1857 the Indian Mutiny almost destroyed the Companys rule of India Afterward the British government took control away from the Company In 1858 India became a part of the British Empire and queen Victoria became the empress of India

The British Raj For ninety years the British ruled India and Burma as a unified territory under the British king or queen It was divided into eight provinces each with a governor These provinces were Burma Bengal Madras Bombay UP Central Provinces Punjab and Assam A Governor General in Calcutta was head of the government

The British did bad things They took valuables tortured and raped many Indians  The way they conquered India was often divide and rule In the end many kingdoms were defeated by the British and the riches taken For example many of the Royal Crown Jewels were taken from previous kingdoms in India including the Koh I Noor diamond Also they stole many other large diamonds and gold 

During famines and floods many people died because the government did not help enough Any Indian not able to pay the British taxes could be forced into prison andor publicly beaten Political opponents were jailed and sometimes killed for speaking out against colonial rule After taking much of the Indias natural resources for hundreds of years England was criticized for not protecting Indians during the partition of India and Pakistan During the partition of India and Pakistan millions of Indians and Pakistanis died 

The British also did good things They built railroads telegraphs and telephones improved trade standardized laws and water supplies Many of these things were done to help improve commerce in India and taxes provided to England They created the Indian Civil Service for administering rules and regulations They also tried to eliminate practices like burning widows

The British ruled India primarily for the economic benefit of Britain India produced cheap raw materials for British industry Indians had to buy British manufactured goods and profits went back to Britain

Many people in India wanted to be free from British rule The struggle for independence was long and difficult The most important leader of the struggle for Indian independence was Mohandas Gandhi Gandhi believed in non violent opposition to the British

India won its independence along with Muslim Pakistan and became a free country on August 15 1947

On 15 August 1947 British Indian Empire was partitioned into two countries India and Pakistan With this the British Raj in the Indian subcontinent ended On 26 January 1950 Hindustan adopted a constitution From that day Hindustanis became the Republic of India or Indians

During last 60 years Republic of India has seen different stages in its national life Some of them are as follows

Presently India is currently the tenth largest economy in terms of gross GDP It is the 4th largest economy of the world when accounting for purchasing power parity Some economists think that in coming decades Indias economy will become still larger

Life and Times of Michael K is a novel written by J M Coetzee in 1983 It won a Booker Prize

The story is about a simple gardener called Michael K trying to run away from South Africa in the Apartheid Era

Some people think there is a link between Michael K and Josef K in The Trial by Franz Kafka

Tort law is the part of law for most harms that are not either criminal or based on a contract For example a car accident where one driver hurts another driver because he or she was not paying attention might be a tort If a person is hurt by someone else he or she can sue in court

Many torts are accidents like car accidents or slippery floors that make people fall down and get hurt But some torts are done on purpose These are called intentional torts For example if one person punches another person in the nose it might be an intentional tort called battery

Many torts cause physical harm to people Some torts cause damage to property like a broken window Some torts can harm other things like someones reputation or a business

The kinds of torts this article talks about are a part of the common law The common law is found in England and former British colonies such as the United States of America Different laws are found in civil law countries such as France or Germany

Torts are what happens when one person injures another The person or organization that causes the injury is known as a tortfeasor The person who is injured is often called the victim

The victim may sue the tortfeasor The people or organizations on each side of a lawsuit are called the parties In a lawsuit the victim is called the plaintiff The tortfeasor is called the defendant

Usually the plaintiff in a lawsuit is asking the court to make the defendant pay money to make up for the harm that the defendant caused For example the money that the plaintiff asks for might pay for the plaintiffs medical bills if he or she was hurt in an accident For some torts especially ones done on purpose the plaintiff might also ask the court to punish the defendant by making him or her pay extra money Money that the court orders the defendant to pay is called damages Sometimes a plaintiff also asks the court to order the defendant to stop doing something like polluting the air or water An order to stop doing something is called an broken wikt linkinjunctioninjunction

Sometimes the same act can be both a tort and a crime For instance stealing someone elses property might be a criminal offense but it is also a tort against the person who owns the property

When a defendant causes an injury on purpose that injury is an intentional tort Sometimes an injury can be an intentional tort if the defendant knows it will happen even if the defendant does not want it to happen Intentional torts include hitting people and saying things about them that are not true

Unintentional torts are accidents They usually happen because someone was not being careful When someone is not careful it is called negligence An example of negligence is driving a car while not paying attention to the road In a case of negligence the court figures out what happened and decides whether the defendant was careful enough It orders the defendant to pay money only if the defendant was not careful enough

In some kinds of cases it does not matter whether the defendant was careful or not This is called strict liability or absolute liability For example in the United States if someone buys a soda can and it explodes because it was manufactured badly the manufacturer will probably have to pay the victim money even if the court finds that the defendant was as careful as it could be

Physical torts are injuries to a persons body such as hitting them or making them sick

Abstract torts are injuries to a persons mind reputation or property A persons mind or reputation can be injured by saying things about them that are not true A persons property can be injured by taking it from them without permission or saying that it belongs to someone else

Torts that involve people include hitting them saying things about them that are not true and making them stay in one place when they want to leave Hitting someone is called battery Saying things about someone that are not true is called broken wikt linkslanderslander and writing things about someone that are not true is called libel When a police officer takes a person to prison when he or she is not supposed to that is called false imprisonment or false arrest

Torts involving property include walking on someone elses property without permission taking someone elses property without permission or damaging someone elses property Walking on someone elses property without permission is called trespassing Taking someone elses property without permission is called stealing or broken wikt linkconversionconversion

A lawsuit occurs when two people or organizations ask a court or judge to solve a disagreement or argument The two sides of a lawsuit are called the parties Each party is usually represented by a lawyer That means that the lawyer will talk to the judge for the party The party that starts the lawsuit is called the broken wikt linkplaintiffplaintiff because they are complaining about something the other side has done This is also called suing or to sue The other party is called the broken wikt linkdefendantdefendant because it must defend what it has done Both sides or parties will show evidence or proof that they are right and the other side or party is wrong The parties may also ask witnesses questions about what the argument or disagreement is about

After both parties have shown evidence and asked witnesses questions the judge or jury will decide which party is right Then the court will do something to make the winning party happy again The court might make the losing party pay the winner money or it might make the losing party stop doing something that made the winner unhappy

Chamber music means music written for small groups of instruments A chamber is a room Usually the word chamber in English means a room in a large house or castle In the days when people with big houses or castles kept their own musicians they might have their own private orchestra which played in the large hall Sometimes there would be a concert in a small chamber This was called chamber music

Chamber music can be any group of instruments from two up to about eight or nine Each player will be playing something different from the others Compare that to an orchestra where there may be for example several violins all playing the same notes

The word chamber is also used for a chamber orchestra meaning a small orchestra By contrast a large orchestra is often called a symphony orchestra A small choir may be called a chamber choir But these examples are not usually thought of as chamber music

These words are used to show how many people are playing They can also be used for groups of singers

Chamber music for instruments became popular as something different from big orchestras The orchestra developed in the 17th century and so did chamber music Composers wrote trio sonatas which were for two high instruments and a continuo accompaniment Arcangelo Corelli and Johann Sebastian Bach wrote many trio sonatas

Joseph Haydn wrote lots of string quartets He made this combination popular Mozart and Beethoven also wrote some very great string quartets The last ones that Beethoven wrote were very difficult to play and to understand but composers of the 19th century like Schubert Schumann Mendelssohn and Brahms were inspired by them In the twentieth century some of the best string quartets were written by Bartk and Shostakovich 

It is great fun to play chamber music because each player is an individual It is like having a conversation in music There is no conductor so each musician has to listen carefully to the others and learn to play together as a small team The musicians can also hear their own playing better than they can in an orchestra Some living composers have written a lot of music for young players who are not very advanced Some of Mozarts earlier string quartets are not too difficult and make an excellent introduction to chamber music playing

Circumcision cuts off the foreskin on the penis of a boy or man Circumcision can be a religious ritual or a custom in certain tribes or a medical practice There are five kinds of reasons for doing a circumcision

People disagree about whether circumcision is a good for health and sexual pleasure Those who believe that the foreskin is important for sexual pleasure are against circumcision Others do not like circumcision because they believe it has no medical advantage or that it is easy to clean under the foreskin or that circumcision harms the penis or the mind and finally point out the penis belongs to its owner to do as with as he wishes when he is older enough to decide for himself It should not be the choice of the doctors or parents

Those who prefer circumcision believe that circumcision reduces sexually transmitted diseases prevents certain kinds of cancer and gets rid of infections and unpleasant smells under the foreskin Those who prefer circumcision often believe that the foreskin does not matter for sexual pleasure

There are 4 large groups of circumcised men

Australia Canada New Zealand and the United Kingdom used to circumcise baby boys but no longer do so

Otherwise most men are not circumcised

As with all medical procedures sometimes things go wrong From the worst thing that could go wrong at the bottom here is a list of them

The Moirae were the three goddesses of destiny in Greek mythology They were Clotho Lachesis and Atropos

They controlled the life and destiny of everyone Klotho spins the thread of life Lachesis measures it and Atropos cuts the thread When the thread is cut the person dies The Moirae are incapable of killing an immortal

The decisions of the Moriae about a persons life cannot be changed Even Zeus is powerless to change their will1

The parents of the Moirae are not surely known Some said they were the daughters of Zeus and the Titaness Themis or of primordial beings like Nyx Chaos or Ananke 

Their Roman equivalent were the Parcae

Whaling is the practice of hunting whales This is done to get meat and oil called blubber Whaling has been done at least since 3000 BC 

Many communities on the coast have done whaling for food for a long time They have also killed stranded whales

Industrialisation started in the 17th century and also affected whaling Special ships were built for whaling and whales were hunted until they were almost extinct 

As technology increased and demand for the seemingly vast resources remained high catches far exceeded the carrying capacity of whale stocks In the late 1930s more than 50000 whales were killed each year By the middle of the 20th century whale stocks could not recover In 1986 the International Whaling Commission introduced a moratorium on commercial whaling so that stocks might recover

This moratorium was successful and permits whale stocks to recover There is a debate about whaling in general Countries which are in favor of whaling want to do away with the moratorium so they can again hunt whales as they did before Countries and environmental groups say that whaling is immoral and that stocks have not yet recovered sufficiently As whaling is immoral it should be banned

Whales have a thick layer of fat under their skin called blubber For many years the Eskimos of Alaska depended on these whales to live Every part of a whale was used the bones the blubber and the skin  every bit of it In this way one whale could feed an Eskimo community for a long time They were important to the Eskimos However sometimes a good thing can get out of control and become a bad thing This was what happened in whale hunting

Whale blubber was not used only by Eskimos Soon it became a product everybody wanted This was because before electricity was invented blubber was used as oil for lamps They also used whale blubber to oil machines and make lots of expensive makeup Because of this people hunted and killed whales to make money

The whalers found out the paths whales liked to take in the ocean and killed them mercilessly It was a dangerous and frightening jobWhalers would jump into a small boat and follow the whale Once they were close to it they would throw a broken wikt linkharpoonharpoon that was attached to a very long rope into the whale The end of this harpoon was not at all like a spear It had a switch blade on the end that would stay in the whales skin Once the harpoon was in the whale the whale would start swimming as fast as it could The whale might swim day and night with no stop for several days Eventually the tired and hurt whale would stop The whalers would then kill the whale with one last harpoon When the animal died the whalers would haul the whale onto the ship skin it then boil the blubber for the oil

Soon boats began getting bigger Whalers began using a harpoon like before but the harpoon has a broken wikt linkgrenadegrenade inside This was very cruel way of killing whales as it hurt them a lot The whale would then have blood coming out of its blowhole This meant the poor whale would die soon

Sometimes entire whale families were found and as many were killed as possible Because of whaling lots of whales became almost extinct 

More happily whales are protected by broken wikt linkconserveconservation laws that stop people from killing too many of them Also chemists invented many products thta take the place of whale blubber and electricity too was invented Now many countries have agreed not to hunt whales because otherwise all the whales might die They signed a treaty a piece agreeing on this though Norway and Japan still hunt whales Russia is also practising whaling but not in such a huge way

An opinion is something a person or a group of people think What is your opinion is like saying What do you think about it

The persons answer might start with In my opinion

Sometimes companies try to find out what people think about something by asking a lot of people their opinion This is called an opinion poll They might be trying to find out whether they think the government is good or bad or whether enough is being done about global warming

A school year is the time of year when students go to school In some countries it starts after summer and goes to the next summer The typical school year in the United States ranges from 262 days to 250 days In the south a school year is 180 days for students and 190 days for teachers

An audience is a group of people that go to see the same thing The people in an audience can each be very different

A group is a set of things or a number of individuals who have regular contact and frequent interaction 

Eating is taking in food to get energy and nutrients People and animals need to eat because they cannot make their own food inside their bodies like plants All plants energy comes from the sun Plants take the suns energy and they are eaten by other animals as food The animals then eat each other for the energy

However many people can not stop themselves from eating and they end up becoming fat or obese You can become fat by eating the wrong unhealthy types of food and by eating too much When a plant collects energy from the sun through its leaves it is called photosynthesis If a plant gets too much food it can just store it until later They do this during the winter When you are proven to be fat or obese through your body mass index it means you are too heavy than the average for your height The taller you are the heavier you should be in theory If someone is too heavy to be called fat then they are called obese When someone eats too much of one thing they become fat Someone can eat junk food but they can also balance themselves by also eating fruits and vegetables 

A bathroom is where people can use the toilet wash their hands take a bath or take a shower The room may also contain a sink often called a wash basin or hand basin and often a lavatory In the United States bathroom mostly means a room containing a lavatory In other countries this is mostly called the toilet or water closet The word bathroom is also used in the United States for a public toilet or restroom

A shower is where a person cleans himself by using water They stand up when they use a shower and usually do not wear clothes in a shower Showers have a shower head that squirts out water

There are different kinds of showers One is a power shower where there are many jets of water from all around Another is the one in the picture Some are in baths and others are on their own

Gangtok is the capital of the Indian state of Sikkim It has a population of 50000 It is located at a height of 1780 metres in the Himalayan Mountains It is small town filled with different cultures and religions living together 

The city has wide roads flyovers markets a modern hospital schools colleges and universities fast food shops discothques and all other modern amenities One imposing man made landmark of the town is the 200 ft high TV tower which overlooks the town and is near the Enchey Monastery below Ganesh Tok 

A transposing instrument is a musical instrument that does not play the notes you might think it will play But all the notes differ from the real notes by the same musical interval So a song played on the transposing instrument will sound familiar but played in a different key That is because the transposing instrument is tuned above or below what the usual notes would be and always above or below by the same number of notes on a scale The usual notes are called concert pitch Most non transposing instruments like pianos are tuned to play in the key of C

When writing music for a transposing instrument or teaching how to play the notes the entire series of notes is written and described as notes moved up or down a number of semitones For example playing the note that is called C on a B flat clarinet produces the note that is called B when played on a piano All transposing instruments such as horn in F or alto saxophone in E mean F and E in normal notes The note C as written and played on the horn in F will sound like an F and the same C written for the alto saxophone in E will sound like E

Woodwinds especially the recorder and clarinets are transposing instruments Saxophones and most brass instruments are transposing instruments

The use of transposed notation probably started with the slow changes in how to make instruments There was a clarinet in C when Mozart was alive but was later replaced by the larger richer sounding clarinet in B There was no change to how clarinet players had to move their fingers That helped players change from the older instrument to the newer instrument Maybe learners of the modern day instrument in B could re learn how to use their fingers so they could play with normal notes But all written music would have to be transposed back to concert pitch

Instruments such as horns and woodwinds have a natural harmonic series so it is easier and louder to play in certain keys So that needs to be remembered when writing music for these instruments Also these instruments can only be played in tune in certain keys because of a problem with something called equal temperament Which keys will work depends on which key the instrument was tuned for

Having transposing instruments makes it possible for pipes to play in several different keys The fingering can remain the same Only the key the music is written in the notes that harmonize with that key and timbre change as the different sizes of instrument are used A cor anglais is like an oboe but a fifth lower Any oboe player can play the cor anglais reading the music and playing with normal oboe fingering It will automatically sound a fifth lower Compare this to recorders which are not transposing instruments On a descant recorder the note played with three fingers of the left hand is a G To play a G on a treble recorder the fingering is 1 2 3 1 2 3 This can be confusing at first but with practice players can get used to changing between the different sizes of recorder

Professional clarinet players will need two clarinets a B flat and an A clarinet Some clarinet cases are made to hold both instruments Some clarinet players also play the bass clarinet This is also in B flat but sounds an octave lower than the ordinary B flat clarinet There is also an E flat clarinet which sounds a minor third higher than written

Saxophones transpose into different keys according to their sizes Brass instruments come in several different keys It is always important for a player to come to a rehearsal or concert with the correct instrument Often brass players become skilled at transposing That means if their music is written in the wrong key for the instrument on which they are playing they can still play it in the right key

Transposition or transposing in music means playing or writing music in a different key Transposing music means making it sound higher or lower

Transposing is a useful skill for people who play an instrument especially the piano or organ If a pianist is accompanying a singer and the song is a little too high for the singers voice it is very useful if he is able to transpose it down so that the music sounds in a lower key For example if the music is written in the key of C major it could be transposed down a whole tone so that it sounds in B flat major

It is a good idea for people who play keyboard instruments or transposing instruments to practise transposing There are three ways to do this

1 Transpose each note For example when transposing from C to B flat each note has to be one tone lower an A becomes a G a G becomes an F an F becomes an E flat etc

2 By watching the shape of the music and thinking in the new key For example when a note leaps up a major third the same needs to happen in the new key This is a better way of transposing

3 By hearing what the music should sound like and thinking in the new key

When people transpose they probably use a mixture of all three of these ways

There is a fourth possibility which sometimes works by thinking in a different clef  For example someone who is good at reading alto clef can transpose up a tone from music written in the treble clef by imagining it was written in the alto clef and playing an octave lower

It is very important to understand the key system in order to be able to transpose This is why it is so useful to practise scales

Most electric keyboards and organs these days have buttons which can be set so that the keyboard will transpose automatically This can be very useful although it may be confusing for people with absolute pitch

The Erinyes were the goddesses of revenge in Greek mythology

They forever followed the person who did a crime and they even could make the person go mad They are often shown with snakes on their heads blood coming out of their eyes and looking very horrific

Very well known is the one time the Erinyes followed Orestes Orestes mother Klytaimnestra and her lover Aegisthos had killed Orestes father Agamemnon The god Apollo told Orestes to kill the murderers of his father which he did Orestes was then pursued by the Erinyes for his crime But with the help of Athena and Apollo Orestes went to a court in Athens It was decided that Orestes had acted right and nobody should hurt him Even the Erinyes accepted the decision and from then on they were also called Eumenides which means the kind ones because they could also let people go in peace if their crime was done for a good reason

The Indian subcontinent is a term mainly used to denote the geographic region surrounded by the Indian Ocean mainly the Republic of India Afghanistan Pakistan Kashmir Nepal Sikkim Bangladesh Sri Lanka Bhutan and Myanmar and few other countries see South Asia

The subcontinent was once part of Gondwana the ancient southern supercontinent Geologically the origin of the Himalayas is the impact of the Indian tectonic plate traveling northward at 15 cm per year to slowly hit the Eurasian continent about 40 50 million years ago The formation of the Himalayan arc resulted since the lighter rock of the seabeds of that time were easily uplifted into mountains An often cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine limestone

About 50 million years ago this fast moving plate had completely closed the Tethys Ocean The existence of the Tethys has been proved by sedimentary rocks settled on the ocean floor and the volcanoes that fringed its edges Since these sediments were light they crumpled into mountain ranges rather than sinking to the floor The Indian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau which forces the plateau to move upwards 

The Indo Australian plate is still moving at 67 mm per year and over the next 10 million years it will travel about 1500 km into Asia About 20 mm per year of the India Asia convergence is absorbed by thrusting along the Himalaya southern front This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5 mm per year making them geologically active The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also leads to earthquakes from time to time

The solo concerto became popular with composers like Antonio Vivaldi who wrote over 400 concertos for various instruments His most famous concertos are a group of four known as The Four Seasons These are violin concertos and each concerto deals in turn with one of the seasons spring summer autumn and winter Many other Baroque composers wrote concertos Johann Sebastian Bach wrote several concertos for violin although only two have survived the others have been lost He also wrote solo concertos for the harpsichord George Frideric Handel wrote concertos for the organ Organs in England were very small in those days and balanced well with an orchestra Handel sometimes put pauses in his concertos where the soloist could improvise some music These improvised bits became known as cadenzas Concertos ever since have cadenzas where the soloist can show how brilliant they are at playing and at improvising Some composers wrote their own cadenzas this is not correct as in because of the poor word choices

In the Classical period Joseph Haydn wrote a few concertos including two for the cello but he is better known for his symphonies It was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart who wrote many wonderful piano concertos This was at a time when the piano was a new instrument Mozart was a brilliant pianist and he wrote most of them for himself to perform He also wrote five violin concertos four horn concertos two flute concertos and a clarinet concerto He also wrote concertos for more than one soloist eg a flute and harp concerto and a violin and viola concerto which he called Sinfonia Concertante By this time concertos always had three movements a fast one a slow one and a fast movement to finish with

Ludwig van Beethoven became famous as a pianist before he was known as a composer He wrote five piano concertos The last one known in English speaking countries as the Emperor Concerto is a very big powerful work which looks forward to the music of the Romantic period Beethoven wrote a beautiful violin concerto At the time everyone thought it was too hard for the soloist to play but as composers wrote harder and harder music the players had to become better and better Nowadays every professional violinist should be able to play it Beethoven also wrote a Triple Concerto for piano violin cello and orchestra

The 19th century is known as the age of Romanticism People adored creative men like artists musicians and writers They were seen as heroes The concerto fitted in very well with this way of thinking The soloist was a great hero and the concerto enabled him to show off his great technique The violinist and composer Niccol Paganini was one of these great heroes He played the violin like no one else had ever done and because he was a thin skinny man with a pale face and long hair people thought he looked like the devil He wrote violin concertos which at the time only he could play

A Concerto Grosso is a piece of music from the 18th century in which there are a small group of instruments and a large group of instruments These two groups are contrasted with one another Sometimes both play together sometimes one plays by itself or the two groups might imitate one another The small group is called concertino and the large group is called tutti ripieno or concerto grosso Concerto grosso is Italian for big concerto  The plural is concerti grossi Notice that the second c in concerto is pronounced like an English ch

A concerto grosso has several parts that differ in speed and character There are usually three movements the first is fast the second is slow and the last is fast The first movement contrasts the tutti and the soloists the second movement is quiet while the last movement is lively

The composer who made the concerto grosso very popular was the Italian Arcangelo Corelli The instruments in the small group of soloists in his concerti grossi were usually two violins and one cello George Frideric Handel also used that combination for his concerti grossi 

Johann Sebastian Bach wrote a set of six concertos known as the Brandenburg Concertos Each of the Brandenburg Concertos is for a different combination of instruments Most of them are concerti grossi The second one for example has a concertino group of four instruments trumpet violin recorder and oboe

After the Baroque period few composers wrote concerti grossi They were more interested in the solo concerto However in the 20th century some composers including Igor Stravinsky and Bela Bartok wrote pieces of music that are like concerti grossi

An accompaniment in music is music that accompanies something else

A piece of music may have a melody and an accompaniment underneath The music may be played on the piano with the right hand playing the tune and the left hand playing the accompaniment The accompaniment might also be played on a different instrument

Music does not have to be a tune with accompaniment although it often is The accompaniment does not always have to be lower than the tune To play the piano the pianist has to learn to play a tune in the right hand and accompaniment in the left hand or the tune might be passed from one hand to the other The tune should usually be played a little louder than the accompaniment The accompaniment must not drown the tune

An accompaniment might be single notes or chords or any other pattern The accompaniment help us to feel the harmony An accompaniment might be another tune Tunes can be played or sung without accompaniment Folk songs are traditionally sung unaccompanied

If one instrument accompanies another the person who plays the accompaniment is an accompanist The piano is the most popular instrument for accompanying in Western music A good pianist can accompany a violin cello oboe trumpet singer or choir They have to listen carefully to the instrument they are accompanying and play with the same kind of feeling

When a soloist plays a concerto the orchestra are accompanying the soloist An organist playing a hymn is accompanying the congregation A percussion player in a rock band is accompanying the lead instrument

Guitars and electric keyboards are often used for accompaniment In Elizabethan times the lute was popular People sang songs and often accompanied themselves on the lute or harp In the Baroque period the accompaniment was often played by the basso continuo

The pianist Gerald Moore was a famous accompanist When he started his career in the 1920s people did not think that the accompanist was very important Sometimes their name would not even be printed in the programme A singer would expect the audience to start to clap as soon as they had sung their last note even if the piano had several more bars to play This might not matter too much with some music but in songs by Schubert Wolf and other composers of Lieder the piano parts are very important Gerald Moore made people realize how important the accompanist is A good performance can be ruined by a bad accompaniment

Basso continuo is a form of musical accompaniment used in the Baroque period

Basso continuo sometimes just called continuo was played by a keyboard instrument and another bass instrument such as cello violone or bassoon The keyboard instrument was normally a harpsichord or if it was being played in a church an organ

It was not usual to write out all the notes for the keyboard player The composer normally just wrote the bottom line which would be played by the bottom part of the left hand and by the cello or whatever the instrument being used The composer would indicate what the harmony should be by writing figures underneath the music This is why it is called figured bass or sometimes thoroughbass The continuo player will realize the figured bass ie he will improvise the chords which are shown In modern editions of old music the figured bass part has normally been realized by the editor

Reading music from a figured bass was a skill that all keyboard and piano players were expected to have They needed to have a good understanding of music theory especially of harmony They would often improvise ornamental bits on top but this had to be done musically and sensitively

Basso continuo would accompany solo instruments and singers as well as instrumental groups

The first period of Japans history is its prehistory period that is before the written history of Japan Archeologists have found pottery of that time Japans Paleolithic era covers a period from around 100000 BC to around 12000 BC This is a very long period of time Archeologists have found some polished tools made of stones Some of them are kept in Tokyos National Museum These tools are more than 32000 years old

The Yayoi period covered about 550 years from around 300 BC till around 250 The period had got its name from a location in Tokyo By that time Japanese people had learnt the cultivation of rice Different clans controlled different areas and they also fought among themselves Some Chinese texts tell about this time These texts describe Japan as the Yamatai country Yamatai came into being when about 30 smaller parts of Japan of that time united under a queen named Himiko

The Ancient and Classical period covers about 900 years beginning from the mid 3rd century till the end of the 12th century The History of Japan of this period may further be divided into several smaller periods These are described below

In the history of Japan the period from the mid 3rd century till around 710 is known as the Yamato period This period has two parts The first is the Kofun period Buddhism had not reached Japan by this time The second period is called the Asuka period By this time Buddhism had reached Japan 

This period saw many important changes like introduction of the Chinese writing system to Japan The relationship with Korea and China also brought social changes

During this period from the year 707 steps were taken to shift the capital to a place near present day Nara This was completed in 710 A new city was built The city was built to look like the Chinese capital city of that time At that time the Tang Dynasty was ruling China and the capital was at Changan

During the Nara period development was slow The Emperors family members were always fighting and quarrelling for power with the Buddhists and other groups At that time Japan had friendly relations with Korea and Chinas Tang Dynasty The capital was shifted twice In 784 the capital was moved to Nagaoka and in 794 to Kyoto In that period Kyoto was known as Heian kyo

Muromachi Period began in 1336 and ended in 1573 Emperor Go Daigo lost his throne The government of the Ashikaga shogunate took control of most parts of Japan This period ended in 1573 In that year the 15th and the last shogun named Ashikaga Yoshiaki was forced to go out of the capital At that time capital was in Kyto 

During this period in 1542 a Portuguese ship reached Japan and made the first direct contact between both cultures including the knowledge of firearms In the next few years merchants and also some Christian missionaries from several European countries mainly Portugal the Netherlands England and Spain reached the beaches of Japan

Azuchi Momoyama period covers the years from 1568 to 1600 During these years different parts of Japan became again united Its military power grew In 1592 Japan wanted to conquer China At that time China was ruled by the Ming dynasty At that time Toyotomi Hideyoshi was one of the main leaders of Japan He sent an army of 160000 troops to Korea But the Japanese could not win and returned to Japan In 1597 Japan again sent an army to Korea In 1598 Toyotomi Hideyoshi died After his death the Japanese dropped the idea of conquering Korea and China 

During this period Japanese brought many Koreans to Japan These Koreans were very good at making pottery and at other arts Some of them were very learned persons Japan gained new information and knowledge from these Koreans

During the Edo period Japan had many small rulers There were about 200 of them They were called daimyo Out of them the Tokugawa clan was most powerful They ruled from a place named Edo This place was around the present days Tokyo For fifteen generations they were the most powerful clan in Japan 

Edo period is also very important period in the history of Japan Many developments took place Main developments were

In 1868 a war named the Boshin War took place With this war the government of the Shogunate ended Japan again came under the rule of an emperor

Beginning from the early 17th century the rulers of Japan started to follow a policy of seclusion known as sakoku in Japanese language They suspected that traders merchants and missionaries wanted to bring Japan under the control of European powers These rulers started a policy of seclusion Except the Dutch and the Chinese all foreigners traders and merchants from other countries missionaries faced restrictions They also ordered some foreigners to go out of Japan

Still even during the period of seclusion Japanese continued to gain information and knowledge about other parts of the world

This policy of seclusion lasted for about 200 years At last it was ended under force On July 8th 1853 Commodore Matthew Perry of the US Navy reached Edo old Tokyo with four warships The ships were heavily armed and their guns pointed towards the city After shown such a power Japan was asked to agree to trade with other countries Later on Japanese called these ships the kurofune the Black Ships 

Next year on 31st March 1854 Perry came with seven ships and Japanese signed a treaty established diplomatic relationship with the USA Another treaty was signed with the USA on 29th July 1858 This gave more facilities to foreigners coming to Japan and doing business with Japan Though Japan started relationship with the USA and several other countries many Japanese were not happy with this style of forcing Japan to do such things

Meiji Restoration is an important period of history of Japan At that time Emperor Meiji was ruling Japan During this period power of Japans emperor was restored that is he gained back his full power and this is why the period is called Meiji Restoration During this period beginning after the Boshin War of 1868 many changes happened in Japan 

At the end of the 19th century a number of learned Japanese supported a particular theory According to this theory Japan had to make itself bigger in size to face foreign powers Thus Japan tried to expand its areas It wanted parts of nearby countries to make its borders safe This resulted in wars with its neighboring counties In 1894 1895 Japan and China had a war After about ten years in 1904 1905 another war took place with Russia Japan became a strong power after these wars But Russian influence continued to grow inside China

By the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century the Russian influence was increasing in China Japan and the Great Britain used to get economic and other benefits from their relationship with China Therefore Japan as well as the Great Britain did not like Russias growing influence in China Both countries discussed the matter Finally they signed a treaty on 30th January 1902 They agreed that in the event of any attack or war on any of them they would fight together This is known as the Anglo Japanese Alliance Russia was not happy at this type of agreement He also tried to sign similar treaty with Germany and France On 6th March 1902 Russia could sign a similar treaty with France But Germany did not join them 

Soon after this Japan and Russia were at war and fighting with each other By 1905 Japanese had won several rounds of victories over Tsarist Russia At that time the Czar ruled Russia and hence it was called Tsarist Russia But the Japanese victory was not final The USA came to meditate under the US President Teddy Roosevelt Japan got a number of concessions In 1910 Japan completely took over Korea and made that a part of Japan

In 1914 the First World War broke out Japan also entered the war It attacked several places which were colonies of Germany After the war ended in 1919 Japan developed very fast It became one of the major powers of Asia 

Before the beginning of the Second World War Japan was fighting with China This is called Second Sino Japanese War When the Second World War broke out in 1939 Japan went to the side of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7 1941 The fighting continued for years When the USA dropped the first atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan accepted defeat and surrendered in 1945

After the end of the Second World War Japan came under international control Japan became an important friend of the USA when it entered into the Cold war with Korea Over next few years many political economic and social changes took place Japanese Diet came into being In 1951 USA and 45 other countries signed an agreement with Japan and Japan again became an independent nation with full power on 28th April 1952 

Post Occupation Japan means Japan after its occupation and control by a group of nations had ended This is the period after the Second World War The Second World War had damaged Japan very badly It has almost lost its industry and economy was in a very bad shape After the war Japan received assistance and technology from the USA and several other countries of Europe The progress was very rapid For about 30 years from around the 1950s to the 1980s Japan grew very fast It became one of the major economic powers of the world

When the UN forces were fighting in Korea during the Korean War Japan was one of the major suppliers This also helped Japans economy By 1980s Japan had become the worlds second largest economy after the USA At first there was very close relationship between Japan and the USA But Japans economic might resulted into trade deficit for the USA A trade deficit results when imports are more than exports Thus USA was importing more than it exported to Japan 

For various reasons this phase of rapid development ended in the 1990s Some historians have described this decade as the lost decade of Japanese economy About 5 to 10 persons in 100 persons could not find any work

By 1952 Japan had become free from most of the controls of occupation period It got its own democratic system Various political parties came into being and Japans political life became active 

Historians and sociologists call the recent life of Japan as modern life In Japanese language this period is called Heisei By 1989 Japans economy had become a very big economy All round development had taken place Japans military growth again startedFactsubst12242008 In the Gulf war of 1991 Japan gave billions of dollars

History of Saudi Arabia covers thousands of years with lots of people from different cultures living there There was a culture called the Dilmun culture among them which was very old and existed along the Persian Gulf It was as old as the ancient civilizations of Sumerians and the Egyptians Saudi Arabia had trading relations with many parts of the ancient world but the hot and harsh climate had made large settlements difficult Some settlements had always existed around oases these are places in the deserts where growth and water are available 

Saudi Arabia became an important center as Islam rose in the 620s The cities of Medina and Mecca became the holiest places of Islam They also became the two holiest cities for the Muslims in the whole world The rulers and kings of Saudi Arabia also got more power

The beginning of the modern history of Saudi Arabia was when an Islamic reformer named Muhammad ibn Abd al Wahhab and a local ruler named Muhammad bin Saud founded the Saudi state in the year 1744 It was founded in the central part of the Arabia Over the next Century and a half the Saud family saw bad and good times The family also faced opposition from rulers of Egypt and the Ottoman Empire The family also faced opposition from other powerful families of Arabia

Finally after many decadesThe modern state of Saudi Arabia could be established by King Abdul Aziz Al Saud In 1902 he took over the city of Riyadh from another family named Al Rashid He continued to win more areas and on 8 January 1926 he became the King of Hijaz On 29 January 1927 he took the title of King of Nejd On 20th May 1927 the government of the United Kingdom accepted him as the King of the areas ruled by him His kingdom now became a sovereignty All the regions under his control were united to form the state of Saudi Arabia by the year 1932 Petroleum oil was found in Saudia Arabia on 3 March 1938 which made the country rich as export of oil started to bring a lot of money

Saudi Arabia discussed from the beginning of the 1920s with its neighboring countries about fixing of definite boundaries It finalized its boundaries with Iraq Jordan and Kuwait On borders with Iraq and Kuwait two neutral zones were created one with Iraq and the other one with Kuwait In 1934 borders with Yemen were almost finalized 

In 1965 Saudi Arabia gave some of its areas to Jordan and Jordan gave some of its areas to Saudi Area In 1971 the neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait was partitioned between these two countries Likewise Saudi Arabia and Iraq decided in 1981 to partition the neutral zone between them The zone was partitioned between the two countries in 1983 

Still Saudi Arabias borders with the United Arab Emirates and Oman are not final The border with Qatar was finalized in 2001

King Abdul Aziz Al Saud died in 1953 His son named Saud became the king He reigned for 11 years In 1964 he was forced to step down and his half brother Faisal became the king Faisal had the support of the senior members of the royal family and the religious leaders Faisal also held the post of the Prime Minister This tradition of being both the King and the Prime Minister still continues in Saudi Arabia All Kings after Faisal had followed this practice 

Faisal took a number of new steps for economic development of Saudi Arabia During his reign many important political events also happened like the ones noted below

In 1975 King Faisal was assassinated by one of his nephews The nephew was found guilty and he was sentenced to death King Faisals half brother Khalid became the King and the Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia During the reign of King Khalid Saudi Arabias importance in regional politics increased The economic growth of the country also continued at a good rate

King Khalid died in 1982 After his death Fahd became the King At the same time he also became the Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia His half brother Prince Abdullah became the Crown Prince

The income of Saudi Arabia became less during the period of King Fahds reign This was a result of lower price of petroleum oil King Fahds government used an economic policy which helped the country to survive with a lower income

King Fahd helped Iraq during the Iran Iraq war Iraqs economy had become very bad on account of this war The King also discussed with these two countries to stop war Both countries stopped the war in August 1988 The King also helped in making Gulf Cooperation Council a stronger organization The GCC is an organization of six countries of the Persian Gulf The purpose of the organization is to increase development and cooperation among the member countries

In 1990 Saddam Hussain was ruling Iraq The Gulf War of 1991 was when he invaded Kuwait Many people thought that his army would also invade Saudi Arabia King Fahd allowed some Western countries and USA to send their forces to the country Many Muslims were against that their most holy land was used by non Muslim soldiers 

During and after the Gulf War King Fahds role was very important During the war he allowed the entry of the royal family of Kuwait inside Saudi Arabia and followed by 400000 other persons from Kuwait to stay on a temporary basis The King allowed the troops of countries like USA to mount attacks on Kuwait to liberate it He also helped in arranging support of other Muslim countries for liberation of Kuwait Iraqi forces were eventually ousted from Kuwait

Presence of troops from the Western countries has angered many Muslims One of them was the wealthy man Osama bin Laden He was forced to leave Saudi Arabia when he disagreed and opposed the King of Saudi Arabia Other than Osma bin laden and his groups there were several other persons and groups who did not like the presence of Western troops inside Saudi Arabia 

These persons and their groups attacked people they tried manly to attack the foreign troops located in Saudi Arabia Some examples of such attacks are given below

September 11 2001 attacks in New York had resulted into many deaths and big destruction After enquiry it came to light that out of 19 suspected persons for these attacks 15 were from Saudi Arabia 

Such things attracted the attention of the government of Saudi Arabia The government started a policy to check such activities Even then terrorist activities of such persons and groups continued

The Carolina Parakeet is an extinct species of parrot

It was the last parrot type to have lived before the European conquest in the eastern United States It was found from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf of Mexico and lived in old woods along rivers 

The last wild Carolina Parakeet was killed in Okeechobee County in Florida in 1904 and the last bird kept by people died at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1918 This was the male bird called Incas who died within a year of his mate Lady Jane It was not until 1939 however that it was agreed that all the Carolina parakeets had died

At some date between 1937 and 1955 three parakeets looking like this sort of bird were seen and recorded on videotape in the Okefenokee Swamp of Georgia However the American Ornithologists Union thought that they had probably recorded escaped pets Additional sightings were recorded in Okeechobee County in Florida until the end of the 1920s

The Carolina Parakeet died out for a number of reasons To make space for more farms large areas of forest were cut down taking away its living space The colorful feathers were in demand as decorations in ladies hats and the birds were kept as pets Even though the birds were bred easily in captivity little was done to make sure enough birds were bred to avoid their dying out Finally they were killed in large numbers because farmers thought they were pests

Another reason that led to their extinction was that unfortunately they liked to return in large flocks to places where some of them had just been killed This led to even more being shot by hunters as they gathered about the wounded and dead members of the flock

The Germ theory of disease is a theory in biology It says that small organisms also known as microbes are the cause of many diseases The prevailing majority of the diseases are infectious Todays view of how disease happens is that those small organisms cause a reaction in the body of those affected by a disease This reaction is what people call the disease

Louis Pasteur showed that this theory was true He made an experiment with fermentation In one case he made a broth that he isolated from the surroundings so no particles could pass to it from outside The broth he thusly made did not change and no fermentation took place 

The other case was a similar broth but this time it was connected to the environment This time fermentation took place The thing that caused fermentation therefore needed to come from outside

Another view of how diseases came to be was that they spontaneously generated Scientists call that view abiogenesis with the meaning of life being generated from non living forms Robert Hooke made a book called Micrographia  small pictures this book sold over 300 million copies in the educated bookstore at Harvard University

Ralph Vaughan Williams was the most important English composer of his generation

Vaughan Williams wanted to be a good composer so he went abroad to study with famous composers like Max Bruch in Berlin and Maurice Ravel in Paris Yet he knew that he must not simply imitate these composers so he also studied English folk song He became good friends with the composer Gustav Holst The two men always showed one another the music they were writing so that they could help one another by offering criticism

In 1910 he wrote a work which became one of his best known pieces of music the Fantasia on a theme of Thomas Tallis The piece is for a string orchestra divided into two sections It uses a theme by the famous 16th century composer Tallis He also wrote hymn tunes for the English Hymnal One of his most popular hymn tunes is the one called Sine Nomine sung to the words For all the saints Another lovely work is The Lark Ascending This is a short work for solo violin and orchestra The violin sounds like a skylark singing in the sky In 1934 he wrote a short piece for flute harp and string orchestra called Fantasia on Greensleeves which is based on the famous English Renaissance tune Greensleeves 

During his long life Vaughan Williams wrote nine symphonies works for the stage songs choral music and chamber music In 1938 he wrote a famous piece called Serenade to Music for 16 solo singers and orchestra It was one of several works he wrote inspired by Shakespeare The words were from the play The Merchant of Venice It was written for the 50th anniversary of Sir Henry Woods career as a conductor In 1953 he wrote music for Queen Elizabeth IIs coronation including a very short and simple motet O taste and see which has remained very popular with church choirs

In his old age he became quite deaf This was because of the noise of gunfire he had been exposed to when he was serving as a stretcher bearer in World War I

Some of Vaughan Williamss best works are those where he makes his music sound like folk song He loved the poetry of Housman and used some of the poems in a song cycle called On Wenlock Edge for tenor piano and string quartet His music always sounds English He was born in the 19th century which was a time when people thought English musicians were not very good Vaughan Williams and Edward Elgar made people realise that it was possible for an Englishman to write beautiful moving music

Recycling means turning the materials from trash into something new Glass paper plastic and metals such as aluminum and steel are all commonly recycled Dead plants and some kitchen trash can be recycled through composting It is important however not to confuse recycling with reusing which is where old things such as clothes are donated or given a new use instead of being thrown out

One reason that people give for recycling is that it reduces trash in dumps Another reason people recycle is to reduce the amount of raw materials and energy used in making things Most of the time it takes less energy to recycle trash than to throw it away The Economist says Recycling can reduce your carbon footprint and it would help to minimize the size of rubbish tips around the world 

The 3 Rs are Reduce Reuse and Recycle

Most people make about two kilograms of waste every day and about 7 of this waste is made up of plastic products that can be recycled Today plastic can be recycled into products like picnic tables park benches and even high chairs

First plastic is collected and taken to a recycling center where it is sorted out When plastic is sorted out symbols have to be printed on every recyclable plastic product used There are two types of plastic polyethylene or polymer There are two kinds of polyethylene plastic too high density polyethylene and low density polyethylene HDPE plastic is usually used to make furniture and LDPE plastic are usually things like milk jugs plastic and grocery bags

HDPE plastic is broken wikt linkgrindground into a small powder LDPE plastic which are usually thin films need to be ground by a special machine After that both plastics are washed with hot water and broken wikt linkdetergentdetergent Dirt and other things like labels are taken off After the wash the powder is dried with hot air

Sometimes the powder is sold But other times the powder is heated colored and then put into a pelletizer The pelletizer makes the powder into little broken wikt linkpelletpellets which are bought by a company that shapes the pellets into pieces of plastic wood This plastic wood is used to make flowerpots trash cans pipes picnic tables benches toys mats and many other things

The Mercalli intensity scale is a scale to measure the intensity of earthquakes Unlike with the Richter scale the Mercalli scale does not take into account energy of an earthquake directly Rather they classify earthquakes by the effects they have When there is little damage the scale describes how people felt the earthquake or how many people felt it

Very often non geologists use this scale because it is easier for people to describe what damage an earthquake caused than to do calculations to get a value on the Richter scale

Values range from I  Instrumental to XII  Catastrophic

Nagorno Karabakh is an autonomous region of Azerbaijan Armenia wants it to be part of itself Most of the people in Nagorno Karabakh are Armenians The names for the region in the different local languages all translate to mountainous Karabakh or mountainous black garden In fact Karabakh is an Azeri word meaning literally black garden

Nagorno Karabakh became a subject of the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 1918 when both countries declared independence from Russia Territorial dispute has not been resolved until 1920 when both young states became part of the Soviet Union and actually lost their independence due to the actions of Russian communists During this time many Azeris were killed by Armenian terrorists

Supporters for the Armenian position frequently emphasize that resolution of the Caucasian Bureau from July 5 1921 was obviously accepted under the Bolsheviks pressure and in any case this resolution contradicts with the principle of self determination and cannot be considered as valid the problem should be solved by the countries which it directly involves and not by the Committee created specially for this case and inside the ruling party of the third country

When Mikhail Gorbachev has come to power in Moscow and has started the campaigns of publicity and democratic reforms in the end of 80th Armenians of Nagorno Karabakh decided to address the problems to the international and Soviet heads Complaining about forced Azerification of the region the majority Armenian population started a movement for independence

In November 1991 seeking to stop this movement the Parliament of Azerbaijan abolished the autonomous status of the region In response the Nagorno Karabakh Armenians held a December 10 1991 referendum in which the overwhelming majority of the population voted for outright independence The Azeri community of Nagorno Karabakh boycotted this referendum

These events and especially violant deportation of approx 200 000 Azeris from Armenia led to riots against Armenians living in Azerbaijan

The war for Nagorno Karabakh became the longest and one of the bloodiest conflicts in states successors of Soviet Union According to last estimations it has killed 15000 people and the number of refugees has exceeded one million

Today Nagorno Karabakh is a de facto state calling itself the Nagorno Karabakh Republic

Tiberius was the second Roman Emperor He ruled from 14 to 37 AD He was the step son of Augustus

Tiberius was one of Ancient Romes greatest generals whose campaigns protected the northern frontier He reigned for 22 years and the first part of his imperial work was excellent Later he came to be remembered as a dark reclusive and somber ruler After the death of his son Drusus in 23 the quality of his rule declined and ended in terror 

In 26 Tiberius moved from Rome to the Isle of Capri and left administration largely in the hands of his unscrupulous Praetorian Prefect Sejanus Sejanus became the effective ruler of Rome and plotted against Tiberius murdering people who opposed him When alerted Tiberius counter plotted to remove Sejanus from his official positions and eventually executed him More executions followed of people who had committed crimes under Sejanus rule

Caligula Tiberius grand nephew and adopted grandson succeeded the Emperor upon his death

Tiberius shared in Augustus tribune powers as of 6 BC but soon went into retirement in Rhodes He was reported as wanting no further role in politicsp117p46 After the early deaths of Augustus young grandchildren turned sons Lucius and Gaius in AD 2 and 4 respectively and the earlier death of his own brother Drusus Tiberius was recalled to Rome in June AD 4 where he was adopted by Augustus on the condition that he in turn adopt his nephew Germanicusp119 This continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of heirs 

In the same year Tiberius was also granted the powers of a tribune and proconsul emissaries from foreign kings had to pay their respects to him and by 13 was awarded with his second triumph and equal level of imperium with that of Augustusp119120 Tiberius duly assumed the titles of Augustus when the old mans long regn came to an end in AD 14

Problems soon arose The northern legions had not been paid and rebelled Germanicus and Tiberiuss son Drusus were dispatched with a small force to quell the uprising and bring the legions back in line Germanicus rallied the mutineers and led them on a short campaign across the Rhine into Germanic territory stating that whatever treasure they could grab would count as their bonus Germanicuss forces smashed across the Rhine and quickly occupied all of the territory between the Rhine and the Elbe So Germanicus dealt a significant blow to Romes enemies and quelled an uprising of troops actions that increased his fame with the Roman people

After being recalled from Germania Germanicus celebrated a triumph in Rome in AD 17 the first full triumph that the city had seen since Augustuss own in 29 BC As a result in AD 18 Germanicus was granted control over the eastern part of the empire just as both Agrippa and Tiberius had received before and was clearly the successor to Tiberius But tragedy struck once again as Germanicus died after a year apparently poisoned

Sejanus had served the imperial family for almost twenty years when he became Praetorian Prefect in AD 15 The death of Drusus elevated Sejanus Tiberius had statues of Sejanus erected throughout the city and Sejanus became more and more visible as Tiberius began to withdraw from Rome altogether Finally with Tiberiuss withdrawal to Capri in AD 26 Sejanus was left in charge of the entire state mechanism and the city of Rome 

Sejanuss position was not quite that of successor The presence of Livia seems to have checked his power for a time Her death in AD 29 changed all that Sejanus began a series of purge trials of Senators in Rome Germanicuss widow Agrippina the Elder and two of her sons were arrested and exiled in AD 30 and later all died in suspicious circumstances

In response Tiberius manoevered cleverly He knew an immediate condemnation of Sejanus might not succeed Since he and Sejanus were then joint Consuls Tiberius resigned his post of Consul which forced Sejanus to do likewise This removed much of Sejanus legal powers and protection Then in AD 31 Sejanus was summoned to a meeting of the Senate where a letter from Tiberius was read condemning Sejanus and ordering his immediate execution Macro was appointed Praetorian Prefect with the specific job of removing Sejanus Sejanus was tried and he and several of his colleagues were executed within the week

More treason trials followed Tacitus writes that Tiberius had been hesitant to act at the start of his reign but now towards the end of his life he seemed to do so without compunction However Tacitus portrayal of a tyrannical vengeful emperor has been challenged by several modern historians The prominent ancient historian Edward Togo Salmon notes in his work A history of the Roman world from 30 BC to AD 138 

The last years of Tiberius were notable for his complete absence frome Rome and his inactivity as Emperor He was a man in his 70s and left decisions to the officials in Rome He did nothing to prevent the rise of Caligula who was now popular with the people and who had the support of the Prefect Macro

An Orangutan is a great ape that has fur with a color between red and brown There are two species of orangutan They are from Southeast Asia There are very few of them left because loss of the jungle has reduced their habitat There are orangutans on view at the Singapore Zoo 

The name Orangutan comes from two Malay words orang which means person and hutan which means forest so orangutan means person of the forest

Orangutans have red brown fur They have very long and strong arms They also have hands that are good for climbing The Sumatran Orangutan is smaller and has longer hairfur than the Bornean Orangutan Orangutans have suffered from forest loss and are on the very edge of extinction

Orangutans are from the rainforests on the islands Borneo and Sumatra in Southeast Asia They mostly live up in the trees They eat fruit leaves and bark but also insects bird eggs and small vertebrate animals They drink water from rain that has been collected in leaves Orangutans are not comfortable on the ground since they have to push themselves along with fists Heavy adults move carefully through the trees using their flexible feet to grasp the tree branches Smaller orangutans swing with more ease

After a pregnancy of 230 260 days the female gives birth to usually one baby but sometimes two every eight to nine years The little ones stay with their mother for years riding on their mothers back and learning to move through the forest Like human babies the young orangutans are playful and affectionate When they are five or six years old they become more independent and eventually go off on their own 

Greetings are nice things to say when people meet each other Greetings may be different from culture to culture These are some greetings used a lot in the English language

Sunlight is the light that comes from the Sun Plants use sunlight to make food Without sunlight there could be no life on Earth

Plants need sunlight for the process of photosynthesis During photosynthesis the plants use the energy of the sunlight water and carbon dioxide to create glucose The glucose can later be used by the plant for energy or animals eat the plant and the glucose in it 

Plants need sunlight to grow green Without enough sunlight but with enough water the plant grows very tall very quickly but looks yellow and dehydrated although when touched the leaves are very moist 

Solar radiation can be both good and bad for a persons health When in the light the human body makes its own Vitamin D Being in sunlight without sunscreen too much can cause sunburn Angle of incidence of the sunlight makes difference in seasons on Earth as well as in the length of day and night

Different bodies of the Solar System receive sunlight of different intensities The table compares the amount of light received by each planet on the Solar System follows

Solar energy is used in many different ways by people all over the world both in its traditional way for heating cooking or drying and to make electricity where other power supplies are absent such as in remote places on Earth or in the space Sometimes it is cheaper to make electricity from sunlight than from coal or oil 

Theism is the religious belief that at least one god exists

All of these are rough definitions of the theisms they are almost always different We can split them all into different groups

Gnosticism and agnosticism can be combined with other forms of theism For example it is possible to be an agnostic atheist or a gnostic theist In common usage some people group atheism and agnosticism together under the group of nontheism absence of clear belief in any deity

The main types of theism are

This is another way to group different theisms based on the nature of the gods

There is also these types

Plesiosauridae 

Elasmosauridae 

The Plesiosaurs were an order of large carnivorous marine reptiles They flourished from 245 million years ago to 65 mya

Mary Anning was the first to discovere a plesiosaur She found it on the Jurassic Coast of Dorset England in the winter of 1820 21 The fossil was missing its skull but in 1823 she found another one this time complete with its skull The name Plesiosaurus was given to it by the Rev William Conybeare 

The earliest plesiosaur remains are from the Middle Triassic periodp128 and the group was important through the Jurassic and Cretaceous They had two large pairs of paddles short tails short or long necks and broad bodies They died out at the KT extinction event 65 million years ago

Plesiosaurs had many bones in their flippers making them flexible No modern animal has this four paddle anatomy modern turtles use their forelimbs for swimming They were mainly piscivorous

The pliosaurs were a group of mostly large submarine predators with short necks and large heads Their sizes ranged from two to 15 metres and they were predators of large fish and other reptiles Their streamlined body shape suggests they swam and ate under water 

There were three families of long necked plesiosaurs who evidently had a different life style from the pliosaurs It was suggested by DMS Watson that their method was as surface swimmers mostly eating with their head above water darting down to snatch smaller fish which were feeding on plankton It is hard to see the benefit of a long neck under water aquatic mammals operating under water all have a streamlined torpedo shape as did pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs All the longer necked familiers were from the setting of the teeth and jaws eaters of small fish However some at least were bottom feeders consuming various prey Digestion of shellfish was aided by gastroliths

Plesiosaurs have been found with fossils of belemnites and ammonites associated with their stomachs But plesiosaurs could not crack shells Instead they probably swallowed them whole In the belly of a plesiosaur were stomach stones which are called gastroliths These stones moved around in the plesiosaurs stomach and cracked or crushed the shells of the animals it ate One plesiosaur fossil found in South Dakota had 253 gatroliths weighing a total of 29 pounds

Live birth has been proved for ichthyosaurs but is uncertain for plesiosaurs 

Midland is a city in the American state of Texas It is called Midland because many years ago it was the midway point between two bigger cities in Texas Fort Worth and El Paso Oil was discovered in the region in 1923 and is still a larger part of the economy Midland is also famous as the childhood home of The US President George W Bush and his wife Laura who was born there Midland was also home to former president George H W Bush and former First Lady Barbara Walker Bush

A nuclear reactor is a machine that uses fission to generate heat There are different designs which use different fuels Most often uranium 235 or plutonium 239 are the main components of these fuels

Most nuclear reactors are used to make electricity In nuclear power plants heat from the reactor changes water into steam The steam is then used to power electric turbines which make electricity It is important to remember that the turbines do not change the temperature of the steam or the amount of steam Instead the turbines take energy from the movement of the steam

Some reactors are used for other purposes Some reactors make neutrons for science research and others make radioactive isotopes Some universities have small nuclear reactors to teach students how reactors work

The first nuclear reactor was built in 1942 by a team of scientists led by Enrico Fermi This was a part of the Manhattan Project which needed the fuel from the reactor to make the atomic bomb The first nuclear reactor to make electricity was a small experimental reactor built in Idaho in 1951 It made just enough electricity for four light globes

Nuclear reactors are expensive to build because of the many safety features they need to have There is also a problem with the huge amount of radioactive waste from the reactors However they produce electricity cheaply and do not pollute the air There have been serious accidents at several nuclear reactors Windscale 1957 Mayak 1957 Three Mile Island 1979 Chernobyl 1986 and Fukushima 2011 Concerns about safety have limited the growth of nuclear power There are about 437 reactors around the world which provide about 5 of the worlds electricity

The Blue Whale is a baleen whale of the biological order Cetacea

They can grow to be about 25 meters long The biggest Blue Whale found was 180 tons and measured 98 feet long but larger specimens have been measured and confirmed at 109 feet although they have never been weighed This makes blue whales the largest animals ever to be on Earth even bigger than the largest dinosaurs They eat tiny living things like krill and plankton

The blue whale eats mostly very tiny creatures like krill These inch long shrimp like zoo plankton swim in swarms and blue whales feed heavily on them In the Antarctic summer there are so many of these krill that they turn the waters orange A blue whale can eat eight to ten tons of krill every day

Archaeoceti

The order Cetacea are marine mammals that live in oceans seas and even a few rivers around the world Whales dolphins and porpoises are part of this group The study of cetaceans is called cetology

The Scottish language is a sister language of Irish and Manx all three are Goidelic languages and part of the Celtic language family It is also related to the Welsh language Cornish language and the Breton language 

In past times the language was spoken across all of Scotland except for the Northern Islands In the later part of the Middle Ages the kings of Scotland began to speak the English language and looked down on the Scottish language After the union of England and Scotland the language was snubbed and looked down on even more The English language took over

A Census in the United Kingdom in 2001 showed that a total of 58652 in Scotland could speak some amount of Gaelic at that time Only the Western Isles of Scotland have more people who can speak the language than not The place in Scotland with the biggest percentage of Scottish Gaelic speakers is a village called Barvas on the Isle of Lewis There 747 of the people there speak the language Gaelic is dying out but many people are starting to learn the language

It is estimated that 1000 2000 in Nova Scotia Canada can speak some Gaelic

The Germanic languages are a language family in the Indo European languages They came from one language Proto Germanic and were originally spoken in northern western and central Europe

The Germanic languages are separated into the East Germanic languages the North Germanic languages and the West Germanic languages

All of them are extinct

Killer Whales or Orcas are cetaceans They are the largest dolphins in the world called whales because of their size Orcas have mostly black skin with white patchesThey are found in all the worlds oceans from the cold of the Arctic to the tropical seas

Like all toothed whales they are carnivores They hunt in family groups called pods Packs of fifty or more all working together surround and chase sharks seals dolphins penguins other whales

Killer whales are the largest extant members of the dolphin family Males typically range from 6 to 8 metres long and weigh in excess of 6 tonnes Females are smaller generally ranging from 5 to 7m and weighing about 3 to 4 t The largest male killer whale on record was 98 metres weighing over 10 tonnes while the largest female was 85m weighing 75 t Calves at birth weigh about convert180kglb and are about convert24mft long The killer whales large size and strength make it among the fastest marine mammals able to reach speeds in excess of convert30knkmh

Killer whales have the second heaviest brains among marine mammals They can be trained in captivity and are often described as intelligent although defining and measuring intelligence is difficult in a species whose life is very different from ours

Killer whales imitate others and seem to deliberately teach skills to their young This is most strikingly seen when killer whales deliberately beach themselves to catch seals Off Pennsula Valds adults sometimes pull seals off the shoreline and then release them again near juvenile whales allowing the younger whales to practice the difficult capture technique on the now weakened prey Off the Crozet Islands mothers push their calves onto the beach waiting to pull the youngster back if neededref

People who have interacted closely with killer whales offer numerous anecdotes demonstrating the whales curiosity playfulness and ability to solve problems For example Alaskan killer whales have not only learned how to steal fish from longlines but have overcome a variety of techniques designed to stop them such as the use of unbaited lines as decoys Once fishermen placed their boats several miles apart taking turns retrieving small amounts of their catch in the hope that the whales would not have enough time to move between boats to steal fish as it was being retrieved A researcher described what happened next

In other anecdotes researchers describe incidents in which wild killer whales playfully tease humans by repeatedly moving objects that the humans are trying to reach or suddenly start to toss around a chunk of ice after a human throws a snowball

The killer whales use of dialects and the passing of other learned behaviours from generation to generation have been described as a form of culture

The dorsal fin of the orca can extend up to six feet above its body Thats taller than most grown men And because a killer whale swims close to the surface the dorsal fin can often be seen gliding through the surface of the water This causes some people to mistake killer whale for sharks

Killler whales are very friendly towards people when kept in captivity They are often tamed and can be trained to do tricks for audiences in marine shows like in Sea World Sometimes killer whales have even starred in movies such as the film titled Free Willy 

Pac Man is an arcade video game that was made by Namco It was released in 1980 and became very popular in the history of games

In Pac Man the player makes a Pac Man a yellow disc move around a maze The goal is to eat every yellow pellet while not getting caught by the ghostsmonsters For extra points fruits that appear can also be eaten When Pac Man eats a white pellet the ghosts turn blue and can be eaten Even though the game has 256 stages the last level can not be finished due to a problem with the creation of the game

The game is called Puck Man in Japan The game was named Pac Man in the United States so that nobody could change the P to F There were many sequels and remakes based on the game Hanna Barbera made a animated tv show airing on ABC in the early 1980s The game was also part of Namco Museum games There is a Namco Museum Remix for the Wii Its a game developed by Namco and this is the distribution in the USA by Midway Games

Domestic violence means that in a relationship or marriage one of the partners uses physical sexual or psychological violence to try to get power or control over the other Victims of domestic violence are mostly women and children domestic violence can occur in heterosexual and same sex relationships There is often a predictable pattern or cycle of violence in a relationship and the abuse tends to get worse over time Domestic violense can be also a factor to be homelessness as pointed out by Principles 15 of the Yogyakarta Principles 

In any culture or community there are beliefs and attitudes that support domestic violence and beliefs and attitudes that do not support domestic violence Very often laws exist to protect the victim of such violent acts There are also organisations that can help in such situations 

Domestic violence sometimes does not get reported to the police Estimates say that only a third of domestic violence cases get reported to the authoritiesfactdateJuly 2010

Archaeopteryx is one of the most important fossils ever discovered It is a bird from the Upper Jurassic about 144 million years ago It shows the evolutionary link between reptiles and birds The first Archaeopteryx was found in 1860 near Solnhofen in Bavaria Germany Today nine skeletons and one feather of Archaeopteryx have been found

Archaeopteryx looks like a reptile with wings and feathers It had a mouth with teeth claws at the hands and a long tail like dinosaurs or reptiles Today it is known that some dinosaurs looked like birds and that some had feathers When they are born todays South American hoatzin have claws on their wings when they are young just like Archaeopteryx 

Thomas Henry Huxley who was a comparative anatomist made a study of this nearly 150 years ago He compared Archaeopteryx with a small theropod dinosaur Compsognathus These two fossils came from the same place Solnhofen in Bavaria Germany The strata come from the end of the Jurassic period about 144 million years ago He showed that the two were very similar except for the front limbs and feathers of Archaeopteryx 

Huxleys study showed the basic affinity of birds and reptiles He united them under the title of Sauropsida His papers on Archaeopteryx and the origin of birds were of great interest then and still are Huxley concluded that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs

Only one dinobird has been found dating before Archaeopteryx It is called Anchiornis huxlei It had feathers on both front and rear legs and could certainly glide It may or may not have had some capacity for powered flight This discovery means we can no longer say Archaeopteryx is the first known bird though its contribution to science has been huge We now know for sure that a whole group of small theropod dinosaurs had feathers and that flight was a secondary function It is thought that the initial function of feathers was temperature regulation

It may be that Archaeopteryx is not directly ancestral to all birds but it is still a perfectly good transitional fossil

Mosel Saar Ruwer is a German wine growing region in the valleys of the rivers Moselle Saar and Ruwer near Koblenz and Trier Rhineland Palatinate It is famous for its wines of Riesling Elbling and Mller Thurgau grapes 

There are the following six sub regions with 19 large vineyards 

A snail is an animal It is a mollusk which means it does not have bones Most snails are aquatic they live in the water Most of them have a shell Most snails are herbivores though some are omnivores Fewer even are carnivores

Snails without a shell are usually called slugs Snails move very slowly and are sometimes used to represent slow

In some countries like in France people eat snails After the snails are cooked they make a dish called Escargot a delicacy in France They usually boil them in salt water and add a garlic sauce

The biggest snail is the giant African snail It is 35 cm long This snail turned into a giant pest The rarest snails are the giant African snail and partala snail 

The fastest snail is the Helis aspersa snail It can reach speeds up to 003mph 

Snails dont have bones or legs instead they have a muscle called a foot Snails can also absorb minerals through their foot by simply sitting on a rock containing it

Snails and slugs are invertebrates Invertebrates are animals with no back bones The shell on the snail helps protect it Not all shells are the same They can be different shapes sizes and colours Snails do not breathe through their mouths instead they have a breathing hole under their shells

The head is attached to the foot The mouth is like a cheese grater It is called radula It is used for cutting food In the mouth there are also little teeth On the head there are 15 mm long feelers On the end of the feelers are snails eyes Snails do not see very well

Snails are found all over the world They are even found in cold places like the Arctic They are also found in warm places like beaches and deserts Not all snails live on land Some snails live in the water They live in the sea fish tanks rivers and oceans They dont swim in the water They stick on rocks Snails also live on land They live in caves and dark places Snails can be found in dark places such as in a garden under plants

Snails eat a lot of vegetables such as lettuce cucumber and carrots Snails also eat fruit like apples Snails use their radula to cut food The radula is the mouth

Many animals eat snails Fireflies snakes beetles fish insects turtles and people all eat snails To defend themselves snails hide in their shells or pull in their feelers 

Slugs are invertebrates this means they have no back bones Slugs do not have shells Slugs look a lot like snails but they have no shells Slugs are also mollusks Slugs have soft and squishy bodies Slugs have a head They have eyes on the tip of their tentacles slugs have a file like tongue A slug has a hole half way along the body for breathing Slugs only have one foot they use their foot for moving and the foot is a muscle

Many slugs live in North America Slugs like living in damp places Slugs come out in early mornings and after the rain You can find slugs in gardens and parks Slugs come out in spring and summer

Gunpowder is a mix of chemical substances It burns very rapidly and creates gases Those gases use up more space than the gunpowder they come from so they push outward If the gunpowder is in a small space the gasses will push on the walls of the space building up pressure A bullet is pushed on in this way inside of a gun causing it to fly out at high speeds The pressure is not high enough though to destroy the gun barrel Gun powder is packed into metal cylinders behind the bullet called the cartridge The cartridge is detonated when it gets hit really hard by a pin or hammer 

Gunpowder was probably invented by the Chinese the first references of black powder which is a form of gun powder date to the 13th century when Roger Bacon described the formula of black powder

A Midsummer Nights Dream is a comedy written by William Shakespeare It is one of his most played pieces It was written before 1598 when Frances Meres told about it in his Wits Treasury Meres wrote so Shakespeare among the English is the most excellent in both kinds for the stage for comedy witness his Gentlemen of Verona his Errors his Loves Labours Lost his Loves Labours Won his Midsummer Nights Dream and his Merchant of Venice It is about four young lovers from Athens It mostly plays in a forest It has become known especially because the characters interact with fairies Besides the theatre play which is very popular lots of films have been made of it Benjamin Britten wrote an opera about it 

The story of the play is quite complicated as it involves lots of the characters falling in love with the wrong people It is made more complicated when the fairies decide secretly to give some people a love potion to make them fall in love with different people

At the beginning Egeus wants his daughter Hermia to marry Demetrius but Hermia does not want to because she loves a different man named Lysander Meanwhile Helena is in love with Demetrius Hermia and Lysander decide to run away to the woods together but Demetrius finds out and follows Hermia there and Helena follows Demetrius Soon all four of the lovers are lost in the woods

While this is happening Oberon and Titania are arguing Titania has found a young boy whom she wants to use as a helper and Oberon is angry because he wants the boy as his own servant Because Oberon and Titania are magical their fighting makes the weather stormy and misty which is what makes the four human lovers get even more lost With the help of Puck Oberons cheeky fairy helper Oberon decides to teach Titania a lesson by finding a love potion and secretly giving it to her when she is asleep so that when she wakes up she will fall in love with the first thing she sees Oberon and Puck hope she might fall in love with a wild animal which would be very embarrassing 

Oberon also sees the lovers arguing and feels sorry for Helena and Demetrius so he tells Puck to give Demetrius the love potion too so that he will love Helena But Puck makes a mistake and gives the potion to Lysander by accident so when Lysander wakes up he loves Helena instead of Hermia like before Hermia is sad about this and she has a big argument with Helena

Meanwhile the workmen are practising their play in the woods and Puck decides to play a trick on Nick Bottom by giving him donkey ears The other actors are scared and run away so Bottom decides to lie down and go to sleep He is sleeping near Titania who wakes up and falls in love with him straight away

Oberon realises what has happened to the lovers and he gives some of the love potion to Demetrius Now Demetrius and Lysander both love Helena who thinks they are playing a mean trick on her Very sad and confused all of the lovers fall asleep again At last Puck gives the right lovers the potion and when they wake up Lysander loves Hermia and Demetrius loves Helena Everyone is happy

The workmen perform the play at the wedding of Theseus and Hippolyta Its very funny as they get a lot of it wrong and mix things up Oberon has stopped Titania being in love with Bottom and they are happy with each other again They use their magic to bless all of the lovers in the play

Some of the characters in the play are people and some of them are fairies

Puck A silly fairy

Vodka is an alcoholic drink that is usually about 40 alcohol It is clear and is often mixed with other liquids before people drink it 

Vodka can be made from different things

The process to make vodka is

Unlike cognac or whisky vodka is not usually matured in barrels but bottled immediately Some Scandinavian vodkas called akvavit are matured in oak barrels before they are bottled When the vodka is bottled it is ready for drinking

Most people think the name Vodka comes from the Slavic word for water in its diminutive form little water The earliest mention of Vodka in Poland is in 1405 The Russians are known to have first used the word in June 8 1751 It is not known if it was the Russians or the Poles who made the first drinks that could be classified as vodka

There are two basic kinds of Vodka clear vodka and flavored vodka Some types of vodka have plants or herbs added to the unflavored vodka to make it taste better Flavored vodka is popular in America

Vodka is either drunk pure or cocktails are made with it The simplest form of cocktail is to mix it with orange or lemon juice Usually vodka is drunk during a longer meal Usually salty or sour things are served In Russia and Poland Vodka is drunk from glasses that can hold about 100 grams of vodka Very often it is consumed with a slice of lemon The glass is usually emptied in one draught while holding the breath Directly afterwards something small is eaten Before drinking a toast is given

Its traditional in Russia and other Slavic countries to put a glass of vodka with a slice of bread on top on graves or near photos of the deceased in their memory This is similar to what people in Western country do with flowers

Sexual reproduction is how most animals and plants reproduce Some protists and fungi also reproduce this way Organisms that reproduce sexually have two different sexes male and female Offspring is made by a sperm fertilising an ovum from the female Different steps are involved in the process

The cells of an animal or higher plant have two sets of chromosomes they are diploid When gametes are produced they have only one set of chromosomes they are haploid They have undergone a process of cell division called meiosis Two things happen during meiosis each of which makes the offspring more variable That means they are different from the parents and from each other

Assortment is when the double set of chromosomes becomes a single set in each gamete In each pair of chromosomes which one goes into a single gamete is random Because the gene alleles on each chromosome are not always the same this means that there is genetic variation between gametes This process was Mendels first law the law of segregation

Because crossing over occurs during meiosis this increases the variety of the chromosomes This makes it possible to get recombination 

The consequence of assortment and crossing over makes it certain that no two offspring of the same mother and father are identical except for identical twins They are identical genetically because they developed from the same fertilised egg 

There are advantages and disadvantages of sexual reproduction compared to asexual reproduction The main issues are

Gonads are specialized sex organs where gametes are formed In the male the gonad is the testes while in the female the gonad is the ovaries

Gametes are specialized sex cells formed in gonads by gametogenesis The male gamete is the sperm and the female is ova

Spermatogensis process which produces haploid sperm

Oogenesis process which produces haploid egg cells

Differences Between sperm and ovum Sperm male sex cell microscopic many mature created at one time Ovum female sex cell largest cell in body created from birth fixed able to mature

Hermaphorodites organism containing male and female sex organs Examples earthworms snails hydra able to reproduce with a second parent self fertilization is unlikely

Fertilizations sperm penetrates membrane of ovum structure that now exists zygote

Cleavage early stage of embryo development Cell number increases by cell division

1 Morula Solid ball of cells

2 Blastula hollow ball of cells filled w fluid

3 Gastrulation Blastula continues to grow cell continue mitosis Several 100 cells on 1 side begin to move in form a 2 layered embryo Developed into 3 layered embryo which is endoderm mesoderm and ectoderm

Ectoderm develops into nervous system which includes the brain spinal cord and peripheral nerves Also the lining of mouth anus nostrils spidermis sweat glands hair nails

Mesoderm develops into bones muscles reproductive system kidneys blood blood vessels inner layer of skin

Endoderm develops into lining of digestive system respiratory system liver pancreas and bladder

Growth and Differentiation differentiation changing of unspecialized embryonic cells into specializd cells to tissue and organs 

Why do cells differentiate Parts of DNA tuned onoff determines the role of a cell

Leprosy is an infectious disease It has been known for a very long time Today it is mostly called Hansens disease named after the person who discovered the bacterium Gerhard Armauer Hansen It is caused by a bacterium Mycobacterium leprae 

As of 2004 the estimated number of new infections was about 400000

Getting the disease is hard since it requires close contact with someone who has it over a long period of time In addition about 95 of people seem to be naturally immune to it 

Most cases of leprosy occur in India and other developing countries There are practically no cases of leprosy in the developed world This is because there are excellent drugs and people regularly take antibiotics which will kill the leprosy bacteria 

In former times leprosy was seen as a divine punishment for sins committed

The order Carnivora is a group of mammals The group is divided into the cat like Feliformia and the dog like Caniformia 

Animals of the order Carnivora are called carnivorans but often are called carnivores Many animals of Carnivora are carnivores but there are also a lot of omnivores and a few of the animals eat mostly plants 

Fowl usually refers to birds belonging to one of two biological orders namely the gamefowl or landfowl and the waterfowl It happens that birds in these groups are good to eat and often hunted by gun So the word fowl may be used for a gamebird

Studies of anatomical and molecular similarities suggest these two groups are close evolutionary relatives Together they form the fowl clade the Galloanserae This clade is also supported by morphological and DNA sequence data as well as retrotransposon data

A receipt is usually a piece of paper but in some parts of the world they can also be hard tokens The word comes from receive which means to get

Receipts are used to show or prove that someone has got or received something It usually shows proof that something has been paid for It might also be used to show that something was brought in to be fixed for example a bicycle

The word error can mean different things In Latin error means wandering or going away but it is used more often to mean mistake

In statistics an error does not mean a mistake A statistical error is the amount by which a sample differs from its expected value The expected value is based on the whole population from which the individual was chosen

A tricky point is the following

The word error can be used to describe a computer program that was not written in the right way A syntax error is a bit of source code that does not make sense to the computer A logic error is a mistake in the algorithm used which might result in problems with the output 

An error may also be an exception which is something that happens unexpectedly For example it is an error to try to write more files onto a disk that is full Careful programmers write code that can deal with errors that may happen they can do this by labeling each error with an error code and using exception handling Continuing to run a program when an error has not been dealt with can cause error avalanche which means errors pile up and behavior becomes more difficult to predict

Monotremes are a group of mammals that form the order Monotremata Monotremes are the only mammals that lay eggs but they also feed their babies with milk

The word monotreme refers to their common rear opening the cloaca In reptiles and probably all early tetrapods there is a common opening for urine reproduction and faeces

 Evolution  Monotremes are derived from earlier mammals than the marsupials and eutherians but their fossil record is poor 

The time at which the monotreme line diverged from other mammalian lines is uncertain but one survey of genetic studies gives an estimate of about 220 million years ago This is in the Upper Triassic Fossils of a jaw fragment 110 million years old were found at Lightning Ridge New South Wales This means they originated up to 100 million years before the Metatheria or Eutheria so they are definitely living fossils

The egg laying and the cloaca are primitive features inherited from earlier synapsid tetrapods 

But the monotremes also have other features such as the production of milk caring for their young in burrows homeothermy and a neocortex in their brains These are advanced features which they share with placentals and marsupials This mixture of basal and derived features is characteristic of the way different body parts often evolve at different rates This is called mosaic evolution 

In mammals a monophyletic group there were a number of different lines living at the same time through the Upper Triassic to the Upper Cretaceous Each of these lines had a mixture of basal and derived features until at last the placental mammals developed the whole suite of derived characters This gave them a great advantage over the other groups wherever open competition occurred However because of their long seclusion in southern continents some of the monotremes and marsupials have survived

There are two surviving families of monotremes with five living species They all live in Australia and New Guinea People commonly know them as the platypus and the spiny anteaters There is only one platypus that exists now the duck billed platypus The four others are the spiny anteaters or the echidna

The FIFA Club World Cup is a competition in the sport of Club football The Fdration Internationale de Football Association organizes the World Cup every one year It is normally contested between the Champions of each continent and the champion of the host country

Metatheria is a group in the class Mammalia which contains the marsupials and the sparassodonts 

First proposed by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1880 it is nearly synonymous with the earlier taxon Marsupialia but it also contains the nearest fossil relatives of marsupial mammals

The earliest known representative Sinodelphys is from the Lower Cretaceous of China 

The closest relatives of the metatheres are the Eutheria Both are conventionally united as infraclasses within the subclass Theria which contains all living mammals except monotremes

During development metatherians produce a yolk sac placenta and give birth to larval like offspring 

These offspring have underdeveloped rear limbs and after birth they migrate to the marsupium where they attach to a nipple The mouth of newly born metatherians forms an O shape into which the mothers nipple fits Then it swells to secure the offspring into place

The Greek words meta and theria roughly means the other beasts in contrast with Eutheria

Metatherians first appeared in the Cretaceous period Some stem groupstem metatherians persisted well into the Neogene period before becoming extinct Crown group marsupials the one branch of Metatheria that survives today diversified close to the time of extinction at the end of the Cretaceous

Mixed martial arts is a sport where two people fight to see which one is dominant 

The people who organize a MMA fight can decide the rules for that fight There is not one group of people who decide the rules for all MMA fightsin the world Some states regulate all professional fights including MMA fights and set some rules

MMA fights have few rules Boxing have many rules

Fighters can use any martial art or combination of arts they like in the fight In these fights fighters can fight standing with punches kicks and other strikes in a clinch where fighters are grabbing each other while standing or on the ground

Each fighter will try to defeat the other either by submission or knock out Each fight can last only for a period of time after the time ends judges decide who is the winner The referee in the fight will make sure no one gets hurt too badly and that rules are followed

The pankration was an old style of unarmed combat The ancient Greeks introduced this sport into the Olympic Games in the 648 BC Some public fights took place at the end of the 19th century They represented different styles of fighting including jujutsu wrestling Greco Roman wrestling and others in competitions and challenges across Europe After World War I wrestling was born again in two main flows The first flow was real competition the second flow began to depend more on the choreography and on the grand public shows that resulted in professional wrestling 

Modern mixed martial arts has its roots in two kinds of competition the Vale Tudo and Japanese Shootfighting 

Vale Tudo began circa 1930 when Carlson Gracie invited every competitor to compete in a fight That was the so called Gracies Challenge Later Hlio Gracie and the Gracie family continued this 

In Japan about 1970 Antonio Inoki organized a series of mixed martial arts fights They were the forces that produced the Shootwrestling and they later caused the developing of the first organization of mixed martial arts known as Shooto Mixed martial arts obtained great popularity in the United States in 1993 when Rorion Gracie helped create the first UFC event one of the earliest MMA events in the USA In 1997 in Japan the interest for this sport resulted in the creation of the greater organization of mixed martial arts  Pride Fighting Championship

The Gracie family caused the tournaments as the UFC to be well known It should be noticed that the UFC is the most famous tournament but the persons who practises Brazilian jiujitsu normally do not use blows Undoubtedly the Gracie family played an important role in the creation of open competitions of Vale Tudo and in causing them to be well known through the television Nevertheless before anyone created the UFC or Shooto where the persons who represent every method of self defense can fight there had already existed such mixed martial arts

About the year 1990 three styles were famous for their effectiveness in the competitions of the mixed martial arts the wrestling the Brazilian jiu jitsu and the shootwrestling This can be because of their attention given to the combat by means of holds Before the year 1990 the promoters organized a lacking amount of the competitions of the mixed martial arts and some martial arts base on blows Therefore probably most instructors of these arts had given too little attention to the holds

The Soviet war in Afghanistan was a war fought between the forces of the Soviet Union and Islamic tribes of Afghanistan who were against the Communist government set up by the Soviets The war began in December 1979 and lasted until February 1989 Many people were killed or wounded in this long war About 15000 Soviet soldiers were killed and about 35000 were wounded About 1 million Afghans were killed The anti Communist Afghan forces had support from many countries mainly the United States and Pakistan 

The war started when the Soviet Union sent its 40th Army to fight in Afghanistan They began to reach Afghanistan from 25 December 1979 The fighting continued for about ten years Then from 15 May 1988 the Soviet troops started to leave Afghanistan This continued until 2 February 1989 On 15 February 1989 the Soviet Union announced that all its troops had left Afghanistan

Arabs moved into this area in 642 and they were Muslims Almost all the people of Afghanistan also started to follow Islam after that The country has many mountains and deserts that make movement difficult The population is made up mainly of Pashtun people along with Tajiks Hazara Aimak Uzbeks Turkmen people and some other small groups

In 1979 Hafizullah Amin was the ruler of Afghanistan The Soviets were told by its KGB spies that Amins rule was a threat to the part of Central Asia that was Soviet They also suspected that Amin was not loyal to the Soviet Union They found some information about Amins attempt to be friendlier with Pakistan and China The Soviets also suspected that Amin was behind the death of president Nur Muhammad Taraki Finally the Soviets decided to remove Amin

On 22 December 1979 Soviet advisors to the Army of Afghanistan took many steps They stopped all telecommunication links in Kabul No message could come inside the city or go outside the city Troops of the Soviet Air force also reached Kabul Amin saw some dangers He moved to the Presidential palace for better safety The palace was named Tajbeg Palace 

On 27 December 1979 about 700 Soviet troops took over major government and military buildings at Kabul The troops wore uniforms similar to the army of Afghanistan At 700 pm the Soviet troops destroyed Kabuls communication This stopped all communication among Afghan troops At 715 pm Soviet troops entered Tajbeg Palace By morning of 28 December the first part of the military action was over Amin and his two sons were killed in the fighting by this time The Soviets announced freedom of Afghanistan from the rule of President Amin They also said that all the Soviet soldiers were there to fulfill their duty as stated in the Treaty of Friendship Cooperation and Good Neighborliness of 1978

An announcement came from the Kabul radio station about the killing of Hafizullah Amin The Pro Soviet Afghan Revolutionary Central Committee took the responsibility for this killing Then the ARCC chose Babrak Karmal as the head of government of Afghanistan He asked the Soviet Union for military assistance

The Communist government of Afghanistan asked the Soviet Union many times to send troops The Soviet Union said this was not an invasion because the troops were asked to come by the Communist Government of Afghanistan But the United States said this was just an excuse by the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan 

The Soviet soldiers did many things in Afghanistan But they could never control all parts of Afghanistan Several Afghan groups continued to attack and fight with the Soviet troops

People in most countries around the world did not like what the Soviet Union was doing in Afghanistan But they liked the way the Afghan people were fighting them Some reactions were very serious US President Jimmy Carter said that the Soviet action was the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War

By mid 1980s many groups in Afghanistan had organized themselves They fought the Soviet troops These groups received help from many countries like United States United Kingdom China Saudi Arabia and Pakistan 

Pakistan thought that the Soviet war in Afghanistan was also a threat to it It also started its active support to Afghans fighting the Soviet troops 

The Soviet war in Afghanistan seemed like a war that would never end The Soviet Union looked very bad in the eyes of the world for trying to control this country Inside the Soviet Union also most people did not support this war Finally after ten years with no end in sight the Soviets decided to get out of Afghanistan

The Soviet war in Afghanistan badly affected the rule of Communist Party Many thought that the war was against Islam This created strong feelings among the Muslim population of Central Asian Soviet Republics The Soviet army was really in very low spirits or morale because they were unable to control the people and were treated only as invaders everywhere they went Andrei Sakharov openly said the action of Soviet Army in Afghanistan was wrong 

Over 15000 Soviet troops got killed in Afghanistan from 1979 until 1989 In the war the Soviet Army also lost hundreds of aircraft and billions worth of other military machines Around a million Afghan men women and children died in the war

Even after the Soviet Army left Afghanistan civil war continued in Afghanistan For about three years the Communist government of Najibullah could defend itself from the mujaheddin forces opposing it Many groups had arisen within the government itself and some of them supported the mujaheddin forces In March 1992 General Abdul Rashid Dostam and his Uzbek militia stopped supporting the Najibullahs government Soon mujaheddin forces won Kabul and started to rule most parts of Afghanistan 

During this war lasting for about ten years Afghanistans economy suffered badly Grain production came down to 35 per year between 1978 and 1990 The Soviets also tried to bring commercial and industrial activities under state control This also had a bad affect on the economy With the break up of the Soviet Union in many countries Afghanistans traditional trade also suffered 

At the beginning many people and countries had praised the USA for supporting groups fighting the Soviet forces But after the September 11 attacks people started to question the US policy of supporting and giving money to such groups

During the Iraq Iran War the Persian Gulf came into news Both sides attacked oil tankers of each other When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1991 this war got the name the Persian Gulf War But this war major fighting happened on the land 

The water in the Persian Gulf is rich in fishes it has long beautiful coral reefs Deep inside the water of the Persian Gulf there are many pearl oysters Due to this the area attracts a lot of activities 

In Persian language the term khalj e Fars means the Persian Gulf

The sea waters of the Persian Gulf covers an area of 233000 km On the east it connects with the Gulf of Oman by Strait of Hormuz On the west it connects a major river delta of Shatt al Arab In this river delta waters of two big rivers of the area flow into the waters of the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers

The Khalistan movement is a political movement that wants to create an independent state for Sikh people inside the current Republic of India Such a state already existed in Punjab from 1799 to 1849 It was called the Sikh Empire The new state created would be called Khalistan Its capital would be Chandigarh

The movement was most popular in the 1970s and 1980s In 1971 the movement could collect millions of dollars of funding Today it is seen on a smaller scale There are claims that the movement supports young people financially if they join militant groups fighting to get a Sikh homeland Most of this funding comes from Sikh supporters outside the current state of India

On April 12 1980 Jagjit Singh Chauhan a prominent supporter of the movement met with Indira Gandhi After the meeting he declared that he had formed the National Council Of Khalistan at Anandpur Sahib He said he was the President of this movement and Balbir Singh Sandhu was its Secretary General In May 1980 Chauhan travelled to London and announced the formation of Khalistan A similar announcement was made by Sandhu in Amritsar Sandhu also released stamps and currency of Khalistan Some people said the Indian authorities in Amritsar and elsewhere should not have been inactive and that this was a planned political move by the Indian National Congress 

In the 1980s some supporters of the movement became violent The Indian Army reciprocated the violence In one such incident the Indian Army forced their way into the Harmandir Sahib also known as the Golden Temple The Indian Government was criticised for how they handled the operation which resulted in deaths to both parties and damage to the Temple Many Sikhs say that the Indian Government desecrated the holiest Sikh shrine Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her two Sikh bodyguards and many thousands of Sikhs were massacred in the following riots In January 1986 the Golden Temple was occupied by militants of the All India Sikh Students Federation and Damdami Taksal On 26 January 1986 the gathering passed a resolution favouring the creation of Khalistan The people in favor of Khalistan said it should become a Sikh majority state Those opposed to the idea said the state would probably become a theocracy

The Constitution of India says it is forbidden to make new states which are independent of India This is known as secession Different groups in favor of Khalistan fought an insurgency against the government of India Indian security forces suppressed this insurgency in the early 1990s Since then little has been done inside Punjab to get a Sikh state but certain organisations in favor of Khalistan such as Dal Khalsa are still active outside India

People in the US who supported the idea of Khalistan include Dan Burton Jesse Helms and Edolphus Towns Other people who sympathise are Eric Lubbock fourth Baron Avebury and Lord Nazir Ahmed

There are about 30 such agreements Based on these agreements the member countries trade with each other They sell items to each other and follow a set of rules They have to give a special job to the other country The phrase used is to give the other country a special job this is known as to give the other country a most favored country job From 2004 if a member sells any item to another member country the same type of item should be offered to all other member countries 

While it is highly regarded from its beginning the WTO has also received criticism

The Self Strengthening Movement was a reform organised during the late Qing With the defeat in the Opium Wars and the outbreak of Taiping Rebellion the emperor and the imperial officials realised that it was necessary to improve the countrys statement with a series of reforms Therefore the Self Strengthening Movement was started 

The movement could be divided into three phases the first phase the second phase and the third phase The Major Leaders are Yixin Prince Gong Wenxiang Zeng Guofan Li Hongzhang Zuo Zongtang Shen Baozhen and Zhang Zhidong However owing to the conservatives opposition and the problems of modernization it failed finally

With the failure of the Self Strengthening Movenment the defeat in the First Sino Japanese War and the scramble for concessions many Chinese leaders realised that reforms were urgently needed Thus the Hundred Days Reform was started in 1898 AD The leaders of the reform were Guangxu Emperor Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao Eventually it ended in a coup dtat led by Empress Dowager Cixi

The Manchus changed their ways to be more like the Chinese in order to rule them better The Manchus started wearing Chinese clothes and writing in Chinese They began to enjoy Chinese food and art One of the Manchu emperors Qianlong Emperor began to worry about how much like the Chinese the Manchus were becoming and he tried to get Manchus to be more Manchu Qianlong Emperor made Manchus ride horses and shoot bows and arrows so that they would remember where they came from The Chinese people used different types of clothes like maccukaukonahaschinin and sakahn

In the early Qing Guangdong was a province There were totally 79 counties In 1911 AD it was checked that there were 5041780 households approximately 28001564 people The famous mountains in Guangdong were Lingchau Huangling and Luofu Dongjiang Beijiang and Xijiang were the most important rivers in Guangdong Guangzhou Zhaoqing Xiamen and Fujian were the major Guangdong cities

Hypnosis is a state of mind or a set of attitudes which is created by a special procedure Usually one person talks to another in a special way that puts the subject into a trance While the subject is in this state he can be influenced The hypnotist can tell him to forget his name or that the room is hot or that he is someone else

Hypnosis works with a special way of communicating called suggestions or hypnotic suggestions In the past these were called hypnotic commands but this term is misleading because the subject is free to follow them or not

Hypnotherapy is when a hypnotist uses hypnosis to help the subject heal emotionally or to heal a sick mind Hypnotherapy is hypnosis used for therapy

Hypnosis can also be done by one person acting alone Then he is acting as both hypnotist and subject This is called self hypnosis or sometimes auto suggestion In some cases this is simply a form of using trance

There seem to be many ideas about how hypnosis started The Hindus of India claim that they started the method and used it as a cure for health This is one of the main uses of hypnosis today and is linked to psychology

But the main hypnosis discoveries came in 1842 when James Braid started to learn more about its effects He is often called the Father of Modern Hypnotism He did not think that mesmerism was the cause of hypnosis and in the end he thought that trances were only a nervous sleep In 1843 he wrote a book about this with the title Neurypnology

The hypnotist must do two things to do hypnosis First he must put the subject into a trance Second he must lead the subject through the trance process Often he will switch between these first making sure the subject is in the proper state of mind and then leading him through the process These steps are repeated in a cycle throughout

In trance the subject does not make decisions about the truth of the hypnotists suggestions If trance is reached  it is not always  the subject will accept as true anything the hypnotist says unless it goes against the subjects deepest beliefs This is the heart of hypnosis to put the subject in trance so he will accept suggestions

Hypnosis is very useful against fears addictions emotional trouble pain control stress and so on Some hypnotists claim to be able to help against physical diseases too but scientific studies find no effect better than chance

Master hypnotists can get truly amazing effects from good subjects they can make them forget their names believe they are someone else make them see people who are not there make them forget letters or numbers and so on 

This happens because the subject actively follows the hypnotists suggestions because he trusts the hypnotist and he believes it is safe If the trust is broken or the subject believes it is not safe the subject will emerge from trance

For example if the hypnotist tells the subject to do something he would never do because it is against his morals or religion the subject will not do it Instead he will break the trance

Hypnosis is not truly a power resting in the hypnotist Instead the power rests in the mind of the subject The hypnotist simply knows how to guide the subject through trance

Hypnosis works because of the way the human mind handles language It is not magic

The M6 motorway is the longest motorway in the United Kingdom It is one of the busiest motorways in the country It is often referred to as The Backbone of Britain The M6 is part of the unsigned E road E24 from the M1 to the M6 Toll near Birmingham The E5 joins the M6 Toll from the M42 and then uses the M6 to its north end at Carlisle Then it continues along the M74 The motorway is 230 miles long This is is 37 miles longer than the M1 motorway

The first section of the motorway was opened on 5 December 1958 and was what is now known as the Preston by pass It was built by a company called Tarmac Construction It was the first motorway in the United Kingdom It was opened by Prime Minister Harold Macmillan The motorway was extended in both directions The M6 was the first ever motorway to be opened in the United Kingdom 

Junction 6 in Birmingham has the name Spaghetti Junction This is because it looks very complex from the sky

On the high ground between Shap and Tebay the north and south bound carriages split apart Strangely at this point a local road runs between the two carriageways without a link to the motorway

The section of the M6 which runs over Shap Fell in Cumbria is 1050 ft above sea level This is one of the highest points on any motorway in the UK The West Coast Main Line railway follows the same course It runs alongside the M6 for much of its length

The motorway starts at the M1 in Rugby It passes through Birmingham and Spaghetti Junction The motorway continues to the north passing Liverpool and Manchester It goes around Preston and up to Lancaster It then follows through a valley past the Lake District and Penrith It finishes at Carlisle

At the end of the M6 motorway at Carlisle there is a 6 mile stretch of the A74 which links England to Scotland This is called the Cumberland Gap This was caused by an argument between the British Parliament and the Scottish Parliament which left neither the M6 or the A74 being built After a lot of controversy building started on the remaining six miles When it is completed there will be a complete motorway going from London to Glasgow

The M6 Toll is a toll road which was opened in 2003 It starts at Junction 11A and runs around Birmingham to Junction 3A It is the first toll road to be built in the United Kingdom It was opened on 9 December 2003 It is reported to save 45 minutes from the average journey 

The Sloth Bear is a bear that lives in South Asia

Sloth Bears have long and shaggy black fur but its fur can also be brown On its chest it has a white or yellow mark which is shaped like an Y or V They have big feet with long claws The long claws are also the reason for its English name because the claws look like the claws of a Sloth

Sloth Bears eat insects like for example termites But they also eat fruit honey eggs and also meat

Female Sloth Bears usually have 1 2 babies sometimes 3 Young Sloth Bears stay with their mother for 2 3 years In captivity they can live to be 40 years old

An inclined plane is a simple machine It allows one to use less force to move an object

Examples of inclined planes are ramps sloping roads and hills plows chisels hatchets air hammers carpenters planes and wedges The typical example of an inclined plane is a sloped surface for example a roadway to bridge a height difference 

Another simple machine based on the inclined plane is the blade in which two inclined planes placed back to back allow the two parts of the cut object to move apart using less force than would be needed to pull them apart in opposite directions

To calculate the forces on an object placed on an inclined plane consider the three forces acting on it

If the component of the force from gravity parallel to the surface is greater than the static frictional force fs then the body will slide down the inclined plane with acceleration where fk is the force of friction otherwise it will remain stationary 

When the angle of the slope is zero sin is also zero so the body will not move

The giant panda is a type of bear It lives in bamboo forests in central China The giant panda is an endangered animal In November 2007 China had 239 giant pandas who lived in captivity There are 27 giant pandas which live in zoos outside of China The exact number of giant pandas in the wild is not known Some sources say there are about 1590 other sources give a number between 2000 and 3000 The number of giant pandas in the wild seems to be increasing

Giant pandas are about 1215 m long and about 75 cm high They weigh between 75 and 160 kg Giant pandas have white fur on their bodies and black fur on their legs and shoulders They also have black ears and black patches around their eyes Pandas can climb and swim well

Giant pandas are born with pink skin with black areas on the legs ears and eyes They are usually born with a small amount of white fur They get more fur when they are about nine months old

The giant panda is a type of bear Its closest bear relative is the Spectacled Bear of South America There is another type of creature that shares the giant pandas habitat and has many similar traits This is the red panda which scientists thought must be related But a giant panda is a bear and a red panda is more closely related to a raccoon or a skunk The red and giant pandas have many things in common Both have a similar diet eating mostly bamboo They also have the same kind of enlarged bone called a pseudothumb This allows them to better grip the bamboo they eat Red and giant pandas also live in the same habitat Some people have called the giant panda a living fossil Most other species closely related to the Giant Panda do not exist anymore There is now only one species under the genus of Ailuropoda 

Currently there are two subspecies of giant panda

Giant pandas live alone Females have a territory which they defend against other females When female pandas are ready to mate they give off a special scent and make a loud bleating noise to tell the males that they are ready Giant pandas mate between the months of March and May which is the Summer months in China If there are several males they fight each other The one who wins the strongest male then mates with the female In August or September the female gives birth to one or two babies If she has two babies she will only raise one baby and the other baby dies no one really knows how the female panda choose between the two Giant panda babies are very small and weigh only 90130 grams which is about 1900 of its mothers weight The baby drinks milk until it is 89 months old Young pandas live with their mothers until they are 1824 months old They become mature when they are 57 years old They live around 20 years in the wild and up to 30 years in captivity Unlike other bears pandas do not hibernate

Today the giant panda is seen as a symbol for China It is also protected by the Chinese government and killing a panda is a crime The giant panda is now under the threat of extinction and it will die out if the forests of bamboo continue to disappear

People outside of eastern Asia did not know about the giant panda until 1869 The first Westerner to see a live panda was a German zoologist in 1916 In 1936 Ruth Harkness became the first Westerner to bring a live giant panda out of China It was a cub named Su Lin The cub was taken to live at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago

In the 1970s China began showing giant pandas in zoos in the United States and Japan as a type of diplomacy This happened until 1984 when China changed how this was done Starting in 1984 China would allow zoos to keep the giant pandas for 10 years but the zoo would have to pay China up to 1000000 each year Also the zoo would have to agree that any cubs born would belong to China

Currently 12 cities outside of China have zoos that have giant pandas

The Adelaide Zoo in Adelaide Australia got two giant pandas in 2009

Although their bodies are made to eat meat giant pandas are mostly herbivorous Their main source of food is bamboo Because pandas have the digestive system of carnivores and can not digest cellulose very well they get little energy and protein from the bamboo they eat Because they get very little nutrition from bamboo they must eat a lot Pandas commonly eat 20 to 30 pounds of bamboo a day to get the nutrition they need Although there are more than 200 different varieties of bamboo the Panda will only eat 20 varieties Pandas sometimes run out of food as a type of bamboo flowers die and regrow again at the same time

As of 2008 the giant bear is an endangered animal The main problem they have is habitat loss Habitat loss is when the places they live in are ruined Humans often ruin the places where pandas live such as for the construction of buildings Pandas can also lose their habitat because of pollution Pollution means that less bamboo grows or that bamboo stops growing completely in a certain place Giant pandas also have a low birth rate which makes the problem worse

Traditional Chinese stories about the giant pandas say that the animal can be very powerful Some people believe that sleeping on a panda skin can protect them for ghost and predict their future These tales are one of the reasons why people would spend lots of money for the skin and fur of this precious animal

In former times the pandas were also hunted The Western people who came to China were soon unable to hunt the pandas because of different wars Local people continued though Pandas were mainly hunted for their fur Today hunting pandas is forbidden

In 1963 China set up a nature reserve for pandas the Wolong National Nature Reserve This was the first other nature reserves followed China did this to fight the number of pandas going down In 2006 there were 40 panda reserves compared to 13 two decades ago

 A Steam engine is an engine which uses steam from boiling water to make it go It can change the energy which is in hot steam into movement which can then be used to work a factory or move a railway train or boat

The steam engine was invented by James Watt around 1776 and they were very important during the industrial revolution where they replaced horses windmills and watermills to work machines The first steam engines were piston engines The steam pressure pushed on a piston which made it move along a cylinder and so they had a reciprocal motion This could move a pump directly or work a crank to turn a wheel and work a machine

Steam engines were used in factories to work machines and in mines to move pumps

Later smaller engines were built that could move railway locomotives and steam boats

The steam to power a steam engine is made in a boiler Water in the boiler is heated to make steam The steam coming out of the boiler applies the force on a piston or turbine blade Movement of the piston or the turbine blade is then used to turn wheels or drive other machinery To boil the water in the boiler several types of fuels may be used It may be wood coal or oil 

Today almost all steam engines are turbines which have no pistons but spin like a windmill pushed by jets of steam These work much better than the original kinds of piston steam engines They are used in power plants to operate generators which make electricity Some ships like large warships are also powered by steam turbines

Programming is telling a computer how to do certain things by giving it instructions These instructions are called programs A person who writes instructions is a computer programmer These instructions come in different languages they are called programming languages Sometimes programmers use special software which helps them to make programs and sometimes they use simpler software called a text editor which only gives them a place to type 

A program is a set of instructions for the computer to follow Making these instructions in computer form would be tedious and difficult so instructions are written in quasi English which has to be turned into computer form instructions so the computer can follow them A compiler is what we call the translator from the half English language to the computer language Some languages called interpreted languages use interpreters instead of compilers

Once a program has been compiled the instructions in machine form are written into a file that contains a series of numbers that the computer can understand These files are generally called executables These machine instructions will be loaded into the computers memory so that the CPU can run them when the executable is opened 

BASIC is one of the first programming languages ever to be created It was first used as a programming language on console computers The name is an acronym that spells Beginners All purpose Symbolic Instruction Code

It was designed by John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz in 1963 It was made to follow these eight principles

The creators made the compiler free of charge to make programmers interested in using the language Since the creation a large number of compilers have been made so users can make their programs

Many scientists and others are interested in the temperature record of Earth Especially the temperature changes in the past 1000 years

Temperatures were not measured that far back so weather records are used Unfortunately the weather records can be wrong so the final temperature records are not accurate

The average worldwide temperature will drop in about two centuries for an ice age will occur

As fresh water from the melting ice caps is added to the Atlantic Ocean the North Atlantic Current will come to a halt This current is based on a balance of salt water and fresh water Fresh water from the ice caps will damage this balance the current will stop and Europe which is kept warm during the winter because of the North Atlantic Current will freeze but this will not happen because the earth is warming

Camping is a leisure activity where people leave their homes and spend one or more nights outdoors usually to enjoy nature or a different environment Usually they will sleep in a tent or may not need to use one if the weather is warm In some parts of the world tents are peoples homes 

When camping people usually prepare food to eat that is easy to make If they were hunting or fishing they may cook the animal or fish they caught over a campfire Camping is often done in recreational vehicles or tent trailers by most North Americans 

While camping many dangers can arise such as wild animals including cougars bears and wolves

Camelids are a group of even toed ungulate mammals They form the family Camelidae There are six living species of camelids

The animals of the genus Camelus are also called Afro Asiatic Camelids The animals of the genus Lama and genus Vicugna are also called South American Camelids 

There also exists a camelid hybrid called a Cama It is the child of a female Llama and a male Dromedary Camel The Cama does not exist in nature but is made by humans through artificial insemination

The two Camelus species originally lived in northern Africa south west and eastern Asia The other four camelids lived in South America

Camelids have been domesticated by humans for about 5000 years They have been important for transport but were also kept for wool meat and milk The llama and alpaca were very important for the South American cultures like the Inka The camels were used by people in north Africa and Asia especially in deserts

Western New Guinea is the western half of the island of New Guinea As of 2006 it is internationally recognised as Papua a province of Indonesia It was previously known by various names including Netherlands New Guinea West Irian and Irian Jaya The incorporation of western New Guinea remains controversial in some quarters including some within the area itself and those who do not recognise the legal issues of Indonesias claim to the area calling it West Papua

Papua was annexed by Indonesia under the controversial Act of Free Choice in 1969 In 2003 the Indonesian central government declared that the province would be split into three areas Papua Province Central Irian Jaya and West Irian Jaya Opposition to this resulted in the plan for Central Irian Jaya being scrapped and even the designation of West Irian Jaya Province is still legally unclear The independent sovereign state of Papua New Guinea borders Papua Province to the east

The Maluku Islands are an archipelago in Indonesia They are part of the larger Malay Archipelago They are located on the Australian Plate lying east of Sulawesi west of New Guinea and north of Timor The islands were also called the Spice Islands by the Chinese and Europeans Other islands have also been called the Spice Islands

Domestication is a change that happens in wild animals or plants when they are kept by humans for a long time 

If humans take wild animals and plants and keep and breed them over time the animals and plants may change The animals and plants become dependent on the humans who keep them and they change in ways that are better for human use This change happens by humans choosing which animals will breed the next generation This method is called by biologists artificial selection

The first domestication of plants happened during the first use of agriculture Human first domesticated dogs After the invention of agriculture people domesticated sheep and goats and later cattle and pigs 

Domesticated plants are crops or ornamental plants People use domesticated animals as livestock that means for food clothing and work Otherwise the domesticated animals may be kept as pets

The origin of the domestic dog began with the domestication of the grey wolf several tens of thousands of years ago Domesticated dogs provided early humans with a guard animal a source of food fur and a working animal The process continues to this day

Archaeology has placed the earliest known domestication at possibly 30000 BC and with certainty at 7000 BC Other evidence suggests that dogs were first domesticated in East Asia

Perhaps the earliest clear cultural evidence for this domestication is the first dog found buried together with human 12000 years ago in Palestine

Cats were also domesticated quite early At the beginning of agriculture people started to domesticate sheep and goats and later pigs and cattle Other animals that were domesticated early are camels donkeys and horses Some animals like the domestic rabbit were only domesticated in recent times

The first crops were domesticated around 9000 BC in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East

Night of the Living Dead is a 1968 horror movie from director George A Romero This low budget picture was followed by three sequels along with several parodies and spinoffs 

A nineteen year old goes to his home town to get a job application as a headhunter After having a curious talk the manager starts to follow him awkwardly to the bus stop Martin frantically calls his mother and tells her he thinks his manager is planning to kill him She is not able to get their in time so Martin has to take an airplane At the airport he meets his mother and a few of his high school friends including a troubled Kevin Timmerman who is being abused by his large family When Martin finds out the plain has a delay due to bad snowy weather Martin plans to stay at a nearby hotel 

While leaving the airport and returning to his home town Martin is surprised to hear that a warning over the radio is calling a zombie attack at his town that the dead have risen from the cemetery nearby He thinks this is a prank but screams and commotion suggest otherwise The threats and tension grow increasingly and Martin and a group of about fifteen other people run to a family of threes house One of them is Martins ex girlfriend Madeline The group does not find any news or coverage on the TV but does happen to get information on the local radio station They say the attack is genuine Martin and Madeline start to hear pounding and realize a Frankenstein like zombie is trying to get in the locked door At first they think it is funny he cannot get in and they tease him But he then uses his claws and an axe to hack down the door While trying to stop him a guy named Hunter gets the claws of Frankenstein in his chest eventually killing him The others scurry But Madeline Martin and Ossie stay Ossie gets his chest axed to the other two leaving The group franticlly looks for the shotgun While trying to find it Frankenstein kills a girl on the top floor sending the bedroom down to the basement because of Frankensteins weight One of them is the couples daughter While in the basement Martin tries to stab the zombie with the familys crucifix through the vent upstairs without success The father Tim gets the gun and eventually kills the stranger Staying their longer Martin explains to the group his manager must have been a zombie and that the outbreak must be spreading through the air but they have trouble believing him The next day the group hears screaming and looks out the half hacked door to see a group of the townspeople being chased by the zombies Disturbing sounds include screaming and struggling that eventually turns into failure Those who try to get in including Kevin Timmerman get killed 

After the attack the group goes out to escape but only Martin and a few others survive After being attacked by werewolves and vampires Martin calls his father at his deserted old house He is able to come along with Martins best friend Erik and he asks him if others around the area or world know about the current situation It appears no one does and they get in the car But with numerous attempts it does not work They then have to walk home but Erik stays behind to try to start the car or stay in Martins old house  On the way down about two blocks they find a figure in the middle of the street walking toward them They both argue whether its a zombie or not and the credits roll before we know what or who it is hinting to the audience to make up their own mind

Orignally every single thing that happened in Night of the Living Dead except for the dialogue was based on a dream Aaron Hammer had Even Martins famous line I think hes planning to kill me was from his dream Even the scenes of black and white alternating to color and scenes with black and white but with red blood Hammer thought it had to have been turned into a movie and so he met up with Patrick Kubrick thinking he was the perfect director for that sort of film Kubrick also casted Lauren Paul in the movie as Hammer had intended Along with Cindy Hammer Jeff Hammer Erik Nelson and Eric Malterer as Kevin Timmerman

The film actually has little music In fact two songs were adopted from Stanley Kubricks The Shining The beginning titles is simply the sound of a heart beat and background sound effects that eventually leads the heart to beat faster It then moves on to The Shining theme song In the theatrical release when Ossie gets axed there is no music in the whole entire scene But when it was released on DVD it added a score from The Shining when Mr Halloran gets axed by Jack Nicholson

Sound effects for the zombies were added on during the editing process In the Frankenstein scene he never actually makes any noise The sound of the axe going in ones body was actually the sound of an axe going into meat and animal bones Ketchup and water was used as blood and turned into red later on Other than this these are actually the only effects and music used during the entire film which gives it some realistic like power

The Russian Civil War was a civil war fought from 1918 to c1921 between several groups in Russia The main fighting was between two groups the Red Army and the White Army The Red Army was an army of communists The White Army opposed the communists Finally the Red Army won this war After this war the communists established the Soviet Union in 1922 

Tsar Nicholas II the traditional ruler of the Russian Empire had just lost his throne The Russian Revolution of 1917 had just ended Many regions forming part of the Russian Empire were not stable Many groups had arisen in the Soviet Union The workers and farmers supporting the communists organized themselves into the Red Army People opposing them organized themselves into the White Army

In Ukraine some groups fighting for a free Ukraine organized themselves as the Green Army There were several other groups The Green Army and the smaller groups fought among themselves and sometimes they fought the Red Army and the White Army 

At the same time some foreign countries were worried about the communists ruling the Soviet Union They feared that communism would come to their countries also if the communists were successful so they helped fight against the communists Red Army Slowly the war became very large and continued for years This war became known as the Russian Civil War

The Red Army and the White Army fought this war on three main regions These regions were located in the east the south and the northwest of the Soviet Union There were also three main periods of the war The outbreak of the Russian Civil War and its big scale surprised Vladimir Lenin 

Soon after the Russian Revolution of 1917 the first period of the Russian Civil War began Most of the fighting in this period was on a small scale But the fighting started at many places Some foreign countries also helped the White Army 

The second period of the Russian Civil War was a very important phase It lasted from January to November of 1919 At first the White Army was winning on all three fronts But Leon Trotsky reorganized the Red Army The Red Army fought back and the White Armys loss was heavy The White Army almost lost its fighting power

Fighting in Crimea was the third and the final period of the Russian Civil War Many soldiers of the White Army had gathered in Crimea They had made their position very secure and strong The Red Army continued to fight with them When the Polish Soviet War ended more soldiers of the Red Army could reinforce their comrades in Crimea This action defeated the White Army in November 1920

During and after the Russian Civil War Soviet Russia suffered great damage In 1920 and 1921 there was little rain which caused serious famine in 1921 About one million Russians left Russia and went to other countries to live there on a permanent basis Many of them were very educated and expert persons 

Economic loss was also very big The value of Russias currency fell In 1914 with 2 rubles one could buy a US dollar In 1920 one had to give 1200 rubles to buy one US dollar Estimates say that the war cost the Soviet Russia around 50 billion rubles or 3500000000000 in todays price Production of industrial goods fell to very low level For example The Soviet Union was producing only 5 of the cotton and only 2 of the iron ore compared to the production of 1913 Generally the production had fallen to 20 of the production of 1913

The Russian Civil War had a very bad result for agriculture also Farm produced only 37 of the normal production Number of horses fell from 35 million to 24 million The number of cattle also became less from 58 million to 37 million 

During this war the government of the Soviet Union could somehow manage the country In March 1921 four months after the defeat of the White Army in the Crimea the Lenin administration abandoned the policy of War Communism and instead formulated the New Economic Policy which allowed denationalisation of agriculture and industry but most financial institutions retained state ownership with a deregulation in such sectors On 30 December 1922 the USSR was formally created and by 1928 production returned to pre war levels Lenin however did not live to see that day his health deteriorated rapidly since July 1922 and frequent was nearly incapacitated by strokes and reluctantly handled gave many of his functions to Stalin and Trotsky Lenin tried to demote Stalin but the Party refused through a vote He died on the 21st of January 1924 at the age of 53

However after few years of this war the Soviet Union developed very fast in 1930s But the result of the First World War and the Russian Civil War was very bad for the life and society for the newborn Soviet Union People always remembered their bad results

El Nio Southern Oscillation is a term describing a natural event that takes place in the Pacific Ocean It is also called El Nio and La Nia El Nino and La Nina are English words for the Spanish words El Nio and La Nia In Spanish they mean the little boy and the little girl El Nio is used in Spanish for to describe the infant Jesus Christ

El Nio is when the sea water temperature rises in surface waters of the tropical Pacific Ocean Every two to five years the Pacific Ocean has an event called El Nio Southern Oscillation This is a weak warm current that starts every year around Christmas time along the coast of Ecuador and Peru It lasts for only a few weeks to a month or more Every three to seven years an El Nio event may last for many months This can change the weather and have important effects on economies around the world Australia and Southeast Asia can have drought but the deserts of Peru have very heavy rainfall East Africa can have both In a La Nina event the weather patterns are reversed

The Southern Oscillation had been discovered by Sir Gilbert Walker in 1923 It is a seesaw of atmospheric pressure between the Pacific and Indian Oceans There is an inverse relationship between the air pressure measured at two sites Darwin Australia in the Indian Ocean and the island of Tahiti in the South Pacific The Southern Oscillation Index is the difference in sea level pressure measured at Darwin and Tahiti The Cold Tongue Index measures how much the average sea surface temperature in the central and eastern Pacific near the equator varies from the annual cycle The two measurements are anti correlated so that a negative SOI is usually together with an unsual warm ocean wind known as El Nino

By the early 1980s it was clear that El Nio and the Southern Oscillation were related and the acronym ENSO is used to describe this large scale event

The 2010 2011 Queensland floods were caused by a La Nina event which brought very heavy rain to the east coast of Australia Other big floods in Australia have also happened during a La Nina 1916 1917 1950 1954 1956 and 1973 1975 The cost of the 2010 2011 Queensland floods has been worked out to A30 billion

Not all El Nios happen in the Eastern Pacific During recent decades Central Pacific El Nios have been discovered When these happen the effects from CP El Nios are very different from traditional El Nios Central Pacific El Nios took place in 1986 1988 1991 1992 1994 1995 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 and 2009 2010

The Commonwealth is a name for some countries which were part of the British Empire before they became independent This group of states works together on many important matters like business health and the fight against poverty 

The Commonwealth of Nations is a group of countries Originally it was called the British Commonwealth of Nations which was founded in 1926 when the British Empire began to break up Now there are 53 member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations All except Mozambique were part of the British Empire There are some other associations having similar sounding names For example the Commonwealth of Australia or the Commonwealth of Independent states But the Commonwealth of Nations is different and a separate organization 

The term the Commonwealth of Nations originated in 1884 Lord Rosebery was on a visit to Australia in 1884 At Adelaide he told that over a period of time a number of colonies of the British Empire will become free and many may become more independent He further told that all of these countries would then become the Commonwealth of Nations The use of the term continued though in its present form and in a practical sense the Commonwealth of Nations originated decades later

The Commonwealth of Nations is not a political organization Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom is the official head of the Commonwealth She is also head of state of a lot of the countries of the Commonwealth these are called the Commonwealth realms A Secretary General takes care of the day to day matters of the Commonwealth of Nations But the United Kingdom or the Secretary General does not have any direct or indirect control over these countries In fact almost all the 53 members are independent countries with their own governments These countries have come together to form an association with some common aims Such common aims include

A nuclear meltdown describes a malfunction of a nuclear reactor A nuclear meltdown occurs when the middle portion of the nuclear reactor is not properly cooled  This can occur when the cooling system fails or is otherwise defective If this happens uranium or plutonium or similar materials inside the nuclear reactor become hot and may start melting or dissolving  It is this melting that is a nuclear meltdown 

Around the world some nuclear meltdowns have occurred Some of them were mild but few of them were very serious Nuclear meltdowns are able to kill people from radiation poisoning

The very last accident was the Fukushima nuclear disaster when four units of Fukushima I Nuclear Power Station experienced the cooling problems which happened as the back up diesel generators broke down

In 1986 a nuclear meltdown occurred in a place named Chernobyl In this case all the people living in the towns and the villages had to move to far away places 

Many Russian submarines get power from nuclear energy produced inside these submarines These are nuclear submarines Some such nuclear submarines have faced nuclear meltdown

Sometimes the nuclear meltdown may happen immediately For example the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl Sometimes the nuclear meltdown may take many hours to happen For example the nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island took many hours to happen

In 1914 the Russian Empire covered an area of about 21799825km In 1897 it had a population of 128200000 Its official language was the Russian language Its official church was the Russian Orthodox Church

Imperial Russian people were part of two different social groups the serfs and the nobility The serfs were around 80 of Russias population and lived mainly in counrtyside areas up until the late 19th century when the Emancipation of the Serfs freed them from the farmland they were tied to allowing them to marry whoever they wantedown property and vote The nobility were around 20 of the population and were educated and held higher broken wikt linkprestigeprestige in society These people generally went to university and towards the end of the 19th century wanted to remove the Tsar and give people more power

In 1917 the Russian people chose to get rid of the Tsar The bad conditions that people were forced to work under in in the factories and a food shortage which people blamed on the Tsar caused people to rebel and the cities such as St Petersburg and Moscow were faced with riots The Tsar was soon forced to broken wikt linkabdicateabdicate in late 1917 and soon after assasinated with his family In 1922 the Russian Empire became part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or USSR when a communist government took over

The cello is an instrument used to play music Its name comes from the Italian language so it is pronounced chello The full word is violoncello but when speaking people normally call it the cello A person who plays the cello is called a cellist The cello is a very popular instrument It belongs to the string family It has many uses as a solo instrument in chamber music and also in orchestras It is also occasionally used by pop musicians eg by the Beatles Bjork and Jamiroquai

The cello came into use in the 16th century At that time there was a family of instruments called the viols The instruments of the violin family were also developing and there were lots of experiments with instruments of different shapes and sizes The violone was popular as a bass instrument It was similar to a modern double bass The name violoncello means little violone The cello also has 4 strings The cello developed as the bass instrument in string groups It was used to accompany in basso continuo playing the same as the left hand of the harpsichord player When composers started to write concerti grossi they started to give the cello small solos In this way the cello started to be used as a solo instrument as well Johann Sebastian Bach wrote six very famous suites for solo cello They are among the most beautiful pieces written for the cello

Other composers started to write works for solo cello Joseph Haydn wrote two solo concertos for the instrument King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia loved the cello and he inspired Haydn Mozart and Beethoven to write music with interesting cello parts The cello was now an equal with the other string instruments no longer just playing a simple bass line

In the 19th century many famous composers wrote cello music A lot of them were cellists themselves eg Carl Davidov David Popper and Julius Klengel Some very famous composers who wrote important cello music were Mendelssohn Chopin Schumann Brahms Dvok Faur Saint Sans Elgar Sergei Rakhmaninov Two famous pieces written more recently for cello and orchestra are the Cello Symphony by Benjamin Britten and The Protecting Veil by John Tavener

The parts of the cello are similar to those of the violin The strings are tuned to C G D A exactly one octave lower than the viola The cello is played sitting down and holding the instrument between the knees There is an end pin which rests on the ground This is adjustable in height so that the player can put it in a position to make herself comfortable The cello is normally played with a bow

The cello has a deep rich sound It starts two octaves below middle C but can go very high For the highest notes the player can use thumb position This means that the left thumb is pressing down on one or two strings high up over the fingerboard Although cello music is most frequently written in the bass clef cello music often goes quite high so that the tenor clef or treble clef are used especially in the solo repertory

The most famous cellist of the early part of the 20th century was the Spanish cellist Pablo Casals He made the cello popular as a solo instrument today Some other famous cellists of the last century include Sebastian Bach Emanuel Feuermann Gregor Piatigorski Paul Tortelier Jacqueline du Pr and Mstislav Rostropovich Today Yo Yo Ma Julian Lloyd Webber Mischa Maisky Tim Hugh Robert Cohen and Truls Mrk are among the greatest players

European colonization of the Americas is a term which many historians use to describe colonization and settlement by Europeans in North America and South America It started with the discovery of America by Columbus in 1492 However about 500 years before Colombus the Norse had reached America and colonized Vinland But they did not continue Thus in a practical sense colonization of America began with the arrival of Columbus Columbas was the first to sail to America

The Spanish people were the first to win many parts of South America and Central America They also won many parts of North America Later on people from many countries of Europe reached the Americas There were two main countries that tried to take over the rest of the Americas These countries were France and England England took over the middle of North America and the French took what they could further up north in what is now called Canada Eventually the English colonists took over most of the French territory

The people in the Southern Colonies were there because they wanted money They had very good soil and because of this they could grow what people call Cash Crops tobacco The people in colonies further north could not grow these crops so easily so their reason for coming to America was different These people wanted to come to America because they wanted to be free of religious oppression These were people in the Middle and Northern Colonies In the Middle Colonies people grew food and this was how they lived making food for the whole of North America The people in the Northern Colonies made just enough to live every year so they were there just for religion not for money

The English settled on the East Coast of what is now the United States of America their economic activity consisted of tobacco farming and looking for gold and silver The Spanish settled down in Central America and South America mining for gold and silver and farming tobacco the Spanish had a surplus of labor because they used the Natives to do the work for them this was called Encomienda The French had to use what they could get which was what they wanted because they were the country settled the closest to the north pole They were looking for what we call the Northwest Passage finding a route to Asia because of this they had a low population forcing them to cooperate with the natives to survive There was one trade that the French had major profits in and that was in the trade of furs

Wall of Voodoo is a rock band from the United States The band was from Los Angeles California The bands music style was punk and new wave Their most famous song was Mexican Radio

The bands genesis was in a Hollywood company called Acme Soundtracks a commercially unsuccessful venture founded in 1977 in Hollywood by songwriter Stan Ridgway Ridgways intent for the company was to provide soundtrack music for independently produced low budget horror films unfortunately they found few takers for their services Instead Acme Soundtracks evolved into a band that played live shows as Ridgway enlisted Marc Moreland followed by Marcs brother Bruce Moreland Chas T Gray and Joe Nanini to the line up

The band was named Wall Of Voodoo by Ridgway before their first gig in reference to a comment made while recording and overdubbing a Kalamazoo Rhythm Ace drum machine a gift to Ridgway by writer and iconic voice over artist Daws Butler partner to Stan Freberg voice of Yogi Bear and many other Hanna Barbera characters When someone jokingly compared the multiple drum machine and farfisa organ laden recordings to Phil Spectors Wall Of Sound Ridgway commented it sounded more like a Wall Of Voodoo and the name stuck

Actually for new listeners the voodoo reference was a little misleading as it referred to the musics often spooky quality as opposed to any Haitian or Caribbean influences In fact WoVs music could fairly have been described as a cross between early synthesizer pop and Ennio Morricones spaghetti western soundtracks Adding to the musics distinctiveness was Ridgways unusual vocal style a half spoken western drawl and Naninis percussive experimentation mixing drum machines with found instruments such as pots pans and various kitchen utensils as well as Marc Morelands distinctive guitar

In 1980 Wall Of Voodoo released their self titled debut EP which included a cover version of Johnny Cashs Ring of Fire as well as three original songs and a few snippets of atmospheric Acme Soundtracks work In 1981 the band released Dark Continent an album concerned largely with workplace issues

After that album bassist Bruce Moreland exited the band and Gray doubled up on both bass and keyboards Now a quartet in 1982 WoV recorded their best known album with producer Richard Mazda Call of the West which included Mexican Radio Though Mexican Radio did not make the top 40 in either the US or the UK it was a sizeable underground hit and the songs video received heavy airplay on MTV in the US and MuchMusic in Canada

Wall Of Voodoo added Bill Noland from LAs quirky outfit Human Hands as a keyboardist in 1982 but increasing tensions within the band eventually led to a breakup of the band after the Us Festival in 1983 Ridgway would there after embark on a solo career which netted him much critical acclaim and a top 5 hit in the UK with the 1986 single Camouflage in addition to songs such as The Big Heat Drive She Said and Salesman Numerous solo recordings have followed

Noland and Nanini also left the band in 1983 WoV regrouped in 1984 with a new lead singer as well as a new drummer and returning bassist Bruce Moreland

A homemaker is a person whose main job is to take care of his or her own family home and children Traditionally the job of homemaker is done by women and the job of provider is done by men but both men and women can be providers and homemakers

Because it has been the traditional job of a woman to be a homemaker a woman who spends most of her time caring for the family home has been called a housewife This word is not used on government forms any more because it is gender specific language From the 1970s onward gender specific words are regarded as discrimination The word housewife is still used in ordinary speech If a man is the main homemaker then the word househusband is used for a joke The word started being used in the 1970s to show that gender specific language could sound silly Other terms that started being used in the late 1900s are housegoddess homeprofessional and home and family facilitator

For many thousands of years men have been thought of by society as the main breadwinners in families This means that it has been the job of men to do work that either hunted food grew food or earned money to pay for food while the women have cared for children prepared food for eating cleaned the house and made and cared for clothes

In societies where people are hunters and gathers for example the traditional society of the Australian aboriginal people it is the men who do the hunting of animals for meat and the women who do the gathering of other types of food such as grain fruit and vegetables One of the reasons is that a married woman usually had children and babies It is much easier to gather fruit with a baby on your hip than to hunt a fast moving animal Even in a society where homes were very simple and people did not own very many things men and women did different jobs

In rural societies where the main work is farming women have also taken care of gardens and animals around the house and helped men with heavy work whenever a job needed doing in a hurry usually because of the season

Examples of the heavy work that a traditional housewife in a rural society would do are

An urban societies is when most people live in towns and cities In urban societies since ancient times most men did work that earned money They worked in factories shops banks and other businesses as well as churches schools and the town council It was seen as the job of a woman to be a housewife

But often what really happened was something different Often if a family had a business then not just the husband but also the wife would work to make money in the business This has been happening since ancient times

Every society always has some women who never marry They might stay at home and do housework for other family members or they might work outside the house like a man In many urban societies there has not been many jobs that a woman was allowed to do In modern society there are still strong traditions about the jobs that women do

In the 19th century more and more women began to stop being homemakers and began to do jobs that men usually did At this time many big factories were set first in England then in other countries as well Thousands of young women went to work in factories

Other women like Florence Nightingale stopped being housewives and did dirty dangerous jobs even though they were rich and did not need to work A famous surgeon called James Barry is believed to have been a woman in disguise Even though things like this happened in most families where there was a husband and wife People thought it was the job of the husband to earn money and the job of the woman to be a housewife Women were often very proud to be a good homemaker and have their house and children spotlessly clean their husbands shirts neatly pressed and tasty meals to eat every night

In the first half of the 20th century there were two big wars that were fought by men from many countries While the men were at war their wives went to work to keep the countries running Women who were also homemakers worked in factories businesses and farms At the end of both wars many men had died and women kept doing many of these jobs

By the 1960s there was still an idea that it was alright for a woman to work and be a career girl until the woman got married when she should stop work and be a housewife Many women in the 1970s believed that this was not treating men and women equally and that women should do whatever job they were able to do whether they were married or not

At this time when more and more women had good educations and were able to earn a lot of money in some families the husband would be the person that was the homemaker

In the late 20th century it became harder and harder for a family to live on the wage of a man who has just an ordinary job Many women who are mothers cannot stay at home and make homemaking their first job Nowadays in many families where both the husband and wife do paid work both partners share in the housework and caring for the children In other families there is still a traditional idea that housework is only a womans job so that when a couple get home from work it is only the wife who works in the house while the man takes a rest after his days work This usually leads to resentment towards the husband

The job of a homemaker is to take care of a family and the place where the family lives The usual things that a homemaker does are

Odessa is a city in southwestern Ukraine It is the administrative center of the Odessa Oblast and is its own separate district within the oblast Odessa is a major port on the Black Sea

In 2004 about 1012500 people lived in Odessa

A very old Greek colony named Olbia probably was where the city is now Many monuments from old times link this place to the Eastern Mediterranean In the Middle Ages these lands were a part of the Kievan Rus Galich and Volyn Principality the Golden Horde the Great Lithuanian Principality the Crimean Khanate and the Ottoman Empire Crimean Tatars traded there in the 14th century At the time of the RussianTurkish wars these lands were captured by Russia That was at the end of the 18th century

From 18191858 Odessa was a free port During the Soviet time it was the most important port of trade in the USSR and a Soviet naval base On January 1 2000 the Quarantine Pier of Odessa trade sea port was made a free port and free economic zone for 25 years

Odessa is a warm water port but of small military value Because Turkey controls the Dardanelles and Bosphorus NATO can control ships moving between Odessa and the Mediterranean Sea The city of Odessa has two important ports Odessa itself and Yuzhny Yuzhny is an oil terminal that is important to the world It is in Odessas suburbs Another important port Illichivsk is in the same oblast to the south west of Odessa Important transportation comes together at these ports Railways and pipelines come to these ports Pipelines connect Odessas oil and chemical factories to Russias and the EUs 

Odessa is the fifth largest city in Ukraine and its most important trading city In the 19th century it was the fourth city of Imperial Russia after Moscow and St Petersburg and Warsaw Its old buildings seem more Mediterranean than Russian They were made like French and Italian buildings People in Odessa could always laugh and had a spirit of freedom The reason is probably because Odessa is a nice place and because the people accept others They let others be the kind of people that they are

In the AD 15th century nomadic tribes of the Nogays under the government of the Khanate of Crimea lived in the place that is now Odessa During the reign of Khan Haci I Giray the Khanate was in danger because the Golden Horde and the Ottoman Turks were not friends of the Khanate To get help the khan gave Odessa to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania  The place now named Odessa was then named Khadjibey It was part of the Dykra region Few people lived in that region They were part of the Turkic tribes The land was mostly empty steppes 

The Ottoman Empire controlled Khadjibey after 1529 The region surrounding Khadjibey was named Yedisan The Ottoman Empire controlled that region as part of Silistra Province In the middle of the 18th century the Ottomans rebuilt a fortress at Khadjibey It was named Eni Dunia

At the time of the war between Russia and Turkey on 25 September 1789 Ivan Gudovich led a group of Russian soldiers to Khadjibey They took Khadjibey and Yeni Dnya for the Russian Empire A Spaniard in the Russian army named Major General Jos de Ribas led one part of the group of soldiers Russians named him Osip Mikhailovich Deribas The main street in Odessa today is named Deribasovskaya street after him Turkey let Russia keep the place in the Treaty of Jassy in 1792 Russians made it a part of a place they named Novorossiya 

The Russian government decided to build a naval fortress on the ruins of Khadjibey city in 1794 This became the city named Odessa by January 1795 In that year its new name was first written in government letters The reasons for the new name are lost but people guess why Odessa got a new name According to one of the stories when someone said Odessos should be the name for the new Russian port Catherine II said that all names in the South of the Empire were already masculine and she did not want another one so she decided to change it to more feminine Odessa This story may be false There were at least two cities with names that sound feminine for a Russian also Catherine II did not speak Russian when she was a child and lastly all cities are feminine in Greek Another story is that the name Odessa is from word play in French French was then the language spoken at the Russian court Plenty of water is assez deau in French If one says this backwards it sounds like the Greek colonys name Word play about water makes sense Odessa is next to a very big body of water but has a little fresh water Anyhow there is still a link with the name of the old Greek colony So there may be some truth in the things people said long ago 

The new city quickly became a major success Its early growth owed much to the work of the Duc de Richelieu who served as the citys governor between 18031814 Having fled the French Revolution he had served in Catherines army against the Turks He is credited with designing the city and organising its amenities and infrastructure and is considered one of the founding fathers of Odessa together with another Frenchman Count Alexandre Langeron who succeeded him in office Richelieu is commemorated by a bronze statue unveiled in 1828 to a design by Ivan Martos

In 1819 the city was made a free port a status it retained until 1859 It became home to an extremely diverse population of Russians Ukrainians Jews Greeks Bulgarians Albanians Armenians Italians Frenchmen Germans and traders representing many other European nationalities Its cosmopolitan nature was documented by the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin who lived in internal exile in Odessa between 18231824 In his letters he wrote that Odessa was a city where you can smell Europe French is spoken and there are European papers and magazines to read 

Odessas growth was interrupted by the Crimean War of 18531856 during which it was bombarded by British and French naval forces It soon recovered and the growth in trade made Odessa Russias largest grain exporting port In 1866 the city was linked by rail with Kiev and Kharkov as well as Iai Romania 

The city became the home of a large Jewish community during the 19th century and by 1897 Jews were estimated to comprise some 37 of the population They were however repeatedly subjected to severe persecution Pogroms were carried out in 1821 1859 1871 1881 and 1905 Many Odessan Jews fled abroad particularly to Palestine after 1882 and the city became an important base of support for Zionism

In 1905 Odessa was the place of a workers uprising supported by the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin and Lenins Iskra Sergei Eisensteins famous motion picture The Battleship Potemkin commemorated the uprising and included a scene where hundreds of Odessan citizens were killed on the great stone staircase in one of the most famous scenes in motion picture history At the top of the steps which lead down to the port stands a statue of Richelieu The actual massacre took place in streets nearby not on the steps themselves but the movie caused many to visit Odessa to see the site of the slaughter The Odessa Steps continue to be a tourist attraction in Odessa The film was made at Odessas Cinema Factory one of the oldest cinema studios in the former Soviet Union

Following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 during World War I Odessa was occupied by several groups including the Ukrainian Tsentralna Rada the French Army the Red Army and the White Army Finally in 1920 the Red Army took control of Odessa and united it with the Ukrainian SSR which later became part of the USSR 

The people of Odessa suffered from a great famine that occurred in 19211922 as a result of the war During World War II Odessa was occupied by Romanian and German forces from 19411944 The city suffered severe damage and many casualties

Atmospheric pressure is a force in an area pushed against a surface by the weight of air in Earths atmosphere The earth is covered in a layer of air However this layer is not distributed evenly around the globe At different times the layer of air is thicker in some places than in others Where the layer of air is thicker there is more air Since there is more air there is a higher pressure in that spot Where the layer of air is thinner there is a lower atmospheric pressure The higher the elevation the thinner the air is Mercury barometers can be used to measure atmospheric pressure There is the same atmospheric pressure from all directions

Atmospheric pressure is measured in hPa The higher the place is the lower the atmospheric pressure is there This is because high places do not have as much air as low places because gravity does not hold it down as strongly so the atmospheric pressure is less

To destroy Hezbollah bases Israel has responded in different ways These have included air strikes on sites in Lebanon and sending ground troops into Southern Lebanon In 2000 Israel withdrew its troops from the security zone in Southern Lebanonbut not from a sliver of land called Shebba FarmsThis fertile area was kept under Israeli occupation The border was relatively quietnot taking into account Israeli targeted assassinations and kidnappings until July 2006 when Hezbollah captured two IDF soldiers This led to the 2006 Lebanon War in which Hezbollah rockets reached deep into Israel

Few countries see Hezbollah as a terrorist organization the majority do not Among those who consider it to be terrorist are the United States the United Kingdom and Israel among those who do not are the European Union and Russia Lebanon sees Hezbollah as a legitimate resistance movement This view is shared by Syria Iran and all other countries in the Arab World

The International Criminal Court was created on 1 July 2002 It investigates and punishes people for genocide crimes against humanity and war crimes It is sometimes called the ICC or the ICCt

The ICCs main office is in The Hague in The Netherlands It has smaller offices in New York City Kampala Kinshasa Bunia Abch and Bangui

The ICC is different from the International Court of Justice The main difference is that ICJ settles arguments between countries but the ICC punishes people

On 1 January 2008 105 countries were members of the ICC These countries have a duty to help the ICC

Nearly all the countries in Europe and South America are members and about half the countries in Africa are members Only a few countries in Asia have joined

The ICC can normally only investigate three kinds of crime

The ICC can only investigate crimes that happened after 1 July 2002 It can only open a case when national courts are not able to or do not want to If a national court is investigating or prosecuting a case the ICC is not allowed to

There are 18 judges in the ICC They all come from member countries of the ICC No two judges can come from the same country

The prosecutors job is to investigate crimes If he finds evidence that a person did something wrong he asks the judges to start a trial

The ICC is managed by an Assembly of States Parties The Assembly elects the judges and the prosecutor Each ICC member country has one vote in the Assembly

The ICC has opened investigations in four places Northern Uganda the Democratic Republic of the Congo the Central African Republic and Darfur 

The ICC has arrested three people They are all from the Democratic Republic of the Congo Thomas Lubanga is accused of using children to make war Germain Katanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui are both accused of murder sexual slavery using children to make war and other crimes

According to Hinduism and Hindu mythology Brahma is one of the three major gods of Hindus Brahma is said to be the creator of the whole universe The other two gods are Vishnu the preserver and Shiva the destroyer all three of which make up the Trimurti Brahma represents Brahman a term and concept of Hinduism 

The Hindu tradition states that Brahma had five heads However the mythological story tells that Shiva cut one of the heads of Brahma The tradition also states that the four heads of Brahma represent many aspects of Hinduism The four heads represent four Vedas which are very important Hindu scriptures These four heads also represent four division of time of Hinduism the Yugas They also represent four divisions of the Hindu society the four Varnas 

Brahma does not have many followers as he is said to have sought out his daughter using his four heads after falling in love 

Asexual reproduction is reproduction without sex 

In this form of reproduction a single organism or cell makes a copy of itself The genes of the original and its copy will be the same except for rare mutations They are clones

The main process of asexual reproduction is mitosis This type of reproduction is common among some single cell organisms for example amoeba Many plants also reproduce asexually

Some organisms like bacteria reproduce using binary fission They split in two so one bacterium becomes two bacteria This always leads to daughter cells and the offspring will be identical to the parent

Budding is similar to binary fission but it is used by plants and some animals which cannot simply split in half as bacteria can It is when a small part of a plant or animal breaks off and then while they are separated from their mother they start to grow until both the parent and the offspring are the same size and both are capable of budding again This may happen many more times

Fungi produce spores which may be asexual or sexual The asexual spores have the genetic material inside which allows them to make a whole new organism identical to its parent 

Conidia are asexual non motile spores of a fungus they are also called mitospores due to the way they are generated through the cellular process of mitosis They are haploid cells genetically identical to the haploid parent can develop into a new organism if conditions are favorable and serve in dispersal

Asexual reproduction in Ascomycetes is by the formation of conidia which are bourne on specialized stalks called conidiophores The morphology of these specialized conidiophores is often distinctive of a specific species and can therefore be used in identification of the species

Brahman is the concept of God in Hinduism It is a word of the Sanskrit language Brahman is said to be infinite with no beginning or end Brahman is changeless and is the source of the universe in Hindu beliefs

The International Monetary Fund is an international organization 187 countries are members of the International Monetary Fund It has its headquarters in Washington DC USA 

In the 1930s many countries faced economic problems Some of such problems were falling standard of living and unemployment by large number of people Trading between different countries also came down Some countries reduced the value of their currencies All such factors combined and an economic depression resulted By late 1939 the Second World War had started 

After the Second World War was over most countries found that the international value were not smooth and facing many restrictions Leaders of many countries thought over these matters and discussed them in meetings Thus after the Second World War many countries felt the need to have an organization to get help in monetary matters between countries To begin with 29 countries discussed the matter and signed an agreement The agreement was the Articles of Association of the International Monetary Fund The International Monetary Fund came into being in December 1945

Any country may apply to become a member of the IMF When a country applies for membership the IMFs Executive Board examines the application If found suitable the Executive Board gives its report to IMFs Board of Governors After the Board of Governor clears the application the country may join the IMF However before joining the country should fulfill legal requirements if any of its own country Every member has a different voting right Likewise every country has a different right to draw funds This depends on many factors including the member countrys first subscription to the IMF

The IMF does a number of supervisory works relating to financial dealings between different countries Some of the works done by IMF are

A Board of Directors manages the IMF One tradition has governed the selection of two most senior posts of IMF Firstly IMFs managing director is always European IMFs president is always from the United States of America 

The major countries of Europe and America control the IMF This is because they have given more money to IMF by way of first subscriptions and so have larger share of voting rights

Many people and countries have commented about IMF Some are good and some are bad comments about the work of IMF Despite many bad comments about IMF a research shows that more than 60 percent of Asians and 70 percent of Africans feel that IMF have had a positive effect on their country

The World Bank Group is a group of five international organizations The World Bank Group gives advice and finance to member countries for economic development and reducing poverty It is a non profit making international organization owned by member governments The Group has its headquarters in Washington DC It also has offices in 124 other member countries 

The World Bank Group is made of the following five organizations

The World Bank Group originated at Bretton Woods New Hampshire There many countries decided to establish an international organization to provide finance to member countries The Bank came into existence on 27th December 1945 Its name was the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development The Banks first loan was to France The loan was of 250 million US Dollar The purpose was to help France to again build industry and other important things like roads destroyed during the Second World War 

The activities of the World Bank Group cover many activities Some of these activities are as follows

The World Bank Group gives loans at low rate of interest to member countries The member countries use the money received for any one of above or some other similar activity 

In short the World Bank Groups main mission is 1 to fight poverty and 2 to improve the living standards of people in the developing world Beside giving direct money and finance the World Bank Group provides advice and assistance to developing countries on almost every aspect of economic development

In general the World Bank Group is part of the United Nations system But member countries govern it through a board The IBRD has 184 countries as its members Other four organizations of the Group have between 140 to 176 member countries A Board of 24 Executive Directors controls the activities of the World Bank Group A President heads the Board 

Many economists and people have criticized the World Bank Group for its style of functioning Before giving loans the Bank sometimes requires many changes in the policies of a country This has attracted criticism as it reduces the countrys independence to run its economy in its own way The criticism is also on account of other factors One of them is that two or three countries have more power to decide matters As of November 1 2004 the United States held 164 of total votes Japan 79 Germany 45 and the United Kingdom and France each held 43 As major decisions require an 85 super majority the US can block any change

In spite of several criticisms the World Bank Groups role in economic development and reduction of poverty has continued in many countries 

The International Court of Justice is an international organization It is the main judicial organ or branch of the United Nations In short International Court of Justice is ICJ sometimes people call it the World Court In French language it is Cour internationale de justice Established ICJ in 1945 ICJ has its headquarters at The Hague Netherlands The ICJ began its working from 1946 It replaced an earlier similar court named Permanent Court of International Justice The International Court of Justice is different from the International Criminal Court The ICJ uses two languages the English language and the French language 

The Internal Court of Justice has two major functions Firstly it settles disputes which the member countries may bring before it Secondly it may give its opinions on legal matters Since 1980s may developing countries have been using the services of the ICJ But in 1986 the United States of America does not accepts courts views on all matters but selectively only that is on case to case basis Since the year 2000 the docket went down from 23 to 12 cases In the meantime the staff tripled

The ICJ has fifteen permanent judges The UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council elects the judges A judge serves a for nine year period and may be re elected if necessary If a serving judge dies another judge from the same country he or she belonged too is generally elected to fill the vacant position Elections are staggered thus five judges come up for election every three years 

The fifteen permanent judges are elected from a list of persons nominated by the national groups in the Permanent Court of Arbitration The election process is set out in Articles 4 12 of the ICJ statute Generally five members of the Security Council of the United Nations always have a judge from their country These countries are China France Russia United Kingdom and the United States of America 

In some case the ICJ allows Ad hoc judges Thus the countries in dispute have a right to nominate one judge each for that particular case if desired This right is not available if that country already has a judge of its nationality in the ICJ Thus sometimes instead of fifteen seventeen judges may be deciding a case 

There are many rules which lay down the qualifications and conduct of the judges of the ICJ

Generally all the judges of the ICJ sit together to hear and decide any matter But sometimes smaller chambers of three to five judges hear and decide a case Such chambers may be for special types of cases Sometimes the ICJ sets up ad hoc chambers to hear and decide particular disputes 

While deciding the case the ICJ applies the principles of international law It also uses the laws of the civilized world This may be the civil and criminal law of major countries It may also refer to legal writings law books and earlier decisions while deciding any matter 

The Indian independence movement was a movement from 1857 until August 15 1947 when India got independence from the British Raj The movement involved many political and social organizations and armed and unarmed struggle Many political ideas also added to the movement Perhaps the most famous person in it was Mohandas Gandhi

Vasco da Gama of Portugal had discovered a sea route to India He had reached Kozhikode in 1498 After this many Europeans started coming to India for trading They made their offices and forts in many parts of India Out of many European countries the British East India Company of the United Kingdom became the major force in India The Companys troops led by Robert Clive defeated rulers of Bengal province in 1757 This battle became famous as the Battle of Plassey This was the beginning of British rule that is the British Raj in India In 1765 the Battle of Buxar happened The English forces won this battle After this the British got control over Bengal Bihar and Orissa 

The Parliament of the United Kingdom passed many laws to help the British East India Company like the Regulating Act of 1773 the India Act of 1784 and the Charter Act of 1813 to promote the British in looting and stripping India of its wealth

Although the educated Indians were trying to reform the social system they and the general public started to hate the British rule The rulers of the British Raj and their officers treated the Indians in a bad and cruel way They tortured and hanged Indians for even disobedience Some of them employed Indian servants simply to scold and beat them to death The British used inhuman torture techniques to extract confessions and used farce trials to quickly execute those opposing their rule They did not even spare the Indian troops employed by them They also did many barbaric things against local customs like playing music in Taj Mahal which is a tomb or organizing parties in mosques All these resulted into ill feelings among the Indians

Before the First War of Independence Indians in different parts of India had revolted against the British Many such revolts and armed struggles had taken place Some examples include

Indias First War of Independence was a revolt of Indian soldiers and people against the British rule Historians have used the terms like the Indian Mutiny or the Sepoy Mutiny to describe this event The rebellion by Indian troops of the British Raj started in March 1857 and continued for months Many reasons had combined to result in this rebellion

The British officers had been treating their Indian soldiers very poorly The British rulers continued to forcibly take regions ruled by Indians and made these regions part of the British Raj They did not give any respect to old royal houses of India like the Mughals and the Peshwas They made the Indian soldiers of their army use a special type of cartridge The soldiers had to open the cartridges with their teeth before loading them into their guns The cartridges supposedly used cow and pig fat For Hindus the cow is a sacred animal and they do not eat beef The Muslims consider pig a dirty animal Thus the use of these cartridges made soldiers of both the religions turn against the British Although the British tried to replace the cartridges the feelings against them stayed 

Rebellion broke out when Mangal Pandey a soldier attacked a British sergeant and wounded an adjutant One General named Hearsay ordered another Indian soldier to arrest Mangal Pandey The other soldier refused Ultimately the British arrested Mangal Pandey and the other Indian soldier The British killed both by hanging them All other soldiers of that regiment lost their jobs On May 10th 1857 cavalry troops while doing parade broke ranks They freed the soldiers of the 3rd regiment and they moved towards Delhi Soon many Indians of north India joined these soldiers They entered the Delhi Fort They asked Bahadur Shah II the Mughal Emperor to become leader of the rebellion He agreed unwillingly Very soon the revolt spread throughout north India Important Indian leaders of royal families joined the rebellion and started fighting the British at several places They included Ahmed Ullah an advisor of the ex King of Oudh Nana Saheb his nephew Rao Saheb and his retainers Tantia Topi and Azimullah Khan hero the Rani of Jhansi Kunwar Singh the Rajput chief of Jagadishpur in Bihar and Firuz Saha a relative of the Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah

At the beginning the British were slow to respond Then they took very quick action with heavy forces They brought their regiments from the Crimean War to India They also redirected many regiments that were going to China to India The British forces reached Delhi and they surrounded the city from 1st July 1857 until 31st August 1857 Street to street fights broke out between the British troops and the Indians Ultimately they took control of Delhi The last important battle was at Gwalior in which they killed Rani Lakshmi Bai With this the British had practically suppressed the rebellion However some fights in many places continued until 1859 

Indias First War of Independence was a major event in the history of modern India The Parliament of the United Kingdom closed down the British East India Company The United Kingdom started ruling India directly through its representative called the Viceroy of India It made India a part of the British Empire They promised the the Princes Chiefs and Peoples of India equal treatment under the British law In 1877 Queen Victoria took the title of Empress of India

The British sent Bahadur Shah II the last Mughal Emperor out of India and kept him in Yangon Burma where he died in 1862 The Mughal dynasty which had ruled India for about four hundred years ended with his death

The British also took many steps to employ Indian higher castes and rulers into the government They stopped taking the lands of the remaining princes and rulers of India They stopped interference in religious matters They started employing Indians in the civil services but at lower levels They increased the number of British soldiers and allowed only British soldiers to handle artillery

The period following Indias First War of Independence was an important period in the Indian independence movement Many leaders emerged at the national and provincial levels and the Indians became more aware of their rights Social movements also helped in shaping peoples outlook tried for social changes and tried to remove bad social practices and evils like illiteracy and caste system During this period many social and religious leaders worked to inspire the Indian society They included men like Swami Vivekananda Ramakrishna Paramhansa Sri Aurobindo Subramanya Bharathy Bankim Chandra Chatterjee Sir Syed Ahmed Khan Rabindranath Tagore and Dadabhai Naoroji They spread the message of self confidence removing of social evils and making India free from domination of foreign power Lokmanya Tilak was one such leader who was not very modest in his views The British arrested him In the court he declared Swaraj is my birthright This concept of Swaraj later became a main policy and philosophy of Indias independence movement in the following decades until India became independent 

In 1885 at the suggestion of Allan Octavian Hume a retired British civil servant seventy three Indian delegates met in Bombay They founded the Indian National Congress The delegates represented educated Indians in professions such as law teaching and journalism A few years before Dadabhai Naoroji had already formed the Indian National Association It merged with the Indian National Congress to make form a bigger party 

To begin with the Indian National Congress was not a very active political party It met annually and gave some suggestions to the rulers of the British Raj The suggestions generally related to civil rights and opportunities for Indians in the government jobs Despite its claim to represent all Indians it represented only the educated and higher class of the society But it failed to attract all Muslims Many Muslims had become distrustful of Hindu reformers who raised their voice against matters like religious conversion and killing of cows for their meat For Hindus the cow is a sacred animal not to be killed Sir Syed Ahmed Khan launched a separate movement for Muslims and founded in 1875 a college in Aligarh Uttar Pradesh state India Later this college became Aligarh University in 1921 The objective of the college was to give modern education to Indias Muslims By 1900 the Indian National Congress had become a national party but did not represent all groups of Indian society particularly the Muslims 

Partition of Bengal 

In 1905 Lord Curzon the Viceroy and Governor General of India divided Bengal province into two provinces Eastern Bengal Assam with its capital at Dhaka and West Bengal with its capital at Calcutta At that time Calcutta was the capital city of the British Raj The people became very angry at that partition and created the phrase divide and rule for the policy followed by the British Empire The leading intellectual figures of India at that time expressed their unhappiness at this partition For example Rabindra Nath Tagore the most famous Indian poet composed a poem against this partition

During the First World War Indians gave support to the United Kingdom About 13 million Indian soldiers went to many parts of Europe Africa and the Middle East to fight Many Indians including the princes and rich people of India contributed money and materials to the war funds of the United Kingdom However many Indian soldiers died in foreign lands In India flu spread like an epidemic killing many persons The tax rates increased in India and prices also increased The Indians became restless The Muslim Indians also demanded a separate country for themselves 

In August 1917 Edwin Samuel Montagu the Secretary of State for India announced in the British Parliament about many steps to give more rights to Indians A new law named the Government of India Act of 1919 gave many rights to the Indians in the provincial government These rights related to farming local government health education and public works The British administrators kept matters like taxation finance and law and order under their control

In 1919 the British made a new law named the Rowlatt Act Under this law the government got many powers to arrest people and keep them in prisons without any trial They also got the power to stop newspapers to report and print news The people called this act the Black Act Indians protested against this law in many places

The positive impact of reform was seriously undermined in 1919 by the Rowlatt Act named after the recommendations made the previous year to the Imperial Legislative Council by the Rowlatt Commission which had been appointed to investigate seditious conspiracy The Rowlatt Act also known as the Black Act vested the Viceroys government with extraordinary powers to quell sedition by silencing the press detaining political activists without trial and arresting any individuals suspected of sedition or treason without a warrant In protest a nationwide cessation of work was called marking the beginning of widespread although not nationwide popular discontent 

The agitation reached a peak in Amritsar In Amritsar on 13th April 1919 about 10000 Indians had assembled to protest against the Rowlatt Act The British military commander Brigadier General Reginald Dyer ordered his troops to fire at the civilians without any warning The troops fired 1650 times Some historians estimate that the troops killed 379 persons and injured about 1137 persons This incident became famous as Jallianwala Bagh massacre With this killing of innocent people the British lost the trust of the Indian people

Mohandas Gandhi also known as Mahathma Gandhi had received his education at London He was a barrister In 1893 he went to South Africa He protested against inequalityetc He became successful and the government of South Africa removed most of such rules and restrictions 

Gandhi returned to India in 1915 Few people knew him However over a period of the next few years under the leadership of Gandhi Indians began to follow a different way to get freedom

The Jallianwala Bagh was also a response of Brittans tyrannical rule over India

In December 1929 the Indian National Congress Party agreed to start a movement for complete independence from British rule The Party decided to start a movement named to disobey the British rule It became the civil disobedience movement They decided to observe 26th January 1930 as the complete Independence Day Many other political parties and revolutionaries came together to support this movement 

Gandhi started this movement He led a number of persons on a 400 kilometres route from Ahmedabad to Dandi on the coast of the Arabian Sea There they made salt from the seawater and broke a law of British India to make salt without paying taxes Thus the civil disobedience movement began and spread through out India Indians started to break unfair laws in a peaceful manner Thus they showed their anger and protested against the British rule

Many Indians did not believe in such peaceful protests They thought that the British would not give independence to Indians so easily They believed in armed struggle to oust the British from India In some way this had continued for years after the partition of Bengal in 1905 Many revolutionaries and leaders emerged from time to time

The rulers of the British Raj made a new law to govern India named the Government of India Act 1935 This law aimed at constitutional process to govern India It had three major aims to establish a federal system with many provinces to give self ruling position to the provinces and to give the Muslim minority protection through giving them some separate electorates In such separate electorates only Muslims could stand for elections In February 1937 elections took place for the provincial assemblies The members of the Indian National Congress won in five provinces and held upper position in two more provinces The Muslim Leagues performance in the election was not good 

During the Second World War the rulers of the British Raj declared India to be a party to the war They did not discuss the matter with Indians and their leaders The Indians and their leaders became divided over this matter Some supported the British while many did not British rulers of India wanted the Indians to fight and die in the name of freedom yet they had denied this freedom to India and the Indians for more than a hundred years This created a lot of dissatisfaction among Indians and two big movements for Indias independence took shape The first was the Indian National Army of Subhash Chandra Bose The second was Quit India Movement of Mohandas Gandhi

Subhash Chandra Bose and many leaders did not like the British decision to drag India into the Second World War He had twice become president of the Indian National Congress Party the leading Indian political party of that time However he and many other leaders of the Indian National Congress Party differed on many matters He resigned and formed a new party named All India Forward Bloc The British government of India put him under house arrest However he escaped in 1941 He reached Germany and secured the support of Germany and Japan to fight the British in India In 1943 he traveled in submarines of Germany and Japan and reached Japan He organized the Indian National Army The INA fought the troops of the British Raj in northeastern India Despite many difficulties INA recorded many victories However with the surrender of Japan in 1945 INAs operations stopped Bose died in a plane crash but circumstances of his death are not clear 

The British government of India put on trial three Indian National Army officers at the Red Fort in Delhi The British had chosen for this trail one Hindu one Sikh and one Muslim of the INA This made many Indians of all religions very angry A naval mutiny also broke out in Bombay Ultimately the British ruled that these officers were guilty but they set them free seeing the public anger When India became independent the government of India did not allow the former officers and soldiers of the INA to join the armed forces of the independent India However the government granted them very good pensions and other facilities The Indian public also gave them much respect 

Many consider Nethaji Subhas Chandra Bose a controversial figure due to his association with the Axis Powers But in India people consider him a patriotic hero of the Indian independence movement

On 8th August 1942 the leaders of the Indian National Congress Party met in Bombay The leaders adopted a policy to force the British out of India Gandhis slogan Do or Die became a national slogan and the movement became the Quit India Movement At the beginning of the Second World War the Indian National Congress Party had supported the British but they had demanded freedom of India after the war The British did not agree to this proposal On 14th July 1942 the Indian National Congress Party passed a resolution demanding complete independence from the British rule However this did not have support of some other political parties 

Gandhi had asked the people to keep the Quit India Movement as a peaceful movement Many people started the movement in many places of India But at some places the movements turned violent Gandhi refused to eat until the violence stopped He was successful in ending the violence

The British action was very quick They arrested over 100000 people They levied fines on many people They dropped bombs on the people who demonstrated against the British Raj The troops of the British Raj even beat people with sticks and caned them The British arrested all the leaders of the Congress Party Gandhis wife Kasturba Gandhi died during detention His secretary Mahadev Desai also died Gandhis health had also become very bad In 1944 the British set him free fearing that Gandhis death might result in a very large protest by Indians Gandhi continued to oppose the British and demanded that all other leaders be set free 

The Second World War had reduced the economic political and military strength of the British Empire They were also aware that after the war Indians would begin a larger movement for independence The mood of the British people and the British Army had also changed After the Second World War most of them were in no mood come to India to become part of the British ruling class in India The position was now clear to the leaders of the United Kingdom By early 1946 they set free all the political prisoners held in India They started discussion the leaders of the Indian National Congress Party Finally India won its freedom on 15th August 1947

On 3rd June 1947 Lord Louis Mounbatten announced partition of India into two countries union of India and an Islamic Pakistan In this partition many people died and got separated from their families On midnight of 14th August 1947 India became an independent country and still is today On 26th January 1950 India adopted a constitution

The Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel is a document of world history The declaration announced the establishment of an independent and sovereign state named Israel 

This term describes the announcement of establishment of a Jewish state named State of Israel This State of Israel was established on 14th May 1948 In Hebrew language Medinat Yisrael means the State of Israel The British Mandate of Palestine was a part of the British Empire This was the land where the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah had once been The State of Israel covered more or less the same land 

Some persons call this as the beginning of Third Jewish Commonwealth The First Jewish Commonwealth ended with the destruction of Solomons Temple and the second with the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem two thousand years ago

On November 29th 1947 the United Nations had passed a resolution The resolution allowed the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine The resolution asked for taking steps to establish such a state 

On May 12th 1948 the Jewish national administration met at Tel Aviv Museum of Art They had gathered to decide acceptance of an American proposal for a truce or to declare a new state of Israel Six of the ten voting members supported declaration of a state of Israel Two days later on May 14th 1948 the Jewish National Council met at Tel Aviv At mid night of May 14th 1948 a member of the Council read the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel

The declaration followed a style generally seen in the United Nations documents First few sentences stated the reasons for the declaration and the right of the Jews for an independent country Then the sentences gave the features and characteristics of the new Jewish state

Nguyn studied in Paris from 1919 23 In those four years he started following communism and began to believe that Vietnam then a French colony should be independent During this time he wrote a letter which was ignored to United States President Woodrow Wilson asking for US military aid to help overthrow the French colonial rulers He joined the French Communist Party and started visiting Moscow regularly as a member of the Asian branch of the Comintern

H led a revolution against the French rulers of Vietnam from 1945 1954 After overthrowing the French a Communist regime supported by the Soviet Union and China was set up in the northern half of the country with himself leading the country as both President and Prime Minister A non Communist government supported by the United States was set up in the southern half of the country because the United States did not want all Vietnam to be Communist This was because the United States was then fighting the Cold War

When South Vietnam and America did not keep their promise to hold an election and unite the two halves into one country H led Vietnam into into a military and political struggle to bring the rice fields of the South under his Communist rule Two decades of war followed killing millions of Vietnamese The United States supported South Vietnam with military aid while the Soviet Union and Peoples Republic of China continued to support North Vietnams war effort

In the end North Vietnam won the war several years after H Ch Minh died

Suffering from diabetes and heart problems H Ch Minh died on the morning of September 2 1969 of a heart attack

In his will he said he wished to be cremated and have his ashes be buried in hills in the north center and south of Vietnam After he died however his followers embalmed his body and put it in a tomb the mausoleum where he is still worshipped today

In 1976 in the style of the Soviet Union the victorious Communist North renamed the capital of the non Communist South Saigon to Ho Chi Minh City in honour of their leader

The Declaration of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was a speech read by Ho Chi Minh on September 2 1945 in Ba Dinh Square Hanoi Vietnam which proclaims the independence of the Democractic Republic of Vietnam from France and Japan Empire after the Second World War 

During the August Revolution Ho Chi Minh wrote the speech at 48 Hang Ngang Street Hanoi at the home of a bourgeoisie family that donated 5147 taels of gold to the Revolutionary Government headed by Ho Chi Minh The Declaration was written with the advise of OSS Detachment 101 Maj Archimedes Patti

It is based on the American Declaration of Independence and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen

This immortal statement was made in the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America in 1776 In a broader sense this means All the peoples on the earth are equal from birth all the peoples have a right to live to be happy and free

The Declaration of the French Revolution made in 1791 on the Rights of Man and the Citizen also states All men are born free and with equal rights and must always remain free and have equal rights

Those are undeniable truths

Nevertheless for more than eighty years the French imperialists abusing the standard of Liberty Equality and Fraternity have violated our Fatherland and oppressed our fellowcitizens They have acted contrary to the ideals of humanity and justice

In the field of politics they have deprived our people of every democratic liberty

They have enforced inhuman laws they have set up three distinct political regimes in the North the Center and the South of Vietnam in order to wreck our national unity and prevent our people from being united

They have built more prisons than schools They have mercilessly slain our patriots they have drowned our uprisings in rivers of blood

They have fettered public opinion they have practised obscurantism against our people

To weaken our race they have forced us to use opium and alcohol

In the field of economics they have fleeced us to the backbone impoverished our people and devastated our land

They have robbed us of our rice fields our mines our forests and our raw materials They have monopolized the issuing of banknotes and the export trade

They have invented numerous unjustifiable taxes and reduced our people especially our peasantry to a state of extreme poverty

They have hampered the prospering of our national bourgeoisie they have mercilessly exploited our workers

In the autumn of 1940 when the Japanese Fascists violated Indochinas territory to establish new bases in their fight against the Allies the French imperialists went down on their bended knees and handed over our country to them

Thus from that date our people were subjected to the double yoke of the French and the Japanese Their sufferings and miseries increased The result was that from the end of last year to the beginning of this year from Quang Tri province to the North of Vietnam more than two million of our fellow citizens died from starvation On March 9 the French troops were disarmed by the Japanese The French colonialists either fled or surrendered showing that not only were they incapable of protecting us but that in the span of five years they had twice sold our country to the Japanese

On several occasions before March 9 the Vietminh League urged the French to ally themselves with it against the Japanese Instead of agreeing to this proposal the French colonialists so intensified their terrorist activities against the Vietminh members that before fleeing they massacred a great number of our political prisoners detained at Yen Bay and Caobang

Notwithstanding all this our fellowcitizens have always manifested toward the French a tolerant and humane attitude Even after the Japanese putsch of March 1945 the Vietminh League helped many Frenchmen to cross the frontier rescued some of them from Japanese jails and protected French lives and property

From the autumn of 1940 our country had in fact ceased to be a French colony and had become a Japanese possession

After the Japanese had surrendered to the Allies our whole people rose to regain our national sovereignty and to found the Democratic Republic of Vietnam

The truth is that we have wrested our independence from the Japanese and not from the French

The French have fled the Japanese have capitulated Emperor Bao Dai has abdicated Our people have broken the chains which for nearly a century have fettered them and have won independence for the Fatherland Our people at the same time have overthrown the monarchic regime that has reigned supreme for dozens of centuries In its place has been established the present Democratic Republic

For these reasons we members of the Provisional Government representing the whole Vietnamese people declare that from now on we break off all relations of a colonial character with France we repeal all the international obligation that France has so far subscribed to on behalf of Vietnam and we abolish all the special rights the French have unlawfully acquired in our Fatherland

The whole Vietnamese people animated by a common purpose are determined to fight to the bitter end against any attempt by the French colonialists to reconquer their country

We are convinced that the Allied nations which at Tehran and San Francisco have acknowledged the principles of self determination and equality of nations will not refuse to acknowledge the independence of Vietnam

A people who have courageously opposed French domination for more than eight years a people who have fought side by side with the Allies against the Fascists during these last years such a people must be free and independent

The Khmer Rouge in romanized Khmer French language for Red Khmer were a Stalinist Maoist extremist group which took over the capital of Kampuchea Phnom Penh on April 17 1975 It was led by Pol Pot who was called Saloth Sar before the take over They named the country Democratic Kampuchea They immediately forced everyone out of the cities effectively turning the whole country into a giant labor camp They were defeated by the Vietnamese in January of 1979 During the Khmer Rouge Years between 17 million and 3 million people were killed in a genocide comparable to the Holocaust The international community continued to recognize the Khmer Rouge as the government of Kampuchea for a decade after they were defeated Therefore the Khmer Rouge held a seat in the UN until 1989

Louis XVI was King of France and Navarre from 1774 to 1791 and as King of the French from 1791 to 1792 Suspended and arrested during the Insurrection of 10 August 1792 he was tried by the National Convention found guilty of treason and executed by guillotine on 21 January 1793 He was the only king of France to be executed

Louis XVI was born to Louis Ferdinand Dauphin of France and grandson of Louis XV and his wife Marie Josephe of Saxony in 1754 His father died early in Louiss life and Louis XVI became the dauphin His parents liked his older brother more than Louis and were upset when Louiss brother died at ten Louiss parents turned against him and he became a shy boy When Louis was 15 he married Marie Antoinette At first he and Marie did not consummate the marriage At last they did in 1773

However they failed to produce children for several years after that This made the marriage strained The situation was made worse when broken wikt linkobscenityobscene broken wikt linkpamphletpamphlets called libelles were published These libelles mocked their failure to produce children One questioned Can the King do it Cant the King do it In the end he and Marie had four children

At Versailles King Louis XVI could scarcely believe the storming of Bastille but the National Assembly took it in stride It was a victory for the people and bloodshed was natural in revolution But this was an important turning point for France There was no longer any possibility for reform  the movement had organically become a revolution 

On October 5 1789 an agitated assembly of women demanding bread marched to Versailles They surged effortlessly past the palace guards and thundered into the queens bedroom mere minutes after she fled The mob wanted the royal family to come with them to Paris and the ever faltering Louis at last acquiesced to the peoples demands With a heavy heart Louis added his signature to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and loaded his family into the royal carriage As they rolled somberly alongside the crowd the heads of their dead guards bobbed mockingly beside their windows

But Louis wouldnt be content as puppet king for very long Even though he was imprisoned by the people in the Tuileries Palace he had allies beyond Frances borders who wanted to see him regain the throne They planned an escape and broke from the Tuileries on the night of June 21 1791 under the guise of servants The royal family was close to the Austrian border when its carriage was apprehended at the town of Varennes When Louis and his family were brought back to their quarters at the Tuileries they were kept under heavier watch Suspicions against the royal family continued to mount including founded or unfounded beliefs that Marie Antoinette was writing to her family about confidential military maneuvers In an act of misguided duty to the monarchies of Europe Prussias Duke of Brunswick wrote We will destroy Paris into the ground if anything happens to our royal majesty the king and queen

Louis cousin the Duke of Orleans was the one responsible for spreading rumors about Louis wife which caused people to get very angry Louis was officially arrested on 13 August and sent to the Temple an ancient Paris fortress used as a prison On September 21 the National Assembly declared France to be a republic and abolished the monarchy

Louis was made to go on trial as an ordinary citizen and he was quickly proclaimed guilty Louis Capet had no allies in the Convention but the Girondins at least wanted to spare his life The Jacobins wouldnt hear of it Louis must die Robespierre convinced the people that the monarch must die for the republic to live For the last time he was reunited to his family and promised to come back the next morning but he did not On his way on the guillotine Louis Capet ominously prophesied I trust that my death will be for the happiness of my people but I grieve for France and I fear that she may suffer the anger of the Lord but his speech was drowned out by a roll of drums On January 20 1793 the man they once call King is no more Marie Antoinette the Queen was executed months later 

Louisville Kentucky is named for Louis XVI In 1780 the Virginia General Assembly present this name in honor of the French king whose soldiers were aiding the American side in the American Revolution The Virginia General Assembly saw the King as a noble man but many other continental delegates disagreed

Barter is useful when two people each have something the other wants so they agree on an amount of stuff and then swap it This can also happen with services for example a plumber can fix a tap in a winery and be given a crate of wine

The problem with barter is one person may not want what the other person has For instance Bob needs a new pair of shoes and John has those shoes But Bob has eggs and John needs milk This is where money becomes useful because anything can be traded for a set amount of money Bob could pay John for the shoes and John could go to the store and buy some milk

Hemisphere means half of the Earth

Pressure means how much something is pushing on something else expressed as force per unit areaPFA

To measure the amount of pressure people use these units

  

Pounds per square inch 

Commonly used in the US but not elsewhere Normal atmospheric pressure is 147 psi which means that a column of air one square inch in area rising from the Earths atmosphere to space weighs 147 pounds   

Atmosphere  atm

Normal atmospheric pressure is called 1 atmosphere 1 atm 146956 psi 760 torr   PFA Torr  torr

This is called the Torr because it is based on the original Torricelli barometer design One atmosphere of pressure will push the column of mercury in a mercury barometer to a height of 760 millimeters A pressure that causes the Hg column to rise 1 millimeter is called a torr 1 atm 760 torr 147 psi   

Bar  bar

The bar is almost the same as the atmosphere unit One bar 750062 torr 09869 atm 100000 Pa   

Millibar  mb or mbar

There are 1000 millibar in one bar This unit is used by meteorologists who find it easier to refer to atmospheric pressures without using decimals One millibar 0001 bar 0750 torr 100 Pa   

Pascal  Pa

1 pascal a force of 1 newton per square meter 1 pascal 10 dynecm2 001 mbar 1 atm 101325 Pascals 760 mm Hg 760 torr 147 psi   

Kilopascal  kPa

The prefix kilo means 1000 so one kilopascal 1000 Pa Therefore 101325 kPa 1 atm 760 torr and 100 kPa 1 bar 750 torr   

Megapascal  MPa

The prefix mega means 1000000 so one megapascal 1000 kPa 1000000 Pa Pressures in the megapascal range are common in high pressure air compressors and hydraulic systems where high pressure liquids are used to do useful work

  

Gigapascal  GPa

The prefix giga means 1000000000 so one gigapascal 1000 MPa 1000000 kPa 1000000000 Pa 9870 atm 10000 bar Pressures of several gigapascals can change graphite to diamond or make hydrogen a metallic conductor

Curitiba has high rates of education and is home to the oldest Brazilian university the Federal University of Paran People from Curitiba are called curitibanos in Portuguese language and Curitibans in English language

The name Curitiba comes from the large number of Brazilian Pines commonly called Parana Pine which grew in the region before the city was built There are two reasons for the name the indians of the Tupi nation namely the J and the Guarani used the word corae atuba The other reason also from the Tupi language comes from the joining of kurit and yba So Curitiba means something as Land of Abundant Pines

Curitiba is known for the urban differentiated solutions notably for the integrated system of transport of people together with the regular transit routes has served especially from the 1970s to encourage urban development

The public transport system in Curitiba features large passenger terminals connected by roads used only by the buses Vermelhos the Expressos Articulados and Biarticulados The biarticulated bus travels on long trips stopping only on the tube station stops to pick up or set down people Each biarticulated bus can carry 270 people  and complemented with the speedy silver Ligeirinho with an modern design has fewer stops therefore shortening distances when compared to the Linha Direta due to saved time and feeders differentiated by color 

This model has inspired similar experiments in cities of other countries such as Los Angeles and New York City where in the 1990s the installation of an experimental line of ligeirinho in the city connecting the city to the World Trade Center The system is the source of inspiration for the TransMilenio in Bogot Colombia Metrovia in Guayaquil Ecuadoras well as the Orange Line of Los Angeles California and for a future transportation system in Panama City Panama

The Order Crocodilia is a group of Archosaur reptiles There are three living families

Crocodiles are the nearest living relatives to birds because they are both survivors of the Archosaurs

Crocodiles are first found in the Upper Cretaceous period They are descendents of a much wider group of Archosaurs called the Crocodylomorphs These in the Upper Triassic were slender land living forms the sister group of the dinosaurs 

The Crocodylomorphs in turn were part of an even larger group the Crurotarsi which are first seen early in the Triassic

Biometrics is a field of study which aims to identify or recognise people based on traits they have Given these traits a system can be trained to recognise certain people with a certain probability Better training usually lowers the probability of falsely identifying someone 

The traits used are of three types

Most often the two types are combined as in voice or signature recognition Most of these biometrics are seen as behavioral but some are linked to the physiology eg of the vocal tract or of the hand 

Ways to identify a person could be to take a fingerprint of every person another one could be to let the person sign a document The data could then be put into a form that a machine can read At the border people could again take the fingerprint or the signature and compare it to the version stored in the passport

When selecting features those choosing must also look at social acceptance Taking a fingerprint may be ok taking a blood test may not be Some biometric data is also easier to fake eg signatures

Also when voice samples are taken these may be distorted because only a telephone line is available Telephone lines cut off some bandwidth from the signal

Other than for passports biometric methods are also used in some banks

Bandwidth is a measure of how much frequency space of a spectrum is used

To make this more clear we must define some terms Many systems work by means of vibrations or oscillations Vibrations are something that goes back and forth at a regular rate Each complete cycle of back and forth is called simply enough a cycle The number of cycles per second of a system is its frequency

Frequency is measured in cycles per second usually called Hertz and abbreviated Hz

However most systems do not operate at just a single frequency They operate at many different frequencies For example sound is vibrations Therefore it has at least one frequency and usually many different frequencies People can hear sound frequencies as low as about 20 Hz and as high as about 20000 Hz A band of frequencies is a continuous range of frequencies in this example the band of frequencies people can hear is from 20 Hz to 20000 Hz 

Finally bandwidth is the width of such a frequency band that is the highest frequency minus the lowest frequency In the hearing example the bandwidth of a persons ears is about 20000 Hz  20 Hz 19980 Hz

Bandwidth is often applied to the electromagnetic spectrum Such waves are vibrations of electric and magnetic fields To use a radio example the lowest United States AM radio channel covers the band of frequencies from 535000 Hz to 545000 Hz It therefore has a bandwidth of 10000 Hz All United States AM radio stations have this bandwidth The lowest United States FM radio channel covers the band from 88000000 Hz to 88200000 Hz It therefore has a bandwidth of 200000 Hz

The term bandwidth has been misused in the field of digital data communication It is often incorrectly used to mean data carrying capacity However there is no such thing as digital bandwidth The proper term for the data carrying capacity of a communication channel is channel capacity

It is true that in general the channel capacity of a system increases with the bandwidth used for communication However many other effects are also important Therefore in many real systems the channel capacity is not easily related to the channel bandwidth

Sometimes the word broadband is used to meaning high speed Broadband means wide band and suggests high speed However the term is not clear high speed is more clear Typically a telephone connection is thought to be low speed at less than 56000 bits High speed is usually 200000 bits or faster DSL or Cable Modem connections are usually high speed

The hertz is a unit to measure frequency It tells how often something happens A frequency of 1 hertz means that something happens once a second The pitch of the note Middle C is 262 Hz This means there are 262 vibrations every second when a Middle C is played

The unit is named after Heinrich Rudolf Hertz

1000 hertz equals 1 kilohertz 1000 kilohertz equals 1 megahertz 1000 megahertz equals 1 gigahertz and so on

Batman Returns was the second major Batman film produced and the second Batman film directed by Tim Burton

The Liberal Party of Australia in coalition with the National Party of Australia is one of the two main political groups in Australian politics the other being the Social Democratic Australian Labor Party The LiberalsNationals are the more conservative of the two main parties It was founded by Sir Robert Menzies in 1944 The current Liberal leader is Tony Abbott The LiberalNational coalition is currently in opposition in the Federal Parliament of Australia They lost governemnt in the Australian federal election held on November 24 2007 to the ALP after 11 years in government under the previous Liberal Prime Minister John Howard

Paul John Keating was the 24th Prime Minister of Australia He was from the Labor Party He grew up in the city of Sydney and the suburb of Bankstown He left De La Salle College at Bankstown at 14 years of age and worked as a clerk with the Sydney County Council doing this while juggling with studies and managed a rock band called the Ramrods Annita van Iersel married Paul Keating in 1975 In 1998 the Keatings separated

Keating was Treasurer from 1983 to 1991 He challenged and beat Bob Hawke for the job of prime minister in 1991 He won one election in 1993 but was beaten by John Howard in 1996 As treasurer with Bob Hawke he made lots of chages to the Australian economy and made it more modern In the early 1990s Australia had a really bad recession while he was treasurer and when he became Prime Minister As Prime Minister he tried to make Australia better friends with Asian countries and liked things like APEC He also wanted Australia to become a republic and wanted the government to say it was sorry to Aboriginal people for the things that Australians did long ago 

The Commonwealth of Independent States is the international organization or alliance of countries that used to form the Soviet Union 

On December 8 1991 leaders of Russia Belarus and Ukraine met in a place in Belarus They met in a Natural Reserve named Belovezhskaya Pushcha They discussed the matter of creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States They reached an agreement and signed a document creating the CIS The document contained many points about the CIS One of the same stated that the alliance would be open to all the republics of the Soviet Union Other nations with similar goals could also join the CIS

The Soviet Union had 15 republics Armenia Azerbaijan Belarus Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Moldova Russia Tajikistan Turkmenistan Ukraine Uzbekistan Georgia Estonia Latvia and Lithuania On 6th September 1991 the Soviet Union had recognized the independence of Estonia Latvia and Lithuania Out of the remaining 12 republics all joined the CIS Before joining the CIS on 21st December 1991 leaders of these 11 countries had met in Kazakhstan to accept the original CIS agreement of 8th December 1991 In December 1993 Georgia also joined the CIS On 26th August 2006 Turkmenistan left the permanent membership and became an associate member On 15th August 2008 Georgia left the CIS membership and Georgias CIS membership officially ended on 17th August 2009

Many persons believed that with the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States the Soviet Union ceased to exist They believed that it was the dissolution of the Soviet Union Many others think that with CIS Russia continues to have some control over the former republics of the Soviet Union 

The CIS has its headquarters at Minsk Belarus An Executive Director heads the CIS The CIS is not a successor country to the Soviet Union The CIS is an organization or alliance of independent countries It is more like the European Community The member countries of the CIS had also signed many agreements for economic cooperation and defense cooperation They have signed other agreements for cooperation in foreign policy and other matter 

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations is an international organization On 8th August 1967 Malaysia Thailand Indonesia Singapore and the Philippines formed the ASEAN At that time communism was growing in Vietnam and these five countries were also facing problems inside their countries In this background these five countries created ASEAN as a show of common display of cooperation In short the purpose of the organization is political and economic cooperation 

There was an earlier organization Its name was the Association of Southeast Asia It was an international organization of Philippines Malaysia and Thailand These three countries had formed ASA in 1961 It is named because all the countries in it are a part of Southeast Asia 

In 1976 ASEAN countries held a conference in Bali After this these countries started closer economic cooperation But by mid 1980s the activities of the ASEAN had slowed down By 1991 Thailand proposed a free trade area The ASEAN countries meet annually to discuss many matters 

Originally there were only five members of the ASEAN Brunei joined the ASEAN on 8 January 1984 Vietnam joined the ASEAN on 28 July 1995 Laos and Myanmar joined the ASEAN on 23 July 1997 Cambodia became a member on 30th April 1999 Some other countries such as East Timor may soon join ASEAN 

Some information about ASEAN countries is as follows

The ASEAN countries had created an ASEAN Regional Forum 27 countries are members of the ASEAN Regional Forum The leaders of these countries meet and discuss various matters especially security and economic cooperationThe current members in the ARF are Malaysia Thailand Indonesia Singapore Philippines Vietnam Brunei Laos Myanmar Cambodia Australia Canada the Peoples Republic of China the European Union India Japan North Korea South Korea Mongolia New Zealand Pakistan Papua New Guinea Russia Timor Leste United States and Sri Lanka

The ASEAN holds a meeting every year The meeting lasts for 3 days and the members discuss many things

An electric motor changes electrical energy into mechanical movement A dynamo or an electric generator does the reverse it changes mechanical movement into electric energy Most of the electric motors work by using the force of magnetism But an electric motor may work using different types of forces

 Lets start by looking at the overall plan of a simple two pole DC electric motor A simple motor has six parts Armature or rotor Commutator Brushes Axle Field magnet DC power supply of some sort An electric motor is all about magnets and magnetism A motor uses magnets to create motion If you have ever played with magnets you know about the fundamental law of all magnets Opposites attract and likes repel So if you have two bar magnets with their ends marked north and south then the north end of one magnet will attract the south end of the other On the other hand the north end of one magnet will repel the north end of the other Inside an electric motor these attracting and repelling forces create rotational motion 

To understand how electric motors work the key is to understand how electromagnets work An electromagnet is the basis of an electric motor

Electric motors are boardly classified in to two different categories ie DC and AC With in these categories there are numerous types each offering unique abilities that suit them well for best applications

In 1821 Michael Faraday made the first electric motor It worked using the force of magnetism

He created a simple electromagnet by taking a nail and a wire wrapping about 100 loops of wire around the nail and connected it to a battery With this he had a simple electromagnet with north and south pole In the middle of the nail he had made a hole and put a spindle into the hole so that the nail could rotate He then took a horseshoe shaped magnet and placed the wire wrapped nail in the middle

He connected the wire of the north pole to the negative pole of the battery and the wire of the south pole to the positive pole The basic law of magnetism told him what would happen the north end of the electromagnet would repel the north end of the horseshoe shaped magnet and would attract the south pole The same happened on the other side of the nail with the result that the nail turned 

Faraday was not happy with the result of the electromotor because the motor turned only once He changed the polarity of the battery and the wire wrapped nail again turned just once If he changed the polarity every time when the north pole of the wire wrapped nail is opposite to the south pole of the horseshoe shaped magnet then he would have the result he was looking for The wire wrapped nail would turn and turn around the spindle

Examples of electric motors include fans washing machines fridges pool pumps vacuum cleaners and fan ovens

Explosives are chemical compounds that cause explosions they flare up and burst with a loud sound Explosive material has many special characteristics it is a chemically unstable material it changes its form very fast and while changing its form it explodes by bursting and making loud sounds 

There are two types of explosives low explosives and high explosives This classification depends on their rate of explosion Low explosives burn very fast High explosives explode with bursts A low explosive is a material which burns very fast but does not explode generally For exploding them people mix them with high explosives Sometimes even a low explosive may explode A high explosive bursts and explodes very fast High explosives produce more pressure than low explosives People use high explosives in mining destroying old buildings Military weapons use high explosives 

High explosives may belong to different groups primary explosives and secondary explosives Primary explosives rapidly react to shock friction and heat Any shock friction or heat makes primary explosives to burn or blast fast Secondary explosives do not react very fast to shock friction and heat Any shock friction or heat may burn such explosives but not make them to burst and blast Some people call secondary explosives as base explosives Some people also tell about another group of explosives These are tertiary explosives These explosives do not react to shock friction and heat For explosion tertiary explosives may need a mixture with secondary explosives 

While sending explosives from one place to another the packs containing different types of explosives may have different types of markings on the boxes The United Nations has advised use of such markings Some examples are

UNICEF has its headquarters in New York United States of America UNICEF provides many types of assistance and help to children and mothers It receives money from different governments and private persons It works in almost all countries of the world

UNICEF has decided the following 5 areas as priority or main areas

Some other priority areas are the child in the family and sports for development

UNICEF has been working for over 60 years in different countries all over the world In 1965 this organization received the Nobel Peace Prize for its work But many people and governments have not always praised the work of the UNICEF They have pointed out some defects in the way UNICEF works Still it is the worlds leading organization for the development of children It operates in 190 countries around the world

German reunification is a term of history Unification means making two or more parts as one The German reunification is the unification of the two parts of Germany

After the Second World War Germany had been divided into two countries One was the Federal Republic of Germany also called West Germany The other part was the German Democratic Republic which was also called East Germany The German reunification was on October 3 1990 when East Germany again became a part of the Federal Republic of Germany

After World War II Germany was divided into 4 occupation zones by the 4 allied forces France Great Britain The United States of America and The Soviet Union in 1945 In 1949 the French British and American zones were made joined into the Federal Republic of Germany also known as West Germany while the Soviet zone was made into a separate state known as the German Democratic Republic or East Germany

During the cold war West Germany was a democratic country was allied with the United States of America and had a capitalist economic system East Germany was a communist country and was controlled by the Soviet Union

After West Germanys economy began to grow faster and faster in the 1950s while East Germanys economy was not doing so well many people moved from East to West Germany To stop this emigration the border between East and West Germany was closed in 1961 by East German forces This border was part of the Iron Curtain Between 1961 and 1989 leaving East Germany was very hard and extremely dangerous Officially leaving East Germany took years to be approved and people who applied were often spied on by East German police Many people who tried to flee over the border were shot and killed there

In 1989 Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev started to open the Soviet Union to the west Many of the communist countries followed his example opening the door into freedom for their citizens East Germany tried to ignore this trend but during the year of 1989 public protest grew inside the country After some tries to keep the country stable the border was finally opened on 9 November 1989 Conversion of East Germany into a democratic country started almost immediately During the following 11 months the terms of unification were negotiated between East and West Germany France Great Britain The United States of America and The Soviet Union and the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany was signed which opened the way towards reunification

Two options for reunification were written in the West German constitution

The Partitions of Poland or Partitions of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth is a term used in history In the Polish language the term for the Partitions of Poland is Rozbir Polski or Rozbiory Polski In the Lithuanian language the term for the partitions is Padalijimas The term describes partitions of the independent and sovereign country named the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth the neighboring countries of Prussia Imperial Russia and the Habsburg Monarchy divided the lands of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth among themselves Three partitions of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth took place on the dates noted below

The Partitions of Poland or Partitions of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth took place in the second half of the 18th century and ended the existence of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth The partitions were carried out by Prussia Russia and Habsburg Austria dividing up the Commonwealth lands among themselves Three partitions took place

The less often used term Fourth Partition of Poland may refer to any subsequent division of Polish lands specifically

During the reign of Wadysaw IV the liberum veto had evolved This policy of parliamentary procedure was based on the assumption of the political equality of every gentleman with the corollary that unanimous consent was required for all measures A single MPs belief that a measure was injurious to his own constituency even after the act had already been approved became sufficient to strike the act It became increasingly difficult to get action taken The liberum veto also provided openings for foreign diplomats to get their ways through bribing nobles to exercise it Thus one could characterise Poland Lithuania in its final period prior to the partitions as already not a completely sovereign state it could be seen almost as a vassal or in modern terms a Russian satellite state with Russian tsars effectively choosing Polish kings This applies particularly to the last Commonwealth King Stanisaw August Poniatowski who for some time had been a lover of Russian Empress Catherine the Great 

In 1730 Commonwealths neighbours namely Prussia Austria and Russia signed a secret agreement in order to maintain the status quo specifically to ensure that the Commonwealth laws would not change Their alliance later became known in Poland as the Alliance of the Three Black Eagles because all three states used a black eagle as a state symbol The Commonwealth had been forced to rely on Russia for protection against the rising Kingdom of Prussia while Prussia was demanding a slice of the northwest in order to unite its Western and Eastern portions although this would only leave the Commonwealth with a Baltic coast in Latvia and Lithuania The Commonwealth could never be liquidated unless its longtime ally Austria allowed itFactdateFebruary 2007 and first Catherine had to use diplomacy to win Austria to her side

The Commonwealth had remained neutral in the Seven Years War though sympathizing with the alliance of France Austria and Russia and allowing Russian troops access to its western lands as bases against Prussia Frederick II of Prussia retaliated by ordering enough Polish currency counterfeited to severely affect the Polish economy Through the Polish nobles whom Russia controlled and the Russian Minister to Warsaw ambassador and Prince Nicholas Repnin Empress Catherine the Great forced a constitution on the Commonwealth at the so called Repnin Sejm of 1767 named after ambassador Repnin who de facto dictated the terms of that Sejm This new constitution undid the reforms made in 1764 under Stanisaw II The liberum veto and all the old abuses of the last one and a half centuries were guaranteed as unalterable parts of this new constitution Repnin also demanded religious freedom for the Protestant and Orthodox Christians and the resulting reaction among some of Polands intolerant Roman Catholic as well as the deep resentment of Russian intervention in the Commonwealths domestic affairs led to the War of the Confederation of Bar with Russia from 1768 to 1772 

The Poles tried to expel foreign forces in an uprising but the irregular and poorly commanded forces had litte chance in the face of the regular Russian army and suffered a defeat Adding to the chaos was a Ukrainian peasant rebellion the Koliyivschyna which erupted in 1768 and resulted in massacres of noblemen Jews Uniates and Catholic priests before it was put down by Polish and Russian troops

On February 19 1772 the agreement of partition was signed in Vienna A previous agreement between Prussia and Russia had been made in St Petersburg on February 6 1772 Early in August the Russian Prussian and Austrian troops simultaneously entered the Commonwealth and occupied the provinces agreed upon among themselves On August 5 1772 the occupation manifesto was issued much to the consternation of a country too exhausted by the endeavours of the Confederation of Bar to offer further resistance Frederick II wrote about the participation of the empress Maria Theresa in the first division of Poland in a letter The Empress Catherine and I are simple robbers I just would like to know how the empress calmed down her father confessor She cried when she took the more she cried the more she took

The regiments of the Confederation whose executive board had been forced to leave Austria after that country joined the Prusso Russian alliance did not lay down their arms Every fortress in their command held out as long as possible Famous was the defence of Tyniec which lasted until the end of March 1773 and also that of Czstochowa commanded by Puaski Krakw fell on April 28th captured by the Russian general Suvorov who exiled the garrison to SiberiaFactdateFebruary 2007 Neither France nor Britain upon whom hopes had been based helped in a sufficient measure or protested when the partition was executed So came to an end the ill organized attempt of the Commonwealth to repulse the foreign aggression It had cost about a hundred thousand men and once more laid the country to waste although it was the first demonstration of the reviving national consciousness

The partition treaty was ratified by its signatories on September 22 1772 Frederick II of Prussia was elated with his success and took great care for the welfare of his new Polish subjects importing large numbers of Catholic schoolteachers and making it mandatory for Prussian crown princes to learn Polish Kaunitz of Austria was proud of wresting as large a share as he did with the rich salt mines of Bochnia and Wieliczka and Catherine of Russia was also very satisfied By this diplomatic document Russia came into possession of that section of Livonia which had still remained in Commonwealth control and of Belarus embracing the counties of Vitebsk Polotsk and Mstislavl 

Prussia took Ermland Royal Prussia without the city of Danzig northern areas of Greater Poland along the Note River and parts of Kuyavia

To Austria fell Zator and Auschwitz part of Little Poland embracing parts of the counties of Krakw and Sandomir and the whole of Galicia less the City of Krakw By this partition the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth lost about 30 of its territory amounting at that time to about convert484000sqmikm2 with a population of four million people The largest share of the spoils as far as population and revenue were concerned went to Austria

After having occupied their respective territories the three partitioning powers demanded that King Stanisaw and the Sejm approve their action The King appealed to the nations of Western Europe for help and tarried with the convocation of the Sejm When no help was forthcoming and the armies of the combined nations occupied Warsaw to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly no alternative could be chosen save passive submission to their will Those of the senators who advised against this step were arrested and exiled to Siberia by the representatives of CatherineFactdateFebruary 2007 The local land assemblies refused to elect Deputies to the Sejm and after great difficulties less than half of the regular number of representatives came to attend the session led by Marshal of the Sejm Adam Poniski the commander of the Malta Order a cynic and notorious gambler In order to prevent the disruption of the Sejm and the defeat of the purpose of the invaders he undertook to turn the regular Sejm into a Sejm of a Confederacy where majority rule prevailed In spite of the dramatic efforts of Tadeusz Rejtan Samuel Korsak and Stanisaw Bohuszewicz to prevent it the deed was accomplished with the aid of Micha Radziwi and the Bishops Andrzej Modziejowski Ignacy Jakub Massalski and Antoni Kazimierz Ostrowski who occupied high positions in the Senate of Poland The so called Partition Sejm elected a committee of thirty to deal with the various matters presented On September 18 1773 the Committee formally signed the treaty of cession renouncing all claims of the Commonwealth to the occupied territories On the other hand that very Sejm which continued its deliberations until 1775 shaken by the first partition passed several important reforms among them the creation of the Permanent Council and Commission for National Education

By seizing northwestern Poland Prussia instantly gained control over 80 of the Commonwealths total foreign trade Through levying enormous custom duties Prussia accelerated the inevitable collapse of the Commonwealth

By 1790 on the political front the First Polish Republic had deteriorated into such a helpless condition that it was successfully forced into an unnatural and ultimately deadly alliance with its enemy Prussia The Polish Prussian Pact of 1790 was signed The conditions of the Pact were such that the succeeding and final two partitions of Poland were inevitable The May Constitution of 1791 enfranchised the bourgeoisie established the separation of the three branches of government and eliminated the abuses of Repnin Sejm Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth Once again Poland dared to reform and improve itself without Russias permission and once again the Empress was angered arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical Jacobinism then at high tide in France Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792 

In the War in Defense of the Constitution pro Russian conservative Polish magnates the Confederation of Targowica fought against the Polish forces supporting the constitution believing that Russians would help them restore the Golden Liberty Abandoned by their Prussian allies Polish pro constitution forces faced with Targowica units and the regular Russian army were defeated Prussia signed a treaty with Russia agreeing that Polish reforms would be revoked and both countries would receive chunks of Commonwealth territory In 1793 deputies to the Grodno Sejm in Grodno last Sejm of the Commonwealth in the presence of the Russian forces agreed to Russian territorial demands In the 2nd partition Russia and Prussia helped themselves to enough more land so that only one third of the 1772 population remained in Poland

Targowica confederates who did not expect another partition and the king Stanisaw August Poniatowski who joined them near the end both lost much prestige and support The reformers on the other hand were attracting increasing support and in 1794 the Kociuszko Uprising begun

Kosciuszkos ragtag insurgent armies won some initial successes but they eventually fell before the superior forces of Russian Empire The partitioning powers seeing the increasing unrest in the remaining Commonwealth decided to solve the problem by erasing any independent Polish state from the map On 24 October 1795 their representatives signed a treaty dividing the remaining territories of the Commonwealth between their three countries

The Russian part included 120000 km and 12 million people with Wilno the Prussian part 55000 km and 1 million people with Warsaw and the Austrian 47000km with 12 million and Lublin and Krakw

Napoleon set up the Duchy of Warsaw in a smaller area of Poland but after his defeat and the implementation of the Congress of Vienna programme things became even worse for Poles than before Russia gained a larger share of Poland and after crushing an insurrection in 1831 the Congress Kingdom of Polands autonomy was abolished and Poles faced confiscation of property deportation forced military service and the closure of their own universities After the rising of 1863 Russification of Polish secondary schools was imposed and literacy rate dropped dramatically In the Austrian portion Poles became the second nationality FactdateFebruary 2007 and were allowed representation in Parliament and to form their own universities and Krakw and Lvov became centers of Polish education Meanwhile Prussia Germanized the entire school system of its Polish subjects and had no more respect for Polish culture and institutions than Russia hadFactdateDecember 2007 It would take the World War I with the Central Powers losing to the Western Allies the chaos of the Russian Revolution and the Treaty of Versailles to restore Polands independence after 123 years

As a result of Partitions Poles were forced to seek a change of status quo in Europe Polish poets politicians noblemen writers artists many of whom were forced to emigrate became the revolutionaries of 19th century as desire for freedom and liberty became one of the defining parts of Polish romanticism Polish revolutionaries participated in uprisings in Prussia Austrian Empire and Imperial Russia Polish legions fought alongside Napoleon and under the slogan of For our freedom and yours participated widely in the Spring of Nations

The term Fourth Partition of Poland may refer to any subsequent division of Polish lands specifically

If one accepts more than one of those events as partitions fifth and sixth partitions can be counted but these terms are very rare

As historian Norman Davies stated because of the observance of the balance of power equilibrium many contemporary observers accepted explanations of the enlightened apologists of the partitioning state Some particularly older historians from countries that carried out the partitions such as 19th century Russian scholar Sergey Solovyov argued that partitions were justified as the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth had degenerated to the point of being partitioned because of the counterproductive principle of liberum veto that made decision making on divisive issues such as a wide scale social reform virtually impossible Solovyov specified the cultural language and religious break between the supreme and lowest layers of the society in the east regions of the Commonwealth where the Bielorussian and Ukrainian serf peasantry was Orthodox Russian authors emphasized the historical connections between Belarus Ukraine and Russia as former parts of the medieval old Russian state where dynasty of Rurikids reigned A new justification for partitions arose with the Russian Enlightenment as Russian writers such as Gavrila Derzhavin Denis Fonvizin and Alexander Pushkin stressed degeneration of Catholic Poland and the need to civilize it by its neighbors Nonetheless other 19th century contemporaries were much more sceptical for example British jurist Sir Robert Phillimore discussed the partition as a violation of international law German jurist Heinrich Bernhard Oppenheim presented similar views Other old historians who challenged such justifications for the Partitions included French historian Jules Michelet British historian and politician Thomas Babington Macaulay 1st Baron Macaulay and Edmund Burke More recent studies claim that partitions happened when Poland had been showing the beginning signs of a slow recovery and see the last two partitions as an answer to strengthening reforms in the Commonwealth and the potential threat they represented to its neighbours 

The Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth was a federation of two countries of the 16th century In 1569 Jagiellon Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania formed this federation The Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth covered more lands than the present lands of Poland and Lithuania The lands of the Commonwealth also covered all the lands of present day Belarus a large part of Ukraine and Latvia and western part of present day Russia This Commonwealth lasted for more than 200 years It ended with the final Partitions of Poland in 1795 The Commonwealth was an extension of the Polish Lithuanian Union a personal union between those two states that had existed from 1386

The process of the Unification of Germany occurred in the nineteenth century Prior to unification there were many states in Central Europe Some of them were very small possibly no more than convert5mispus from one border to the other Many Germans wanted a nation that was united powerful and influential 

Unification took place on 18 January 1871 At the conclusion of the Franco Prussian War the German princes proclaimed the German nation in Versailles France at the Hall of Mirrors Unification joined together the many independent German states These states became the German Empire 

The unification of Germany began many years earlier during the Napoleonic Wars At the Battle of Leipzig in 1813 which is also called the Battle of Nations many of the German states joined with Russia Sweden and Austria to defeat Napoleons army In the subsequent Peace of Vienna in 1815 which ended the Napoleonic Wars Austria remained the most powerful of the German states in terms of political power Prussia emerged as Austrias political and diplomatic rival

There were many problems in unifying the German states Not all politicians were in favor of unification Some feared that unification would give Austria and Prussia too much power among the many states There were also problems in deciding who would collect taxes and how much tax would be paid 

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is an international organization Since 1965 the headquarters of OPEC is in Vienna Austria 

12 countries are members of OPEC The names of these countries are 

Member countries of the OPEC came together to form this international organization with several aims Some of the aims are

However OPEC has not always been able to achieve all these aims 

The Organization for Economic Co operation and Development is an international organization of thirty three countries Member countries of OECD all have a democratic system of government They also accept the principle of a free economy A country has a free economy when its government does not control the economic activities of its citizens and companies 

The OECD started 1948 as the Organization for European Economic Co operation The Second World War had just ended three years before in 1945 Some countries of Europe came together to form OEEC to help each other re build their industry and other things destroyed in the Second World War Later on some non European countries also joined this organization In 1960 OEEC changed its name and it became OECD the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development

The OECDs headquarters are at the Chteau de la Muette in Paris

Right now OECD has thirty four countries as its members Twenty countries became members of OECD in 1960 These countries are

14 countries joined OECD after 1960 The names of these countries are 

The 1973 oil crisis started on October 17 1973 when the members of Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries said because of the Yom Kippur War that they would no longer ship petroleum to nations that had supported Israel in its conflict with Syria and Egypt

About the same time OPEC members agreed to raise world oil prices after attempts at negotiation with the Seven Sisters oil company earlier in the month failed Due to the dependence of the industrialized world on crude oil and the role of OPEC as a major supplier these price increases hurt the economies of the targeted countries while at the same time limiting economic activity The targeted countries responded with new and mostly permanent attempts to limit any more dependency

Organization for Security and Co operation in Europe is an international organization Presently it has 56 countries as its members Most of the member countries of the OSCE are from Europe the Caucasus Central Asia and North America 

The headquarters of OSCE are in Vienna Austria There are more than 3500 persons who work for OSCE Most of the persons who work for OSCE work at different places and only about 10 of them work at its headquarters 

Since the end of the Second World War many countries of the Europe wanted to have an organization to discuss various matters especially security Such discussion had continued since 1950s Many years after in November 1972 leaders of 35 countries met in Helsinki In 1973 these countries set up the Conference for Security and Co operation in Europe By the end of 1990s communist governments in many countries had changed In this situation the role of CSCE was also changing The leaders from member countries of CSCE met in Paris On 21st November 1990 they signed an agreement This changed the name of Conference for Security and Co operation in Europe to Organization for Security and Co operation in Europe This international organization continues to function
