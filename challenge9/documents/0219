Ferruccio Busoni was an Italian composer pianist teacher and conductor

Ferruccio Busoni was born in Empoli in Tuscany in Italy His parents were both musicians His father played the clarinet and his mother played the piano They were often touring when Ferruccio was young He spent most of his childhood in Trieste

Busoni was a child prodigy He first played the piano in public at the age of seven Two years later he played some of his own compositions in Vienna The composer Franz Liszt heard him He also met Liszt Johannes Brahms and Anton Rubinstein

For a short time he studied in Graz then in Leipzig He taught in several places including Helsinki where he met Jean Sibelius as well as a young lady was to be his wife In 1890 he won the Anton Rubinstein Competition with his Concert Piece for Piano and Orchestra He taught in Moscow in 1890 and in the United States from 1891 to 1894 where he also toured as a virtuoso pianist

In 1894 he went to Berlin where he stayed He performed as a pianist and conductor and taught many gifted pianists He wrote a book called Sketch of a New Aesthetic of Music He did not agree with the strict rules that were used by most teachers for teaching composition He thought that music was born to be free His thinking influenced his composition pupils who included Percy Grainger Kurt Weill and Edgard Varse

During World War I Busoni lived first in Bologna where he was director of the conservatory and later in Zrich He refused to perform in any countries that were involved in the war He returned to Berlin in 1920 where he gave master classes in composition 

Busoni died in Berlin from a kidney disease 

Busonis music is based on the Romantic style but it also starts to sound quite modern He uses a lot of complicated counterpoint Sometimes it is quite atonal A lot of it is based on music of the past He made many transcriptions including piano transcriptions of several works by Johann Sebastian Bach

Busoni was a virtuoso pianist and his works for piano are difficult to perform His Piano Concerto is extremely hard to play as well as being extremely long The British pianist John Ogdon who played it called it the longest and grandest piano concerto of all

Some of his best known works include his suite for orchestra Turandot which he made into an opera and his opera Doktor Faust which he had not finished when he died It was finished by his student Philipp Jarnach but in the 1980s Anthony Beaumont made a better version of it

Busoni made a number of piano rolls and a small number of these have been re recorded onto CD People who knew him disagree about whether these piano roll recordings show his playing at his best

Before the discovery of America certain foods were not known to the Afro Eurasian diet The diet was more alcohol cattle and grain based and did not include foods like corn turkey potatoes and other New World crops

Chinese herbs do not grow in China only If you find the right climate and soil type you can grow many of those herbs overseas For instance American Ginseng is grown in Wisconsin State

The raw herbs available in retail have the following natural features

How do people take the raw herbs Raw herbs are usually taken orally by extracting the essence out of them The natural way being practiced since ancient time is to boil and brew the herbal package in water to get a dark brown solution called herb tea that never tastes good One hour of brewing should be good enough Then you drink one or two cups a day Honey or sugar may be added to make it taste less bad The herbal package can be conveniently modified by changing some ingredients to make it work for you So an herbal package is really tailor made for you only

Raw herbs can be dried and grounded into a powder then compressed into a tablet which is better than buying your own tablets or having to buy gel capsules

Raw herbs can be made into capsules at home All you need is a tailor made package of raw herbs Turn it into fine powder with a powerful grinder and put the powder into empty gel capsules When you swallow the capsules your digestive system has to extract the essence out of the raw herb powder Whereas if you drink the herb tea the essence extraction is already done after brewing The herbal solution will readily be absorbed by your body Furthermore the herb tea has a history spanning over two thousand years How many years of history does the tablet or capsule have besides offering convenience General Tonics

shi chang purhizoma Acori GramineiThe terms used here reflect typical TCM usage and may not reflect their meanings in TCM namely meanings that are normative figurative or metaphorical when read in context The meanings of these terms are therefore different from that in common English usage In particular they are not to be used for purposes of self diagnosis much less for self medication For example Xia Huo means To reduce fire but fire here does not refer to combustion involving oxygen Even within TCM there are various meanings of fire and it can refer to real or false fire The 3 herbs mentioned above cannot be used to reduce false fire or fires of yin deficiency in the zhang organs An example of the non literal use of transliterated characters is long gu which literally means dragon bones This term cannot possible refer to Chinese dragons since they do not exist However one can easily buy long gu from any TCM herbal shop Another term that cannot be taken literally is di long which literally means earth dragon Although the above herbs are common in TCM prescriptions they cannot be purchased if we refer only to their Latin names One likely reason is that TCM pharmacists rarely if ever use the Latin names of the herbs The Chinese names or the transliterated names should be used instead For example if we ask for flos Lonicerae we will almost certainly get a blank look However if we ask for Jin Yin Hua or we will connect immediately even though the pharmacist may speak any of the large number of Chinese dialects Wherever possible use the written form to avoid miscommunication andor mis pronunciation since there is no dialect form of the written language There are a large number of synonyms of the herb names in both Chinese English and Latin This makes it even more essential to use the written form of the Chinese names to ensure accuracy Some herbs are prone to adulteration substitution or both For example Ling Zhi Cao can be substituted with an inactive form of the herb If an extract is first made with water the herb will be tasteless when dried and re usedrecycled On the other hand the genuine Ling Zhi tastes bitter but few consumers would know the difference especially if the herb is mixed in a prescription and boiled together with other herbs The pharmacists themselves may not be aware as some may trust their suppliers implicitly and do not conduct regular testing Animal based herbs are prone to substitution or adulteration including Xiong Dan which looks very much like Niu Dan when the gall bladder is dried although Niu Dan is far less bitter in taste Some are simply unavailable because they are banned in many countries These include tiger parts such as Hu Gu which is substituted by bobcat bone and Chuan San Jia which has no animal based substitute Niu Huang is unavailable in many Western countries and Singapore because of its potential impact on pregnant women although Niu Huang Pills with about 2 of Niu Huang are available in many Asian countries

A rocket engine is a device that produces a force by pushing gases at high speed out of a nozzle Rocket engines burn chemicals such as petroleum and liquid oxygen at very high pressures and temperatures to turn the chemical energy into motion In some cases the force created can be over a million pounds

A garden hose shows how moving fluid can create a force When a hose is turned up the hose will snake around unless it is held still The exiting water is creating a force on the hose just like how the rocket engine gases push on the rocket engine

Some rocket engines burn liquid fuels while some burn solid fuels Solid fuel rocket engines are sometimes called rocket motors

Liquid fuel rocket engines often require complex pumps and valves to properly move the liquids from the fuel tank to the actual engine These machines must work in very extreme temperatures and pressures Liquid oxygen is very cold while the engine is very hot and the pressure is oftentimes hundreds of times higher than normal air pressure Because of these conditions liquid fuel rocket engines are often very complex and require very specialised materials

Solid fuel rocket motors have the fuel as a solid mixture of an oxidizer and fuel An oxidiser supports the burning of fuel much like oxygen supports burning The common oxidiser is powdered Ammonium Perchlorate while the common fuel is powdered aluminum metal The two powders are stuck together with a third component known as the binder The binder is a rubbery solid that also burns as a fuel The simple idea makes solid rocket engines cheaper but they cannot be turned off or controlled and are more likely to explode than liquid rocket engines They are also less powerful than liquid rocket engines

Hybrid rocket engines combine the two ideas The two propellants are different states of matter often with liquid oxidisers and solid fuels They are not used much but might be safer than solid rocket motors or liquid rocket motors

A nozzle is a device that takes incoming fluid and increases the speed This is done by changing the size of the pipe that the fluid is flowing through

The Penny Black was the worlds first adhesive postage stamp It was issued by the United Kingdom on the first of May 1840 and used from the sixth May of the same year All London post offices received official issues of the new stamps but other offices in the country did not Some post offices like in Bath offered the stamp unofficially after May 2 

Once the stamps were used they had a red cancellation However it was hard to see and it could easily be taken off It is not very rare althougt prices vary from a few pounds to over 1000 pounds

The Penny Red was a postage stamp issued in 1841 to replace the Penny Black It was the main type of postage stamp in the United Kingdom until 1879 The design was hardly changed at all

Mugello is a landscape north of Florence in northern Italy It is separated by the Santerno Rivers valley by the Futa Pass

In ancient times it was on the border between the area settled by the Ligurians the Etruscans and the Gauls The Roman colonization left sparse traces as the Mugello was mostly an agricultural area In the Middle Ages it was home to numerous castles and was later acquired by the Republic of Florence Several families of the city built there partician villas like those of the Medici in Cafaggiolo and the Trebbio Recent is the creation of the artificial Lake of Bilancino on the Sieve river

Friars are special monks that do a service to a community and that lead a simple life rather than living like ascets in a monastery

There are two classes of orders known as friars or mendicant orders the four great orders and the so called lesser orders

The lesser orders are 

The Order of the Brothers of Our Lady of Mount Carmel or Carmelites is a Roman Catholic religious order It was founded in the 12th century on Mount Carmel from which the order receives its name Saint Bertold has traditionally been associated with the founding of the order but few clear records of early Carmelite history have survived and this is likely to be a later invention

Samael is an archangel in Talmudic and post Talmudic beliefs and stories as well as Christian tradition and demonology There are also other religions that believe in stories of Samael Samael is often thought to be both good and evil It is said that he was the guardian angel of Esau and a patron of the sinful empire of Rome 

Samael is often confused with Satan because he often has grim and destructive duties He is often considered a fallen angel like Satan and the chief of the evil spirits One of Samaels roles in Jewish beliefs is that of the Angel of Death In this belief he is a fallen angel but remains one of the Lords servants As a good angel Samael supposedly lives in the seventh heaven although he is said to be the chief angel of the fifth heaven 

The website Catholicorg says Samael is a Power which means he is the chief of many warrior angels

Powers are warrior angels against evil who defend the world and people They fight against evil spirits who attempt to bring chaos through human beings The chief is said to be either Samael or Camael both angels of darkness

In Jewish beliefs Sammael is said to be the Angel of Death the ruler of the Fifth Heaven and one of the seven regents of the world served by two million angels he resides in the Seventh Heaven Yalkut I 110 of the Talmud says Samael is Esaus guardian angel In Sotah 10b Samael is Esaus guardian angel

In the Sayings of Rabbi Eliezer he is said to be the one who tempted Eve then seduced and impregnated her with Cain Some sources identify Gadreel as the angel that seduced Eve although other Hebrew scholars say that it was Samael who tempted Eve as the Serpent 

Samael is also sometimes said to be the angel who wrestled with Jacob and also the angel who held back the arm of Abraham as he was about to sacrifice his son

According to The Ascension of Moses Samael is also mentioned as being in 7th Heaven In the last heaven Moses saw two angels each five hundred parasangs in height forged out of chains of black fire and red fire the angels Af Anger and Hemah Wrath whom God created at the beginning of the world to execute His will Moses was disquieted when he looked upon them but Metatron embraced him and said Moses Moses thou favorite of God fear not and be not terrified and Moses became calm There was another angel in the seventh heaven different in appearance from all the others and of frightful mien His height was so great it would have taken five hundred years to cover a distance equal to it and from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet he was studded with glaring eyes at the sight of which the beholder fell prostrate in awe This one said Metatron addressing Moses is Samael who takes the soul away from man Whither goes he now asked Moses and Metatron replied To fetch the soul of Job the pious Thereupon Moses prayed to God in these words O may it be Thy will my God and the God of my fathers not to let me fall into the hands of this angel In The Holy Kabbalah Samael is described as the severity of God and is listed as fifth of the archangels of the world of Briah Samael is said to have married Lilith after she left Adam According to Zoharistic cabala Samael was also mated with Eisheth Zenunim Naamah and Agrat Bat Mahlat  all angels of prostitution

Samael is sometimes confused in some books with Camael an archangel of God whose name means He who sees God

Samael is shown as a character in the Megami Tensei video game series The archangel is shown in the games as a blood red serpent He is a member of the Vile Clan and is a persona of the Death Arcana 

In the Silent Hill video games Samael is the name of one of the towns gods He is shown as an anthromorphic goat

In the film Hellboy one of the main characters is a giant hell hound called Sammael who Hellboy nicknames Sammy

In medieval history Ifriqiya or Ifriqiyah was the area of the coastal regions of what are today western Libya Tunisia and eastern Algeria This area included what had been the Roman province of Africa

In modern Arabic the term simply means Africa It comes from the Latin term Africa 

In Ancient Rome a province was the basic and until around 300 largest territorial and administrative unit of the empires territorial possessions outside of the peninsula of Italy The word province in modern English came from the term used by the Romans

The Roman province of Africa was established after the Romans defeated Carthage in the Third Punic War It roughly includeded the territory of present day northern Tunisia north eastern Algeria and the Mediterranean coast of modern day western Libya along the Syrtis Minor The Arabs later named roughly the same region as the original province Ifriqiya an other word for Africa

The prosperity of most towns depended on agriculture Called the granary of the empire North Africa according to one estimate produced one million tons of cereals each year one quarter of which was exported Additional crops included beans figs grapes and other fruits By the second century olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item In addition to the cultivation of slaves and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animals the principal production and exports included the textiles marble wine timber livestock pottery and wool

The Third Punic War was the third and last of the Punic Wars It was fought between the former Phoenician colony of Carthage and the Roman Republic

The war was a much smaller engagement than the two previous Punic Wars and was mostly just the Romans attacking the city of Carthage in the Battle of Carthage The Romans killed or captured all the people living inside of the city tore down the buildings and put salt in the earth so that plants wouldnt be able to grow They did this because they hated the Carthaginians after fighting two other wars with them and didnt want to fight another so they totally destroyed them

The Punic Wars were a series of three wars fought between Rome and Carthage between 264 and 146 BC and were probably the largest wars in the ancient world They are known as the Punic Wars because the Latin term for Carthaginian was Punici

The main cause of the Punic Wars was the clash of interests between the existing empire of Carthage and the expanding Roman Republic Carthage lost the three wars

Carthage was a trading nation founded by Phoenicians It was the dominant sea power in the western Mediterranean It was a maritime empire in contrast to the land based Roman empire The Romans decided they needed Sicily which was then in Carthaginian hands The consequence was a series of wars which lasted over a hundred years and ended in the utter destruction of Carthage

The User Datagram Protocol is one of the core members of the Internet Protocol Suite the set of network protocols used for the Internet With UDP computer applications can send messages sometimes known as datagrams to other hosts on an Internet Protocol network without requiring other communications to set up special transmission channels or data paths UDP is sometimes called the Universal Datagram Protocol The protocol was designed by David P Reed in 1980 and formally defined in RFC 768

UDP applications use datagram sockets to establish host to host communications Sockets bind the application to service ports that functions as the endpoints of data transmission A port is a software structure that is identified by the port number a 16 bit integer value allowing for port numbers between 0 and 65535 Port 0 is reserved but is able to be used if the sending process does not expect messages in response

Ports 1 through 1023 are named well known ports and on Unix like operating systems binding to one of these ports requires superuser access

Ports 1024 through 49151 are registered ports

Ports 49152 through 65535 are used as temporary ports usually by clients when communicating to servers

A cache can be used to improve the performance of accessing a given resource When there are several such caches for the same resource as shown in the picture this can lead to problems Cache coherence or Cache coherency refers to a number of ways to make sure all the caches of the resource have the same data and that the data in the caches makes sense Cache coherence is a special case of memory coherence

There may be problems if there are many caches of a common memory resource as data in the cache may no longer make sense or one cache may no longer have the same data as the others A common case where the problem occurs is the cache of CPUs in a multiprocessing system As can be seen in the figure if the top client has a copy of a memory block from a previous read and the bottom client changes that memory block the top client could be left with an invalid cache of memorywithout knowing Cache coherence is there to manage such conflicts and maintain consistency between cache and memory

Coherence defines the behavior of reads and writes to the same memory location The caches are coherent if all of the following conditions are met

These conditions are defined supposing that the read and write operations are made instantaneously However this does not happen in computer hardware because of memory latency and other aspects of the architecture A write by processor X may not be seen by a read from processor Y if the read is made within a very small time after the write has been made The memory consistency model defines when a written value must be seen by a following read instruction made by the other processors

Distributed shared memory systems mimic these mechanisms so that they can maintain consistency between blocks of memory in loosely coupled systems

The two most common types of coherence that are typically studied are Snooping and Directory based Each has its own benefits and drawbacks Snooping protocols tend to be faster if enough bandwidth is available since all transactions are a requestresponse seen by all processors The drawback is that snooping is not scalable Every request must be broadcast to all nodes in a system As the system gets larger the size of the bus and the bandwidth it provides must grow Directories on the other hand tend to have longer latencies but use much less bandwidth since messages are point to point and not broadcast For this reason many of the larger systems use this type of cache coherence

Homestead is a city of southeastern Florida in the United States It was devastated when Hurricane Andrew traveled over the area in August 1992

Marshall was born in Kalgoorlie Western Australia He lived in Kalgoorlie and Carnarvon until moving to Perth at the age of seven He went to high school at Newman College Perth At the University of Western Australia he studied medicine and surgery He married his wife Adrienne in 1972 In 1972 he was also the Western Australian state yo yo champion

In 1979 Marshall became a Registrar in Medicine at the Royal Perth Hospital At the hospital he met Robin Warren a pathologist who was interested in gastritis They were both training in internal medicine at Royal Perth Hospital in 1981 Together they looked at spiral bacteria in gastritis In 1982 they grew a culture of H pylori They worked on their idea that there was a bacterial cause of peptic ulcer and stomach cancer Their idea was laughed at by scientists and doctors who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic stomach Marshall said that Everyone was against me but I knew I was right Other doctors said they wouldnt believe it until the H pylori idea could be proved

Marshall and Warren tried to give the bacteria to piglets in 1984 but it did not work Marshall drank some of the bacteria and soon developed gastritis with achlorhydria He had stomach discomfort nausea vomiting and bad smelling breath On the 14th day of the infection biopsies of Marshalls stomach did not show any bacteria His body may have got rid of the bacteria without help His wife made him take antibiotics immediately so there was no way of checking the negative result again He did not develop antibodies to Hpylori This means that natural immunity can sometimes get rid of Hpylori infection His illness and recovery showed the link between H pylori and gastritis but not for peptic ulcer This experiment was published in 1985 in the Medical Journal of Australia and is among the most cited articles from the journal

After this work at Fremantle Hospital Marshall did research at Royal Perth Hospital and at the University of Virginia USA before going back to Australia He held a Burnet Fellowship at the University of Western Australia from 1998 2003 He is still looking at H pylori and runs the Hpylori Research Laboratory at UWA

In 2005 the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm gave the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Dr Marshall and Dr Warren for finding the bacterium Helicobacter pylori and its part in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease

Marshall was given other awards including

He was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 2007

Diglossia is when a group of people have two languages or dialects that they use One is the common language they use every day and the other is either a much older version from centuries before or a similar but clearly different modern day version for example Norwegian with Bokml and Nynorsk

Mutual intelligibility is where the speakers of one language can understand another language because they are similar

Sweetwater is a city of Florida in the United States

During the 1920s the Miami Pittsburgh Land Company bought land near Miami They planned to build Sweetwater Groves In 1926 a category 4 hurricane the Great Miami Hurricane struck the area Between the hurricane and problems with real estate value at the time this construction never happened 

In 1938 Clyde Andrews bought most of the Sweetwater Groves land and began to sell it for homes A group of Russian midgets were some of the people who bought the land They were looking for a place to retire after their career in the circus They built several homes on the land These homes were not built for people of normal height The homes were built smaller than normal so that the group would be comfortable living in them This caused Sweetwater to be called the midget community for many years Sweetwater became incorporated in 1941 The first mayor of the town was the manager of the group of midgets The town grew to a population of about 500 people by 1959 In 1970 Sweetwater was still a small town Its population was about 3000

During the 1970s Sweetwater began to grow quickly In 1972 Florida International University began teaching students at its campus just south of the town Two large highways were being built in the area One north of the town and the other to the west of it The area also got noticed by the Dade County Hispanic community All of this caused the population of Sweetwater to double The town had the largest growth of all cities in Dade County during the 1970s

The Citys population is currently over 14200 people Ninety three percent of the population is of Hispanic origin

West Palm Beach is a city of Florida in the United States West Palm Beach is the county seat of Palm Beach County Florida In 2007 there were about 99377 people living in West Palm Beach 

The city was founded by Henry Flagler as a community to house the servants working in the two grand hotels on the neighboring island of Palm Beach across Lake Worth The original spelling was Westpalmbeach but it was feared that the 13 letter word would be a bad omen for the new community On November 5 1894 78 people met at the Calaboose and passed the motion to incorporate the Town of West Palm Beach in what was then Dade County This made West Palm Beach the oldest incorporated municipality in the county and in South Florida The town council quickly addressed the building codes and the tents and shanties were replaced by brick brick veneer and stone buildings The city grew rapidly in the 1920s as part of the Florida land boom Many of the citys landmark structures and old neighborhoods were built during this period

Originally Flagler intended for his Florida East Coast Railway to end in West Palm but after the area experienced a deep freeze he chose to extend the railroad to Miami instead

In the 1960s Palm Beach Countys first enclosed shopping mall the Palm Beach Mall and an indoor arena were completed They led to a short revival for the city but crime continued to be a serious problem and by the early 1990s there were not many people living or working in downtown Since the 1990s developments such as CityPlace and renovation of 1920s architecture on Clematis Street have brought people back to downtown for the entertainment and shopping district

George Edward Foreman is an American two time World Heavyweight Boxing Champion and entrepreneur 

He became the oldest man ever to win a major heavyweight title when at 45 he knocked out 26 year old Michael Moorer in the 10th round He is still the oldest person to do that and has been named one of the 25 greatest fighters of all time by Ring Magazine Nicknamed Big George he is now a successful businessman and an ordained Christian minister who has his own church

Foreman has 10 children and each of his five sons is named George George Jr George III George IV George V and George VI They are also known by the nicknames Monk Red Joe Big Wheel and Little George His five daughters are Michi Georgetta Freda George Natalie and Leola

In recent years he has become famous for a line of electric grill products that bear his name The grill products cook the food and allow the fat to drain off into a bowl making the food less fatty 

SIMATIC is the name of an automation system which was developed by the German company Siemens The automation system controls machines used for industrial production This system makes it possible for machines to run automatically Depending on the needed function of the machine you have to upload the right program on your Simatic unit This unit is kept in a control cabinet near the machine

Simatic is similar to a digital computer which can store and run programs The Simatic also has some inputs and outputs The running program on the Simatic controls these inputs and outputs Both are connected by electrical wires with the machine That makes a communication between the Simatic and any machine possible As the case may be the inputs and outputs are set on a High signal or on a Low signal by the program These are different electrical definitions Finally these signals are important if an action in the machine happens or not 

Example for different signals at the output to a motor

Example for different signals at the input coming from a thermometer in the machine

There are basically two ways of communication

In the machine are sensors A sensor gives information about different situations in the machine For example how fast the motor rotates how the temperature is or when the current action is completed All this information is necessary for the program The sensors give out an electrical signal This signal goes by wire on an input of the Simatic unit So the program knows what s going on in the machine This is very important because now the program can do the next right step For example if the temperature of the motor is too high the program have to know it Now the program will switch off the motor

In the machine are actuators They cause a wanted motion action or forming Examples for actuators are a motor a heater or a light If the program says that it s time to switch on the light in the machine the right output of the Simatic unit will be set That means that an electrical signal at the output goes by wire to the machine and switches on the light

The name Simatic is a registered trademark of the company Siemens since 1958 Simatic connects Siemens and Automatic in one word

Siemens developed four different product lines so far

Every automation system needs a program to control a machine To create a program you need a software Siemens created its own software for their products

A Lect is a variety of a language

Some examples of lects

In linguistics a Register is where a person talks differently to different people They may be more polite to people they do not know for example

In linguistics a Stratum or Strate is a language that changes another language or is changed by another language

A substratum is the language which is changed and a superstratum is the language that changes it An adstatrum is where two languages change each other at the same time

Language transfer is where a person uses their knowledge of one language when they learn another one This can help them but it can also confuse them

False friends are two words in different languages or lects that look the same or similar but have different meanings

Code switching is where a person mixes more than one language or lect when they talk

Multialphabetism is where a mix of more than one alphabet is used This can have different reasons

Japanese uses the Roman alphabet as well as kanji hiragana and katakana It is often used to put Japanese words on a computer When Romanized text is used for Japanese words this is called Romaji While it may appear helpful to most foreigners it is not used in everyday Japan and therefore can hinder the process of learning Japanese

Language attrition is where someone forgets all or part of a language

Language death is where a language or lect stops being used as a main language

A Modern language is a language which is spoken today It is the opposite of an extinct language The official languages of countries are modern languages

FreeOTFE is a free open source computer program used to automatically encrypt and decrypt information stored on a hard disk

FreeOTFE was originally written for Microsoft Windows and was later copied to Windows Mobile

It can encrypt information using a large number algorithms including AES Blowfish CAST6 MARS RC6 Serpent and Twofish

Sarah Dean is the developer of FreeOTFE

A natural language is the kind which we use in everyday conversation and writing For example English Hindi Chinese Natural languages are always very flexible and people speak them in slightly different ways

There are some natural languages which are simplified such as Basic English and Esperanto

An artificial language is quite different as it is built for some special purpose They are always very precise and must be used according to pre set rules Symbolic logic mathematics programming languages

Windows Mobile is a compact operating system that comes with basic applications for mobile devices

It is designed to look like desktop versions of Microsoft Windows

An A priori language is a constructed language that made up new words and did not use words from other languages

A Shoot is something in professional wrestling that is completely real and is not scripted In other words broken kayfabe A shoot rarely happens

On the scripted level a Worked shoot is a scripted segment that takes place in a show with elements of reality being exposed such as an off screen incident between wrestlers being used as fuel for an on screen rivalry between them It can also be a segment that fans are meant to believe is a shoot but is not

Biofuels are liquid fuels from plant materials They offer the prospect of oil price moderation But the use of biofuels needs to be sustainable Responsible development of biofuels will help economic prospects in Africa Latin America and Asia 

There are many biofuel options which are available Biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel are currently produced from the products of conventional food crops such as the starch sugar and oil feedstocks from crops that include wheat maize sugar cane palm oil and oilseed rape Any major switch to biofuels from such crops would create a direct competition with their use for food and animal feed and in some parts of the world we are already seeing the economic consequences of such competition

Second generation biofuels are now being produced from the cellulose in dedicated energy crops forestry materials the co products from food production and domestic vegetable waste Advances in the conversion processes will improve the sustainability of biofuels through better efficiencies and reduced environmental impact of producing biofuels from both existing food crops and from cellulosic sources 

Lord Ron Oxburgh suggests that responsible production of biofuels has several trade offs Produced responsibly they are a sustainable energy source that need not divert any land from growing food nor damage the environment they can also help solve the problems of the waste generated by Western society and they can create jobs for the poor where previously were none Produced irresponsibly they at best offer no climate benefit and at worst have detrimental social and environmental consequences In other words biofuels are pretty much like any other product  

According to the Rocky Mountain Institute sound biofuel production practices would not hamper food and fibre production nor cause water or environmental problems and would enhance soil fertility The selection of land on which to grow the feedstocks is a critical component of the ability of biofuels to deliver sustainable solutions A key consideration is the minimization of biofuel competition for prime cropland

Crops like Jatropha used for biodiesel can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops will not grow or would produce only slow growth yields Jatropha cultivation provides benefits for local communities  Cultivation and fruit picking by hand is labour intensive and needs around one person per hectare In parts of rural India and Africa this provides much needed jobs  about 200000 people worldwide now find employment through jatropha Moreover villagers often find that they can grow other crops in the shade of the trees Their communities will avoid importing expensive diesel and there will be some for export too 

Cambodia has no proven fossil fuel reserves and is almost completely dependent on imported diesel fuel for electricity production Consequently Cambodians face an insecure supply and pay some of the highest energy prices in the world The impacts of this are widespread and may hinder economic development 

Biofuels may provide a substitute for diesel fuel that can be manufactured locally for a lower price independent of the international oil price The local production and use of biofuel also offers other benefits such as improved energy security rural development opportunities and environmental benefits The Jatropha curcas species appears to be a particularly suitable source of biofuel as it already grows commonly in Cambodia Local sustainable production of biofuel in Cambodia based on the Jatropha or other sources offers good potential benefits for the investors the economy rural communities and the environment

Sweet sorghum overcomes many of the shortcomings of other biofuel crops With sweet sorghum only the stalks are used for biofuel production while the grain is saved for food or livestock feed It is not in high demand in the global food market and thus has little impact on food prices and food security Sweet sorghum is grown on already farmed drylands that are low in carbon storage capacity so concerns about the clearing of rainforest do not apply Sweet sorghum is easier and cheaper to grow than other biofuel crops in India and does not require irrigation an important consideration in dry areas

Public attitudes and the actions of stakeholders can play a crucial role in realising the potential of biofuels Informed discussion and dialogue based both on the scientific case and an understanding of public and stakeholder views is important 

The Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels is an international initiative which brings together farmers companies governments non governmental organizations and scientists who are interested in the sustainability of biofuels production and distribution During 2008 the Roundtable developed a series of principles and criteria for sustainable biofuels production through meetings teleconferences and online discussions

The Roundtable for Sustainable Biofuels released Version Zero of its proposed standards for sustainable biofuels on August 13 2008 This includes a dozen principles each with several criteria developing the principle further Sustainable Biofuels Consensus 

The Sustainable Biofuels Consensus is an international initiative which calls upon governments the private sector and other stakeholders to take concerted collaborative and coordinated action to ensure the sustainable trade use and production of biofuels In this way biofuels may play a key role in the transformation of the energy sector climate stabilization and resulting worldwide renaissance of rural areas all of which are urgently needed

The Sustainable Biofuels Consensus envisions a landscape that provides food fodder fiber and energy which offers opportunities for rural development that diversifies energy supply restores ecosystems protects biodiversity and sequesters carbon

Biofuels offer the prospect of real market competition and oil price moderation According to the Wall Street Journal crude oil would be trading 15 per cent higher and gasoline would be as much as 25 per cent more expensive if it were not for biofuels A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes

Biofuels have a limited ability to replace fossil fuels and should not be regarded as a silver bullet to deal with transport emissions Biofuels on their own cannot deliver a sustainable transport system and so must be developed as part of an integrated approach which promotes other renewable energy options and energy efficiency as well as moderating the overall demand and need for transport The development of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles public transport and better urban and rural planning all need to be considered

The Montreal Screwjob is the real life screwjob of then WWF superstar Bret Hart The screwjob occurred in a match for the WWF Championship at Survivor Series in 1997 in Montreal Quebec The screwjob happened when Harts opponent Shawn Michaels applied Harts own finishing move the Sharp Shooter and then WWF Referee Earl Hebner called for the bell under Vince McMahons order even though Hart had not submitted As a result Michaels became the WWF Champion McMahon was the one who started the plans for the screwjob when Hart announced he was leaving the WWF for the companies then biggest competitor World Championship Wrestling and refused to lose the title in front of his fellow Canadians to Michaels The original scripted plan was for Hart to win at Survivor Series and surrender the title the next night on Raw McMahon felt he did not need another Alundra Blayze incident so he instituted the screwjob On the January 4 2010 episode of Raw he reconciled with Michaels by shaking his hand and hugging in the ring

Central Florida is the central region of the United States state of Florida on the East Coast The region enjoys a hot but stormy climate with many thunderstorms and hurricanes threatening often

The exact boundary of the area may be in dispute Central Florida tends to be thought of as the area around metropolitan Orlando including Orange Osceola Seminole Lake Brevard and Volusia counties Polk Flagler and Sumter counties are considered by some including the local media to be part of Central Florida Although geographically in the central part of the state usually the west central coast including Hillsborough Pinellas Pasco and Hernando counties is considered the Tampa Bay area or the Suncoast rather than a part of Central Florida This area is known as the I 4 corridor

In 2007 the guessed total population of the Central Florida area was just over 38 million people Central Florida is a mix of deep south and typical Floridian culture This is what makes the area unique

The largest cities in Central Florida are Orlando Palm Bay Lakeland Melbourne Deltona Daytona Beach Kissimmee Altamonte Springs and Sanford 

The region has grown over the last two decades A lack of growth management has led to massive urban sprawl in the area Outdated and unplanned building has led to an overload of vehicle traffic Local governments in dispute with each other over growth have now started taking a more regional approach and several transportation programs

The Incarnation is the Christian belief that Jesus Christ is the God of Israel in a human body The word incarnate comes from Latin and means in the flesh  The incarnation is a basic teaching of Christianity It is based on the New Testament of the Holy Bible The incarnation is the belief that Jesus who is the non created second person of the triune God took on a human body and everything that is human and became both man and God In the Bible its teaching is in the Gospel of John where in chapter 1 verse 14 it says And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us 

In the Incarnation normally defined the divine nature of the Son was joined but not mixed with human nature in one divine Person Jesus Christ who was both truly God and truly man The Incarnation is commemorated and celebrated each year at the Feast of the Incarnation which is better known as the Annunciation

This is center to the traditional Christian faith held by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Catholic Churches the Eastern Orthodox Church the Oriental Orthodox Church the Anglican Communion and most Protestants Other views on the subject have been considered in the past but all were rejected by mainstream Christian bodies

The Eureka Stockade is the name given to a rebellion by gold miners at Ballarat Victoria Australia It took place at sunrise on December 3 1854 The miners refused to pay a licence fee to look for gold The miners said that the money for the licence was a tax and that if they had to pay tax then they should be represented in the parliament Irish miner Peter Lalor became the leader of the miners They built a fort or stockade on a hill above the gold diggings on the Eureka gold lead They were attacked by the British Army More than 30 people were killed

The miners made their own flag which was flown at the Eureka Stockade The flag was torn down during the battle and taken away by one of the soldiers It was given to the Ballarat Art Gallery in the 1890s Pieces of the flag were sometimes given to important visitors to Ballarat It is believed that Queen Elizabeth II has a small piece In the 1973 the flag was restored and put on display at the Art Gallery The display was opened by the Prime Minister of Australia Gough Whitlam The flag has been put on the Victorian Heritage Register and was named an icon by the National Trust in 2006 In August 2010 the Ballarat Art Gallery said that the flag needed further work to keep it safe It will be sent to South Australia to be restored at a cost of more than AU100000 The Gallery will also build a new airtight case to hold the flag when it is fixed

The flag has often been used as a symbol of rebellion Trade unions used the flag in their marches The Prime Minister John Howard banned the flag from being flown on building sites 

In 2008 the Football Federation of Australia tried to stop the flag from being flown by supporters of the soccer team Melbourne Victory They said it was against their rules for teams to use political symbols People with the flag would be made to leave the football ground 

Many nationalist groups have started to use the flag as a symbol It was used during the racial riots at Cronulla New South Wales People are concerned that it will become a symbol of leaving people out and not a symbol of Australian democracy

Sokka is a fictional character and one of the main characters in Nickelodeons animated television series Avatar The Last Airbender The character was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko and voiced by Jack DeSena In the film version The Last Airbender in which is his name is pronounced differently the character is played by Jackson Rathbone

In the show 15 year old Sokka is a warrior of the South Poles Southern Water Tribe a race of people who can control water He along with his younger sister Katara discovers an Airbender named Aang the long lost Avatar and accompanies him on his mission to win the Fire Nation and bring peace to the world

Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko said that Sokka was originally designed to be much more low key but when his comedian voice actor Jack DeSena came in and brought liveliness to his character they began writing towards that strength Much of Sokkas dialogue and actions are derived from improvisations and intentional exaggerations on DeSenas part that the writers chose to include within scripts 

As a result of his design Sokkas character has come to serve as a source of comic relief during the series often a victim of visual slapstick He also is extremely sarcastic

Sokka grew up in his village and trains the warriors of his village Forced to mature quickly when his mother Kya was killed in a Fire Nation raid he cultivated his warrior skills with a militant zeal while his sister Katara did chores and practiced waterbending When Sokka was thirteen his father and the other village men left to help the Earth Kingdom to fight against the Fire Nation leaving him and his sister to look after their tribe with their grandmother Gran Gran As the oldest male left in the South Pole Sokka came to assume a semi leadership role by the time he was sixteen fiercely protecting the village from any possible outside threats while trying to train children to be a new generation of defenders

While on a expedition Katara and Sokka discovered Aang inside an iceberg with Appa After Katara freed him Sokka initially believed that the Aang might be a Fire Navy spy and he eventually grew xenophobic enough to banish him from the village Upon discovering that Aang was the Avatar destined to master all four elements and bring peace to the world Sokka relented realizing that they had a common enemy in the Fire Nation He then set off with Katara and Aang on their journey to find a waterbending master at the North Pole determined to hone his warrior skills by way of fighting Firebenders along the way Fire Nation general Zhao killed Tui causing the moon to turn red and then vanish as during a lunar eclipse thus preventing the waterbenders from using waterbending Princess Yue then becomes the new moon by giving her life energy to the moon spirit thereby restoring the moon in the sky and the abilities of the waterbenders

In Sokkas Master Sokka expresses self doubt and worry that he is not usefull as much to the group as his bender companions are Inspired by his friends encouragement he seeks out a master from whom he could learn the art of the sword Rather than fighting with brute force and flawless technique Sokkas creativity and heterodox approach to things are the cornerstones of his technique and his master notes that in time Sokka will be a superior swordsman As he departs his master gives him a game piece that was previously established as a sign of connection to the secret society known as the Order of the White Lotus

In the two hour series finale Sokka and Katara meet with Kataras Waterbending master Pakku who has now married their grandmother In the battle against Ozai Sokka his girlfriend Suki and Toph destroyed a Fire Nation airship and use it to destroy others of its kind while Aang duels with the Phoenix King Sokka and Toph are separated from Suki and attack another airship but Sokka breaks his leg and strains his arm grabbing hold of Toph who was falling off the ship In a compromised position the pair are attacked by two soldiers whom Sokka defeats at the cost of his sword and boomerang As he and Toph are on the edge of the crashing ship Suki arrives with another airship and saves the two With the battle over the trio reunite with Aang and the vanquished Phoenix King At Zukos coronation Suki is reunited with her fellow Kyoshi Warriors Sokka and Katara are reunited with their father with the rest of the group reunited with their friends In the end Sokka is seen at Irohs tea shop in Ba Sing Se where everyone teases a painted picture he created of the entire team wherein he altered some factual details to make the scene more memorable

In the live action movie The Last Airbender by M Night Shyamalan Sokka is played by Jackson Rathbone His name is pronounced So kah but in the show its name pronounced Sah kah Several important changes to the characters personality were made In the film he is no longer the comic relief nor does he exhibit any inventive abilities or usefulness in battle He rarely shares screen time with Aang the main hero or contibe in any way to the plot M Night Shyamalan has said in an interview that these decisions were made in order to ground the character

Toph Bei Fong is a fictional character in Nickelodeons animated television series Avatar The Last Airbender The character and series were created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko Toph is voiced by Jessie FlowerThough blind Toph actually sees with her feet by sensing movement In book two chapter nineteen Toph learns how to metal bend by bending the earth inside the metal She can also tell if your lying by sensing your heartbeat she can also tell your position if your lying down sitting down or standing up by sensing your blood flow

Structural engineering is a subset of civil engineering dealing with the design and analysis of buildings and large non building structures to withstand both the gravity and wind loads as well as natural disasters Besides it may also cover design of machinery medical equipment vehicles or any other objects where structural functionality or safety are involved Structural engineers must ensure their designs satisfy building codes

Major structural engineering projects go through the following four stages research design testing and construction which are featured with the images below

 FileEPET print outjpg FileMulti Frequency Quieting Building Systemjpg File2009 0709 earthquakejpg File2009 03 03 Pearl River Towerjpg 

Structural engineering came to existence when the humans first started to construct their own structures It became a more defined profession with the emergence of the architecture profession during the industrial revolution in the late 19th Century 

Entry level structural engineers may design individual structural elements of a structure for example beams columns and floors of a building More experienced engineers would be responsible for the structural design and integrity of an entire system such as a building

Structural engineers often specialize in particular fields such as bridge engineering building engineering pipeline engineering industrial structures or special mechanical structures such as vehicles or aircrafts

Lemmus

Synaptomys

Myopus

Lemmings are small rodents usually found in or near the Arctic in tundra biomes

The lemmings and voles are the rats and mice of the Arctic The lemmings have very short tails They live underground in summer Because the top soil freezes in the winter they cannot burrow underground then so they live under the snow during the colder months They eat plants and roots If they find plenty of food they wil have extra large families that year

In a year with plenty of food millions of lemmings will be roaming the tundra The owls and foxes have more food than they can eat They will have extra babies in they years when there are so many lemmings However the tundra does not have enough food for millions of lemmings They rush across the tundra looking for food and are eaten by predators or starve to death

Many lemmings leave to find a new home when they run out of food and space Soon millions of lemmings decide to follow the crowd They go across the Arctic as a huge mass Foxes and owls kill many of them Many others blindly rush along They usually fall off cliffs as they were not watching out or drown in the ocean

The lemmings that are left have enough food and space to survive Then they start to breed and multiply again

Roundhay Park is a large park in the upmarket suburb of Roundhay in North Leeds The park is home to two lakes the Waterloo Lake and the Upper Lake The Park is also home to Roundhay Mansion Roundhay Castle and Tropical World

Roundhay Park was a private hunting ground in the thirteenth century Thomas Nicholson bought the park in 1803 and in 1811 had John Clarke redesign it as a private park At the same time the Roundhay Mansion was built In 1871 the park was bought by Leeds City Council for use by the public The decision to buy the park was not a popular one with many people seeing it as a waste of money because the park was so far away from Leeds City Centre The city grew though in later years through the industrial revolution and the citys wealthy residents built houses close to the park

The main lake Waterloo Lake was built by soldiers after their return from the Napoleonic Wars after the Battle of Waterloo The lake is convert60ftm0lkonabbron deep and convert33acreha0lkonabbron in area It was originally used for boating but now only fishing In the twentieth century the boat house was made into a cafe Until 1900 a steamboat called the Maid of Athens ran on the lake The dam at the south end was once a waterfall

The Upper Lake is the smaller of the two lakes in the park and is set much higher than Waterloo Lake Roundhay Castle is on the hill between the two lakes The Upper Lake has a large fountain in the centre

The park has seen many concerts including Party at the Park a Madonna concert and more recently a Robbie Williams concert

Simple Network Management Protocol is a part of the Internet Protocol Suite SNMP is used in network management systems to monitor status of devices and also spot problems It consists of a set of standards for network management including an Application Layer protocol a database schema and a set of data objects

SNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems which describe the system configuration These variables can then be queried by managing applications

In common SNMP usage there are a number of systems to be managed and one or more systems managing them A software component called an agent runs on each managed system and reports information via SNMP to the managing systems

SNMP agents expose management data on the managed systems as variables But the protocol also allows active management tasks such as modifying and applying a new configuration The managing system can retrieve the information through the GET GETNEXT and GETBULK protocol operations or the agent will send data without being asked using TRAP or INFORM protocol operations Management systems can also send configuration updates or controlling requests through the SET protocol operation to actively manage a system Configuration and control operations are used only when changes are needed to the network The monitoring operations are usually performed regularly

Junglefowl are the four living species of bird from the genus Gallus in the pheasant family which occur in India Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia

These are large birds with colourful male plumage but are nevertheless difficult to see in the dense vegetation they inhabit

The junglefowl are seed eaters but insects are also taken particularly by the young birds

One of the species in this genus the Red Junglefowl is of historical importance as the likely ancestor of the domesticated chicken

Red Junglefowl are the ancestors of all our domestic chickens They were first domesticated in Asia where they are native Some of the less specialized domestics such as some Games and the Brown Leghorns retain color patterns very similar to that of their wild ancestors They are two pounds in size

Red Junglefowl regularly bathe in dust to keep just the right balance of oil in their plumage The dust absorbs extra oil and it subsequently falls off

The Real Time Streaming Protocol developed by the IETF and created in 1998 as RFC 2326 is a protocol for use in streaming media systems which allows a client to remotely control a streaming media server issuing VCR like commands such as play and pause and allowing time based access to files on a server

The sending of streaming data itself is not part of the RTSP protocol Most RTSP servers use the standards based RTP as the transport protocol for the actual audiovideo data The RTSP server from RealNetworks also features RealNetworks proprietary RDT as the transport protocol

A styx

A atropos is usually found in Europe but A styx and A lachesis are found in Asia You can spot them by the skull shaped pattern of markings on the thorax All three species are about the same in size coloration and life cycle

These moths have many unusual features All three species can make a loud squeak if irritated The sound is made by moving air from the pharynx often along with the flashing of the brightly colored abdomen in a further attempt to deter predators All three species are commonly seen raiding beehives of different species of honey bee for honey but A atropos only attacks colonies of the well known Western honey bee Apis mellifera They are able to move about in hives unhurt because they mimic the scent of the bees

Eggs are laid one by one under old leaves of the hostplant and are green or grey blue None of the three species are forced to use a single family of host plant Many of the types of plants used are in the families Solanaceae Verbenaceae Oleaceae Bignoniaceae and others The larvae are strong reaching 120 130 mm with a tail horn that stands out or can be seen easily All three species have three larval color forms usually green brown or yellow Larvae do not move much and will click their mandibles or even bite if threatened When mature they burrow underground and excavate a small chamber where they pupate

This moth was used in the movie The Silence of the Lambs It was also referenced in Im the King of the Castle

In computing the Post Office Protocol version 3 is an application layer Internet standard protocol used by local e mail clients to get e mail from a remote server over a TCPIP connection POP3 and IMAP4 are the two most widely accepted Internet standard protocols for e mail retrieval Almost all modern e mail clients and servers support both

While not yet an official standardized mail protocol a proposal has been outlined for a POP4 specification complete with a working server implementation

The proposed POP4 extension adds basic folder management multipart message support as well as message flag management allowing for a light protocol which supports some popular IMAP features which POP3 currently lacks

No progress has been found in the POP4 specification since 2003

Lysosomes are organelles found in the cytoplasm of a cell Lysosomes work like the digestive system to break down or digest proteins acids carbohydrates and other unwanted materials

Lysosomes work by breaking up larger molecules into smaller molecules Those smaller molecules can then be used again as building blocks for other large molecules mTOR signalling and macroautophagy regulate numerous pathological and physiological processes including cellular responses to altered nutrient levels However the mechanisms regulating mTOR and autophagy remain incompletely understood Lysosomes are dynamic intracellular organelles1 2 intimately involved both in the activation of mTOR complex 1 signalling and in degrading autophagic substrates3 4 5 6 7 8 Here we report that lysosomal positioning coordinates anabolic and catabolic responses with changes in nutrient availability by orchestrating early plasma membrane signalling events mTORC1 signalling and autophagy Activation of mTORC1 by nutrients correlates with its presence on peripheral lysosomes that are physically close to the upstream signalling modules whereas starvation causes perinuclear clustering of lysosomes driven by changes in intracellular pH Lysosomal positioning regulates mTORC1 signalling which in turn influences autophagosome formation Lysosome positioning also influences autophagosomelysosome fusion rates and thus controls autophagic flux by acting at both the initiation and termination stages of the process Our findings provide a physiological role for the dynamic state of lysosomal positioning in cells as a coordinator of mTORC1 signalling with autophagic fluxhttpwwwnaturecomncbjournalv13n4absncb2204html

Acherontia atropos is the most widely known of the three species of Deaths head Hawkmoth

A atropos has a wingspan of 10 to 13 cm The top wings are mainly dark brown or black They are powdered with white There are many black and dark red stripes There is a small white spot in the center of each top wing The bottom wing is yellow or yellow brown There are two black lines near the edge of each wing The head and thorax are dark brown or black They are the same color as the top wings On the thorax there is a dark brown spot that looks like a human skull This is where the moth gets its name However some individuals do not have this spot The abdomen is blackish blue There are is a row of yellow spots on each side of the abdomen

It is found from northern Africa to the Middle East It can be found as far north as southern Great Britain It can also be found on the Canary Islands Madeira and the Azores

A atropos is seen from March to September in its normal range However they will sometimes be seen as early as February and as late as October They have many broods each year

A atropos is able to make a loud cry if it is attacked by predators It can make this sound by pushing air out of its proboscis If this does not scare the predator away it will quickly flash its abdomen showing the yellow spots

A atropos is most active from evening to after midnight It is attracted to lights It will feed on the nectar of Potato Tobacco Sweet William and Orange blossoms

At night A atropos will raid beehives It will only attack Western honey bee beehives A atropos is attacked at the entrance by guard bees However A atropos is immune to the bees venom The moth also can mimic the bees scent A atropos feeds on the honey It will break through the honeycombs with its sharp proboscis

Female A atropos will lay one egg per host plant She will lay them on the underside of the leaves The egg is green or a gray blue color It will turn to a yellowish color just before hatching

The newly hatched caterpillar is yellow green It has a very long black horn on the end of the abdomen After it sheds its skin it becomes more green It has yellow stripes on each side of the body There are many small white and yellow bumps on the body After it sheds its skin a second time the yellow stripes have blue or purple edges on them The horn is yellow green with the bottom part being black After it sheds its skin for a third time the caterpillar becomes more yellow There is a row of black spots along each side of the body The blue or purple edges on the yellow stripes become thicker After it sheds its skin for the last time it becomes even more yellow All of the colors are brighter There are no longer any bumps on the body The horn is now yellow It points downward The horn has many little bumps on it It will reach a length of about 13 cm

Before it turns into a chrysalis the caterpillar will begin to darken It will also cover itself with saliva This makes the caterpillar darken even faster Once this is done it will look for a good place to pupate

The caterpillars do not move very much They will only move to find fresh leaves If a caterpillar is attacked it will make sounds with its mandibles They will also bite very hard if attacked

The caterpillar will pupate 15 to 40 cm deep in the ground The chrysalis is a shiny brown It is 75 to 8 cm long If attacked the chrysalis can move The chrysalis hibernates However A atropos will sometimes hibernate as a caterpillar A atropos does not live through the winter in Europe

Here is a list of host plants used by A atropos

Acherontia styx is a Sphingid moth found in Asia one of the three species of Deaths head Hawkmoth also known as the Bee Robber

Scarlino is a comune in the Province of Grosseto in the Italian region Tuscany located about 100 km southwest of Florence and about 25 km northwest of Grosseto 

Scarlino borders the following municipalities Castiglione della Pescaia Follonica Gavorrano Massa Marittima

Scarlino in the first time was under the control of the Aldobrandeschi family later under the bishops of Roselle and then the Alberti family In the 13th century it was bought again by the Aldobrandeschi but later it passed to Pisa and then the Appiani of Piombino 

Until early 19th century Scarlino was still a part of Principality of Piombino few time later when it became part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany

In biology mimicry is when a species evolves features similar to another Either one or both are protected when a third species cannot tell them apart Often these features are visual one species looks like another but similarities of sound smell and behaviour may also make the fraud seem more real 

Mimicry is related to camouflage and to warning signals in which species manipulate or deceive other species which might do them harm Although mimicry is mainly a defence against predators sometimes predators also use mimicry and fool their prey into feeling safe

Mimicry happens in both animal and plant species The mimic is the species which looks like the model The model may be living or not Whole groups of animals go in for mimicry as a life style such as mantids leaf insects or stick insects Camouflage in which a species looks similar to its surroundings is a form of visual mimicry

There are far more insect mimics than any other class of animal but then there are far more insects than other types of animals Indeed 75 of all animals which have been described and named are insects Many other kinds of animal mimics are known including fish plants and even fungi though less research has been done on these

Mimicry evolves because the species that are better at mimicking survive to produce more offspring than the species that are worse at mimicking The genes of the better mimics become more common in the species Over time mimic species get closer to their models This is the process of evolution by natural selection

Since most higher animals have relatively good eyesight they use it to find what they want Both herbivores and predators use sight to find their food Prey need to avoid being eaten by predators Their best chance is to avoid being seen Usually they need camouflage With camouflage an animal looks like its background and so is more difficult to see This is achieved in various ways 

Both camouflage and mimicry work best when a predator is searching from a distance When the predator gets close to the prey and they are sure to be found some prey switch methods and flee or fight back This behaviour is almost always instinctive In any event whether cryptic or not the preys behaviour must match its mimicry If it looks like a leaf twisting in the wind then it has to twist in the wind Almost all forms of mimicry involve appropriate behaviour to reinforce the visual impression

Not all animals use camouflage because there are situations where it is good to show themselves off One case is the need to find and keep a mate Many male animals have some bright colours during the mating season or change their behaviour and come out into the open Without this they might not succeed in mating Their females on the other hand are usually dowdy and camouflaged This pattern occurs in alnost all animals where the male displays and the female chooses There is at least one good reason the female stays camouflaged The moment she is fertilised she carries the precious cargo the eggs that will form part of the next generation 

Animals that are dangerous or foul to eat usually advertise the fact This is called warning or aposematic colouration It is the exact opposite of camouflage Warning colours are vivid often some of black white red yellow 

Tests show that warning colours definitely do deter predators

Some individual animals will die or receive damage while birds or mammals on the attack learn about the connection between colour and taste However if warning costs less than hiding the animal benefits And the advertising traits such as colours may serve other functions as well The patterns may help mate identification within the species for instance

The fact that some animals are genuinely dangerous or noxious to eat gives the opportunity for mimicry based on warning colouration Mllerian and Batesian mimicry

In Mllerian mimicry some species with warning colouration come to look like each other English naturalist Henry Walter Bates first noticed that some distasteful butterflies resembled one another which he wrote about in 1862 However he did not give a good explanation that was left to German naturalist Fritz Mller in 1878 Mllers explanation was simple Both species benefit from a common pattern They share the cost of predators learning of their foul taste Only one learning experience per predator might well be enough to deter it from eating both species 

The butterflies Bates Wallace and Mller watched and collected were brightly coloured and slow moving They often flew in groups which were highly visible Despite this they were avoided by birds This is typical of aposematic colouration The colouring of some species from the same area was so perfect that even experienced naturalists could not tell them apart on the wing 

Once they were collected and set out on a board so the details could be seen it became clear they were not all of the same species and often not from the same biological families The similar warning colours of hornets wasps and some bees is Mllerian if they live in the same geographical region so that a predator might before learning choose any of them

Tests show that birds do learn what to eat by sampling when they are young All aspects of this situation have been the subject of research Field and experimental work on these ideas continues to this day

In Batesian mimicry the mimic is a sheep in wolfs clothing it looks like something dangerous or which tastes disgusting but in reality it is good to eat As he was exploring the Amazon valley in the 1850s Bates collected butterflies He saw how some harmless butterflies looked like other species which were toxic Birds avoided them so the mimics survived even though they were good food This was the first scientific account of mimicry

Hoverflies often visit flowers to feed on nectar They are harmless insects which often mimic wasps and bees They also fly in a slow erratic fashion rather like wasps and bees Often their mimicry is not perfect and you can easily tell them apart once they have settled However even an imperfect mimic might cause a bird to hesitate and that may save their life

Biologists still do research on Batesian and Mllerian mimicry They study how the models differ in how foul they taste and what happens when the ratio of mimics to models varies Quite often it is only the female which is a mimic the male carries the normal appearance of its genus The females need more protection while the males need to mate A more subtle reason is that it halves the number of mimics and so bolsters the effectiveness of the mimicry Batesian mimicry might damage the warning effect if the frequency of mimics became high because more young birds would taste them and be encouraged to try again The benefit of warning declines if there are more mimics 

This may explain cases such as Papilio dardanus an African swallowtail whose females mimic a number of unpalatable species from the Danaidae survival is higher when each mimetic form is rare relative to its model The advantage is probably greater for the females because males do not show the mimetic patterns sexual selection probably helps to maintain this difference These and other issues have been researched for many years 

With this type of insect the life is split into stages The larva is the growth stage the adult is the reproductive stage The larvae too show camouflage aposematic colour and mimicry It is the larvae that pick up the offensive chemicals from the plants they feed on However larvae do not show differences between male and female because reproduction is not their function 

In tropical countries field research has shown that there are large numbers of species involved in mimicry 54 species of Heliconius are recognised with over 700 named colour forms There are four assemblages of butterflies which include the heliconiines and their mimics These mimicry rings are called tiger red blue and orange for short Members of each ring tend to roost together at night fly to similar habitats and at the same time of year Mimicry rings include both Mllerian and Batesian mimicry

Vavilovian mimicry occurs in plants where a weed comes to look like a crop plant It is named after Nikolai Vavilov a Russian plant breeder who discovered the idea Before herbicides weeds were plucked by hand This has been done for thousands of years The weeds come to look like the crop because the weeders pick those weeds which look most different Vavilovian mimicry is caused by unintentional selection by humans The weeds that survive pass on their genes Gradually all the weeds look more like the crop plant

An example is rye a common Mediterranean species Rye was originally just a weed growing with wheat and barley Weeding made it like the crop Like wheat it came to have larger seeds and more rigid spindles to which the seeds are attached Rye is a tougher plant than wheat it survives in harsher conditions Having become a crop like the wheat rye was able to become a crop plant in harsh areas such as hills and mountains

 Aggressive mimicry 

This type of mimicry is quite common It is the bible metaphor of the wolf in sheeps clothing The mimicry works to entice a victim who is then eaten or otherwise taken advantage of Angler fish insectivorous plants and the cuckoo are all examples All these groups are widespread and there is no doubt that the aggressive mimicry is a successful life style

The next two examples introduce another metaphor that of the siren The Australian katydid Chlorobalius leucoviridis can attract male cicadas by imitating the species specific reply clicks of sexually receptive female cicadas Playback experiments show that C leucoviridis is able to attract males of many cicada species even though cicada mating signals are species specific

Female fireflies of the genus Photuris emit the same light signals that females of other genera use as a mating signal Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics and are subsequently captured and eaten Female signals are based on that received from the male each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species

Luring is not a necessary condition however as the predator may have a significant advantage by not being identified as such They may resemble a mutualistic symbiont or a species of little relevance to the prey

Aggressive mimicry may be used by some parasites as a means of getting to their next host A parasitic trematode lives in the gut of songbirds Their eggs pass out and are then eaten by a snail which lives in moist environments The eggs develop into larvae inside this second host Unlike related species these larvae are brightly coloured and able to pulsate A sac full of spores forces its way into the snails eye stalks and pulsates at high speed This causes the tentacle to enlarge It also affects the hosts behaviour the snail moves towards light which it usually avoids These factors make the sporocysts highly conspicuous and they are soon eaten by a hungry songbird The snail then regenerates its eye stalks and carries on with its life cyclep134

Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin Some allow the cleaner to go inside their mouth to hunt these parasites One species of cleaner the Bluestreak cleaner wrasse shown to the right cleaning a grouper lives in coral reefs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans It is recognized by other fish who allow it to clean them 

Its imposter the mimetic Sabre toothed blenny also lives in the Indian Ocean It not only looks like the wrasse in terms of size and colour but even mimics the cleaners dance After fooling its prey into letting its guard down the blenny then bites it tearing off a piece of its fin before fleeing the scene Fish attacked in this manner soon learn to distinguish mimic from model but because the similarity is close they become much more cautious of the model as well Due to victims ability to discriminate between foe and helper the blennies have evolved close similarity right down to the regional level

A phenomenon sometimes called auto mimicry is when the model belongs to the same species as the mimic An example is the Monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus which feeds on milkweed plants The butterflies store toxins from the plant which they maintain even in their adult forms As the levels of toxin vary depending on diet during the larval stage some Monarchs will be more toxic than others

Less palatable individuals can be thought of as mimics of the more dangerous individuals They carry exactly the same warning colours as the more toxic individuals but their punishment for predators is weaker In species where one sex may be more of a threat than the other if the two sexes look alike one can protect the other Evidence came from a monkey from Gabon which regularly ate male moths of the genus Anaphe but promptly stopped after it tasted a noxious female

Many animals use more than one type of mimicry This is seen in butterflies who usually rest with wings folded upwards They usually have different patterns on the underside of wings The underside may be cryptic while the upper side has some warning pattern Moths which rest with wings horizontal may have different patterns on the rear wings The rear wings are normally covered by the front wings at rest but can be revealed if the moth is disturbed This tactic occurs in moths which are active in daytime or twilight The Scarlet Tiger Moth uses both camouflage and warning colour according to its situation It is a fine example of how behaviour and mimicry work together

The earliest known example of leaf mimicry among insects has been found in the Middle Jurassic of 165 million years ago The insects are lacewings and the leaves are from cycads or related gymnosperms This is interesting because it shows this type of mimicry evolved long before flowering plants arose

A beehive is a structure in which some species of honey bees live and raise their young Natural beehives are made by honey bee colonies while domesticated honey bees are kept in man made beehives in a location known as an apiary The beehives made by people are usually the things referred to by the word beehive

Beehives have hexagonal cells in them packed together This is called a honeycomb

In Greek mythology Circe is a minor goddess of magic Sometimes she is described as a nymph witch enchantress or sorceress In the Odyssey Homer describes her as The loveliest of all immortals living on the island of Aeaea famous for her part in the adventures of Odysseus

In most descriptions Circe was the daughter of Helios the god of the sun and Perse an Oceanid and the sister of Aeetes the keeper of the Golden Fleece Perses and Pasipha the Wife of King Minos and mother of the Minotaur Other accounts make her the daughter of Hecate 

Circe transformed her enemies or those who offended her into animals through the use of magical potions She was known for her knowledge of drugs and herbs 

That Circe also purified the Argonauts for the death of Apsyrtus as told in Argonautica may be an early tradition

Chyjice Village is located in the district Jin Hradec Krlov region On 3 7 In 2006 there were 145 inhabitants It was first documented in 1323

Kenny started his career at Hibernian and made his debut in the 199798 season He was loaned to Stenhousemuir where he scored 10 goals in 11 games He spent four years at the club and was the Scottish Premier League top scorer in season 199900 and received the Scottish Young Player of the Year award in 2000

Kenny signed for Rangers for 2 million in June 2000 He made his debut in a 4 1 win against FBK Kaunas on 26 July during a Champions League match His first goal came on 5 August 2000 during an SPL match away to Kilmarnock scoring the third in a 4 2 win 

Three months later Miller netted five goals during a 7 1 home defeat of St Mirren More goals against Monaco and Aberdeen meant he had ten goals from just fourteen games However until the end of the season Miller only scored once more against Brechin City in the Scottish Cup

In September 2001 he went to Wolverhampton Wanderers on a three month loan scoring two goals in his first two games However during his third match Miller broke his shoulder in a fall During the next two months Wolves and Rangers had talks over his future Wolves finally bought him on a permanent deal at a cost of 3 million Miller had made a total of 38 appearances and scored 11 goals for Rangers

In 200203 Miller was playing most games for Wolves but he had only managed six goals in 19 games However during the final six months of the season he scored 18 goals in his final 24 appearances He equalled a club record of scoring in six consecutive games That helped Wolves gain promotion into the English Premier League

In the summer of the 200506 season the newly promoted Premiership team Sunderland wanted to sign Miller but Wolves rejected their 1m and 12m offers and Miller began the new season as a Wolves player Miller scored 12 goals and ended the season as top scorer  the third time in Wolves last three seasons Miller played more than 190 games for Wolves and scored more than 60 goals during his five years with the club

When Millers contract finished at the end of that season he transferred to Celtic for free under special rules called the Bosman ruling He signed an agreement in January after refusing to sign a new deal at Wolves a month earlier Miller became only the third player since the war to have played for both sides of the Old Firm  following Alfie Conn and Maurice Johnston

Despite being praised by many for his overall performances Miller failed to score in his first nine games for Celtic He finally scored his first goal against Old Firm rivals and former employers Rangers at Celtic Park in September 2006 He then went on to score in Celtics 10 Champions League win against Copenhagen from the penalty spot and scored two in the 30 win over Benfica By scoring in the 200607 Champions League season Miller became the first player to score goals in the Champions League for both Rangers and Celtic However he ended the season with only four league goals He did play in the 2007 Scottish Cup final before being substituted because of an injury Despite hints from the player himself that he would leave to get more first team opportunities Miller vowed to stay at the club and fight for his place at the club Miller scored his first goal in his first appearance of the 200708 season in a 41 victory over Falkirk and added to his collection the following week by scoring against Aberdeen He scored 11 goals in total for the club in 46 appearances

Miller signed a three year deal with newly promoted English Premier League club Derby County on 31 August 2007 for an undisclosed fee thought to be around 3 million but later confirmed by Derby County manager Paul Jewell to be closer to 225m 

Miller started well at his new club scoring in his first two home matches including the winner on his league debut for the Rams against Newcastle United in a 10 win on 17 September 2007 a strike which won the clubs Goal Of The Season award However following this initial success Miller netted just twice in his next 28 league fixtures

With Derby looking like they would be relegated Miller said he would like to move just over 6 months after joining the club  with a return to Rangers his preferred destination though his manager Jewell insisted any move would have to be financially fair for Derby

A fee of 2m was agreed between Rangers and Derby allowing Miller to move back to Ibrox The deal was completed on 13 June Millers return to Ibrox means he is one of only a few players to cross the Old Firm divide twice

Miller made his second debut for the club on 30 July 2008 in a UEFA Champions League qualifier gainst FBK Kaunas He scored in the first Old Firm game of the season on 31 August 2008 He followed this up with a further two goals against former employers Hibernian at Easter Road on 28 September 2008 then adding his sixth goal back in a Rangers shirt at Rugby Park in a 4 0 win over Kilmarnock

Since making his Scotland national team debut in 2001 Miller has remained a player in the Scotland team under the management of Berti Vogts Walter Smith and Alex McLeish

He has scored goals in crucial games against several teams including Germany and Ukraine In 2005 Miller scored in three consecutive internationals with goals against Austria Italy and Norway

The Red crowned Crane also called the Japanese Crane or Manchurian Crane is a large crane and is the second rarest crane in the world In East Asia it is known as a symbol of luck and fidelity At 55 inches high the crane does not make easy prey for all that it stands out in its natural habitat of marshes and swamps When it matures the Red crowned Crane is snow white with a patch of red skin on its head 

In the spring and summer the Red crowned Crane lives in Siberia where their eggs hatch Normally the crane lays 2 eggs with only one surviving Later in the fall it migrates in flocks to Korea Japan China Taiwan and other countries in East Asia to spend the winter All Red crowned Cranes migrate except for a flock that stays in Hokkaido year long 

The crane eats small amphibians aquatic invertebrates insects and plants that grow in marshes and swamps

A natural gas vehicle or NGV is an alternative fuel vehicle that uses natural gas instead of fuel

Natural gas is a mixture It consists mainly of hydrocarbons The main component is methane Natural gas is often found in the ground together with petroleum

The main difficulty in the use of natural gas is transportation Natural gas pipelines are economical but are impractical across oceans Liquefied natural gas tankers are also used

Compressed natural gas is stored in containers at high pressure Liquefied natural gas is stored at temperatures as low as  260F At these temperature conditions natural gas is in a liquid state

Natural gas is used for the production of electricity it is also often used because of ecological aspects and last but not least for the fuel for vehicles 

tienne Lenoir built 1862 the first gas engine before there have been fuel and diesel engines Over the years gas was used in many different machines so the technology improved also From the 1950s the automobile industry focused more on fuel technology than on gas technology There have only been single cars with natural gas technology and few gas stations which offered natural gas Because of climate and environment the role of natural gas became more and more important

Worldwide existing about 57 million natural gas vehicles

Europe

The French automobile producer Citroen is cooperating with a French gas supplier and wants to offer a compressor which is connected to the private gas connection at home so that everyone can refuel his car at homeThe price for the compressor will be about 500 There will be also a tax reduction for people who have bought a new NGV And the business group carrefour wants to install natural gas stations

In London and surroundings NGVs are free from paying the city toll Owners of NGVs have to pay less motor vehicle tax

Until 2011 MAN will deliver 135 busses with natural gas engines for the municipal use of the city Den Haag

Asia

The Turkish capital Ankara will increase their use of natural gas vehicles about 500

In India has already started a development programme to reduce pollution

The number of NGVs increases very fast in Pakistan Meanwhile there are driving about 14 million cars

In Thailand the government is planning a switch from fuel gas stations to natural gas stations and to develop the NGVs

America

In Brasilia the police of Rio de Janeiro were equipped with 632 natural gas vehicles

The use of NGV in the USA makes it possible to maintain under the Ultra Low Emission Vehicle Standards

There are two variants of NG technology either the bivalent version that means that the vehicle can drive with fuel and natural gas or the monovalent version this vehicle can only drive with natural gas In principle the natural gas engine works like a otto engine the only significant difference is that this engine needs a natural gas air mix instead of fuel air mix

A conversion is possible with each car

The automobile industry will offer a new natural gas technology with turbo  Turbo natural gas

The advantages of natural gas are the lower price in comparison with fuel and the lower tax rate

Since January 2008 there are 771 natural gas stations in Germany The supply network will expand constantlyThe EON Gas Mobil GmbH wants to install over 150 natural gas stations close to the freeways

The natural gas technology was and is still very popular Because of the current gas conflict in Russia natural gas became less popularHowever natural gas is a finite resource The prices for gas will increase in the next years so there will be needed new technologies in the future

A serial number is a unique number used for identification Serial numbers are made in such a way that they change by a fixed discrete integer value each time a new serial number is needed Most people refer to any identifier that has numbers and letters in it as a serial number and that can be used to pick a certain item of a large number of items Not every numerical identifier is a serial number identifying numbers which are not serial numbers are sometimes called nominal numbers

Sequence numbers are almost always non negative and typically start at zero or one 

Serial numbers can be very useful for quality control That way if there is a problem with a certain batch of products the serial number of one defective item can tell which items are affected by the problem Serial numbers can also be used against stealing or imitating products because it is possible to keep track of which serial numbers have been used Stolen goods or those with problems can be identified more easily

Many computer programs come with serial numbers often called Compact Disc keys and the installers often require the user to enter a valid serial number to continue These numbers are verified using a certain algorithm to avoid usage of counterfeit keys 

Serial numbers also help track down counterfeit currency because in some countries each banknote has a unique serial number 

The International Standard Serial Number or ISSN can be seen on magazines and other periodicals It is the similar to the International Standard Book Number for books It is serially assigned but takes its name from the library science use of serial to mean a periodical like a newspaper

Certificates and Certificate Authorities are necessary for widespread use of cryptography These depend on applying mathematically rigorous serial numbers and serial number arithmetic 

The term serial number is also used in military formations as an alternative to the expression service numberFactThe linked article suggests that service numbers apply to peopledateJanuary 2009 In air forces the serial number is used to identify a specific aircraft It is usually painted on both sides of the aircraft most often in the tail area although in some cases the serial is painted on the side of the aircrafts finrudder Because of this the serial number is sometimes called a tail number

In the case of the UK Royal Air Force the Serial takes the form of two letters followed by three numbers eg BT308the prototype Avro Lancaster or XS903an English Electric Lightning F6 at one time based at RAF Binbrook During the Second World War RAF aircraft carrying secret equipment or that were in themselves secret had G added to the end of the serial the G signifying Guard denoting that the aircraft was to have an armed guard at all times while on the ground eg LZ548Gthe prototype de Havilland Vampire jet fighter or ML926Ga de Havilland Mosquito XVI experimentally fitted with H2S radar Prior to this two letter three number scheme the RAF and preceding Royal Flying Corps utilised a serial consisting of a letter followed by four figures eg D8096  a Bristol F2 Fighter currently owned by the Shuttleworth Collection or K5054  the prototype Supermarine Spitfire The serial number follows the aircraft throughout its period of service

Serial numbers are often used in network protocols However most sequence numbers in computer protocols are limited to a fixed number of bits and will wrap around after a sufficiently many numbers have been allocated Thus recently allocated serial numbers may duplicate very old serial numbers but not other recently allocated serial numbers To avoid ambiguity with these non unique numbers RFC 1982 Serial Number Arithmetic defines special rules for calculations involving these kinds of serial numbers

Lollipop sequence number spaces are a more recent and sophisticated scheme for dealing with finite sized sequence numbers in protocols

They have a flat type of body and only a small dorsal pattern Adults can grow to be 22 to 28 cm and have a leg span of 7 to 12 cm Some have colors of brown white and black

Females have a larger abdomen than males but males have longer and thinner legs with a slim body Both have a wide yellow to cream clypeus band around the rest of the carapace The female also has a strong body and often carries a pillow like egg sac under her

Brown huntsman spiders do not use spider webs to feed on prey These spiders are known to hunt by waiting and making no noise above their prey and then rush forward when their prey get close They are fast agile and can move through tight spaces They feed at night

If you let them into your home they will eat unwanted bugs and insects like cockroaches and silverfish

In anatomy the dorsum is the upper side of animals that can run fly or swim in a forwards and backwards direction and the back side of animals that walk upright In vertebrates the dorsum contains the backbone The term dorsal means the parts that are either located toward or grow off that side of an animal The opposite side of the animal is described with the terms ventrum and ventral

In humans the top of the foot is said to be dorsal

Examples of dorsal are the dorsal fin of fish dorsal root ganglion dorsal root dorsal nerve dorsum sellae dorsal arch dorsalis pedis artery dorsal ramus dorsal scales of snakes dorsal respiratory group dorsal venous arch and dorsiflexion among others

The clypeus is one of the hard parts that makes up the face of an insect The clypeus is often well defined by grooves along its horizontal and vertical margins and is most commonly rectangular in overall shape

A carapace is a dorsal section of an exoskeleton or shell in a number of animal groups

Bookworm is a popular generalization for any insect which supposedly bores through books

This behaviour is uncommon Both the larvae of the death watch beetle and the common furniture beetle will tunnel through wood and if paper is nearby they will pass into that

A major book feeding insect is the booklouse A tiny soft bodied wingless psocoptera The insect actually feeds on molds and other organic matter found in ill maintained works but they will also attack bindings and other parts It is also not a true louse

Many other insects like the silverfish or cockroach will consume these molds including degraded paper or the starch based binding pastes warmth and moisture or high humidity are needed so damage is more common in the tropics Modern glues and paper are less attractive to insects

Tineola bisselliella and Hofmannophila pseudospretella will attack cloth bindings Leather bound books attract various consumers such as Dermestes lardarius and the larvae of Attagenus unicolor and Stegobium paniceum

The bookworm moth and its larvae are not interested in books The larvae are pests for cotton or tobacco growers as the cotton bollworm or tobacco budworm

The TIME service is an Internet protocol defined in RFC 868 Its purpose is to provide a site independent machine readable date and time

TIME can operate over either TCP or UDP When operating over TCP a host connects to a server that supports the TIME protocol on TCP port 37 The server then sends the time as a 32 bit unsigned binary number in network byte order representing a number of seconds since 0000 1 January 1900 GMT and closes the connection The host receives the time and closes the connection

When operating over UDP the client sends a datagram to UDP port 37 The server responds with a single datagram of length 4 containing the time There is no connection setup or teardown

Tropical Depression Sixteen was the sixteenth and weakest tropical cyclone of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season Sixteen formed from a strong tropical disturbance off the eastern shores of Nicaragua on October 13 The disturbance quickly turned into a tropical depression the next day while being very close to the coastline Because of its close distance towards land the depression was not able to form strong convection which was the reason why it did not become stronger Once off the northern shores of Honduras the depression became disorganized but was able to strengthen a little bit reaching its peak intensity with winds of 35 mph on the afternoon of October 15 The depression then moved onshore and quickly died out by the next morning

A lot of rainfall from the depression started deadly flooding in Central America which left at least 75 people dead and forcing 100000 people to move and being responsible for 150 million in damage

On the afternoon of October 13 a large area of low pressure formed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea about 160 mi east southeast of Puerto Cabezas Nicaragua The low was found in a place that was good for development and a tropical cyclone formation alert was given out soon after the low formed The low slowly became better organized and was thought to have turned into a tropical depression the next morning while it was 50 mi northeast of the NicaraguaHonduras border The depression was predicted to move across from the coastline and later move to the west when it was north of Honduras and by then make landfall in Belize as a tropical storm with winds of 65 mph on October 18 

But the convection that was associated with the depression went away and the whole structure of the storm started to get worse The depression stayed disorganized during the morning in spite of curved banding traits forming they stayed far from the center of circulation In the late afternoon the depression mooved onto the northern coastline of Honduras with winds still at 30 mph Even though being over land and still being disorganized the depression became a little bit more strong enough to reach its peak intensity of 35 mph on the afternoon of October 15 This happened because of a mistake of a QuikSCAT satellite pass a ship with the code H3VR reporting 38 mph sustained winds and a buoy report However the winds were actually though to have been weaker than what was said because of the ridge of high pressure that was over the southern United States The final advisory on the depression was given out the next morning as it turned back into a remnant low

The National Hurricane Center gave out a lot of tropical storm watches while the storm was still alive while in Costa Rica a red alert warning was put into effect across much of the country and more than 100000 people were told to move to safer places Because the depression never became a tropical storm tropical storm conditions were not felt in the watch areas 

Heavy rains from the depressions remnant low left at least 16 people dead and six missing and forced 100000 other people from their homes across Central America The depression destroyed bridges flooded villages and blocked roads Total damage is thought to be at about 150 million

A high pressure area is an area where the atmospheric pressure is greater than the rest of the atmosphere

A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert is a notice given out by the US Navy run Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Honolulu Hawaii or the Naval Maritime Forecast Center in Norfolk Virginia warning of the possibility of a tropical cyclone forming from a tropical disturbance that has been watched carefully

90377 Sedna is a dwarf planet and a trans Neptunian object It was discovered on November 14 2003 by Mike Brown Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz Around 1250 1800 km in diameter Sedna takes roughly 10500 years to orbit the Sun It is one of the most distant known objects in the Solar System Therefore Sednas surface temperature never rises above 240C NASA is not planning any missions to explore Sedna 

No pictures can be taken of Sedna because very little light from the Sun reaches it For this reason Sedna is known as Cobian meaning shadows in Ancient Greek Due to its orbit the chances of Sedna being found were 0017 Hypothetically 40 120 more objects this size should exist without our knowledge

Boa constrictor is a non venomous Boa species The snake can be found in Central and South America and on some islands in the Caribbean The common name is the same as the scientific name which is unusual The color pattern of its skin can vary considerably Boa constrictors grow to a large size Currently there are ten subspecies including the one that gives the name

The size adult animals reach varies among subspecies The largest animals have been found in Northern south America Two animals from Suriname are currently the largest on record One reached 411cm the other 427cm Such sizes are rare boas reaching 3m are considered large There is a report of a boa reaching 56m in Trinidad but it is believed that snake was an anacondaEunectes murinus taken for a boa 

Boas can use their tail to grasp things This is known as prehensility Boas do not have organs that react to warmth around the mouth 

Boas have a color pattern that is brownish and becomes brick red around the tail Dorsally the ground color is overlaid with a series of large tan colored saddles that become lighter towards the tail Here the saddles break up into half rings of a pale cream color in vivid contrast with the red

Though all boids are constrictors only this species is properly referred to as boa constrictor a rare instance of an animal having the same common and scientific binomial name

All subspecies are referred to as boa constrictors while the nominate subspecies B c constrictor is often referred to specifically as the red tailed boa

B c constrictor is also called the common boa

Other common names include jibia and macajuel

Found from northern Mexico through Central America to South America north of 35S Colombia Ecuador Peru Venezuela Guyana Suriname French Guiana Brazil Bolivia Uruguay and Argentina Also in the Lesser Antilles on San Andrs Providencia and many other islands along the coasts of Mexico and Central and South America The type locality given is Indiis  a mistake according to Peters and Orejas Miranda

Flourishes in a wide variety of environmental conditions from tropical rainforests to arid country

Small individuals may climb into trees and shrubs to forage but they become mostly terrestrial as they become older and heavier It is said that specimens from Central America are more irascible hissing loudly and striking repeatedly when disturbed while those from South America tame down more readily

Prey includes a wide variety of mammals and birds Their diet mostly consists of rodents but larger lizards and mammals as big as ocelots are also reported to have been consumed

Ovoviviparous females give birth to live young that average 15 20 inches in length

This species does well in captivity usually becoming quite tame It is a common sight in zoos Captive longevity is 20 to 30 years with rare accounts of over 40 years making them a long term commitment as a pet Proper animal husbandry is the most significant factor in captive lifespan Though still exported from their native South America in significant numbers it is widely bred in captivity

In human anatomy the appendix is a blind ended tube connected to the cecum 

The caecum is a pouch like structure of the colon The appendix is near the junction of the small intestine and the large intestine The term vermiform comes from Latin and means worm like in appearance

The appendix has no function in humans but it can cause diseases In us it is a vestigial organ

Darwin suggested that the appendix was perhaps used to digest leaves as primates Over time humans have eaten fewer vegetables and have evolved Over thousands of years this organ has become smaller to make room for the stomach It is a vestigial organ which has degraded to nearly nothing in the course of evolution

herbivorous mammals such as the Koala have large appendices and usually other adaptations as well Cellulose from plant cell walls is hard to break down The cecum of the koala is attached to the juncture of the small and large intestines like in humans  and is very long This enables it to host bacteria specific for cellulose breakdown

Early mans ancestor may have also relied upon this system and lived on a diet rich in foliage As man began to eat foods easier to digest they became less reliant on cellulose rich plants for energy The cecum became less necessary for digestion and mutations that previously had been deleterious were no longer selected against These alleles became more frequent and the cecum continued to shrink After thousands of years the once necessary cecum has degraded to what we see today the appendix 

Evolutionary theorists have suggested that natural selection selects for larger appendices because smaller and thinner appendices would be more susceptible to inflammation and disease

Candiru candir are parasitic freshwater catfish and a member of the Trichomycteridae family They can be found in the Amazon River and to the people who live there they are the most feared fish in its waters even over the piranha They are eel shaped and translucent making them very difficult to see in the water Some species have been known to grow to a size of 6 inches in length

The area that has the most of these fish is at the section between the Amazon River and the Rio Negro near Brazils inland city of Manaus

Candiru are parasites Their ability to detect respiratory currents in the water allows them to swim into the gill openings of other aquatic species where they feed on their preys blood

While the members of the subfamily Vandelliinae feed on blood members of Stegophilinae may feed on scales mucus or carrion

To hunt for its prey the Candir lies at the bottom of the river testing and sniffing the water for certain chemicals such as urea and ammonia from the gills of other fish Once they have found a fish nearby they rush with a burst of speed to the gill cavity and attaches itself with its spines Then it begins to gnaw a hole towards a major blood vessel and stuffs itself for no more than a few minutes which usually causes the victim to die It will then release itself and sink back to the river bed in order to digest its food and wait for its next meal 

This fish is also known to attack humans and animals and swim into an open body part like the vagina anus or even the penis going deep into the urethra

The fish finds human targets when people urinate near the fish

The slide rule also known as a slipstick is a mechanical analog computer The slide rule is used primarily for multiplication and division and also for scientific functions such as roots logarithms and trigonometry but does not generally perform addition or subtraction

There are many different styles of slide rules Generally they are either have a linear form or that of a circle They have a standardised set of markings These scales are used for mathematical computations Some slide rules have been made for specialised fields of application for example aviation or finance Such slide rules have special scales which are useful in the particular field of application in addition to the common ones 

William Oughtred and others developed the slide rule in the 1600s The slide rule is based on the work on logarithms by John Napier Before electronic calculators were developed slide rules were the tool used most often in science and engineering The use of slide rules continued to grow through the 1950s and 1960s even as digital computing devices were gradually introduced but around 1974 the electronic scientific calculator made the slide rule largely obsolete and most suppliers exited the business

In its most basic form the slide rule uses two logarithmic scales to allow rapid multiplication and division of numbers These common operations can be time consuming and error prone when done on paper More complex slide rules allow other calculations such as square roots exponentials logarithms and trigonometric functions

Mathematical calculations are done by aligning a mark on the sliding central strip with one on one of the fixes strips The relative position of other marks can then be observed Numbers aligned with the marks give the approximate value of the product quotient or other calculated result

The user determines the location of the decimal point in the result based on mental estimation Scientific notation is used to track the decimal point in more formal calculations Addition and subtraction steps in a calculation are generally done mentally or on paper not on the slide rule

Most slide rules have three linear strips of the same length The strips are aligned in parallel and interlocked so that the central strip can be moved lengthwise relative to the other two The outer two strips are fixed so that their relative positions do not change 

Some slide rules have scales on both sides of the rule and slide strip others on one side of the outer strips and both sides of the slide strip still others on one side only A sliding cursor with a vertical alignment line is used to find corresponding points on scales that are not next to each other or in duplex models are on the other side of the rule The cursor can also record an intermediate result on any of the scales

Operations may go off the scale for example the diagram above shows that the slide rule has not positioned the 7 on the upper scale above any number on the lower scale so it does not give any answer for 27 In such cases the user may slide the upper scale to the left until its right index aligns with the 2 effectively multiplying by 02 instead of by 2 as in the illustration below

Here the user of the slide rule must remember to adjust the decimal point appropriately to correct the final answer We wanted to find 27 but instead we calculated 02714 So the true answer is not 14 but 14 Resetting the slide is not the only way to handle multiplications that would result in off scale results such as 27 some other methods are 

Method 1 is easy to understand but entails a loss of precision Method 3 has the advantage that it only involves two scales

The illustration below demonstrates the computation of 552 The 2 on the top scale is placed over the 55 on the bottom scale The 1 on the top scale lies above the quotient 275 There is more than one method for doing division but the method presented here has the advantage that the final result cannot be off scale because one has a choice of using the 1 at either end

In addition to the logarithmic scales some slide rules have other mathematical functions encoded on other auxiliary scales The most popular were trigonometric usually sine and tangent common logarithm natural logarithm and exponential scales Some rules include a Pythagorean scale to figure sides of triangles and a scale to figure circles Others feature scales for calculating hyperbolic functions On linear rules the scales and their labeling are highly standardized with variation usually occurring only in terms of which scales are included and in what order

Many slide rules have S T and ST scales marked with degrees and minutes So called decitrig models use decimal fractions of degrees instead

Base 10 logarithms and exponentials are found using the L scale which is linear Some slide rules have a Ln scale which is for base e

The Ln scale was invented by an 11th grade student Stephen B Cohen in 1958 The original intent was to allow the user to select an exponent x on the Ln scale and read ex on the C scale and ex on the CI scale Pickett Inc was given exclusive rights to the scale Later the inventor created a set of marks on the Ln scale to extend the range beyond the 23 limit but Pickett never incorporated these marks on any of its slide rulesFactdateJune 2008

Slide rules are not typically used for addition and subtraction but it is nevertheless possible to do so using two different techniques

This method is similar to the additionsubtraction technique used for high speed electronic circuits with the logarithmic number system in specialized computer applications like the Gravity Pipe supercomputer and hidden Markov models

The second method uses a sliding linear L scale available on some models Addition and subtraction are performed by sliding the cursor left or right then returning the slide to 0 to read the result

The length of the slide rule is quoted in terms of the nominal length of the scales Scales on the most common 10 inch models are actually 25 cm in length as they were made to metric standards though some rules offer slightly extended scales to simplify manipulation when a result overflowed Pocket rules are typically 5 inches Models a couple of meters long were sold to be hung in classrooms for teaching purposes 

Typically the divisions mark a scale to a precision of two significant figures and the user estimates the third figure Some high end slide rules have magnifying cursors that make the markings easier to see Such cursors can effectively double the accuracy of readings permitting a 10 inch slide rule to serve as well as a 20 inch

Various other conveniences have been developed Trigonometric scales are sometimes dual labeled in black and red with complementary angles the so called Darmstadt style Duplex slide rules often duplicate some of the scales on the back Scales are often split to get higher accuracy

Specialized slide rules were invented for various forms of engineering business and banking These often had common calculations directly expressed as special scales for example loan calculations optimal purchase quantities or particular engineering equations For example the Fisher Controls company distributed a customized slide rule adapted to solving the equations used for selecting the proper size of industrial flow control valvesFactdateJune 2008

Circular slide rules come in two basic types one with two cursors and another with a movable disk and a single cursor The dual cursor versions perform multiplication and division by maintaining a fixed angle between the cursors as they are rotated around the dial The single cursor version operates more like the standard slide rule through the appropriate alignment of the scales

The basic advantage of a circular slide rule is that the longest dimension of the tool was reduced by a factor of about 3 For example a 10 cm circular would have a maximum precision equal to a 30 cm ordinary slide rule Circular slide rules also eliminate off scale calculations because the scales were designed to wrap around they never have to be re oriented when results are near 10the rule is always on scale However for non cyclical non spiral scales such as S T and LLs the scale length is shortened to make room for end margins

Circular slide rules are mechanically more rugged and smoother moving but their scale alignment precision is sensitive to the centering of a central pivot a minute 01 mm off centre of the pivot can result in a 02 mm worst case alignment error The pivot however does prevent scratching of the face and cursors  The highest accuracy scales are placed on the outer rings Rather than split scales high end circular rules use spiral scales for more complex operations like log of log scales One eight inch premium circular rule had a 50 inch spiral log log scale 

The main disadvantages of circular slide rules are the difficulty in locating figures along a rotating disc and limited number of scales Another drawback of circular slide rules is that less important scales are closer to the center and have lower precisions Most students learned slide rule use on the linear slide rules and did not find reason to switch

One slide rule remaining in daily use around the world is the E6B This is a circular slide rule first created in the 1930s for aircraft pilots to help with dead reckoning With the aid of scales printed on the frame it also helps with such miscellaneous tasks as converting time distance speed and temperature values compass errors and calculating fuel use The so called prayer wheel is still available in flight shops and remains widely used While GPS has reduced the use of dead reckoning for aerial navigation and handheld calculators have taken over many of its functions the E6B remains widely used as a primary or backup device and the majority of flight schools demand that their students have some degree of its mastery

In 1952 Swiss watch company Breitling introduced a pilots wristwatch with an integrated circular slide rule specialized for flight calculations the Breitling Navitimer The Navitimer circular rule referred to by Breitling as a navigation computer featured airspeed ratetime of climbdescent flight time distance and fuel consumption functions as well as kilometernautical mile and gallonliter fuel amount conversion functions

Traditionally slide rules were made out of hard wood such as mahogany or boxwood with cursors of glass and metal At least one high precision instrument was made of steel

In 1895 a Japanese firm Hemmi started to make slide rules from bamboo which had the advantages of being dimensionally stable strong and naturally self lubricating These bamboo slide rules were introduced in Sweden in September 1933 and probably only a little earlier in Germany Scales were made of celluloid or plastic Later slide rules were made of plastic or aluminum painted with plastic Later cursors were acrylics or polycarbonates sliding on Teflon bearings

All premium slide rules had numbers and scales engraved and then filled with paint or other resin Painted or imprinted slide rules were viewed as inferior because the markings could wear off Nevertheless Pickett probably Americas most successful slide rule company made all printed scales Premium slide rules included clever catches so the rule would not fall apart by accident and bumpers to protect the scales and cursor from rubbing on tabletops The recommended cleaning method for engraved markings is to scrub lightly with steel wool For painted slide rules and the faint of heart use diluted commercial window cleaning fluid and a soft cloth

The slide rule was invented around 16201630 shortly after John Napiers publication of the concept of the logarithm Edmund Gunter of Oxford developed a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale which with additional measuring tools could be used to multiply and divide The first description of this scale was published in Paris in 1624 by Edmund Wingate an English mathematician in a book entitled Lusage de la reigle de proportion en larithmetique geometrie The book contains a double scale on one side of which is a logarithmic scale and on the other a tabular scale In 1630 William Oughtred of Cambridge invented a circular slide rule and in 1632 he combined two Gunter rules held together with the hands to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule Like his contemporary at Cambridge Isaac Newton Oughtred taught his ideas privately to his students but delayed in publishing them and like Newton he became involved in a vitriolic controversy over priority with his one time student Richard Delamain and the prior claims of Wingate Oughtreds ideas were only made public in publications of his student William Forster in 1632 and 1653

In 1677 Henry Coggeshall created a two foot folding rule for timber measure called the Coggeshall slide rule His design and uses for the tool gave the slide rule purpose outside of mathematical inquiry

In 1722 Warner introduced the two and three decade scales and in 1755 Everard included an inverted scale a slide rule containing all of these scales is usually known as a polyphase rule

In 1815 Peter Roget invented the log log slide rule which included a scale displaying the logarithm of the logarithm This allowed the user to directly perform calculations involving roots and exponents This was especially useful for fractional powers

The more modern form was created in 1859 by French artillery lieutenant Amde Mannheim who was fortunate in having his rule made by a firm of national reputation and in having it adopted by the French Artillery It was around that time as engineering became a recognized professional activity that slide rules came into wide use in Europe They did not become common in the United States until 1881 when Edwin Thacher introduced a cylindrical rule there The duplex rule was invented by William Cox in 1891 and was produced by Keuffel and Esser Co of New York

Astronomical work also required fine computations and in 19th century Germany a steel slide rule about 2 meters long was used at one observatory It had a microscope attached giving it accuracy to six decimal places

In World War II bombardiers and navigators who required quick calculations often used specialized slide rules One office of the US Navy actually designed a generic slide rule chassis with an aluminum body and plastic cursor into which celluloid cards could be placed for special calculations The process was invented to calculate range fuel use and altitude for aircraft and then adapted to many other purposes

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s the slide rule was the symbol of the engineers professionFactdateAugust 2008 German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun brought two 1930s vintage Nestler slide rules with him when he moved to the US after World War II to work on the American space program Throughout his life he never used any other pocket calculating devices slide rules served him perfectly well for making quick estimates of rocket design parameters and other figures Aluminum Pickett brand slide rules were carried on five Apollo space missions including to the moon according to advertising on Picketts N600 slide rule boxes 

Some engineering students and engineers carried ten inch slide rules in belt holsters and even into the mid 1970s this was a common sight on campuses Students also might keep a ten or twenty inch rule for precision work at home or the office while carrying a five inch pocket slide rule around with them

In 2004 education researchers David B Sher and Dean C Nataro conceived a new type of slide rule based on prosthaphaeresis an algorithm for rapidly computing products that predates logarithms There has been little practical interest in constructing one beyond the initial prototype however 

The importance of the slide rule began to diminish as electronic computers a new but very scarce resource in the 1950s became widely available to technical workers during the 1960s The introduction of Fortran in 1957 made computers practical for solving modest size mathematical problems IBM introduced a series of more affordable computers the IBM 650 IBM 1620 IBM 1130 addressed to the science and engineering market John Kemenys BASIC programming language made it easy for students to use computers The DEC PDP 8 minicomputer was introduced in 1965 

Computers also changed the nature of calculation With slide rules there was a great emphasis on working the algebra to get expressions into the most computable form Users of slide rules would simply approximate or drop small terms to simplify the calculation Fortran allowed complicated formulas to be typed in from textbooks without the effort of reformulation Numerical integration was often easier than trying to find closed form solutions for difficult problems The young engineer asking for computer time to solve a problem that could have been done by a few swipes on the slide rule became a humorous clich Many computer centers had a framed slide rule hung on a wall with the note In case of emergency break glass

Another step toward the replacement of slide rules with electronics was the development of electronic calculators for scientific and engineering use The first included the Wang Laboratories LOCI 2 introduced in 1965 which used logarithms for multiplication and division and the Hewlett Packard HP 9100 introduced in 1968 The HP 9100 had trigonometric functions in addition to exponentials and logarithms It used the CORDIC algorithm which allows for calculation of trigonometric functions using only shift and add operations This method facilitated the development of ever smaller scientific calculators 

The last nail in the coffin for the slide rule was the launch of pocket sized scientific calculators of which the 1972 Hewlett Packard HP 35 was the first Such calculators became known as slide rule calculators since they could perform most or all of the functions on a slide rule At several hundred dollars even this was considered expensive for most students While professional slide rules could also be quite expensive drug stores often sold basic plastic models for under 20 USD But by 1975 basic four function electronic calculators could be purchased for under 50 By 1976 the TI 30 offered a scientific calculator for under 25 After this time the market for slide rules dried up quickly as small scientific calculators became affordable

One advantage of using a slide rule together with an electronic calculator is that an important calculation can be checked by doing it on both because the two instruments are so different there is little chance of making the same mistake twice

Urea is an organic compound It was first found in urine in 1773 by the French chemist Jean Rouelle It is also called Carbamide and its chemical names are Carbonyl Diamide and Diaminomethanal

In humans it is a normal component of blood and many body tissues It is produced in the liver where ammonia a very toxic substance is changed into urea which has a very low toxicity so low in fact that it is many times less toxic than table salt Most of the urea produced in this way is not needed by the body and is removed from the blood in the kidneys and taken out of the body in urine

Mucus or slime is a slippery liquid It is made by many living things as a kind of biological lubricant It plays the role in living things which oil plays in machines 

Mucus is mainly composed of polysaccharides which are long chain carbohydrates These molecules are stiff when dry and sticky and slippery when wet They are present in all types of organisms from bacteria to man 

In vertebrates mucus is made by covering mucous membranes Mucus may have sickness preventing enzymes and immunoglobulins Mucus protects epithelial cells in the respiratory gastrointestinal urogenital visual and auditory systems in mammals the epidermis in amphibians and the gills in fish Snails slugs hagfish and certain invertebrates also produce external mucus which in addition to serving a protective function can facilitate movement and play a role in communication 

The Luna Moth is a species of moth It belongs in the family Saturniidae The Luna Moth is thought to be North Americas most beautiful insect

The Luna Moth has a wingspan of 75 to 105 cm The wings are lime green The bottom wings have long tails There is a clear spot on each wing There is a reddish brown border on the top edge of the top wing Some individuals have pinkish borders on the outer edge of both wings Other individuals have yellowish borders instead Adult Luna Moths do not have any mouths parts and cannot eat They live by the fat they stored up at the larval stage Because of this they only live for about one week

The Luna Moth is found in North America It is found from Nova Scotia west to North Dakota south to Texas and east to Florida

The Luna Moth is found in habitats such as woodlands and forests

The Luna Moth is seen from May to July in the northern part of its range It is seen from March to September in the southern part of its range

The Luna Moths eggs are brown The caterpillar is green It has bright red spots on its body There are two yellow stripes that run down each side of the body The caterpillar will grow to 65 cm long The Luna Moth caterpillar is similar to the Polyphemus Moth caterpillar The Polyphemus Moth caterpillar does not have the yellow stripes on its body The Luna Moths cocoon is made of dead leaves on the ground It overwinters as a cocoon The Luna Moth has one brood each year in the northern part of its range It has three broods each year in the southern part of its range

The caterpillars feed on the following host plants

Tijs Michiel Verwest is a Dutch musician He was born on January 17 1969 in the Netherlands

The Syrian hamster is a breed of hamster originating from Syria They are also known as Golden hamsters as originally all hamsters that were kept as pets were gold coloured Now there are over 100 different colour variations because of selective breeding Little is known about their life in the wild but they are kept as pets in many countries including America the United Kingdom Germany France Australia and others

A Syrian hamsters anatomy is similar to other rodents and very close to other hamsters

Syrian hamsters have 16 teeth These are 4 incisors and 12 molars There is a toothless gap between the incisors and the molars which is called the diastema

The spine like in other animals is made up of several bones called vertebrae There are five different types of vertebra and altogether a Syrian hamster has 43 44 13 14 of those are in the tail

All hamsters have short legs Because of this their legs have small bones which make them easier to break or fracture Obese hamsters are more likely to have problems with their legs

Syrian hamsters have like most animals five senses They can see hear touch taste and smell They have very poor eyesight however and rely largely on smell They are rumored to be colorblind and almost completely blind in daylight

Very little is known about Syrian hamster breeding in the wild but Syrians have been bred well in captivity which means people have been able to learn a lot about their breeding and it is very likely that the breeding patterns in captivity are the same as the ones in the wild

Syrian hamsters are believed to have the shortest gestation period of any animal as it is just 16 days The gestation period is the amount of time a baby is inside its mothers womb or how long the pregnancy lasts

They also have a short ovulation period Syrian hamsters come into heat once every 4 days for about 1 2 hours

Wild Syrian hamsters or Golden hamsters are hamsters which live in the wild in Syria Little is known about them due to their reclusive nature and because they live alone which makes it hard to find them

Tropical Storm Nana was the fourteenth tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season The storm formed in early October from a tropical wave with a nearby low pressure area The wave moved west northwest with a small amount of convection before being completely organized enough to become a tropical depression while convert700nmikm west of the Cape Verde Islands It became a tropical storm later that same day and began weakening almost right away thereafter as it moved in to an area of higher vertical wind shear The storm finally died out early on October 15 Nana did not have an effect on any land areas or ships

A tropical wave moved west awat from the western coast of Africa on October 6 This wave continued moving west with just a little bit of convection until October 8 when organized cloud bands began to form around its low level center The wave continued moving westward and organizing until it was called a tropical depression early on October 12 convert700nmikm west of the Cape Verde Islands It began moving towards the west northwest because of a weakness in the subtropical ridge while becoming stronger to its strongest point of convert40mihkmh As it did so it went into an area of strong upper level winds which began moving the thunderstorm clouds to the east of the center of circulation Just twelve hours later it had weakened back into a tropical depression and by October 14 it had weakened back to just little more than a low level cloud swirl It died out early the next day as it combined itself with a powerful front convert820nmikm east northeast of the Leeward Islands

Tropical Storm Nanas formation was expected for a few days before it actually developed Movement and strength predictions were also better than the long term average Because of Nanas short life the sample size is not very meaningful Tropical Storm Nana stayed in the middle of the Atlantic and never came near land As a result it had no known impact No ships reported strong winds that came from the tropical storm

The sample size of a statistical sample is the number of observations that make up it It is usually means n a positive integer

Accumulated cyclone energy is a measure used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to show the activity of each tropical cyclones and entire tropical cyclone seasons particularly the Atlantic hurricane seasons It uses an estimation of the energy used by a tropical system over its lifetime and is calculated in every six hours

Bohemian FC is a football club in Dublin Ireland They play in the League of Irland The club is owned by the club members

The club was founded in 1890 They were member of the Irish Football League from 1902 to 1911 and 1912 to 1920 During this time the greatest success was the Irish Cup in 1908 and were five times runner up It was a founding member of the League of Ireland in 1921 The club is one of only two clubs to have been members of the League of Ireland since it was founded Bohemians is the only club who always played in the top division Till 1969 they were an amateur team Today they are a professional club

Bohemians play their home matches at Dalymount Park in the Northside neighbourhood of Phibsborough Their club colours are red and black Bohemians supporters often refer to their club by a number of nicknames including Bohs The Gypsies and The Big Club The big rival is Shamrock Rovers a club from Dublins south side

As of 19 June 2011

Dalymount Park is a football stadium in Dublin Ireland It is the home of Bohemian FC

The 2006 Central Pacific cyclone also called 91CINVEST or Storm 91C was a strange weather event in 2006 Forming on October 30 from a mid latitude cyclone in the north Pacific mid latitudes it moved over waters warmer than normal It got some characteristics more normal for subtropical or even tropical cyclones However as it came closer to western North America it fell apart Moisture from its remains then caused a lot of rainfall in British Columbia

A cut off extratropical cyclone over the central north Pacific moved into a place with sea surface temperatures as high as 2C above normal for two days By October 31 the system had gotton convection a warmer than normal core and an eye like characteristic During this time it had moved east then northeast and then northwest 

On November 1 the system had estimated winds of 100 kmh and its most developed convection After that it slowly weakened moved counter clockwise and headed east towards the west coast of North America On November 2 wind shear started affecting the storm and all convection was gone by the next day when it was located roughly 520 mi off the coast of Oregon

This systems center of circulation passed south of observation buoy 46637 on November 1 The buoys lowest pressure reading was 989 mbhPa Other buoys indicated that a rather large area of low pressure was associated with the system Buoy 46637 was not at the systems center of circulation so it is possible that this system had a lower minimum pressure than was actually measured

As a result to the weather system the American National Weather Service gave out wind watches for the Oregon Coast The system brought heavy rain to parts of Vancouver Island

If Storm 91C is really a tropical or subtropical cyclone it has several records Since right now it is not officially either its holding these records is also unofficial Because the storm formed at 36N this system is the northernmost formation in the eastern north Pacific basin The previous record holder was Tropical Storm Wene which formed at 32N before crossing the dateline In addition this systems track data shows that it crossed from the central to the east Pacific because it formed at longitude 149W and dissipated at 135W Only two other known tropical cyclones had done that before

This system has been thought to be a tropical subtropical or extratropical cyclone

Mark Guishard a meteorologist with Bermuda Weather Service had the opinion that the system had finished tropical cyclogenesis and was a tropical cyclone Meteorologist Mark Lander thought that cloud tops were similar to several Atlantic hurricanes Hurricane Vince in example James Franklin a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center thought that

 The system was of frontal origin the frontal structure was eventually lost The convective structure resembled a tropical rather than subtropical cyclone and the radius of maximum winds was very close to the center also more typical of tropical cyclones on balance it was more tropical than subtropical 

Clark Evans of Florida State University reported that forecasting tools showed that the systems structure was same with that of a subtropical or barely tropical cyclone NASA which is not a meteorological agency thought that the system was a subtropical cyclone 

In its review of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season the Canadian Hurricane Centre said that the storm was to be an extratropical cyclone Since this system had one minute sustained winds of 100 kmh which are above the 60 kmh boundary between a depression and a storm it would be able to be a named storm if it was a tropical or subtropical cyclone However neither of the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers for the eastern north Pacific the National Hurricane Center and the Central Pacific Hurricane Centre include this system in their yearly archives nor is it included in the official best track file So this system is not an official tropical or subtropical cyclone of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season

Perpetual motion refers to a movement that goes on forever once started without additional energy added A machine that could be set in motion once would continue to move forever Such a device or system would be against the law of conservation of energy This law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed but one form of energy can be transformed into a different one 

Perpetual motion machines have interested inventors for a long time and even though it has been shown that such a machine cannot exist people still try to build them

Perpetual motion machines have been classified into different types Each type breaks a different law of thermodynamics

Tropical Storm Laura was the twelfth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season Laura formed out of a large non tropical low pressure area located 1015 miles west of the western islands of the Azores on September 29 Laura slowly got tropical characteristics throughout the day as it moved over warmer waters On the afternoon of September 30 Laura had gotten enough tropical characteristics to be designated as a Tropical Storm Soon after becoming tropical Laura began to start an extratropical transition which did not completely take place until the morning of October 1 Laura became reduced into a post tropical cyclone later that morning and the National Hurricane Center gave out its last advisory on the storm

In late September a large non tropical system located over the north central Atlantic slowly moved westward away from the Azores The low produced hurricane force winds but did not exhibit the characteristics of a tropical cyclone The storm steadily weakened over the following days but developed tropical characteristics as it moved over slightly warmer waters By September 29 the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura Upon being upgraded cold cloud tops began to wrap around the center of Laura and consolidate near the center of circulation The convection organized around the center quickly and a satellite pass over the storm revealed that it could be intensifying A later satellite pass disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60 mphFactdateApril 2009

The overall structure of Laura remained subtropical but there were indications that it was acquiring tropical characteristics During the afternoon satellites revealed that Laura had developed a deep warm core a characteristic of a tropical cyclone but the wind field remained subtropical in nature By the nighttime hours the radius of the strongest winds contracted to 80 mi much smaller than what is typical of a subtropical cyclone However Laura was still under the influence of an upper level low and cloud tops remained shallow However the cloud tops became colder overnight and Laura was on the verge of becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September 30 but strong interaction with the upper level low meant it was still subtropical Despite moving over colder waters a water vapor satellite image determined that Laura had separated itself from the upper level low signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone Laura was upgraded to a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude 412N

Not long after being declared tropical early signs of an extratropical transition appeared Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed Laura becoming extratropical the next morning and non tropical later the next day Overnight convection associated with Laura began to diminish and lose tropical characteristics but still retained its status Early on October 1 the extratropical transition was fully apparent Laura remained tropical but the cloud pattern was becoming frontal and there was little convection around the center of the system Laura later degenerated into a post tropical cyclone a term that had been previously used by the Canadian Hurricane Centre to describe a storm that has lost tropical characteristics but is not subtropical or extratropical The transition was forecasted to be complete by the end of the day

While Laura was a tropical cyclone it never came near land so no effects or damages happened and no one died But the storms remains were caught in an upper level jet stream and was pushed towards Europe Heavy rain fell across parts of Britain creating localized build up of flood waters Because of that Glebe Road near Windermere England was closed in both directions and along the A65 road between Old Hutton and Kirkby Lonsdale previously wet soil as well with overwhelmed storm drains resulted in localized flooding Traffic on the M6 Motorway was slowed because of bad driving conditions

After the remains of now extratropical Laura made its final landfall on the southern coast of the Netherlands its rain clouds started mix with a cold front related to a well developed low west of Norway dropping up to 113 mm of precipitation in the northwestern Netherlands flooding streets and homes in the village of Hippolytushoef More than 10000 people lost electricity in southern Norway because of damage to the electrical system created by the remains of the storm

DSL is the base for a number of technologies used to transmit digital data over a telephone line Telephone lines only transmit a limited spectrum of signals This means that the other frequencies can be used to transmit data The data is multiplexed onto the telephone line At both ends a device called Splitter separates the data part and the telephony part DSL provides the physical layer the lowest layer of the OSI Model ATM or Ethernet is used as data link layer IP at the network layer

DSL signals can also be used without a telephony line Multiplexing onto telephone lines is the most common scenario though 

At the end of the consumer a DSL modem converts the signals to be able to travel on the phone line at the other end a DSLAM multiplexes the signals onto the internet backbone of the provider

Most of the time the DSL lines of consumers are asymmetric This is called ADSL and means that there is more bandwidth in one direction than in the other 

Typically the download speed of consumer DSL services ranges from 256 kilobits per second to 24000 kbits depending on DSL technology line conditions and service level implemented Typically upload speed is lower than download speed for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line and equal to download speed for the rarer Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line

DSL typically works by dividing the frequencies used in a single phone line into two primary bands The ISP data is carried over the high frequency band while the voice is carried over the lower frequency band The user typically installs a DSL filter on each phone This removes the high frequencies from the phone line so that the phone only sends or receives the lower frequencies The DSL modem and the normal telephone equipment can be used on the line at the same time without interference from each other

The customer end of the connection consists of a Terminal Adaptor This converts data from the digital signals used by computers into a voltage signal of a suitable frequency range which is then applied to the phone line 

In some DSL variations the terminal adapter is directly connected to the computer via a serial interface using protocols such as RS 232 or V35 In other cases it is common for the customer equipment to be integrated with higher level functionality such as routing firewalling or other application specific hardware and software In this case the entire equipment is usually referred to as a DSL router or DSL gateway

The True Cross is the name given to parts which are believed to be from the actual cross upon which Jesus was crucified

Empress Helena was the mother of Constantine the first Christian Emperor of Rome Christianity was legalised through the Roman Empire in 312 According to the early writers like Socrates Scolaticus Helena travelled to the Holy Land founding churches and establishing relief agencies for the poor She is said to have discovered the resting place of the three crosses used at the crucifixion of Jesus and the two thieves  Dismas and Gestas  who were executed with him Through a miracle it was revealed which of the three was the True Cross 

Many churches have fragmentary remains which are by tradition alleged to be those of the True Cross Their authenticity is not accepted by all those of the Christian faith Many Christians question the accuracy of the reports surrounding the discovery of the True Cross The acceptance and belief of that part of the tradition that pertains to the Early Christian Church is generally restricted to the Catholic and Orthodox Churches The Medieval legends where it came from are not the same in Catholic and Orthodox tradition These churches honour Helena as a saint as does also the Anglican Communion

Some Christians believe that wood from the true cross has miraculous healing powers During the Middle Ages people made pilgrimages to churches and shrines where pieces of the cross were kept and touched the wood in the hope of being cured of a sickness or infirmity

The Southern Railway gave the designation 5BEL to the 5 car all Pullman electric multiple units built to work the prestigious Brighton Belle trains between London Victoria and Brighton These units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated TOPS Class 403 Between 1933 and 1935 the units were designated 5PUL

The Southern Railway gave the designations 4Cor 4Res 4Buf and 4Gri to the different types of electric multiple unit built to work the route between London Waterloo and Portsmouth Harbour The 4Cor type units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated TOPS Class 404 The Cor designation had previously been used for the 6Pul units and was reused by them during World War II when the Pullman car was stored but this stock was different from the 4Cor units

The Southern Railway gave the designation Sub to the wide variety of electric multiple units that were used on inner suburban workings in the South London area Originally these units were formed as three car units but in the 1940s all surviving units were increased to four cars by the addition of an Augmentation trailer New four car units were also built at this time and these survived in passenger use until late 1983 by which time British Rail had allocated to them TOPS Class 405

The British Rail Class 411 electrical multiple units were built at Eastleigh works from 1956 63 for the newly electrified main lines in Kent These units were based on the earlier Southern Railway 4Cor design built in 1937

The British Rail Class 413 units were formed in 1982 by permanently coupling two Class 414 2Hap units together The cabs in the centre of the unit were decommissioned thus reducing the weight of the units

A logical disk is a concept from computing Logical disks provide a certain amount of space to store data Unlike real hard disks that can be touched logical disks can take this storage space from different locations

Common locations where this can be taken from

The disk is described as logical because it does not actually exist as a single physical entity in its own right 

When IBM first released the magnetic disk drive in the 1956 a single drive would be directly attached to the using system with each disk managed as a single entity As the development of drives continued it became apparent that reliability was a problem and systems using RAID technology evolved This means that more than one physical disks are RAID ed together to produce a single logical disk 

In a modern home PC environment disk drives now provide hundreds of gigabytes of storage capacity which can be impractical to use as a single entity Therefore most systems have their drives partitioned into multiple logical drivesFactdateNovember 2007

In most modern business IT environments some form of a Storage area network will exist Here many storage devices are connected to many host server devices in a network A single RAID array may provide some capacity to one server and some capacity to another Therefore logical disks are used to partition the available capacity and provide the amount of storage needed by each host from a common pool of logical disks

The British Rail Class 414 electric multiple units were built between 1956 and 1963

The British Rail Class 416 electric multiple units were built between 1953 and 1956 They were intended for inner suburban passenger services on Londons Southern Electric network

The British Rail Class 423 electrical multiple units were built by BR at York Works from 1967 to 1974 although the MBSOs and TSOs of the first 20 7701 7720 were constructed at Derby Works They feature manually opening doors next to every seating row They were mostly found working outer suburban services in South London and rural services in Kent and Sussex up to 2005 when they were finally replaced by Electrostar and Desiro units

Always is the most recent single by Sum 41 released on their first complicity album 8 Years of Blood Sake and Tears The Best of Sum 41 It is the only new song on the record recorded especially for this release and was released as a radio single on December 9 2008  Although the album was released on November 26 2008 the song was released to the public for free listening on the Universal Japan website on November 11 2008  

Overview  Always is not a typical Sum 41 song It switches tempos back and forth during the whole song from an acoustic slow intro to an up tempo verse and chorus up until a quiet piano break again into an up tempo chorus and back to a totally stripped acoustic slow break from the whole tempo of the song The song features a prominent use of piano and acoustic guitar and has a much heavier sound then the one present on the bands last album Underclass Hero  

Like the bands last effort Underclass Hero the song was totally produced mixed and engineered by lead singer Deryck Whibley himself  

The British Rail Class 442 Wessex Electric electrical multiple units were introduced in 1988 on the South Western Main Line from London Waterloo to Southampton Central Bournemouth Poole and Weymouth Twenty four of these 5 car units were built between 1988 89 by BREL at their Derby works Their introduction coincided with the completion of electrification from Bournemouth to Weymouth The entire fleet was operated by South West Trains up until February 2007 when the Class 442 services were replaced

The British Rail Class 444 Desiro electrical multiple units were built by Siemens AG from 2003 04 Forty five of these units were built for express services for South West Trains The Desiro family also includes units of Classes 350 360 and 450

The PEP Stock were prototype electric multiple units used on British Rails Southern Region during the early 1970s They were forerunners of the BR Second Generation electric multiple unit fleet Three units were built one two car unit and two four car units Under TOPS they were allocated Classes 445 and 446

The phylum Ctenophora the comb jellies is a phylum of marine invertebrates They are part of the plankton and there are also pelagic species The phylum includes the sea gooseberry and Venus girdle

The phylum was grouped with Cnidaria in the former Coelenterata phylum Ctenophores are the most basal known type of animals 

Even though they look like jellyfish they are zoologically not related to them They lack the characteristic nematocysts but have colloblasts sticky cells that snare small victims They have eight rows of cilia which look like the teeth of a comb hence Ctenophore comb bearer Ctenophores have connective tissues and a nervous system There are about 150 described species of ctenophora spread throughout the worlds oceans from shallow estuarine waters to the deep sea 

Although there are a few benthic species most are gelatinous zooplankton and form a considerable proportion of the entire planktonic biomass worldwide A few species such as the sea gooseberry native to the North Sea have reached such high populations that they clog fishermens nets while of other species only a few examples are known The fragile makeup of ctenophores makes research into their way of life extremely difficult For this reason their lifespan is not known but ctenophores begin to reproduce at an early age

Many planktonic ctenophores produce a rainbow effect which is not caused by bioluminescence but by diffraction the scattering of light as the cilia on the combs beat Most species are also bioluminescent but the light is usually blue or green and can only been seen in darkness However some groups appear incapable of bioluminescence

Domitian was a Roman Emperor who reigned from 14 September 81 until his death 

Domitian was the last emperor of the Flavian dynasty which ruled the Roman Empire between 69 and 96 This included the reigns of Domitians father Vespasian his elder brother Titus and that of Domitian himself

When Titus died the next day Domitian was declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard This started a reign which lasted fifteen years longer than any man who ruled since Tiberius

As emperor Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage He expanded the border defenses of the empire and started a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome 

Significant wars were fought in Britain where his general Agricola attempted to conquer Scotland and in Dacia where Domitian was unable to get a decisive victory against king Decebalus 

Domitians rule was totalitarian He saw himself as the new Augustus an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new age Religious military and cultural propaganda fostered a cult of personality By nominating himself perpetual censor he sought to control public and private morals As a consequence Domitian was popular with the people and army but considered a tyrant by members of the Roman Senate 

Domitians reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials The same day he was succeeded by his advisor Nerva After his death Domitians memory was condemned to oblivion by the Roman Senate while senatorial authors such as Tacitus Pliny the Younger and Suetonius published histories showing Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant 

Modern history has rejected these views Now we see Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural economic and political program provided the foundation of the peaceful second century

2Wim was the designation given by Southern Railway to a small fleet of electric multiple units dedicated for use on the West Croydon to Wimbledon Line None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class

Conceived by Oliver Bulleid for the Southern Railways Dartford commuter route the two 4DD electric multiple units were the only double deck trains to run on the main line railway network in Britain The upper level seats were squeezed in between the lower level seats to ensure that the overall height of the unit was within the clearances necessary to pass through tunnels and under bridges The 4DD was somewhat unsuccessful because the upper level compartments were cramped and poorly ventilated The compartments were pressure ventilated but the equipment proved to be troublesome Also dwell times at stations were increased because of the increased number of passengers per door To obtain the extra seating capacity that was being sought it was instead decided to lengthen trains from eight cars to ten

Network SouthEast was one of three passenger sectors of British Rail created in 1982 NSE principally operated commuter trains in the London area and inter urban services in densely populated South East England Before 1986 the sector was known as London South Eastern

After privatisation NSE was divided up into several franchises

The Southern Railway gave the designation 4Lav to the electric multiple units built to work the semi fast services on the route between London and Brighton None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class

The Southern Railway gave the designations 6Pul 6Cit and 6Pan to electric multiple units built to work the routes between London and Brighton West Worthing and Eastbourne None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class number The 6Pul units were designated 6Cor until 1935

British Rails third fundamental design of carriage was designated Mark 3 and was introduced in 1976 primarily for use on the High Speed Train The coaches were also used as conventional loco hauled stock as part of the West Coast Main Line northern electrification scheme in the mid 1970s designated Mark 3A and 3B The final batch was built in 1988 but Mark 3 based multiple units continued to be built until the early 1990s

Desiro is the brand name for a design of modular train manufactured by Siemens of Germany

The Desiro can be made as a diesel or electric multiple unit It is normally made as two and three car trainsets Although there are many differences between single trains the basic body design is the same These trains are mostly used for regional services and belong to a new generation of light modular trains which have become common in many European countries They are sometimes thought as light regional railcars They are mostly cheap to make and work Their fast acceleration makes them good for services with short intervals between stations However they are sometimes complained by people for their poor passenger comfort

In Austria the BB is right now using about 60 diesel powered Desiro trains called BB 5022 These are based on the Class 642 used by Deutsche Bahn but have added more safety stuff

In 2005 and 2006 in Bulgaria the Bulgarian State Railways begin working Desiro trains as part of a 67 million deal with Siemens AG for a total of 25 Diesel multiple units As of 22 March 2006 16 trains had been delivered with many of them working on the Sofia Kyustendil Sofia line Another 117 million deal for 25 EMUs has also been signed with Siemens AG The EMUs were fitted out in Varna where BDZ and Siemens AG are thinking about making a joint venture company The EMUs are classes 30 and 31 and are servicing traffic in the Sofia and Plovdiv areas

In Denmark DSB rented 12 Desiro trains since 2002 The train is mostly used between Odense and Svendborg and between Odense and Fredericia On July 2 2009 DSB signed a contract of eight trains from Siemens for Grenaabanen for delivery late 2010 Nordjyske Jernbaner used Desiro trains since 2004 on all its working rails Today the company owns eight Desiro trains

The Class 642 has two MAN diesel engines with an output of 275 or 315 kW each and hydro mechanical transmission with retarders It normally has 100 seats When linked together with Scharfenberg couplers up to three trainsets can be worked together The Desiros are quite popular with most passengers thanks to their good acceleration Because they have often replaced pushpull trains their shorter journey times such as on the Mglitzbahn have made greater passenger numbers

At first DB was going to work together modern DMUs bought from different makers but because of software trouble this proved to be impossible Therefore the Class 642 can only be mechanically coupled with other DMUs like the Class 643

Right now in Hungary 31 diesel Desiros are in service with MV mostly as broken wikt linksuburbansuburban trains on the secondary line between Budapest Esztergom and Budapest  Lajosmizse and as an InterCity between Budapest and Baja On weekends the units also used as top inter city trains from Budapest to Baja and Storaljajhely and as fast trains from Budapest to Tapolca During the summer months Desiros appear on some local train diagrams on the norther shore of the Lake Balaton

The 57km KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit airport rail link uses the Desiro ET 425 M four car Electric Multiple Units There are 12 trainsets right now working in Malaysia 

These EMUs have a maximum commercial speed of 160 kmh

Caile Ferate Romane Romanias national railway worker is one of the largest users of the Siemens Desiro trainsets CFR which is right now undergoing modernisation has bought many Desiro trainsets and uses them for all types of train like its Rapid Accelerat and Personal inter city services but mostly on its Rapid express trains There was some broken wikt linkcriticismcriticism of the use of Desiros for CFRs long distance services because they were thought to be uncomfortable CFR has recently refitted them and is now using Desiros mostly on its medium and short distance routes

In December 2009 Russian Railways ordered 38 Desiros for delivery in 2013 for use during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi with an option for a further 16 which would be mostly made in Russia

Slovenian Railways works electric Desiro units that are made as DESIRO EMG 312 SR 31E They are used as commuter stopping trains mostly on connections to and between Ljubljana and Maribor on the following lines

SBB CFF FFS works double decker EMUs They are broken wikt linkdesignateddesignated as class SBB RABe 514 They are used as commuter trains in Zrich where 61 four car sets have been working since 2006

Nine 25 kV AC Desiro UK EMUs based on the Heathrow Connect Class 3602 will be used for the Suvarnabhumi Airport Link which is right now under running test from the locomotive shop in Asoke to Suvarnabhumi Station under the airport

Electrostar is the name given to a series of related electric multiple unit passenger trains manufactured by Bombardier Transportation formerly ADtranz Since the privatisation of British Rail it has become the most common new EMU type in Britain where different variants referred to as Class 357 Class 375 Class 376 and Class 377 are most common on the high volume commuter routes in South London and to the Sussex Kent South Essex coasts  It shares the same bodyshell and core structure as the Turbostar which is in turn the most common post privatisation diesel multiple unit family Most of the Electrostar fleet were assembled at Bombardiers Derby works

The Cuckoos are a family of near passerine birds They are the main part of the order called Cuculiformes 

Many of them have a unique kind of parastism called brood parastism This means it lays its eggs in the nests of other kinds of birds who then rear the baby cuckoo instead of their own

Cuculus canorus the most common species is a well known bird in many parts of the world The cuckoo gets its names because the male Common Cuckoo sings two notes which sound like the word cu ckoo The female does not make this sound She has a loud bubbling call 

The cuckoo is a Spring migrant to many parts of Europe and Asia It spends the winters in Africa The cuckoo only stays in its summer location for about 10 weeks In Britain for example it will arrive around the end of April and the adults may be returning to Africa by the end of June or early July

The Common cuckoo is a greyish bird with a slender body long tail and strong legs It looks a little bit like a small bird of prey when it flies The male is dark grey above with a blackish brown tail spotted and tipped with white and unevenly barred in black The female is similar but a bit more reddish on the upper breast It likes to eat hairy caterpillars It is often found where woods border on to open land

The Common cuckoo does not make a nest of its own and they do not bring up their own young Instead the female lays her eggs in the nests of other birds Each female cuckoo specialises in just one host species and lays camouflaged eggs in that birds nest For example a cuckoo which lays its eggs in reed warbler nests will lay eggs that look like those of a reed warbler

The female cuckoo spends a lot of time watching the birds at the nest where she wants to lay an egg She has to work out the exact time to go and lay her egg while the host parents are not looking If the cuckoo lays her egg in the nest before the other bird lays the reed warbler will notice and knows it is not her egg and so she will get rid of it If the cuckoo lays her egg too late when the reed warbler has finished laying this will be noticed too

When the female cuckoo thinks it is the right moment she will fly down to the reed warblers nest pushes one reed warbler egg out of the nest lays her egg and flies off This only takes about 10 seconds The reed warbler does not notice and carries on looking after the eggs When the cuckoo chick hatches it soon grows very fast It pushes the other eggs or reed warbler chicks out of the nest At 14 days old it is about 3 times the size of the adult reed warblers The chick has a huge mouth which it opens very wide It also makes a very fast cheeping sound which sounds like a nest full of reed warbler chicks This makes the parents behave as if they had a nest full of their own chicks

About 56 of the Old World and 3 of the New World cuckoo species are brood parasites laying their eggs in the nests of other birds These species are obligate brood parasites meaning that they only reproduce in this fashion The shells of the eggs of brood parasites is thick They have two distinct layers with an outer chalky layer that is believed to provide resistance to cracking when the eggs are dropped in the host nest 

Female parasitic cuckoos specialize and lay eggs which look like the eggs of their chosen host This has been produced by natural selection as some birds are able to distinguish cuckoo eggs from their own leading to those eggs least like the hosts being thrown out of the nest 

Host species may take direct action to stop cuckoos laying eggs in their nest Birds whose nests are at high risk of cuckoo eggs often mob cuckoos and drive them out of the area 

Parasitic cuckoos are grouped into gentes each gens specializes in a particular host species This permits each gens to evolve a particular egg colouring Thus the species as a whole parasitizes a wide variety of hosts but each line of females specializes in a single host species 

Genes regulating egg colour are passed down only along the maternal line no doubt on the sex chromosome This allows females to lay mimetic eggs in the nest of their host species 

Females are thought to imprint on the host species which raised them later they only parasitize nests of that species Male cuckoos fertilize females of all lines so gene flow takes place between the different maternal lines

The detail and near perfection of the cuckoo nest parasitism and the defences of the host birds are extraordinary Many of the host species can spot and throw out almost perfect cuckoo eggs This system is a fine example of an evolutionary arms race a type of co evolution There are other birds which practise nest parasitism but these other systems are much less specialized

This page lists every locomotive allocated a TOPS classification and all modern traction stock used on the mainline network since 1948

The 1955 diesel locomotive classes are given in brackets where applicable

A large number of different shunter types were purchased by British Rail and its predecessors many of which were withdrawn prior to the introduction of TOPS The tables below attempt to list the different types and the different classifications used to describe them as clearly as possible

Shunter classes are listed by 1955 class which puts TOPS classes in ascending order and generally puts 1948 and 1962 classes in ascending order Unclassed shunters are placed at the start of the table TOPS class 07 has been placed so its 1962 class is in the logical place

Locomotive class are listed by TOPS class Locomotives for TOPS classes 24 and 26 have their original sub classes shown as each wholly comprised locomotives from a distinct 1962 class

When British Rail implemented the TOPS system for managing their operating stock part of their shipping fleet was incorporated into the system as Class 99 in order to circumvent some of the restrictions of the application software

These were locomotives built and owned by private firms but used by British Rail to test them

A number of TOPS class numbers were allocated to proposed locomotives both diesel and electric which for many reasons were not proceeded with

This is a list of British Rail diesel multiple unit classes

TOPS classes

This page lists every electric powered multiple unit allocated a TOPS classification or used on the mainline network since 1948 British Rail operated a wide variety of electric multiple units for use on electrified lines

These use electrical switching devices and have electronic power control

The Southern Railway and its successor the Southern Region of British Rail used three letter codes to classify their DC EMU fleets as shown after the TOPS class numbers

The 500 series classes were reserved for DC EMUs not from the Southern Region This included the DC lines in North London Merseyside and Greater Manchester The DC electric network around Tyneside had been de electrified by the time TOPS was introduced and the stock withdrawn or transferred to the Southern Region

TOPS classes

Pre TOPS classes

This was a one off unit withdrawn before the introduction of TOPS

The 900 series classes were reserved for multiple units in departmental stock most of which were converted from old passenger units In broad terms classes 930 935 were allocated to Southern Region multiple units 936 937 to other EMUs and 960 to other DMUs In recent years this has been less rigidly adhered to

The original use for the Southern Region classes are included in brackets these designations have been less rigidly applied in recent years

British United Traction was a joint company owned by the Associated Equipment Company and Leyland Motors which produced railway equipment and trolleybuses

The British Rail Derby Lightweight diesel multiple units were the first such trains to be built en masse for British Railways The units were built at BRs Derby Works from 1954 to 1955 The units were built in various formations including two single car units 12 power twin 2 car units 84 power trailer 2 car units and four 4 car units Contemporaneous with these units was the unique Battery Electric Multiple Unit

Turbostar is the name given to a series of diesel multiple units built by Bombardier Transportation at their Litchurch Lane Works in Derby England The Turbostar was the first new train type to be introduced after the privatisation of British Rail and is the most common type of diesel multiple unit The first units were ordered by Chiltern Railways in 1996 and were designated Class 168 Since then the family has grown with the addition of the Class 170 Class 171 and the Class 172

Coradia is the name given to the range of multiple unit inter city and regional trains manufactured by Alstom There are a number of variants of this series used in several countries

The Voyager series is a group of high speed diesel electric multiple unit trains built by Bombardier Transportation in service on the UK railway network The trains are among the most modern currently in operation and are in service on many intercity routes around Great Britain There are currently three types in service with 4 TOCs

A diesel multiple unit or DMU is a multiple unit train consisting of multiple carriages powered by one or more on board diesel engines They may also be referred to as a railcar or railmotor depending on country

Southampton Corporation Tramways No 45 or Southampton 45 is an open top tramcar It was built in 1903 by Hurst Nelson At first it had a three window saloon before being rebuilt by Southampton Corporation Tramways with a four window one The tram looks out of proportion as it had to pass through the very low Bathgate Arch in the centre of Southampton A normal sized tram would not have been able to have passed underneath the arch

The tramcar operated from 1903 until the Southampton system closed in 1949 At an enthusiasts tour of the system the Museum Committee of the Light Railway Transport League bought the tram for 10 This price included a refurbished truck and a full repaint This act began the entire preservation movement of British tramways

After it had been purchased the tram travelled the country as there was not yet a museum set up that could store the tram By 1955 the tram was being stored at Marton depot in Blackpool It was soon given to the Tramway Museum Society and moved to the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu Hampshire It was placed next to Newcastle 102 another preserved tramcar Both of the trams were in an open air display

The tram moved to Crich Tramway Village in October 1960 and has been there ever since It is in regular use during the summer months and is the museums only operational open top tramcar

The Acanthocephala are a group of parasitic worms They may be called known as acanthocephales thorny headed worms or spiny headed worms They have an evertable proboscis armed with spines which they use to pierce and hold the gut wall of the host Acanthocephalans have no gut and absorb nutrients directly from the hosts gut 

Acanthocephalans have complex life cycles with various hosts including invertebrates fishes amphibians birds and mammals The juveniles are parasitic in crustaceans and insects Adults live in the digestive tract of vertebrates especially fish About 1150 species have been described

The Acanthocephala were thought to be a separate phylum Recent genome analysis has shown that they are closely related to rotifers Since all parasites are derived from free living forms the Acanthocephalans are modified rotifers This is an example of molecular phylogenetics In due course spiny headed worms will probably be placed in a taxonomic rank below phylum such as sub phylum or class

Kittis Hog nosed Bat also known as the bumblebee bat is an endangered species of bat It is the only member of the family Craseonycteridae It occurs in western Thailand and southeast Burma It usually lives in where limestone caves along rivers

Kittis Hog nosed Bat is the smallest species of bat and one of the worlds smallest mammals It has a reddish brown or grey coat with a distinctive pig like snout Colonies range greatly in size with an average of 100 individuals per cave The bat feeds during short activity periods in the evening and dawn foraging around nearby forest areas for insects Female bat have only one offspring each year

The status of the bat in Burma is not well known In Thailand the bat only occurs in one province and may be at risk of becoming extinct The threats it faces are mostly caused by humans most notably the degradation of habitats and being disturbed in their caves 

Kittis Hog nosed Bat is about 2933 millimetres in length and 2 grams in mass This is the reason for its common name bumblebee bat It is the smallest species of bat and may be the worlds smallest mammal depending on how size is defined The main competitors for the title are small shrews in particular the Etruscan shrew may be lighter but is longer

The bat has a distinctive swollen pig like snout with thin vertical nostrils Its ears are relatively large while its eyes are small and mostly concealed by fur Its teeth are typical of an insectivorous bat The dental formula is 1113 in the upper jaw and 2123 in the lower jaw with large upper incisors

The bats upperparts are reddish brown or grey while the underside is generally paler The wings are relatively large and darker in colour with long tips that allow the bat to hover Despite having two caudal vertebrae Kittis Hog nosed Bat has no visible tail There is a large web of skin between the hind legs which may assist in flying and catching insects although there are no tail bones or calcars to help control it in flight

Kittis Hog nosed Bat occupies the limestone caves along rivers within dry evergreen or deciduous forests In Thailand Kittis Hog nosed Bat is restricted to a small region of Kanchanaburi Province within the drainage basin of the Khwae Noi River While the Sai Yok National Park contains much of the bats range some Thai populations occur outside the park and are therefore unprotected

Since the 2001 discovery of a single individual in Burma at least nine separate sites have been identified in the limestone outcrops outside the Thanlwin Ataran and Gyaing Rivers of Kayin and Mon States The Thai and Burmese populations are morphologically identical but their echolocation calls are distinct It is not known whether the two populations are reproductively isolated

Kittis Hog nosed Bat roosts in the caves of limestone hills far from the entrance While many caves contain only 10 to 15 individuals the average group size is 100 with a maximum of about 500 Individuals roost high on walls or roof domes far apart from each other Bats also undertake seasonal migration between caves

Kittis Hog nosed Bat has a brief activity period leaving its roost for only 30 minutes in the evening and 20 minutes at dawn These short flights are easily interrupted by heavy rain or cold temperatures During this period the bat forages within fields of cassava and kapok or around the tops of bamboo clumps and teak trees within one kilometre of the roosting site The wings seem to be shaped for hovering flight and the gut contents of specimens do include spiders and insects that are presumably gleaned off foliage Nevertheless most prey is probably caught in flight Main staples of the bats diet include small flies hymenopterans and psocopterans

Late in the dry season of each year females give birth to a single offspring During feeding periods the young either stays in the roost or remains attached to the mother at one of her two vestigial pubic nipples

Kittis Hog nosed Bat is the only extant species in the family Craseonycteridae which is grouped in the superfamily Rhinolophoidea as a result of molecular testing Based on this determination the bats closest relatives are members of the families Hipposideridae and Rhinopomatidae

Kittis Hog nosed Bat was unknown to the world at large prior to 1974 Its common name refers to its discoverer Thai zoologist Kitti Thonglongya Thonglongya worked with a British partner John E Hill in classifying bats of Thailand after Thonglongya died suddenly in February 1974 Hill formally described the species giving it the binomial name Craseonycteris thonglongyai in honour of his colleague

As of the species most recent review in 1996 Kittis Hog nosed Bat is listed by the IUCN as endangered with a downward population trend

Soon after the bats discovery in the 1970s some roosting sites became disturbed as a result of tourism scientific collection and even the collection and sale of individuals as souvenirs However these pressures may not have had a significant effect on the species as a whole since many small colonies exist in hard to access locations and only a few major caves were disturbed Another potential risk is the activity of local monks who have occupied roost caves during periods of meditation

Currently the most significant and long term threat to the Thai population could be the annual burning of forest areas which is most prevalent during the bats breeding season In addition the proposed construction of a pipeline from Burma to Thailand may have a negative impact Threats to the Burmese population are not well known

In 2007 Kittis Hog nosed Bat was identified by the Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered project as one of its Top 10 focal species EDGE identifies species that are evolutionarily distinct and need better protection to prevent extinction

The Kingdom of Tungning was the first Han Chinese government to rule Taiwan It ruled between 1661 and 1683 It was a pro Ming Dynasty kingdom It was started by Koxinga after the destruction of Ming government by the Manchu Koxinga was son of a pirate who was a supporter of the Ming Dynasty He hoped to get his soldiers together on Taiwan and use it as a base to get back mainland China for the Ming Dynasty

The Kingdom of Tungning is also sometimes known as

Admiral Koxinga called Taiwan TungtuDongdu In western history books it is known as the Kingdom of Taiwan 

In 1661 Koxinga forced a landing at Luerhmen Taiwan In less than a year he took Fort Zeelandia and made an agreement with Frederick Coyett the Dutch governor The Dutch gave him the fort and left all the goods and property of the Dutch East India Company behind All the Dutch people officials and soldiers were able take their personal things and supplies back to Batavia in safety This ended 38 years of Dutch colonial rule on Taiwan Koxinga kept himself busy making Taiwan into a useful base for anti Qing Dynasty supporters who hoped to get the Ming Dynasty back to power

In 1662 at the age of 39 Koxinga died of malaria Some people said that he died in a sudden fit of craziness when he heard about the death of his father under the Qing His son Zheng Jing took control as the ruler of Taiwan with the name of Prince of Yanping

For the next 19 years Zheng Jing tried to run the country and rebuild his army in Taiwan Contact with the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty from the China through ambassadors was frequent Zheng Jing fought the Qing to defend Xiamen Quemoy and the Pescadores islands which he finally lost over the years His small army army was not big enough to defend the islands from the Qing During Revolt of the Three Feudatories Zheng Jing started an attack in the Fujian area At the end of the revolt Zhengs army was defeated After the defeat Zheng went back to Taiwan where he spent his time with wine and women dying soon after of illness After his death his generals and ministers were split into two groups each supporting one of his sons to take take over After some fighting Zheng Keshuang his 12 year old son became the new king 

In 1683 after the Battle of Penghu Zheng Keshuang gave himself up to the Qing His kingdom was added to the Qing Dynasty as part of the Fujian Province

The Kingdom of Tungning lasted for just over 20 years Because its history is almost the same as modern Taiwan it has great symbolic value

After its defeat in the Chinese Civil War in 1949 the Republic of China led by the Kuomintang went to Taiwan They left mainland China to the Communist Party who started the Peoples Republic of China For many years the ROC planned to take control of the mainland It kept island bases close to the mainland This was the same as Koxinga and his sons had done The ROC has now become a democracy and no longer wants to take over the mainland The political and territorial arrangement has not changed In this way it is the same as between the QingKoxinga situation and the current PRCROC situation

The Kuomintang of the ROC have talked a lot about the goals of Koxinga They were going to use Taiwan as a base for returning their government to Mainland China They see themselves as the defenders of the ROC They see Taiwan as a base from which the ROC will take back control of the mainland The PRC talks about the fact that Koxinga freed Taiwan from Dutch colonialism for the sake of the motherland They do not talk about the fact that Koxinga was trying to get rid of the mainland government to bring back an earlier dynasty

These letters did not usually apply to the wide variety of passenger rated but goods carrying vans Their codes were an acronym of their traditional railway description eg GUV for General Utility Vans

The following list lists those codes that were actually used on British Railways cross referred to the comparable code used by the LMS with the exception that the letter S is used where until 1956 the letter T is used Suffix codes Y or Z are not shown as these could apply to variants of any or all vehicle types

The Pinnacle Point Man is a name given to a group of Homo sapiens believed to have lived in a cave at Pinnacle Point 164000 years ago This cave is near MosselbaaiMossel Bay on the south coast South Africa Discoveries in the cave show that these early humans were able to work with haematite pieces and used ochre to paint their bodies The discovery challenges the widely held belief that modern human behaviour began only 45000 years ago It also challenges the view that this behaviour was reached through a large cultural leap 

Because the African climate became cool and dry the food resources were reduced dramatically This was the reason why the Pinnacle Point man moved to the shores There they could eat marine creatures like mussels snails and crabs These men also used amazing subtly tools Microliths were mounted on wood shafts

The startling discovery was made in 2007 by an international team including the palaeoanthropologist Curtis Marean from the Institute of Human Origins of the Arizona State University and three graduate students of the School of Human Evolution and Social Change They came to the conclusion that humans living in the cave started to eat new foods They added shellfish and other marine resources to their diet The cause for this evolution was the climate change It is the first evidence that mankind was able to this The report in the magazine Nature also reports that the evidence for using coloured pigments was also found This is much earlier than the earliest known usage which had been from 70000 years ago

The findings give rise to the assumption that living near coast has caused the changes 

The evidence shows that Homo sapiens evolved in Africa 100000 to 200000 years ago At that time the world was in an ice age and Africa was a desert But as archaeologica sites dating to that time period are rare in Africa palaeonthologist Curtis Marean looked at different information He studied geologic formations the sea currents climate data and much more As a result he was able to pinpoint his research to destinations like the Pinnacle Point cave where the findings have been made

The W3C Web service definition encompasses many different systems but in common usage the term refers to clients and servers that communicate over the HTTP protocol used on the Web Such services tend to fall into one of two camps Big Web Services and RESTful Web Services

Big Web Services use XML messages that follow the SOAP standard and have been popular with traditional enterprise In such systems there is often a machine readable description of the operations offered by the service written in the Web Services Description Language The latter is not a requirement of a SOAP endpoint but it is a prerequisite for automated client side code generation in many Java and NET SOAP frameworks Some industry organizations such as the WS I mandate both SOAP and WSDL in their definition of a Web service

More recently RESTful Web services have been regaining popularity particularly with Internet companies These also meet the W3C definition and are often better integrated with HTTP than SOAP based services They do not require XML messages or WSDL service API definitions

Pricing is the creation of a price In a market economy the price is made by supply and demand The suppliers would like to get the price as high as possible and the consumers would like to pay as few as possible Prices will be built if consumers and salesmen make an agreement of the exchange of goods

There are many consumers but only a few suppliers

There are only one supplier and one consumer

Many suppliers are compared to many consumers By the low market share of the individual supplier you call it atomize market structure You also call this market form competitive market

The supplier will offer more goods if the market price is rising

The consumer will demand more goods if the market price drops

OEM stands for Original Equipment Manufacturing It is mainly used to describe parts for cars airplanes and electrical systems It is also used for computer parts and computer programs

The name OEM is usually used when a new version of something is made by a company that is different to the company that first made it The new company will sell the product at a cheaper price but this is often because it does not have as many features as the first version For example an OEM computer program will usually only come with the disc and a licence but no instruction manuals

The pubic bone is one of the bones that make up the pelvis In the picture at right it is called a pubis It is ventral and anterior 

It is covered by a layer of fat which is covered by the mons pubis

It can be separated into a body a superior ramus and an inferior ramus

The body forms one fifth of the acetabulum contributing by its outer surface both to the lunate surface and the acetabular fossa Its inner surface enters into the formation of the wall of the lesser pelvis and gives origin to a part of the obturator internus

In the female the pubic bone is in front of the urethral sponge

The left and right hip bones join at the pubic symphysis

The Brown tree snake is an arboreal colubrid snake the lives in parts of coastal Australia Papua New Guinea and islands in northwestern Melanesia

This snake is known for being an invasive species responsible for killing the bird population on Guam

The Brown tree snake eats birds lizards and bats It also eats small rodents in its home  It also eats birds and shrews at Guam

Due to the amount of prey and lack of predators in habitats such as Guam they have been known to grow to larger sizes than their normal 1 to 2 meters in length The longest recorded length of this species is one found on Guam was three meters

Reproduction has not been looked at in detail  The female makes 4 12 eggs 42 47 mm long and 18 22 mm wide with a leathery shell  Females make up to two groups called clutches per year depending on season climate and amount of prey  The female places the eggs in hollow logs rock cracks and other places where they are likely protected from drying and high temperatures

The Brown tree snake is a nocturnal snake that can be very aggressive when confronted The fangs are grooved rather than hollow fangs the poison is hard to place into a bite on a human in this way is only given in small amount The venom appears to be weakly neurotoxic and possibly cytotoxic Adults are not affectly in a great way however children are in greater danger

The history of Curitiba has many different periods

In the past the region where today is the city of Curitiba was a region of exuberant forest where the parana pine was dominant The first inhabitants of the region were the indigenous tribe Tingi by the Tupi Guarani nation

At the beginning of the Christian Era the Plateau Curitibano was inhabited by peoples potters Subterranean houses found at archaeological sites on the outskirts of Curitiba show the adaptation of native to the adverse conditions of climate as the cold wind frost and snow

In time of arrival of the Portuguese to Brazil the Plateau Curitibano was occupied by groups of linguistic families J and Tupi Guarani

The first ten years of the 16th century marked the beginning of a war of conquest of Europeans against the indigenous peoples who inhabited the plateaus of southeastern and southern Brazil Were Portuguese and Spanish expeditions in search of precious metals and stones and Indians to enslave 

The region of Curitiba began to be populated by non Indians around 1630 by people from Paranagu where the alluvium gold had been discovered forming the village of Our Lady of Light and Good Jesus of Pine Forest which was became in town in 1693 The Portuguese who founded a village in 1693 gave it the name of Vila da Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais The name was changed to Curitiba in 1721 

There is a legend telling that around 1648 a group of pioneers founded a small village near the Atuba River while searching for gold These pioneers venerated Nossa Senhor da Luz and made a special place there for her statue The legend tells that every morning the image turned her eyes to a pine tree forest which the pioneers knew was a sacred place of the Indians The explorers took this as a sign that Nossa Senhora was showing them a special place for their village Even though they knew that the Indians took them as enemies the pioneers took the risk and went in to the forest to find this special place When the pioneers got close to the tribe a miracle happened the Indians were peaceful and expecting them to come Done contact with the leader of the Tingi tribe the cacique Tindiqera would have said the new location and put a stick in the ground saying Cor Etuba By this stick would have grown a great tree where today is the zero mark of Curitiba At that place the pioneers built a chapel in honor of the saint now called Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais

Curitiba officially became a town in 1812 orthography its name as Curityba An alternative orthography also came up Coritiba This orthography looked to become dominant for it was used in press and state documents but a state decree in 1919 decided the dispute by orthography the city name Curitiba Growth was based on the cattle trade being a way between cattle breeding country to the South and markets to the North Developing effective started from the beginning of the 19th century with the exploitation and exportation of Yerba mate and the elevation to the condition that city in 1842

Waves of European immigrants started arriving after 1850 mainly Germans Italians Poles and Ukrainians In 1853 the south and southwest of the province of So Paulo are separated forming the new province of Paran and Curitiba has become capital The Universidade Federal do Paran the first in Brazil was established in Curitiba in 1913 the same year in which electric streetcars were first deployed

As most of Southern Brazils population Curitiba is mostly inhabited by Brazilians of European descent The first Europeans to arrive in the region were of Portuguese origin during the 17th century They intermarried with the native people and with the African slaves

In the 19th century the influx of immigrants from Europe increased In 1828 the first German immigrants settled in Paran However large numbers of immigrants from Germany only arrived in Curitiba during the 1870s most of them was Volga Germans from Russia

Immigrants from Poland first arrived in 1871 settling in rural areas near to Curitiba They largely influenced the agriculture of the region Curitiba has the second largest Polish diaspora in the world second only to Chicago and is the only Brazilian city to have orthography in Polish language Kurytyba

Italian immigrants started arriving in Curitiba in 1878 They came mostly from the Veneto and Trento regions in Northern Italy and settled mostly in the Santa Felicidade neighborhood still today the center of the large Italian community of Curitiba

Large numbers of Ukrainian immigrants settled in Curitiba mostly between 1895 and 1897 when 20 thousands arrived They were peasants from Galicia who immigrated to Brazil to become small farmers Nowadays there are 300 thousand Ukrainian Brazilians living in Paran

Japanese immigrants starting arriving in the region in 1915 Curitiba received significant numbers of immigrants from Japan Nowadays there are about 40 thousand Japanese Brazilians living in the city 

Other immigrants such as jewishes Arabs from Lebanon and Syria English French Russians and other Eastern Europeans also settled in Curitiba

During the 20th century especially after the middle the city is going through a large increase in population and is consolidating as regional hub for trade and services becoming one of the richest cities in Brazil and pioneer in urban solutions In the 1940s and 1950s Alfred Agache co founder of the French Society for Urban Studies was hired to produce the first city plan It emphasised a star of boulevards with public amenities downtown an industrial district and sanitation It was followed when possible but was too expensive to complete

By the 1960s Curitibas population had increased to 430000 and some residents feared that the growth in population threatened to drastically change the character of the city In 1964 Mayor Ivo Arzua solicited proposals for urban design Architect Jaime Lerner  who later became mayor  led a team from the Universidade Federal do Paran that suggested strict controls on urban sprawl a reduction of traffic in the downtown area preservation of Curitibas Historic Sector and a convenient and affordable public transit system This plan known as the Curitiba Master Plan was adopted in 1968 Lerner closed the XV de Novembro St to vehicles because it had very high pedestrian traffic The plan had a new road design to minimise traffic the Trinary Road System This uses two one way streets moving in opposite directions which surround a smaller two lane street where the express buses have their exclusive lane Five of these roads form a star that converges to the city centre Land farther from these roads is zoned for lower density developments to reduce traffic away from the main roads A number of areas subject to floods were condemned and became parks

Currently the immigration of foreigners is small  is common only immigrants from China some Middle Eastern and South American countries  has been replaced by migration of Brazilians from other regions of the country

The emerald ash borer is a shiny green beetle native to Asia It made its way into the United States by accident and has since been spread to eleven states and to the border with Canada

The beetle is an invasive species and a serious pest which destroys ash trees It has killed at least 25 million ash trees so far and threatens to kill most of the ash trees throughout North America

Adults lay eggs in crevasses in the bark Larvae burrow into the bark after hatching and consume the living tissue of cambium and phloem This causes death within two years The average emerging season for the emerald ash borer is early spring to late summer Females lay around 75 eggs but up to 300 from early May to mid July The borers life cycle is estimated to be one year in southern Michigan but may be up to two years in colder regions

Huge efforts have been made to slow down its spread but nothing has worked so far Parasitoid wasps from Asia are being released and a fungus which kills insects is being tried

The ratites are a group of medium to large birds most of which are flightless Most of them including the largest Moas and Elephant birds are now extinct 

Unlike other flightless birds the ratites have no keel on their sternum In a flying bird the sternum anchors the wing muscles 

Most parts of the former super continent Gondwana have ratites or did have until the fairly recent past Their closest living relatives are the tinamous of South America

The classification used here includes all ratites in the order Struthioniformes but not the tinamous This may change in future

It was once thought that ratites were all one monophyletic group which evolved together in Gondwana in the Upper Cretaceous Then they evolved in their separate ways as Gondwana split up and the parts drifted apart The parts became the modern southern continents plus Africa and the Indian subcontinent

However modern gene analysis conflicts with this DNA analysis shows that the ratites diverged from one another too recently to share a common Gondwanian ancestor However all analyses show that rheas and the living AustralasianOceanian ratites are monophyletic 

Recent analysis of twenty nuclear genes suggests that the flighted tinamous cluster within the ratite lineage The timamids are the sister group of the Australo Pacific ratites

If so this would make ratites as a whole paraphyletic rather than monophyletic Since tinamous are weak fliers this raises interesting questions about the evolution of flightlessness in this group If timamous are inside the ratite lineage then ratites evolved flightlessness at least three times Re evolution of flight in the tinamous would be an alternative explanation but that has no precedent in bird evolution while loss of flight is commonplace

Tinamous are ratites Therefore ratites are a group of medium to large birds most of whom are flightless with the exception of the tinamous The ratites evolved flightlessness more than once The similarities between Ostriches and the Australo Pacific ratites is due to convergent evolution

Hurricane Luis was one of the most powerful storms of the very active 1995 Atlantic hurricane season Even though Luis was strong it was still only the second strongest storm in 1995 the strongest was Hurricane Opal Hurricane Luis was the strongest storm to hit the Leeward Islands since Hurricane Hugo in 1989 From August 22 to September 1 Humberto Iris Jerry Luis and Karen were active at the same time Most of the places damaged by Luis were damaged only a week earlier by Hurricane Iris except for the United States and Newfoundland and most of the islands would be damaged again less than two weeks later by Hurricane Marilyn

The early stages of Luiss formation is track back to a tropical wave that moved off of Africa on August 26 The next day it became Tropical Depression Thirteen near Cape Verde It reached Tropical Storm status on the 29th and was named Luis It reached hurricane status on August 30 and reach category 4 strength on September 2 The next day Luis reached its highest winds of 140 mph making it a Category 4 Luis continued west and crossed over Barbuda late on September 4 At this time Luis came very close to Antigua St Barthelemy St Martin and Anguilla Luis turned northwest and while it was 150 miles to the north of Puerto Rico Luis weakened to a category 2 hurricane after being a major hurricane for a week Luis kept slowly weakening and headed to the northeast While Luis was offshore of Newfoundland he caused a wave more then 98 feet tall Luis made landfall in eastern Newfoundland on September 11 while a category 1 That same day Luis became extratropical and died near Greenland 

These were the places impacted by Hurricane Luis Many of the Island Countries were affected by Hurricane Iris a week before many would also be affected by Hurricane Marilyn only ten days later Antigua and Barbuda Luis caused a lot of damage in Antigua and Barbuda because it made landfall in that country In Antigua about 50 of houses were either destroyed of damaged In Barbuda nearly 70 of houses were either destroyed of damaged The government of the country spent about 350 million in US Dollars to fix the damage 

In Bermuda winds were reported up to 46 mph However there was no damage or people killed in Bermuda On September 11 a ship called Queen Elizabeth 2 got caught in the 98 foot wave that Luis caused The ship was not damaged but it arrived late in New York 

The only Providence in Canada affected by Luis was Newfoundland

In Newfoundland Luis killed one person and caused about 500000 in damage Luis dropped 24 to 47 inches of rain while it passed over Newfoundland on September 11 

In Dominica larges waves from Hurricane Luis caused one fisherman to get killed Hurricane Luis caused about 47 million in damage to the island nation 

St Martin a small island was hurt most by Luis Luis did not strike St Martin but it was hurt most by Luis because he caused 9 people to get killed and 18 billion in damage 

In North Carolina a US state a wave caused one person to get killed Also in New York a wave washed under a house and later destroyed causing 19 million in damage 

In Guadeloupe Luis killed one In Saint Barthelemy winds were recorded up to 155 mph In Saint Kitts and Nevis damages from Luis were at 197 million 

After Hurricane Luis many organizations and Governments donated money to help fix the damage on the affect islands The largest donation was the Government of the Netherlands which donated 152 million 

When Tropical Depression Thirteen became Tropical Storm Luis on August 29 it marked the earliest date of a seasons 12th named storm While Luis was becoming extratropical it sped up to nearly 65 mph making it the third fastest traveling Atlantic hurricane On September 11 when Luis caused that 98 foot wave it was the highest wave recorded from an Atlantic hurricane Until 2004 when Hurricane Ivan may have caused a wave up to 130 feet 

The name Luis was retired in the spring of 1996 Luis was the first name retired since Andrew in 1992 Luis was also the first named storm starting with L to get its name retired Luis is now only one of two L names to get retired the other was Lili in 2002 In 2001 Lorenzo was used instead
