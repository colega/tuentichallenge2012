Chondroitin sulfate is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan It is a chain of alternating sugars It is usually found attached to proteins as part of a proteoglycan A chondroitin chain can have over 100 individual sugars each of which can be sulfated in variable positions and quantities Chondroitin sulfate is an important structural component of cartilage and provides much of its resistance to compression Along with glucosamine chondroitin sulfate has become a widely used dietary supplement for treatment of osteoarthritis It is commonly extracted from shark cartilage

Chondroitin sulfate was originally isolated well before chemists learned its structure So its name changed over time Early researchers identified different types of the substance with letters

Chondroitin sulfate B is an old name for dermatan sulfate and it is no longer classified as a form of chondroitin sulfate

Chondroitin without the sulfate has been used to describe a type with little or no sulfation However this distinction is not used by all

The name chondroitin sulfate sounds like a salt with a sulfate counter anion This is not the case The sulfate is attached to the sugar with a covalent bond Since the molecule has multiple negative charges at physiological pH a cation is present in salts of chondroitin sulfate Commercial preparations of chondroitin sulfate typically are the sodium salt Barnhill et al have suggested that all such preparations of chondroitin sulfate be referred to as sodium chondroitin regardless of their sulfation status

Chondroitin sulfate chains are unbranched polysaccharides of variable length containing two alternating monosaccharides D glucuronic acid and N acetyl D galactosamine Some GlcA residues are epimerized into L iduronic acid the resulting disaccharide is then referred to as dermatan sulfate

Chondroitin sulfate chains are linked to hydroxyl groups on serine residues of certain proteins Exactly how proteins are selected for attachment of glycosaminoglycans is not understood Glycosylated serines are often followed by a glycine and have neighboring acidic residues But this does not always predict glycosylation

Attachment of the GAG chain begins with four monosaccharides in a fixed pattern Xyl  Gal  Gal  GlcA Each sugar is attached by a specific enzyme allowing for multiple levels of control over GAG synthesis Xylose begins to be attached to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum while the rest of the sugars are attached in the Golgi apparatus

Each monosaccharide may be left unsulfated sulfated once or sulfated twice In the most common case the hydroxyls of the 4 and 6 positions of the N acetyl galactosamine are sulfated with some chains having the 2 position of glucuronic acid Sulfation is mediated by specific sulfotransferases Sulfation in these different positions gives specific biological activities to chondroitin GAG chains

Chondroitins functions depend largely on the properties of the overall proteoglycan of which it is a part These functions can be broadly divided into structural and regulatory roles Some proteoglycans have both structural and regulatory roles

Chondroitin sulfate is a major component of extracellular matrix and is important in maintaining the structural integrity of tissue This function is typical of the large aggregating proteoglycans aggrecan versican brevican and neurocan collectively termed the lecticans

As part of aggrecan chondroitin sulfate is a major component of cartilage The tightly packed and highly charged sulfate groups of chondroitin sulfate generate electrostatic repulsion that provides much of the resistance of cartilage to compression Loss of chondroitin sulfate from the cartilage is a major cause of osteoarthritis

Regulatory 

Chondroitin sulfate readily interacts with proteins in the extracellular matrix due to its negative charges These interactions are important for regulating many cellular activities The lecticans are a major part of the brain extracellular matrix where the chondroitin sugar chains function to stabilize normal brain synapses as part of perineuronal nets The levels of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are vastly increased after injury to the central nervous system where they act to prevent regeneration of damaged nerve endings Although these functions are not as well characterized as those of heparan sulfate new roles continue to be discovered for the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans

In cortical development chondroitin sulfate is expressed by the Sub Plate and acts as a stop signal for neurons migrating from the Ventricular Zone Neurons stopping here may then be programmed for further migration to specific layers in the cortical plate

Chondroitin is in dietary supplements used as an alternative medicine to treat osteoarthritis and also approved and regulated as a symptomatic slow acting drug for this disease in Europe and some other countries It is commonly sold together with glucosamine Chondroitin and glucosamine are also used in veterinary medicine

The optic chiasma or optic chiasm is the part of the brain where the optic nerves partially cross The optic chiasm is located at the bottom of the brain immediately below the hypothalamus

The images on the nasal sides of each retina cross over to the opposite side of the brain via the optic nerve at the optic chiasm The temporal images on the other hand stay on the same side This allows the images from either side of the visual field to go to the appropriate side of the brain combining the sides together 

Beyond the optic chiasm with crossed and uncrossed fibers optic nerves become optic tracts 

This system allows for parts of both eyes that attend to the right visual field to be processed in the left visual system in the brain and vice versa

Youth is the opposite of elderly When something is new it can be called young Old can refer to someone or somethings age Young can mean that something is current to date or well before its best by date Different things lose their youth or grow old at different rates For example technology has a short life span and can only be considered young for roughly one year In many countries humans are no longer young at 18 years old

In our society youth has become an obsession People nowadays want to look young Becuase of this many anti ageing products like face cream and plasic surgery have been used to try and stop peoples skin from looking older The Fountain of Youth was a popular myth and people thought that if you took water from the fountain you would never look old Now however we know that this was a myth and it was not magical at all

The simplified molecular input line entry specification or SMILES is a line notation for the chemical structure of molecules It uses a short series ASCII characters to represent structures Most molecule editor computer programs can draw a two dimensional diagram or a three dimensional model of a molecule based on its SMILES code

Arthur Weininger and David Weininger wrote the original SMILES specification in the late 1980s It has since been modified and extended by others including by Daylight Chemical Information Systems Inc In 2007 the Blue Obelisk open source chemistry community developed an open standard called OpenSMILES

In July 2006 the IUPAC introduced the InChI as a standard line notation for representing chemical structures People think that it is easier for humans to understand SMILES than InChI Some chemists argue that SMILES is better than InChI because many different software programs support it SMILES also has theoretical backing

SMILES can be converted back to 2 dimensional representations using Structure Diagram Generation algorithms This conversion can sometimes be ambiguous Because SMILES just says which atoms are connected without any information about the angles between chemical bonds computer programs use energy minimization to convert SMILES to 3 dimensional representations There are many downloadable and web based conversion utilities

Here are some examples of the SMILES for molecules

Cheminformatics is the study of large amounts of chemical information It is done mostly with the help of computers These tools are used by pharmaceutical companies to discovery new drugs 

Cheminformatics uses computer science and information technology to help solve chemistry problems Cheminformatics deals with algorithms databases and information systems web technologies artificial intelligence and soft computing information and computation theory software engineering data mining image processing modeling and simulation signal processing discrete mathematics control and system theory circuit theory and statistics for generating new knowledge of chemistry 

The term chemoinformatics was defined by FK Brown in 1998 

 Chemoinformatics is the mixing of those information resources to transform data into information and information into knowledge for the intended purpose of making better decisions faster in the area of drug lead identification and optimization 

Since then people use both spellings Cheminformatics but groups in Europe adopted in 2006 Chemoinformatics The recent establishment of the Journal of Cheminformatics is a strong push towards the shorter name

Cheminformatics combines the scientific working fields of chemistry and computer science for example in the area of topology and chemical graph theory and mining of chemical data Cheminformatics can also be applied to data analysis for various industries like paper and pulp dyes and such allied industries

The primary application of cheminformatics is in the storage of information relating to compounds The efficient search of such stored information includes topics that are dealt with in computer science as data mining and machine learning

Computers represent chemical structures in specialized formats such as the XML based Chemical Markup Language or SMILES These representations are often used for storage in large chemical databases While some formats are suited for visual representations in 2 or 3 dimensions others are more suited for studying physical interactions modeling and docking studies

Chemical data can pertain to real or virtual molecules Virtual libraries of compounds may be generated in various ways to explore chemical space and hypothesize new compounds with desired properties

Virtual libraries of classes of compounds were recently generated using the FOG algorithm  This was done by using cheminformatic tools to train transition probabilities of a Markov chain on authentic classes of compounds and then using the Markov chain to generate novel compounds that were similar to the training database

In contrast to high throughput screening virtual screening involves computationally screening in silico libraries of compounds by means of various methods such as docking to identify members likely to possess desired properties such as biological activity against a given target In some cases combinatorial chemistry is used in the development of the library to increase the efficiency in mining the chemical space More commonly a resarcher searches a diverse library of small molecules or natural products

This is the calculation of quantitative structure activity relationship and quantitative structure property relationship values used to predict the activity of compounds from their structures These studies link cheminofrmatics to chemometrics Chemical expert systems are also relevant They represent parts of chemical knowledge in computers

An access control system ensures that no employee can punch in for another which eliminates time fraud and reduces payroll costs Because every persons fingerprint iris voice retina face hand vein and signature are unique a biometric time clock provides a quick accurateand reliable way to record In and Out punches for each employee That is why many companies now employ biometrics

In recent times there are large number of biometric systems that are commercially available Such biometric systems are based on unique characteristics of human being The most common reliable and successful system is the one based on fingerprints Users are supposed to put their thumbindex finger in the finger reader The system then compares the fingerprint that is read with the one in the central database for authentication

Most biometric systems do not keep an image of the fingerprint but a template A template is basically a number that is calculated based on various characteristics of the fingerprint This is done so that persons may not sneak unauthorised images of fingerprints into the database When a fingerprint is to be matched its template number is computed and compared with that stored in the database Most systems allow for dry greasy chaffed and minor cuts on the fingers The other biometric systems are based on retina of the eye palm photograph or voice pattern recognition The palm based systems take the image of the palm from various angles and compare them The system that is based on fingerprints is most popular and economicalcn

Alexander Ivanovich Oparin was a Soviet biochemist

He was notable for his contributions to the theory of the origin of life and for his authorship of the book The Origin of Life One of his ideas was that oxygen would tend to destroy organic molecules essential for the evolution of early life It was later found that the earths atmosphere at first had almost no oxygen in it

He also studied the biochemistry of material processing by plants and enzyme reactions in plant cells He developed the foundations for industrial biochemistry in the USSR

These were some of the main ideas in his first book

1 There is no fundamental difference between a living organism and lifeless matter Life must have arisen as a natural evolution of matter 

2 Methane in the atmospheres of Jupiter and the other giant planets so Oparin thought the infant Earth had a strongly reducing atmosphere containing methane ammonia hydrogen and water vapor In his opinion these were the raw materials for the evolution of life

3 At first there were the simple solutions of organic substances The behaviour of these was governed by the properties of their component atoms and the arrangement of those atoms in the molecular structure But gradually as the result of growth and increased complexity of the molecules structures with new properties developed These newer properties were determined by the spatial and mutual arrangement of the molecules 

4 In this process biological orderliness already exists Competition speed of cell growth survival of the fittest struggle for existence and finally natural selection produced the characteristics of living things 

Oparin outlined a way in which basic organic chemicals might form into microscopic localized systems These would be precursors of the cell from which primitive living things could develop He cited work done into organic chemicals which in solution may form droplets and layers Oparin suggested that different types might have formed in the Earths primordial ocean and been subject to a selection process leading eventually to life

Melvin Sy Oliver was a jazz arranger trumpeter composer singer and bandleader His mother was a piano teacher and his father was a multi instrumentalist who made a name for himself demonstrating saxophones at a time that instrument was little used outside of marching bands

Oliver left home at 17 to play with Zack Whyte and his Chocolate Beau Brummels and later with Alphonse Trent He sang and played trumpet with these bands becoming known for his growling horn playing

Sy arranged and conducted many songs for Ella Fitzgerald from her years with Decca Records As a composer one of his most famous songs was Taint What You Do which he co wrote with Trummy Young

He joined Jimmie Luncefords band in 1933 and contributed many hit arrangements to the band including My Blue Heaven and Aint She Sweet In 1939 he became one of the first African Americans with a prominent role in a white band when he joined Tommy Dorsey as an arranger though he ceased playing trumpet at that time He led the transition of the Dorsey band from Dixieland to modern big band His joining was instrumental in Buddy Richs decision to join Dorsey His arrangement of On the Sunny Side of the Street was a big hit for Dorsey as were his own compositions Yes Indeed Opus One The Minor is Muggin TDs Boogie Woogie and Well Git It

After leaving Dorsey Oliver continued working as a free lance arranger  one of his more successful such efforts was the Frank Sinatra album I Remember Tommy a combined tribute to each mans former boss  and as music director for Decca Records

In later years up until 1980 he led his own jazz band for which he took up the trumpet again

The Aristolochiaceae or Birthwort family are a family of flowering plants with seven genera and about 400 species belonging to the order Piperales The type genus is Aristolochia L

They are mostly perennial herbaceous plants shrubs woody vines or even lianas

The membranous cordate simple leaves are spread out growing alternately along the stem on leaf stalks The margins are commonly entire There are no stipules

The bizarre flowers are large to medium sized growing in the leaf axils They are bilaterally or radially symmetrical

The Aristolochiaceae are magnoliids a basal group of angiosperms which are not part of the large categories of monocots or eudicots

Some newer classification schemes place the family Aristolochiaceae in the order Piperales

Many members of Aristolochia and some of Asarum contain the toxin aristolochic acid which defence against predators in this case herbivores It is known to be carcinogenic in rats Aristolochia itself is carcinogenic to humans

Pipevine swallowtail butterflies lay their eggs on pipevine and the larvae dine on the plant but are not affected by the toxin which then offers the adult butterfly protection against predators

Context is what surrounds a word or piece of text In order to understand what words mean we have to know something about the situation where they are used

In print a word phrase or sentence has other text around it That helps the reader to understand the piece in question In speech the social setting as well as the language help the listener to understand what is said

Something like You can take it whenever you need to might refer to almost anything But if it is said by a doctor to a patient then the context is clear and the listener can guess it refers to some kind of medication So the context is what goes with a text which helps the reader understand the communication

The 2011 Sindh floods started during mid August 2011 because of a lot of rain in Sindh Eastern Balochistan and Southern Punjab The floods have caused a lot of damage 270 people died and 53 million people were affected 12 million homes were sunk Sindh is considered a good region and often called the breakfast of the country The damage caused by the floods in the area is large At least 17 million acres of land have been ruined because of the flooding The flooding is the worst since the 2010 floods in Pakistan

In the month of July Pakistan had low monsoon rains however in August and September the country received above normal monsoon rains A strong weather pattern entered the areas of Sindh from the Indian states of Rajasthan and Gujarat in August and gained strength with the passage of time and caused heavy downpours The four week long continuous rains have created floods in Sindh that have never been seen before

In chemistry hybridization mixes atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals suitable for the qualitative description of atomic bonding properties Hybridized orbitals are very useful in the explanation of the shape of molecular orbitals for molecules It is a central part of valence bond theory

Chemist Linus Pauling first used the hybridization theory to explain the structure of molecules such as methane This concept was developed for such simple chemical systems But the approach was later applied more widely Today chemists use it to explain the structures of organic compounds

Chemists making quantitative calculations use molecular orbital theory rather than hybridization theory The problems with hybridization are most visible in coordination chemistry and organometallic chemistry In those problem cases the d orbitals are involved in bonding Using hybridization theory in transition metal chemistry is not generally as accurate as using them in organic chemistry

Orbitals represent how electrons behave within molecules In the case of simple hybridization this approximation is based on atomic orbitals Chemists use the atomic orbitals of the hydrogen atom which the only atom for which an exact analytic solution to its Schrdinger equation is known In heavier atoms like carbon nitrogen and oxygen the atomic orbitals involved in bonding are the 2s and 2p orbitals These orbitals can be occupied in a hydrogen atom but only when the electron is in an excited state Hybridized orbitals are assumed to be mixtures of these atomic orbitals superimposed on each other in various proportions The theory of hybridization is most applicable under these assumptions It gives a simple orbital picture equivalent to Lewis structures Hybridization is not required to describe molecules but for molecules made up from carbon nitrogen and oxygen the hybridization theorymodel makes the description much easier

Chemists use hybridization theory mainly in organic chemistry Its explanation starts with the way the atoms in methane bond together

The valence bond theory would predict based on the existence of two half filled p type orbitals that C forms two covalent bonds ie CH2 However methylene is a very reactive molecule and cannot exist outside of a molecular system Therefore this theory alone cannot explain the existence of CH4

Furthermore ground state orbitals cannot be used for bonding in CH4 While exciting a 2s electron into a 2p orbital would in theory allow for four bonds according to the valence bond theory this would imply that the various bonds of CH4 would have differing energies due to differing levels of orbital overlap Once again this has been experimentally disproved any hydrogen can be removed from a carbon with equal ease

So to explain the existence of CH4 a method by which as many as 12 bonds of equal strength was required

The proton that forms the nucleus of a hydrogen atom attracts one of the lower energy valence electrons on carbon This causes an excitation moving a 2s electron into a 2p orbital This however increases the influence of the carbon nucleus on the valence electrons by increasing the effective core potential The effective core potential is also known as the effective nuclear charge or Zeff

The solution to the Schrdinger equation for this configuration is a linear combination of the s and p wave functions or orbitals known as a hybridized orbital In the case of carbon attempting to bond with four hydrogens four orbitals are required Therefore the 2s orbital mixes with the three 2p orbitals to form four sp3 hybrids See graphical summary below

In CH4 four sp3 hybridised orbitals are overlapped by hydrogens 1s orbital yielding four bonds All four bonds are of the same length and strength This theory fits experimental findings

If these orbitals recombine with the empty s orbitals of 4 hydrogens and allow maximum separation between the 4 hydrogens then at any orientation of the p orbitals a single hydrogen has an overlap of 25 with the s orbital of the C and a total of 75 of overlap with the 3 p orbitals

According to the orbital hybridization theory the valence electrons in methane should be equal in energy but its photoelectron spectrum shows two bands one at 127 eV and one at 23 eV This apparent inconsistency can be explained when one considers additional orbital mixing taking place when the sp3 orbitals mix with the 4 hydrogen orbitals

Other carbon based compounds and other molecules may be explained in a similar way as methane For example ethene has a double bond between the carbons

forming a total of 3 sp2 orbitals with one p orbital remaining In ethylene the two carbon atoms form a bond by overlapping two sp2 orbitals and each carbon atom forms two covalent bonds with hydrogen by ssp2 overlap all with 120 angles The bond between the carbon atoms perpendicular to the molecular plane is formed by 2p2p overlap The hydrogencarbon bonds are all of equal strength and length which agrees with experimental data

The amount of p character is not restricted to integer values ie hybridizations like sp25 are also readily described In this case the geometries are somewhat distorted from the ideally hybridized picture For example as stated in Bents rule a bond tends to have higher p character when directed toward a more electronegative substituent

In this model the 2s orbital mixes with only one of the three p orbitals resulting in two sp orbitals and two remaining unchanged p orbitals The chemical bonding in acetylene consists of spsp overlap between the two carbon atoms forming a bond and two additional bonds formed by pp overlap Each carbon also bonds to hydrogen in a sigma ssp overlap at 180 angles

Hybridization along with the VSEPR theory helps to explain molecule shape

Commonly the hybridization of the oxygen in water is described as sp3 following the guidelines of VSEPR and the tetrahedral electron geometry it implies In order for this to be true the two electron pairs would be in equal energy symmetrical sp3 hybridized orbitals However molecular orbitals calculations give orbitals which reflect the symmetry of the molecule One of the two lone pairs is in a pure p type orbital with its electron density perpendicular to the H O H framework The other lone pair is an orbital that is close to an sp2 type orbital that is in the same plane as the H O H bonding It is not a purely sp2 type orbital but is extra rich in s character Photoelectron spectra confirm the presence of two different energies for the non bonded electrons

In contrast the orbitals used to make the O H bonds are close to sp2 hybrids but are extra p rich However molecular orbital theory does not give two equivalent bonds but two delocalized orbitals which are in phase and out of phase combinations of the H O bond orbitals It has been argued that it is this change in the mixing of the orbitals that is responsible for the compression of the H O H angle down to the 1045 degrees measured in experiments not some change in the repulsion of electrons However if the molecular orbitals are localized leaving the total wave function unaltered one obtains two equivalent lone pairs and two equivalent bonds 

An accurate prediction of the bond angle requires however that polarization d functions be added to the molecular orbital calculation So while VSEPR and its application to hybridization predicts the correct atomic framework for water it may do so for the wrong reason

Hybridization theory has failed in a few aspects notably in explaining the energy considerations for the involvement of d orbitals in chemical bonding This can be well explained by means of an example Consider for instance how the theory in question accounts for the bonding in phosphorus pentachloride The d orbitals are large comparatively distant from the nucleus and high in energy Radial distances of orbitals from the nucleus seem to reveal that d orbitals are far too high in energy to mix with s and p orbitals 3s 047 3p 055 3d 24 Thus at first glance sp3d hybridization seems improbable

However a closer examination of the factors that affect orbital size reveals more Formal charge on the central atom is one such factor and it is obvious that the P atom in PCl5 carries quite a large partial positive charge Thus the 3d orbital contracts in size to such an extent that hybridization with s and p orbitals may occur Further note the cases in which d orbital participation was proposed in hybridization SF6 IF7 XeF6 in all these molecules the central atom is surrounded by the highly electronegative fluorine atom thus making hybridization probable among s p and d orbitals A further study reveals that orbital size also depends on the number of electrons occupying it And even further coupling of d orbital electrons also results in contraction albeit to a lesser extent

The molecular orbital theory however offers a clearer insight into the bonding in these molecules

Hybridization theory is an integral part of organic chemistry and in general discussed together with molecular orbital theory in advanced organic chemistry textbooks although for different reasons One textbook notes that for drawing reaction mechanisms sometimes a classical bonding picture is needed with two atoms sharing two electrons It also comments that predicting bond angles in methane with MO theory is not straightforward Another textbook treats hybridization theory when explaining bonding in alkenes and a third uses MO theory to explain bonding in hydrogen but hybridisation theory for methane

Although the language and pictures arising from hybridization theory more widely known as valence bond theory remain widespread in synthetic organic chemistry this qualitative view of bonding has been largely superseded by molecular orbital theory when a more detailed analysis is required Advanced texts often stress that while hybrid orbital theory is still useful for problems requiring a rough approximation it provides an incomplete picture that cannot account for many chemical phenomena One specific problem with hybridisation is that it incorrectly predicts the photoelectron spectra of many molecules including such fundamental species such as methane and water From a pedagogical perspective hybridization approach tends to over emphasize localisation of bonding electrons and does not effectively embrace molecular symmetry as does MO theory

Bonding orbitals formed from hybrid atomic orbitals may be considered as localized molecular orbitals which can be formed from the delocalized orbitals of molecular orbital theory by an appropriate mathematical transformation For molecules with a closed electron shell in the ground state this transformation of the orbitals leaves the total many electron wave function unchanged The hybrid orbital description of the ground state is therefore equivalent to the delocalized orbital description for explaining the ground state total energy and electron density as well as the molecular geometry which corresponds to the minimum value of the total energy

There is no such equivalence however for ionized or excited states with open electron shells Hybrid orbitals cannot therefore be used to interpret photoelectron spectra which measure the energies of ionized states identified with delocalized orbital energies using Koopmans theorem Nor can they be used to interpret UV visible spectra which correspond to electronic transitions between delocalized orbitals

A palatal consonant is a consonant that is pronounced with the body of the tongue against the hard palate There is only one palatal consonant in English which is j which is the sound for y in the English word yes The most common palatal consonant used in the world is j

These are the palatal consonants in the International Phonetic Alphabet

An approximant consonant is a consonant that sounds in some ways like a vowel For example lateral approximants like the sound for l in the English word like the sound for r in the English word right and semivowels like the sound for y in yes and the sound for w in wet are all approximants These sounds are pronounced by bringing two parts of the mouth for example the tongue and the roof of the mouth close to each other However it is not close enough to cause the air to be blocked like in a fricative consonant Also the parts are not far apart enough to become a vowel

Semivowels are a type of approximant consonant which sound like vowels if you pronounced them alone However many languages use them as consonants Here are the common semivowels in the International Phonetic Alphabet 

In lateral approximants only the centre of the tongue touches the roof of the mouth So air can only flow through the sides of the tongue like the sound l in like

The M25 motorway or London Orbital is a convert117mikmsingon orbital motorway around Greater London 

The motorway was first suggested early in the 20th century and a few sections were built in the early 1970s The M25 was completed in 1986 is one of the worlds longest orbital roads 

It is one of the busiest and most congested parts of the British motorway network 196000 vehicles were recorded in a single day near London Heathrow Airport The M25 is a cruclial link between the four main London airports Heathrow Gatwick Stansted and Luton

Bearing in mind that no motorways go through the centre of London the M25 is a main route connecting north with south and east with the west of England

The motorway was originally built with only six lanes despite research which suggested eight lanes were necessary Now a fourth lane exists over most of the motorway and more in special sections Plans were scaled back in 2009 in response to rising costs but work is still going on

Public enquiries continued through the 1970s and 1980s Each section had its own enquiry where local citizens and interest groups could question the plans In all 39 public inquiries before independent Inspectors were held taking over 700 sitting days with many more working days preparing evidence Objectors could put forward alternatives and each of these these had to be answered with presentation of evidence Evidence included predictions of traffic and events which would affect growth of traffic Enquiries and evidence were open to public scrutiny and debate 

Some enquiries lasted a day and one one lasted 97 sitting days over 13 months Proposals had to go before Parliament and a special Act was needed to authorise the crossing of the northern tip of Epping Forest by the route in tunnel

As predicted by research soon after the motorway opened in 1986 traffic levels exceeded maximum designed capacity In 1990 the Secretary of State for Transport announced plans to widen the whole of the M25 to four lanes By 1993 the motorway that was designed for a maximum of 88000 vehicles per day was carrying 200000 15 of UK motorway traffic volume was on the M25 and there were plans to add 6 lanes to the section from Junction 12 to 15 as well widening the rest of the motorway to 4 lanes

In 1995 a contract was awarded to widen the section between junctions 8 and 10 from six to eight lanes for a cost of 934 million and a Motorway Incident Detection and Automatic Signalling system was introduced to the M25 from junction 10 to junction 15 at a cost of 135m in 1995 and then extended to junction 16 at a cost of 117m in 2002 This consists of a distributed network of traffic and weather sensors speed cameras and variable speed signs that control traffic speeds with little human supervision The system has improved traffic flow slightly and reduced the amount of start stop driving

In 1995 there was a proposal to widen the section close to Heathrow Airport to 14 lanes This attracted fierce opposition from road protesters opposing the Newbury Bypass and other schemes and it was cancelled shortly afterwards However in 1997 the Department of Transport announced new proposals to widen the section from junction 12 and junction 15 to 12 lanes At the Terminal Five public inquiry a Highways Agency official said that the widening was needed to accommodate traffic to the proposed new terminal however the transport minister said that no such evidence had been given Environmental groups objected to the decision to go ahead without holding a public inquiry A decision to go ahead was given for a 10 lane scheme in 1998 and the 148 million M25 Jct 12 to 15 Widening contract was awarded to Balfour Beatty in 2003 The scheme was completed in 2005 as dual five lane between junctions 12 to 14 and dual six lanes from 14 to 15

The road cost 1 billion and took 11 years to build It used two million tons of concrete and 3 million tons of asphalt

Traffic bottleneck at the Dartford Crossing in the east is the greatest problem on the motorway at present even though the crossing is technically not part of the M25 At present the crossing is by bridge from the north and by tunnel from the south There are usually long tailbacks in both directions

Harold Clayton Urey was an American physical chemist His pioneering work on isotopes earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934 He played a significant role in the development of the atom bomb and he had ideas on the development of organic life from non living matter

Urey earned a degree in zoology from the University of Montana and a PhD in chemistry studying thermodynamics under Gilbert N Lewis at the University of California Berkeley 

At Berkeley Urey was influenced by the work of physicist Raymond T Birge and soon joined Niels Bohr in Copenhagen to work on atomic structure at the Institute for Theoretical Physics 

On his return to the US and between 1924 and 1928 he taught at The Johns Hopkins University as Associate in Chemistry and then at Columbia where he assembled a team of associates He wrote Atoms quanta and molecules one of the first English texts on quantum mechanics and its applications to atomic and molecular systems 

He discovered deuterium isolating it by repeatedly distilling a sample of liquid hydrogen In 1931 he and his associates went on to demonstrate the existence of heavy water Urey was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934 for this work

During World War II Ureys team at Columbia worked on a number of research programs that contributed towards the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb for the United States Most importantly they developed the gaseous diffusion method to separate uranium 235 from uranium 238 In autumn 1941 Urey with GB Pegram led a diplomatic mission to England to establish co operation on the development of the atomic bomb

Isaac Asimov a student at Columbia at this time remembers Urey lamenting perhaps too strongly how pained he was that he could do nothing to help the war effort Asimov pointed out innocently that perhaps the enriched uranium kept at Columbia may have had something to do with the war effort Urey reddened and changed the subject Urey had worried about the German atomic bomb while working on uranium separation at Columbia during the war and now referred to the most dangerous situation that humanity has ever faced in all history

After the war Urey became professor of chemistry at the Institute for Nuclear Studies then Ryerson professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago before moving to the University of California San Diego A UCSD building was named in his honor in the early 1960s during a time when nearly all buildings other than student dormitories had only generic names The name of the building is actually the Frieda and Harold Urey Hall Urey would have rejected the honor he hated the architecture of the building but since it also honored his wife he accepted

In later life Urey helped develop the field of cosmochemistry and is credited with coining the term His work on oxygen 18 led him to develop theories about the abundance of the chemical elements on Earth and of their abundance and evolution in the stars This work was among the pioneering paleoclimatic research Urey summarised his work in the book The planets their origin and development Urey speculated that the early terrestrial atmosphere was probably composed of ammonia methane and hydrogen it was one of his Chicago graduate students Stanley L Miller who showed that if such a mixture be exposed to electric sparks and to water it can interact to produce amino acids commonly called the building blocks of life

Urey died at La Jolla California and is buried in the Fairfield Cemetery in DeKalb County Indiana While working at Columbia University Urey was a resident of Leonia New Jersey

It was well adapted to the cold it had thick shaggy fur small ears short legs and a massive body Fossils of this early rhino have been found in addition to well preserved corpses which were found in frozen gravel in Siberia Stone Age humans hunted woolly rhinos they drew pictures of the rhinos on cave walls 30000 years ago giving us even more information about these large mammals 

The woolly mammoth is a species of mammoth This animal is known from bones and frozen carcasses from northern North America and northern Eurasia The best preserved carcasses in Siberia They are perhaps the most well known species of mammoth

This mammoth species was first recorded in deposits of a former glaciation in Eurasia perhaps 150000 years ago

It disappeared from most of its range at the end of the Pleistocene with a dwarfed race still living on Wrangel Island until about 1700 BC

Woolly mammoths were large elephants that lived during the ice ages Cave paintings of the woolly mammoth have been found in France and Spain Woolly mammoths are closely related to the Indian elephant

The Acoelomorpha are a disputed phylum of animals with features that were considered to belong to the phylum Platyhelminthes

In 2004 molecular studies demonstrated that they are a separate phylum although their position in the tree of life is uncertain Earlier work dismissed the phylum as paraphyletic with Acoela and Nemertodermatida as separate clades

An ongoing collaborative research project has the researchers confident that they can reach an agreement about where acoels fit in evolutionary history

Acoels are almost entirely marine living between grains of sediment swimming as plankton or crawling on algae Acoels have a statocyst which presumably helps them orient to gravity Their soft bodies make them difficult to classify

A chess rating system is a system used in chess to estimate the strength of a player based on his performance against other players They are used by all national chess organisations and by FIDE the International Chess Federation In these systems a higher number indicates a stronger player In general a players rating goes up if he performs better than expected and down if he performs worse than expected The Elo rating system is used by FIDE and by many countries 

The first modern rating system was used by the Correspondence Chess League of America in 1939 Soviet player Andrey Khachatoruv proposed a similar system in 1946 The first one that made an impact on international chess was the Ingo system in 1948 The USCF adopted the Harkness system in 1950 Shortly after the British Chess Federation started using a system devised by Sir Richard Clarke a statistician and senior civil servant The USCF switched to the Elo rating system in 1960 which was adopted by FIDE in 1970

The principle which lies behind a grade is this The grade is a prediction of how well a player will perform against other players of different grades If the player does better than predicted his grade goes up if he does worse his grade goes down An arithmetic calculation shows by how much the players grade changes Today all results are fed into a computer database and computer software does all the calculations Then the list is published as a grading list

The palate is the roof of the mouth in humans and other mammals It separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity 

A similar structure is found in crocodilia but in most other tetrapods the oral and nasal cavities are not truly separate 

The palate is divided into two parts the anterior bony hard palate and the posterior fleshy soft palate or velum 

The hard palate is formed before birth If the fusion is not complete it is called a cleft palate This is a birth or congenital defect

As the roof of the mouth was once considered the seat of the sense of taste palate can also refer to this sense itself as in the phrase a discriminating palate By further extension the flavour of a food may be called its palate

The Myxozoa are a group of parasitic animals of aquatic environments 

Over 1300 species have been described and many have a two host life cycle involving a fish and an annelid worm or bryozoan

They were once considered as parasitic protozoa but are now known to be members of the phylum Cnidaria Analysis of 50 coding genes from Buddenbrockia showed the Myxozoa were severely modified members of the Cnidaria 

Similarities between myxozoan polar capsules and cnidarian nematocysts had been known for a long time but previously were thought to be the result of convergent evolution

Pederpes is an extinct genus of early Carboniferous tetrapod dating from the lower Mississippian 359345 million years ago Pederpes contains one species P finneyae 1 m long

This earliest known Carboniferous tetrapod had a large somewhat triangular head similar to that of later American Whatcheeria The feet look like the feet of later more terrestrially adapted Carboniferous forms 

Pederpes is the earliest known tetrapod to show the start of walking on land Despite the probable presence of a sixth digit on the forelimbs it was at least functionally pentadactyl

Pederpes was discovered in 1971 in central Scotland and classified as a lobe finned fish The type specimen was a nearly complete articulated skeleton Only the tail and some bones of the skull and limbs were missing It was not until 2002 that Jennifer Clack named and reclassified the fossil as a primitive tetrapod 

Pederpes is of uncertain relationship to other tetrapod families While undoubtedly amphibian in life mode Pederpes is not considered an amphibian in the meaning of modern amphibians It is a very basal tetrapod

Pederpes is an important fossil because it comes from the period of time known as Romers gap a 20 million year gap in the sequence of tetrapod fossils It is therefore a transitional fossil and gives biologists rare information about the development of tetrapods in a time when terrestrial life was scarce

Pederpes was 1 metre long including tail This is average sized for an early tetrapod 

The shape of the skull and the fact that the feet face forward rather than outward This shows that Pederpes was well adapted to life on land It is the earliest known fully terrestrial animal although the structure of the ear shows that its hearing was still much more functional underwater than on land It may have spent much of its time in the water and could have hunted there

The narrow skull suggests that Pederpes breathed by inhaling with a muscular action like most modern tetrapods rather than by pumping air into the lungs with a throat pouch the way modern amphibians usually do

Joggins Nova Scotia Canada is famous for its fossils dating to the Pennsylvanian Coal Age of Earth history On July 7 2008 a 15 km length of the coast comprising the Joggins Fossil Cliffs was officially inscribed on the World Heritage List 

The dating of this site has been debated with dates from 320 million years ago to 305 mya being suggestedp39 It is now settled as 31453134 mya  11 million yearsp40

The dramatic coastal exposure of the Coal Age rocks known as the Joggins Fossil Cliffs are continually hewn and freshly exposed by the actions of the tides in the Cumberland Basin Geologists were first attracted to this locality in the late 1820s A little later the first student party studied Joggins in 1835 

However the true fame of Joggins dates from the visits in 1842 and 1852 by Charles Lyell the founder of modern geology and author of Principles of Geology In his Elements of Geology Lyell called the Joggins exposure of Coal Age rocks and fossils the finest example in the world The fossil record at Joggins figures in Charles Darwins On the Origin of Species and played a role in the 1860 Oxford evolution debate between Thomas Huxley and Bishop Wilberforce

Much of the early work to document the fossil record at Joggins was by Nova Scotian geologist William Dawson who had a close personal and working relationship with his friend and mentor Charles Lyell Much of Dawsons collection is in the Redpath Museum of McGill University 

In 1852 Lyell and Dawson made a celebrated discovery of tetrapod fossils entombed within an upright tree at Coal Mine Point Subsequent investigations by Dawson led to the discovery of one of the most important fossils in the history of science Hylonomus lyelli which remains the earliest known reptile in the history of life but not the earliest known amniote In 2002 Hylonomus lyelli was named the provincial fossil of Nova Scotia

Trackways are preserved at the Joggins Fossil Cliffs The tree like lycopod Sigillaria is preserved in situ

There has been a surge in interest in Joggins over the past 20 years Mike Rygels thesis significantly advanced understanding of the sites history stratigraphy sedimentology and biota after the century of neglect which followed Dawsons death in 1899

A vital early tetrapod fossil has been found here the earliest synapsid Protoclepsydrops which is actually earlier than Hylonomus

In 2007 a 15 km length of the coast comprising the Joggins Fossil Cliffs was nominated by Canada to UNESCO as a natural World Heritage Site It was officially inscribed on the World Heritage List in on July 7 2008

The human shoulder is made up of three bones the clavicle the scapula and the humerus as well as muscles ligaments and tendons 

The articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joints The shoulder joint is the part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula the head sitting in the glenoid fossa The shoulder as a whole is the complete group of structures in the region of the joint

There are two kinds of cartilage in the joint The first type is the white cartilage on the ends of the bones which allows the bones to glide and move on each other When this type of cartilage starts to wear out the joint becomes painful and stiff 

The labrum is a second kind of cartilage in the shoulder which is distinctly different from the articular cartilage This cartilage is more fibrous or rigid than the cartilage on the ends of the ball and socket Also this cartilage is also found only around the socket where it is attached

The shoulder must be mobile enough for the wide range actions of the arms and hands but also stable enough to allow for actions such as lifting pushing and pulling The compromise between mobility and stability results in a large number of shoulder problems not faced by other joints such as the hip

At midnight on March 30 1995 Selena and Perez drove to Saldivars motel room Perez had waited for Selena by his pick up truck Selena went inside Saldivars motel room Selena asked for the documents that she needed for taxes Saldivar gave her some of the missing documents When Selena and Perez arrived back home Selena noticed that Saldivar did not give her all the papers she had needed of March 31 1995 At the motel Selena demanded the financial papers Saldvar delayed the handover by claiming she had been raped in Mexico Saldivar called Selena and asked her to come back to her motel room alone Perez told Selena that its too late outside Selena then told Saldivar that she will see her the next morning Perez did not know of this 

On the morning of March 31 Selena drove to Saldivars motel room When she had arrived Selena asked for the missing documents Saldivar delayed and told Selena that she had been raped in Mexico by a gang member Selena had felt bad and took her to a local hospital There a doctor and nurse checked to see for any signs of rape When they were finished the doctor and nurse took Selena aside and told her that Saldivar was making the whole thing up Selena now frustrated took Saldivar back to her motel room When they had arrived back Selena asked once again for the missing documents Saldivar then began to argue with Selena A complaint was made from the next room They asked motel staff if they can ask the two ladies to stop arguing Around this time Selena had removed the ring Saldivar had bought her Selena announced that she can no longer trust Saldivar anymore Selena attempted to leave

At 1149 am Saldivar went by her purse and took out a pistol As Selena turned around Saldivar shot her in the back The gunshot instantly damaged Selenas major artery This artery had led blood to and from Selenas heart Selena ran out of the motel room and screamed Help me help me help me Saldivar chased after Selena and called her a bitch Saldivar was attempting to shoot Selena again However Saldivar went back to the motel room 

Selena ran 392 feet to the motel lobby She had left behind a trail of blood Selena fell to the floor and asked to lock the doors She told the clerk that shes going to shot me again The staff tried to comfort Selena to get answers on what had happened A staff member called 9 1 1 Someone in the lobby recognized Selena and had screamed thats Selena Selena gave the room number where she had been shot The information was then given to the local police By this time an employee began comforting Selena He noticed that Selena began fading away He also noticed that there was little moaning and moving from Selena 

The ambulance had arrived in less than one minute They ripped off the top portion of Selenas jogging suit They then put a Vaseline gloss on Selenas wound This stopped the internal bleeding At this time Selenas heartbeat was very low A paramedic began CPR so that blood can pass through Selenas brain and heart

Saldivar got into her pick up truck She tried to leave the parking lot of the motel However a police officer was already heading that way The police officer saw Saldivars car Saldivar then reversed and parked her car between two cars The police then blocked the car from leaving the spot The police then came out and ordered Saldivar to freeze Saldivar then put the pistol to her right temple More police officers tried to get Saldivar to give herself up They then called the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit and SWAT team 

Around this time a paramedic tried to give Selena an IV However because Selena had bleed out and having little or no blood pressure her veins collapsed to a single point This was very hard to insert an IV The paramedic then called Memorial Hospital that they have a shooting victim and cannot insert an IV 

Navigation Boulevard was shut down by local police as they investigate the crime scene At noon the paramedics arrived at the hospital Doctors and nurses tried to revive Selena When the opened her chest they found out that there was no blood at all They then did a blood transfusion However Selena was a Jehovahs Witnesses who did not believe in blood transfusions But because Selena was unconscious she wasnt able to tell doctors her religion After 50 minutes doctors believed the damaged was impossible and Selena was pronounced dead at 105 pm local time They announced the cause as cardiac arrest and extensive bleeding Selena was only two weeks away from her 24th birthday and two days away from her third anniversary to Chris Perez

During the second hour the FBI had communication with Saldivar They tried to convince Saldivar to give herself up One of the negotiators had tried making the shooting an accident Saldivar had then began believing that she didnt mean to shot Selena She then stated that the pistol was meant for herself that she was going to commit suicide She also changed her mind by stating that the gun went off Around this time a press conference was ordered Assistant Police Chief Ken Bung and Selenas father Abraham Quintanilla Jr made an on air announcement about the murder Saldivars name was still not being named in the media

During the third hour an autopsy was performed This was because of the growing media interest The autopsy revealed that the bullet entered Selenas lower back It passed through Selenas chest cavity which instantly damaged Selenas right secluded carotid artery The bullet then exited the right upper chest The autopsy also revealed that Selenas heart which is fueled by adrenaline pumped her blood out The doctor also noticed that if the bullet had hit Selena a millimeter higher or lower the wound wouldnt have been as severe

During the fourth hour Saldivar exclaimed that the shooting was for herself She also stated that when Selena had tried to open the door she asked her to leave the door closed She said at that instant the gun went off During the sixth hour Saldivar agreed to give herself up However a police officer had a riffle This scared Saldivar to panic and went back to her truck Saldivar gave herself up during the ninth hour As police drove Saldivar away fans cheered and cried nearby

The MG 34 was a fully automatic general purpose machine gun It was from Nazi Germany It was brought into service in 1934 It was first given out to troops in 1935 

It was designed to be both a light machine gun and able to be used in heavier roles It was an early example of a general purpose machine gun When being used as a light machine gun the MG 34 can be fitted with a bipod and a 50 round belt The belt is shaped like a cylinder The belt is inside a magazine and it is attached to the side of the weapon When being used in a heavier role the MG 34 is fitted to a more stable tripod When it is on the tripod it is belt fed Ground troops relied mainly on the belt version and it was like a troop support weapon

The MG 34 was used as the main infantry machine gun during the 1930s and was still the main tank and air defence weapon as well It was supposed to be replaced in these roles by the new less expensive MG 42 but there were never enough MG 42s to go around so the MG 34 stayed partly replaced in these roles until the end of World War II The MG 34 was actually supposed to replace the MG 13 and other older machine guns but even they stayed in service until the end of WWII because the MG 34 could not be produced as fast as it was needed It was designed mainly by a man called Heinrich Vollmer who worked for a company called Mauser Werke AG The design was based on the new MG 30 that was just coming into service in Switzerland

he new gun was brought into service almost immediately and most of the troops liked it especially those who were using it to fight with Nationalist Spain in the Spanish Civil War When it was brought into service it had a lot of advanced features and the general purpose machine gun concept that it created was an influential one However the MG 34 was expensive and slow to make and it needed a lot of raw material and because it was also slow to make was not able to be produced in big enough amounts for the then expanding German Forces It was also the standard machine gun for the German Navy It was also quite a sensitive weapon and jammed very easily when it got dirty andor dusty

Some models of the MG 34 captured from the Germans by the Soviets and French were given to other countries during the Cold War

The MG 34 could use either magazine fed or belt fed ammunition The belts were supplied in 50 round strips but could be linked with other belts to make it longer and allowed the weapon to provide sustained fire If there were machine guns in bunkers they were given 250 round belts The magazine had a 50 round belt inside but there were some double drums which were not actually doubles because the other drum only held another 25 rounds making the guns total bullet load 75 rounds

In the light machine gun role it was used with a bipod and was very light compared to other machine guns of that time When it was being used as a medium machine gun it was mounted on a tripod and the legs of the tripod could be extended to allow it to be used as an anti aircraft gun When it was used on a bipod the MG 34 was usually fitted with a telescopic sight or periscope

A Palestinian Jew is a Jewish inhabitant of Palestine at various points in the regions history Jews in Palestine prior to the establishment of the State of Israel are more commonly referred to as Yishuv A distinction is drawn between the Old Yishuv that is the pre existing Jews in the land of Israel and the New Yishuv that is the newly arrived Jewish immigrants after the First Aliyah in 1881 After the modern State of Israel was born in 1948 native Jews in Palestine became citizens of Israel and the term Palestinian Jews largely fell into disuse

Some people who speak Arabic and live on the territory called Palestine today are Christians These include Oriental Orthodoxy Eastern Orthodoxy Catholic Protestant and others About half of them belong a branch of the Eastern Orthodox Church the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem 

Today less that four percent of the Palestinian Arabs living inside the borders of Palestine are Christians Many Arabs emigrated mainly because of wars fought between Egypt Israel and Jordan There is also a pressure to join Islam Surveys done by the British in 1922 and 1946 showed that in 1922 about 95 and in 1946 approximately 76 of the Palestinian Arabs were Christians

The Dalmatian Pelican is a large bird It lives in wet places such as in swamps and shallow lakes It can be found from southeastern Europe to Pakistan and China

The Platyzoa are a group of protostomia proposed by Thomas Cavalier Smith in 1998 This is a taxon above the level of phylum and is not part of the usual system of classification

Cavalier Smith included here the Platyhelminthes and a new phylum Acanthognatha into which he gathered several previously described phyla of microscopic animals Subsequent studies have supported Platyzoa as a viable clade while differing on the phyla included and on relationships within Platyzoa 

The Lophotrochozoa are a group of animals above the level of phylum It is not part of the usual system of classification They were recently discovered through molecular phylogeny They include two of the most successful animal phyla the Mollusca and Annelida 

The Lophotrochozoa comprise two groups the trochozoans and the lophophorata The exact relationships between the different phyla are not entirely certain However it seeems that neither the lophophorates nor the trochozoa are monophyletic groups by themselves but are mixed together

Other phyla are included on the basis of molecular data

Rock pools are rocky pools by the sea They are in the intertidal zone They are filled with seawater during high tide and exist as separate pools at low tide 

Tide pools are habitats of uniquely adaptable animals that have engaged the special attention of naturalists and marine biologists

Tide pools are a home for hardy organisms such as sea stars mussels and clams They must be able to cope with a constantly changing environment fluctuations in water temperature salinity and oxygen content Huge waves strong currents exposure to midday sun and predators are only a few of the hazards that rock pool animals must endure to survive

Waves can dislodge mussels and draw them out to sea Gulls pick up and drop sea urchins to break them open Starfish prey on mussels and are eaten by gulls themselves Even black bears sometimes feast on intertidal creatures at low tide Although tide pool organisms must avoid getting washed away into the ocean drying up in the sun or getting eaten they depend on the tide pools constant changes for food

This zone receives spray from wave action during high tides and storms At other times the rocks experience other extreme conditions baking in the sun or exposed to cold winds Few organisms can survive such harsh conditions Lichens and barnacles live in this region In this zone different barnacle species live at very tightly constrained elevations Tidal conditions precisely determine the exact height of an assemblage relative to sea level

Since the intertidal zone often desiccates when the tide is out barnacles are well adapted to water loss Their calcite shells are impermeable and they possess two plates which they slide across their mouth opening when not feeding These plates also protect against predation

The high tide zone is flooded for hours during each high tide Organisms must survive wave action currents and exposure to the sun The high tide zone is inhabited by sea anemones starfish chitons crabs green algae and mussels Marine algae can provide shelter for such organisms as nudibranchs and hermit crabs The same waves and currents that make the life in the high tide zone difficult bring food to the filter feeders and other intertidal animals

This subregion is mostly submerged it is exposed only during low tide This area is teeming with life this subregions most notable difference from the other three is that there is much more marine vegetation especially seaweeds There is also greater biodiversity Organisms in this zone generally are not well adapted to dryness and temperature extremes Low tide zone organisms include abalone sea anemones brown seaweed chitons crabs green algae hydroids isopods limpets mussels nudibranchs small fish sea cucumber kelp sea stars sea urchins shrimp snails sponges sea grass tube worms and whelks

These creatures can grow to larger sizes because there is more available energy and better water coverage The water is shallow enough to allow more light for photosynthetic activity and the salinity is at almost normal levels This area is still protected from large predators because of the wave action and relatively shallow water

Sea anemone such as Anthopleura elegantissima can clone to reproduce The process is called longitudinal fission in which the animal splits in two parts along its length Some species such as Anthopleura sola can fight for territory The white tentacles are for fighting The acrorhagi contain stinging cells The sea anemones sting each other repeatedly until one moves

Some species of starfish have the ability to regenerate lost arms in time Most species must retain an intact central part of the body to be able to regenerate but a few can regrow from a single rayThe regeneration of these stars is possible because the vital organs are in the arms

Sea palms look much as palm trees do They live in the middle to upper intertidal zones in areas with greater wave action High wave action may increase nutrient availability and moves the blades of the thallus allowing more sunlight to reach the organism so that it can photosynthesize In addition the constant wave action removes competitors

The Doom engine sometimes called ID Tech 1 is the computer code behind the video game Doom It is also used by several other games including Doom 2

The Doom engine uses a technique called binary space partitioning to represent 3D levels in a way that a computer can process quickly It is written mostly in C The source code has been released for free under the GNU General Public License Many Doom fans have made their own modified versions called source ports Source ports often add new features and fix problems in the original engine Popular source ports include Boom PrBoom PrBoom Zdoom and Chocolate Doom

The Doom engine represents levels internally using structures called linedefs sidedefs sectors verticies and things The doom engine reads levels and other data from a file called a WAD

The Doom engine renders levels entirely on the CPU not the video card as most video cards at the time did not have 3D acceleration This required very efficient algorithms to make the game work on the slow computers of the time

The Doom engine has been made available for more types of computers than any other first person shooter engine It is easy for a programmer to make it work on a new type of computer because it is written in C and it uses very few system resources allowing it to run on handheld computers and computers without a 3D accelerator

James Graham Ballard was an English novelist short story writer and important member of the New Wave movement in science fiction His best known books are Crash and Empire of the Sun

Ballards father was a chemist at a company called the Calico Printers Association The company was based in Manchester and made cloth Ballard was born and raised in the Shanghai International Settlement an area under foreign control where people lived an American style of life He went to the Cathedral School in Shanghai After the start of the Second Sino Japanese War Ballards family temporarily left their suburban home and rented a house in downtown Shanghai to avoid the shells fired by Chinese and Japanese forces

After the Pearl Harbor attack the Japanese occupied the International Settlement In early 1943 they began interning Allied civilians Ballard was sent to the Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center with his parents and younger sister He spent over two years in the internment camp His family lived in a small area in G block a two story residence for 40 families He went to school in the camp

Many think that Ballards exposure to the atrocities of war at a young age explains the conflicts and violence in much of his fiction

In 1946 after the end of the war his mother returned to England with Ballard and his sister on the SS Arrawa They in Plymouth and he attended The Leys School in Cambridge After a couple of years his mother and sister returned to China rejoining Ballards father Ballard went to live with his grandparents when he was not at boarding school In 1949 he went on to study medicine at Kings College Cambridge and planned to become a psychiatrist

At university Ballard was writing avant garde fiction heavily influenced by psychoanalysis and surrealist painters At this time he wanted to become a writer as well as pursue a medical career Ballard stopped his medical studies and in 1952 he enrolled at Queen Mary University of London to read English Literature However he was asked to leave at the end of the year Ballard then worked for an advertising agency and as an encyclopedia salesman He kept writing short fiction but did not get published

In 1953 Ballard joined the Royal Air Force and was sent to the RCAF flight training base in Moose Jaw Saskatchewan Canada He left the RAF in 1954 after two years and returned to England In 1955 he married Helen Mary Matthews and they lived in Chiswick

Ballard published several novels and short story collections during the seventies and eighties However he only became popular in the mainstream with his novel Empire of the Sun in 1984 This novel was based on his years in Shanghai and in an internment camp It became a bestseller

Ballard continued to write until the end of his life

Bruce Sterling called Ballard is an important writer leading to cyberpunk in the introduction to the Mirrorshades anthology 

Jean Baudrillard praised Crash as the first great novel of the universe of simulation in Simulacra and Simulation

Ballard was interested in the relationship between different media He was one of the trustees of the Institute for Research in Art and Technology in the early 1970s

The Indian Cormorant or Indian Shag is a member of the cormorant family It is found mainly along the inland waters of the Indian Subcontinent but extending west to Sindh and east to Thailand and Cambodia It is a gregarious species that can be easily distinguished from the similar sized Little Cormorant by its blue eye small head with a sloping forehead and a long narrow bill ending in a hooked tip

The Oriental Darter or Indian Darter sometimes called Snakebird is a water bird of tropical South Asia and Southeast Asia

Charades is a game where the player acts out a word or phrase and the other players attempt to guess what the word or phrase is in a certain amount of time The person who is acting usually pantomimes similar sounding words The game has also been adapted into television shows like Acting Crazy Party Game Give Us a Clue Body Language and Celebrity Charades

Aestivation also spelled estivation in the USA is a state of animal dormancy It is somewhat similar to hibernation The animals are inactive and have a lowered metabolic rate The state is entered in response to high temperatures and dry conditions Lungfish have been doing this since the Devonian period It takes place during times of heat and dryness the hot dry season which is often but not necessarily the summer months A wide range of animals aestivate including the Nile crocodile and many snails and lady beetles

Invertebrate and vertebrate animals are known to enter this state to avoid damage from high temperatures and the risk of drying out Both land and water living animals can undergo aestivation

Dormancy is a period in an organisms life cycle when growth development and physical activity are temporarily stopped This minimizes metabolic activity and therefore helps an organism to conserve energy Dormancy tends to be closely associated with environmental conditions Organisms can synchronize entry to a dormant phase with their environment through predictive or consequential means 

Predictive dormancy occurs when an organism enters a dormant phase before the onset of adverse conditions For example day length and decreasing temperature are used by many plants as triggers to start dormancy before the onset of winter 

Consequential dormancy occurs when organisms enter a dormant phase after adverse conditions arise This is often found in areas with an unpredictable climate Sudden changes in conditions may lead to a high mortality rate among animals relying on consequential dormancy On the other hand its use can be advantageous as organisms remain active longer and are able to make greater use of available resources

A seed though not active is a tiny living thing It contains the embryo of the future plant which is not changing or developing it is dormant The common idea is that the seed sleeps until it gets what it needs to wake up That is not correct Different seeds have different habits no doubt adapted to their habitat There are different kinds of resting stages in seeds

When a seed germinates it begins to grow into a little plant called a seedling It uses the soft fleshy material inside the seed for nutrients until it is ready to make food on its own using sunlight water and air

Most seeds germinate underground where there is no sunlight The plant does not need the nutrients in soil for a few days or weeks because the seed has all the things it needs to grow Later though it will begin to need sunlight If there is sunlight the plant will use it to grow healthy If there is no light the plant will still grow for a while but its plastids will not mature the chlorophyll does not turn green If the plant does not get enough light it will eventually die It needs light to make food for itself when the reserve in the seed runs out

Wedding Officiant is a generic title referring to the varied officials designees clergy and others who are empowered by the government to legally perform or solemnize wedding ceremonies 

In the US each state has its own particular laws and regulations concerning marriages and hence who is legally permitted to perform wedding ceremonies In almost all jurisdictions clergy from recognized religious institutions are recognized as Wedding Officiants In some jurisdictions clergy must register with some governmental authority before they can do so Commonly but not universally in many other jurisdictions other recognized Wedding Officiants include judges magistrates the clerk of court mayors and other governmental officials In four states Notaries Public are specifically empowered to perform wedding ceremonies as Wedding OfficiantscndateJanuary 2012 Other states have created a separate designation called Justice of the Peace who can only perform wedding ceremonies

Flow is the mental state experienced by a person completely immersed in an activity The person is fully focussed performing actively and successfully The situation is widely recognised by phrases like in the zone in the bubble on the ball in the moment wired in in the groove The performer almost loses touch with their surroundings phrases like lost to the world reflect this mental absorption 

The term flow was given to this experience by a psychologist who found it was completely focused motivation The hallmark of flow is a feeling of spontaneous joy even rapture while performing a task although flow is also described as a deep focus on nothing but the activity not even oneself or ones emotions

Cskszentmihlyi identifies the following ten factors as accompanying an experience of flow

Not all are needed for flow to be experienced

Flow operates on both physical and mental tasks It applies to dance football chess and many other areas where people perform tasks in well defined competitive situations but also in art where the situation may be much more open Evidence about flow comes from interviews with people after various types of performance Efforts are being made to develop ways of enhancing flow for personal and commercial benefit

Private property is a concept used in law Law says that a single person or a group of people can own certain things and control them All the things that are not owned by single persons or a group of people belong to all That way a person may own a car but the park in the city is only administered by the city and belongs to all people Different schools of thought have different ideas of how private property should be handled According to Capitalism private property is needed so that a society can work as it should That way trade can only be done using private property Socialism and Communism believe that certain things can not be owned by an individual or a group of people as they are used to produce other products or provide services 

The Radiata is a superphylum which includes both the echinoderms and the ctenophores It is not part of the usual classification system and is not used by all biologists

The group includes the radially symmetric animals of the Eumetazoa The echinoderms however are members of the Bilateria because they exhibit bilateral symmetry in their developing stages Their radial symmetry is secondary

Thomas Cavalier Smith in 1983 defined a subkingdom called Radiata consisting of the phyla Porifera Myxozoa Placozoa Cnidaria and Ctenophora in Radiata that is all the animals that are not in Bilateria 

The Five Kingdom classification of Lynn Margulis and KV Schwartz keeps only Cnidaria and Ctenophora in Radiata 

Cladistic classifications do not recognize Radiata as a clade The radiata in this sense are diploblastic meaning they have two primary germ layers endoderm and ectoderm Cavalier Smiths use of the term Radiata includes animals with a single germ layer such as sponges

Although radial symmetry is usually given as a defining characteristic of radiates a few members of the class Anthozoa which are now considered as the most basal and oldest group of cnidarians are actually bilaterally symmetric 

Newer research strongly indicates that bilateral symmetry evolved before the split between Cnidaria and Bilateria the radially symmetrical cnidarians have evolved radial symmetry secondarily This means the bilaterism in species like N vectensis has a primary origin Also the free swimming planula larvae of cnidarians exhibit bilateral symmetry Ctenophores show biradial symmetry

Polarized light comes from filtering light so that all light waves line up

Light reflected by shiny transparent materials is partly or fully polarized except when the light is perpendicular to the surface Polarization was first discovered in 1808 by the mathematician Etienne Louis Malus A polarizing filter such as a pair of polarizing sunglasses can be used to observe this effect by rotating the filter while looking through it at the reflection off of a distant horizontal surface At certain rotation angles the reflected light will be reduced or eliminated Polarizing filters remove light polarized at 90 to the filters polarization axis If two polarizers are placed atop one another at 90 angles to one another very little light can pass through both

Polarization by scattering is observed as light passes through the atmosphere The scattered light produces the brightness and color in clear skies This partial polarization of scattered light can be used to darken the sky in photographs increasing the contrast This effect is easiest to observe at sunset on the horizon at a 90 angle from the setting sun Another easily observed effect is the drastic reduction in brightness of images of the sky and clouds reflected from horizontal surfaces This is why polarizing filters are often used in sunglasses Polarizing sunglasses also show rainbow like patterns caused by color dependent birefringent effects for example in toughened glass or items made from transparent plastics The role played by polarization in the operation of liquid crystal displays is also frequently apparent to the wearer of polarizing sunglasses which may reduce the contrast or even make the display unreadable

The photograph on the right was taken through polarizing sunglasses and through the rear window of a car Light from the sky is reflected by the windshield of the other car at an angle making it mostly horizontally polarized The rear window is made of tempered glass Stress from heat treatment of the glass alters the polarization of light passing through it like a wave plate Without this effect the sunglasses would block the horizontally polarized light reflected from the other cars window The stress in the rear window however changes some of the horizontally polarized light into vertically polarized light that can pass through the glasses As a result the regular pattern of the heat treatment becomes visible

A trochophore is a type of larva found in marine plankton It belongs to animals of several related phyla in the superphylum lophotrochozoa

They have two or more bands of cilia By moving their cilia rapidly a water eddy is created In this way they control the direction of their movement Also in this way they bring their food closer to capture it more easily

Orthonectida is a small phylum of poorly known parasites of marine invertebrates They are among the simplest of multi cellular organisms 

The adults are microscopic wormlike animals They have a single layer of outer cells surrounding a mass of sex cells They swim freely within the bodies of their hosts which include flatworms polychaete worms bivalve molluscs and echinoderms They have separate male and female individuals

When they are ready to reproduce the adults are released from the host and sperm from the males penetrates the bodies of the females to achieve fertilisation The resulting zygote develops into a ciliated larva that escapes from the mother to seek out new hosts Once it finds a host the larva loses its cilia and develops into a syncytial plasmodium larva This in turn breaks up into numerous individual cells that become the next generation of adults

The resulting zygote develops into a ciliated larva that escapes from the mother to seek out new hosts Once it finds a host the larva loses its cilia and develops into a syncytial plasmodium larva

The orthonectids were originally described in 1877 as a class and placed as an order of the phylum Mesozoa Recent study shows that orthonectids are quite different from the rhombozoans the other group in Mesozoa

The lophophore is the characteristic feeding organ of four major groups of animals the Brachiopoda Bryozoa Entoprocta and Phoronida All lophophores are found in aquatic organisms

It can most easily be described as a ring of ciliated tentacles surrounding the mouth It is often horseshoe shaped or coiled Phoronids have their lophophores in plain view but the valves of brachiopods must be opened wide to get a good view of their lophophore

The lophophore surrounds the mouth and is an upstream collecting system for suspension feeding The gut is U shaped with the anterior mouth at the center of the lophophore The anus where present is also anterior and is above the mouth In the Bryozoa it is outside the ring of the lophophore in the Entoprocta the anus is within the ring of the lophophore Some brachiopods do not have an anus

The Rhombozoa or Dicyemida are a group of tiny parasites that live in the renal appendages of cephalopods

Classification is controversial They are probably a new phylum Traditionally dicyemids have been grouped with the Orthonectida in the Mesozoa However molecular phylogeny indicates that dicyemids may be more closely related to the roundworms 

Adult dicyemids range in length from convert05to7mmin and they can be seen through a light microscope They display eutely a condition in which each adult individual of a given species has the same number of cells making cell number a useful identifying character 

The organisms structure is simple a single axial cell is surrounded by a jacket of twenty to thirty ciliated cells

Dicyemids exist in both asexual and sexual forms The asexual forms are found in juvenile and immature hosts and the sexual forms in mature hosts 

The asexual stage is termed a nematogen it produces vermiform larvae in the axial cell These mature through direct development to form more nematogens Nematogens proliferate in young cephalopods filling the kidneys Later as the hosts mature sexual forms called rhombogens are formed They are hermaphrodites with gonads of both sexes The rhombogens self fertilise and later release larvae

The ancient Chinese musical system depends on very ancient mathematics used to determine sound frequencies The easiest way to explain it is to work through a real example

Suppose that somebody wanted to make a musical instrument that could play any song in the ancient Chinese system Here are the instructions

Make a wooden box 105 cm long and 60 cm wide Put guides for the strings near each end of the box and fix it so that these two guides are 99 cm apart Multiply 99 cm by 23 which is 66 cm Place a fret all the way across the box on the 66 cm line Multiply 66 cm by 43 which is 88 cm Place a fret along the 88 cm line Multiply 88 cm by 23 which is 58666 cm Place a fret along this line Multiply 58666 cm by 43 which is 78222 cm Place a fret along this line Multiply 78222 cm by 23 which is 54148148148 cm Place a fret along this line Multiply 54148148148 cm by 43 which is 69531 cm Place a fret along this line Multiply 69531 cm by 23 which is 46354  and which is too short so double it to get 92708 cm Place a fret along this line Multiply 92708 cm by 43 Multiply the previous answer by 23 Keep going until you have put down eleven frets

Counting the frequency on the open string and the frequencies on the fretted strings for each string there will be 12 defined frequencies

Tune the bottom string to some basic frequency Tune the next string to the frequency of the bottom string at the first fret Tune the third string to the bottom strings second fret Keep going until you have tuned all twelve strings 

When you pluck these strings at all the fretted and unfretted positions you will get 144 frequencies Some of them will be duplicates but not as many as you might think because this system is not like the Equal tempered system now used for almost all Western music

Out of each twelve frequencies on a single string you can make many selections of either five frequencies or seven frequencies

Here is a chart showing how frequencies and scales can be produced The frequency of 440 hertz could have been any other frequency Once this frequency is chosen it is multiplied by the ratios to produce the first column of frequencies Each of these 12 frequencies is used to start its own column Any five frequencies in a column can be chosen to make a pentatonic scale as long as they are not right together and are not more than two apart 

In the United States students are taught the scale whose notes are named do re mi fa sol la and ti Those seven produce a major scale In Western music we also use a minor scale fairly frequently But we only have those two Chinese traditional music uses five different scales of five notes each It also has pentatonic scales but they are not discussed in this article

Beelzebufo was a large frog discovered in the Upper Cretaceous of Madagascar The media called it Devil Toad and The Frog From Hell The frog lived some 70 million years ago

With a body length of 40 cms the frog was larger than any living frog Its weight in life was about 4 kg

The bones of the skull roof shows a rugous external surface indicating that at least parts of the head may have borne bony scutes

The Beelzebufo was a member of the horned toad sub family the Ceratophryinae Living members of the family are found only in South America but were once more widely distributed in Gondwana Both South America and Madagascar were part of the supercontinent Gondwana before it broke up in the Cretaceous

Beelzebufo was an ambush predator whose wide mouth let it eat relatively large prey perhaps even juvenile dinosaurs It probably lived in warm seasonally dry habitats with occasional pools of water Its modern relatives live in similar habitats and can burrow

The Upper and Lower Fezouata formations of Morocco are Burgess Shale type deposits dating to the Lower Ordovician In the fossilized fauna were numerous organisms previously thought to have died out after the mid Cambrian The discovery proves conclusively that the Burgess Shale biota did not go extinct in the Cambrian

Over 1500 non mineralized Burgess Shale types representing 50 taxa have been recovered from the formations There are also a less abundant shelly fauna The make up of the community varies significantly through the stratigraphic sequence with both abundances and faunal composition changing as time progresses Small burrows are present in the sediment but major burrowing is absent this may suggest a paucity of oxygen in the water or sediment 

Particularly notable is the presence of bryozoa and graptolites forms that are absent in the Cambrian period Various echinoderms indicate a normal range of salinity and the overall shelly assemblage is not significantly different from the normal shelly fauna expected in open Ordovician waters 

The non mineralized fossils contains a range of forms familiar from the Burgess Shale Other Ordovician oddballs are also present including cheloniellids and horseshoe crabs in abundance

The fossiliferous strata were deposited in quiet deep waters below the influence of wave action in all but the fiercest of storms Such storms or similar high energy events would have mobilized sediment that could be quickly deposited trapping animals and leading to their preservation Consequently the assemblage is dominated by benthic organisms

Fossils of the Fezouata formation which are usually squashed flat are often coated with a dusting of pyrite and tin this aspect of the fossil preservation is very similar to that at Chengjiang Non mineralized appendages are often preserved

The fossils a span an area of 500 km2 in southeast Moroccos Draa Valley north of Zagora Fossils are found are found through a 11 km thick column of rock that spans the two lowest epochs of the Ordovician

The lagersttten were first identified in the late 1990s when a local fossil collector Ben Moula showed some of the finds to a PhD student who was then working in the area

A Wolf spider is a member of the group of spiders whose scientific name is the Lycosidae Lycos means wolf in Latin These spiders get their name from the way they hunt which the people who named them thought was like the way wolves hunt However wolves hunt in packs but spiders are solitary animals Their way of hunting is more like that of solitary cats such as the cheetahs They generally wait for their prey to wander close by and then they rush in to kill it 

The wolf spiders belong to a large group The smallest of them are so tiny that many people never notice them The largest of them are around 15 inches in body length The smallest of them are less than 004 inches in body length Some of them spend all of their lives above ground some dig burrows but come out of the burrows to wander about and hunt and some spend almost all of their lives waiting for passing insects in their burrows

One kind of wolf spider gives us the name that is now used in English for an entirely different kind of spider This wolf spider has the scientific name Hogna tarantula because it found around Taranto a city in Italy People there once believed that if a human were bitten by one of these wolf spiders then he or she would surely die unless made to do a wild dance Actually Hogna tarantula does not give bites that need medical help Any deaths from spiders in the area of Taranto probably came from the local Widow spider

As you can see from the above photograph mother wolf spiders carry their baby spiders around on their backs They protect the babies for a few days and then the babies leave her and go off on their own 

After a female wolf spider mates she creates a clear space on the ground lays down a rough sheet of silk and on top of that sheet she makes a silken cup in which she lays her eggs She next closes the cup making a round ball and holds onto it using her spinnerets until the babies begin to hatch She then opens the silk ball and lets the baby spiders come out They all run up her legs and cover the top part of her body There may be more than one hundred baby spiders on her back

There are several kinds of spiders that look almost like wolf spiders The best way to be sure is to look at the eyes There are four small eyes at the bottom then two very large eyes then two somewhat smaller eyes

The Australian gold rush was a large number of gold discoveries in Australia Thousands of people came to Australia in the hope of finding a lot of gold and becoming rich The rush started in 1851 when gold was found near Bathurst New South Wales and ended with the last rush in 1893 to Kalgoorlie Western Australia At each place gold was easily found in rivers and creeks This was known as alluvial gold and could be found by individual miners using very basic equipment such as a spade and a dish In most places this alluvial gold was taken in the first few months To get at the gold that was buried deeper in the ground meant that miners needed to work together and dig tunnels Eventually large companies were started to raise money so that deep gold mines could be built

The gold rushes happened when alluvial gold was found Miners would quickly move there in the hope of being the first to find the surface gold For example miners rushing to Clunes Victoria in August 1851 quickly changed their minds and went to Buninyong when they heard of a new gold discovery Weeks later gold was found at Ballarat a few miles to the north and within six weeks there were more than 10000 people digging But by 1852 most miners had left Ballarat and rushed to the new goldfields at Bendigorp48

Gold had been found in Australia before the 1851 gold rush At first people would not believe the stories A convict who found gold near Bathurst in 1823 was given 150 lashes with a whip as it was believed he must have stolen itrp37 The explorer Count Paul Strzelecki found gold in the Australian Alps in 1839 The government kept it a secret as they did not want to lose control of the convicts if they went rushing off to search for goldrp38 Gold was also found at

The first gold rush was in New South Wales There were many others during the next 30 years

The Onion is the home of Pikmin in the games Pikmin and Pikmin 2 Thought to be some sort of incubator the Onion is very important in the life cycle for the Pikmin

The first Onion encountered is the Red Onion When Olimar crash lands on Earth he runs into this strange object and it expels a Red Pikmin seed This becomes a sprout which Olimar picks and a Pikmin pops out

The next one is found in the second area the Forest of Hope This is a Yellow Onion It expels a Yellow Pikmin Seed

The final one is the Blue Onion which is found in The Forest Navel This is an extremely important Onion as it houses blues which are very useful in this game

When Olimar and Louie land on Earth once more they discover Reds right away with their Red Onion

Then when they go to the Perplexing Pool they find the Yellow Pikmin and their Onion

Finally the Blues are found in the Awakening Wood These are found last of all the Pikmin Their Onion represents their color obviously

The Onion does not exactly resemble a real life onion though it may be the size of one They have three legs which allows it to stand On its top is a flower that allows the Onion to fly They have markings on their sides that resemble some sort of Mayan design or something to that effect

Olimar thinks of the Onion as an incubator for the Pikmin If Pikmin bring back Pellets or killed enemies the Onion expels seeds that create more Pikmin The flower on its head allows it to fly This is extremely important because any Pikmin left behind and not in their Onion by the end of day are eaten

Romney Marsh is a coastal marshland of southern England It runs from Hythe in Kent to Rye in East Sussex It covers about 100 miles2 Romney Marsh is one of three English wetlands the others being The Fens of East Anglia and the Somerset Levels

Much of the area has been reclaimed over the centuries and is now flat farmland Before the area was drained it was a cause of malaria among the inhabitants For much of its history the Marsh was fringed by a lagoon which was protected by a shingle beach at Dymchurch

The Marsh still contains some water features particularly the Royal Military Canal completed in 1809 and the River Rother

At Romney Marsh the coast is at its closest to France and was several times the point of invasion In AD 892 a Danish fleet of 250 ships sailed right into the River Rother and took the fortress at Appledore which they destroyed

The Romans used the Romney area for a salt industry Pans of brackish water were left to evaporate and the salt collected for use in food

The marsh includes two of the ancient Cinque Ports New Romney and Hythe and two ancient towns Rye and Winchelsea New Romney was once a port but is now a mile and a half from the sea It is the main centre of population on the Marsh

Dendritic cells are immune cells forming part of the mammalian immune system Their main function is to process antigen material and put it on their surface to touch other cells of the immune system That is they function as antigen presenting cells They act as messengers between the innate and adaptive immune systems

Dendritic cells are present in tissues in contact with the external environment These tissues are the skin and the inner lining of the nose lungs stomach and intestines They can also be found in an immature state in the blood 

Once activated these cells move to the lymph nodes Then they act with T cells and B cells to start and shape the adaptive immune response  At a particular stage these cells grow branches called dendrites The name comes from the Greek word or dndron that means tree Immature dendritic cells are also called veiled cells as they have large cytoplasmic veils not dendrites

Dendritic cells were first described by Paul Langerhans in the late nineteenth century It wasnt until 1973 however that Ralph Steinman and Zanvil Cohn gave them the name dendritic cells For discovering the central role of dendritic cells in the adaptive immune response Steinman was awarded the Albert Lasker Award in 2007 and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2011

Ralph Marvin Steinman was a Canadian immunologist and cell biologist at Rockefeller University He studied a kind of cell in the immune system and called them dendritic cells He made these discoveries while working in the laboratory of Zanvil A Cohn

On October 3 2011 the Nobel Committee announced that Steinman had received one half of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in adaptive immunity The other half went to Bruce Beutler and Jules Hoffmann for their discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity However the committee did not know that Steinman had died three days earlier on September 30 from pancreatic cancer The committee considered what to do about Steinmans prize since the rule is that the prize is not awarded posthumously 

The committee later decided that as the decision to award the prize was made in good faith they would not change the award

Steinmans daughter said that he had joked the previous week with his family about hanging on until the prize announcement Steinman said I know I have got to hold out for that They dont give it to you if you have passed away I got to hold out for that

Steinman had received numerous other awards and recognitions for his life long work on dendritic cells such as the Albert Lasker Award the Gairdner Foundation International Award and the Cancer Research Institute William B Coley Award In addition he was made a member of Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences

A ground fault circuit interrupter or Residual Current Device is a device that shuts off an electric circuit when it detects that current is flowing along an unintended path possibly through water or through a person It is used to reduce the risk of electric shock It works by measuring the current leaving the hot side of the power source and comparing it to the current returning to the neutral side If they are not equal this means that some of the current is flowing along an unintended path and the GFCI shuts the power off When the problem is corrected the GFCI can manually be reset by pushing the reset button There is also a test button that can be used to verify that the GFCI works It is recommended to test GFCIs at least once a month GFCIs are required in kitchens bathrooms unfinished basements garages outdoors and anywhere near a sink GFCIs are available in two types for permanent installation the circuit breaker type that installs in the panel and the receptacle type that installs in a normal electrical box GFCIs that attach to appliance cords are also available These are often found on hair dryers Although GFCIs are designed primarily to protect from electric shock they can also prevent some fires

GFCIs can be used to upgrade older two prong outlets to three prong outlets without installing any new wire This is safer than using the two to three prong adapter The GFCI is installed in the electrical box without connecting the ground screw A label that says No Equipment Ground must be placed on the GFCI outlet and all downstream outlets Several of these labels are usually included with the GFCI

A calico cat is a cat with a coat of orange and black spots on a white background It is not a breed of cat it is a coat pattern that is common to many breeds Nearly all calico cats are female There are male calico cats but they are very rare

A single X chromosome can have either a black gene or an orange gene but not both However a female cat has two X chromosomes so it can have both genes black on one chromosome and orange on the other making the cat a calico A male cat usually has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome A Y chromosome can not contain a black or orange gene so the cat can have either an orange or a black gene but not both It is possible for a male cat to be a calico if it has Klinefelters syndrome where it has two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome although not all cats with Klinefelters syndrome are calico During the early stages of development when the cat is still a microscopic organism in each cell one of the chromosomes deactivates All cells that were copied from a cell with a deactivated chromosome will also have the same chromosome deactivated This is what leads to formation of the spots The earlier in development the chromosomes deactivate the larger the spots will be The white coloring on a calico is from a separate gene unrelated to the orange or black genes Whether or not a cat is a calico is determined by genetics but the actual layout of the spots is not and will be different even on clones The layout of the spots is considered to be almost random The tortoiseshell cat is closely related although on a tortoiseshell cat the spots are usually smaller and closer together and there is less white

In Japan calico cats are said to bring good luck In many Japanese shops there is a calico Japanese Bobtail figurine called the Maneki Neko which is said to bring good luck to the shops owner

Bruce Alan Beutler MD is an American immunologist and geneticist Together with Jules Hoffmann he received one half of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity

Beutler is currently Director of the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas Texas and Professor and Chairman of the Department of Genetics at The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla California His father Ernest Beutler a hematologist and medical geneticist was also a Professor and Department Chairman at Scripps

Beutler is best known for his pioneering molecular and genetic studies of inflammation and innate immunity Interested in the mechanism by which lipopolysacchride activates mammalian immune cells Beutler identified the LPS receptor Identification of the receptor hinged on the positional cloning of the mammalian Lps locus which had been known since the 1960s as a key gene for biological responses to LPS

Beutler thus discovered the key sensors of microbial infection in mammals He found that one of the mammalian toll like receptors TLR4 acts as the membrane spanning component of the mammalian LPS receptor complex The TLRs are now widely known to function in the perception of microbes each detecting signature molecules that herald infection These receptors also mediate severe illness including shock and systemic inflammation as it occurs in the course of an infection They are central to the pathogenesis of sterile inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus The research on TLRs won him the Nobel Prize in 2011

The positional cloning of Lps was completed in 1998 Beutler continued to analyse immunity in mammals His work found numerous signalling molecules of the innate immune response and helped to work out the biochemistry of innate immunity

Jules A Hoffmann is a Luxembourg born French biologist He is a research director and member of the board of administrators of the National Center of Scientific Research in Strasbourg France In 2007 he became President of the French Academy of Sciences 

Together with Bruce Beutler Hoffmann received one half of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity Hoffmann discovered the function of the fruit fly Toll gene in innate immunity Its mammalian homologues the toll like receptors were discovered by Beutler Toll like receptors identify constituents of other organisms like fungi and bacteria and trigger an immune response This explains how septic shock can be triggered by bacterial remains

Hoffmann completed his PhD in biology at the University of Strasbourg in 1969 His post doctoral training was at the Institut fr Physiologische Chemie at Philipps Universitt in Marburg an der Lahn Germany in 19731974

Hoffmann was a research assistant at CNRS from 1964 to 1968 and became a research associate in 1969 Since 1974 he has been a Research Director of CNRS Between 1978 and 2005 he was Director of the CNRS research unit Immune Response and Development in Insects and from 1993 to 2005 he was director of the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology of CNRS in Strasbourg

Hoffmann is a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina the French National Academy of Sciences the Academia Europaea the European Molecular Biology Organization the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Russian Academy of Sciences

Autoimmune disease when the bodys immune system attacks its own body The function of the immune system is to recognise and reject foreign bodies like bacteria Sometimes the system goes wrong and the body itself gets damaged by its immune system Examples are

Factoid is stating a fact that is not backed up by evidence The factoid may not be trusted because

Factoids become widely treated as if they were true  

In 1973 the term factoid was created and first used by Norman Mailer 

A factoid is an item of unreliable information which is repeated so often that it becomes accepted as a fact The most important thing is that the factoid is widely believed 

A factoid refers to something that looks like a fact could be a fact but in fact is not a fact

The term can also be used to describe partial information without context

Graphite is one of the most common Allotropes of carbon Unlike diamond graphite is a conductor and can be used for instance as the material in the electrodes of an electrical arc lamp Graphite holds the distinction of being the most stable form of solid carbon ever discovered

Allotropes are different forms of the same element All elements are made up uniquely of their own atoms and therefore any physical differences must be a consequence of how the atoms are joined together Many elements show Allotropy as there are often various ways in which the atoms can be linked together and also different ways in which the molecules can be arranged to make larger structures

Diamond is one of the best known Allotropes of carbon whose hardness and high dispersion of light make it useful for industrial applications and jewelry Diamond is the hardest known natural mineral making it an excellent abrasive and also means a diamond holds its polish extremely well and retains luster

Lunokhod 1 was a lunar rover made by the Soviet Union It was part of the Lunokhod programme It was the first man made rover to land on another planet It landed on the Moon on November 17 1970 It drove around on the Moon for nearly a year collecting information about the soil and landscape The Lunokhod had only two speeds 1 kmh or 2 kmh It had four TV cameras and was controlled by a five person team on Earth

It was lost for 40 years but the space rocket which delivered the rover to the Moon was found in photos taken by the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Scientists were then able to follow the rovers tracks and found the rover about 10 km away They can now send laser beams to a reflector on the rover which will send them back to Earth This will help them with measurements to find the exact centre of the Moon

Salmonella enterica is a rod shaped bacterium It is a member of the genus Salmonella

It causes typhoid fever 

This bacterium is the causative agent of The symptoms of typhoid fever include nausea vomiting and fever The main source of infection is from swallowing infected water Food may also be pick up the bacterium if it is washed or grown with contaminated water 

In biology a medusa is a form of cnidarian in which the body is shaped like an umbrella The other main body form is the polyp 

Medusae vary from bell shaped to the shape of a thin disk scarcely convex above and only slightly concave below The upper or aboral surface is called the exumbrella and the lower surface is called the subumbrella the mouth is located on the lower surface which may be partially closed by a membrane extending inward from the margin The digestive cavity consists of the gastrovascular cavity and radiating canals which extend toward the margin these canals may be simple or branching and vary in number from few to many The margin of the disk bears sensory organs and tentacles

In the class Hydrozoa medusae are the sexual individuals of many species alternating in the life cycle with asexual polyps The medusa form of Hydrozoans are known as hydromedusae A polyp is the form that attaches to a surface while a medusa is the form that is free floating a species of cnidarian may take each form in a different phase of its life

The medusa form predominates in the classes Scyphozoa and Cubozoa Except for freshwater hydrozoans like Craspedacusta sowerbyi these are the only classes in which medusae appear

In economics an expenditure is when a company busy fixed assets that will create a benefit in the future or when the company upgrades existing assets so that they can be used for a longer time This constitutes an investment as the benefits of the use usually last much longer than the fiscal year Depreciation also happens the cost that the company took to upgrade or buy the assets will usually not be deducted directly in one year depending on the form of calculation used a part of the cost will be deducted each year as a form of expense

Zygomycota or zygote fungi is a large group of 1600 species of fungi 

Fungi are put into groups by the way they reproduce The name Zygommcota comes from zygosporangia where strong and tough round shaped spores are formed during sexual reproduction 

They are mostly found living in soil or on decaying plant or animal material Some are parasites of plants insects and small animals Others form symbiotic relationships with plants where the plant and the fungi need each other to grow 

Zygomycete hyphae may be a syncytium that is having a mass of nuclei not divided into separate cells On occasion these can be divided into separate parts by a cell wall called a septum This only happens where gametes are formed or to wall off dead hyphae

The Invisible College was the name given to themselves by an group of like minded scientists and natural philosophers in England in the mid 17th century The informal association is considered to have be one of the origins of the Royal Society 

The purpose of the invisible college was to encourage each other to develop scientific knowledge through experiments and other kinds of investigation 

Some of the members of the Invisible College were among the founders of the Royal Society in 1660 including Robert Boyle John Wilkins and Samuel Hartlib

The concept of invisible college was developed in the sociology of science by Diane Crane building on de Solla Prices work on citation networks It is related but significantly different from other concepts of expert communities such as Epistemic communities or Community of Practice Recently the concept was applied to the global network of communications among scientists by Caroline S Wagner 

In fiction it is mentioned in the novel The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown and was the inspiration for the Unseen University in the works of Terry Pratchett

Brian P Schmidt is a Distinguished Professor Australian Research Council Laureate Fellow and astrophysicist at the Australian National University Mount Stromlo Observatory and Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics He is widely known for his research in using supernovae as Cosmological Probes He currently holds an Australia Research Council Federation Fellowship Schmidt shared both the 2006 Shaw Prize in Astronomy and the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics with Saul Perlmutter and Adam Riess for providing evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating

Schmidt an only child was born February 24 1967 in the Montana mountains His father Dana C Schmidt was a fisheries biologist When he was 13 his family moved to Anchorage Alaska

Schmidt went to Bartlett High School in Anchorage and graduated in 1985 He has said that he wanted to be a meteorologist since I was about five years old but I did some work at the US National Weather Service up in Anchorage and didnt enjoy it very much It was less scientific not as exciting as I thought it would be  there was a lot of routine But I guess I was just a little naive about what being a meteorologist meant He decided to study astronomy just before he started at university He was graduated BS BS from the University of Arizona in 1989 He received his MA and then PhD from Harvard University in 1993 Schmidts PhD thesis was supervised by Robert Kirshner and used Type II Supernovae to measure the Hubble Constant

At Harvard he met his future wife an Australian Jenny Gordon who was studying for a PhD in economics In 1994 he moved to Australia

Schmidt was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics before moving to Mount Stromlo Observatory in the Australian Capital Territory in 1995 

Schmidt and Adam Riess led the High z Supernova Search Team which found evidence that the Universes expansion rate is now accelerating They discovered this by looking at Type 1a Supernova The discovery was the opposite of the current theory that the expansion of the universe was slowing down By studying the color shifts in the light from the supernova from Earth they discovered that these billion year old nova were still accelerating This result was also found about the same time by the Supernova Cosmology Project led by Saul Perlmutter With two studies getting the same result scientists now accept the accelerating universe theory New research is now trying to understand the nature of the universe such as the existence of dark matter The discovery of the accelerating universe was named Breakthrough of the Year by Science Magazine in 1998 Schmidt was jointly awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics along with Reiss and Perlmutter for their groundbreaking work

Schmidt is currently leading the SkyMapper telescope Project and the associated Southern Sky Survey

Schmidt has received the Australian Governments Malcolm McIntosh Prize in 2000 Harvard Universitys Bok Prize in 2000 the Australian Academy of Sciences Pawsey Medal Medal in 2001 and the Vainu Bappu Medal of the Astronomical Society of India in 2002 He was the Marc Aaronson Memorial Lecturer in 2005 and in 2006 he shared the Shaw Prize in Astronomy with Adam Riess and Saul Perlmutter 

Schmidt and the other members of the High Z Team shared the 2007 Gruber Cosmology Prize a 500000 award with Saul Perlmutter of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Supernova Cosmology Project for their discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe

Schmidt along with Riess and Perlmutter jointly won the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics for their observations which led to the discovery of the accelerating Universe

The Crab Nebula is a supernova remnant and pulsar wind nebula in the constellation of Taurus The nebula was observed by John Bevis in 1731 it corresponds to a bright supernova recorded by Chinese and Islamic astronomers in 1054

The nebula is about 6500 light years from Earth It has a diameter of 11 ly and expands at a rate of about 1500 kilometers per second It is part of the Perseus of the Milky Way Galaxy

At the center of the nebula lies the Crab Pulsar a neutron star 2830 km across which emits pulses of radiation from gamma ray bursts to radio waves with a spin rate of 302 times per second The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion

The nebula acts as a source of radiation for studying celestial bodies between it and us In the 1950s and 1960s the Suns corona was mapped from observations of the Crabs radio waves passing through it and in 2003 the thickness of the atmosphere of Saturns moon Titan was measured as it blocked out X rays from the nebula

The cloudy remnants of SN 1054 are now known as the Crab Nebula The nebula is also referred to as Messier 1 or M1 being the first Messier Object catalogued in 1758

Previous analysis showed that with X ray and gamma ray energies above 30 keV the Crab is the strongest persistent source in the sky Its flux was known to be above 1012 eV

However recent work has shown the energy levels are much higher than previously thought Scientists found emissions at more than 100 GeV 100 billion times more energetic than visible light

The creation of the Crab Nebula corresponds to the bright SN 1054 supernova that was recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054 AD The Crab Nebula itself was first observed in 1731 by John Bevis The nebula was independently rediscovered in 1758 by Charles Messier as he was observing a bright comet Messier catalogued it as the first entry in his catalogue of comet like objects The Earl of Rosse observed the nebula at Birr Castle in 1848 and referred to the object as the Crab Nebula because a drawing he made of it looked like a crab 

In the early 20th century the analysis of early photographs of the nebula taken several years apart revealed that it was expanding Tracing the expansion back revealed that the nebula must have become visible on Earth about 900 years ago Historical records revealed that a new star bright enough to be seen in the daytime had been recorded in the same part of the sky by Chinese astronomers in 1054 Given its great distance the daytime guest star observed by the Chinese could only have been a supernovaa massive exploding star having exhausted its supply of energy from nuclear fusion and collapsed in on itself

Recent analysis of historical records have found that the supernova that created the Crab Nebula probably appeared in April or early May rising to its maximum brightness of between apparent magnitude 7 and 45 by July The supernova was visible to the naked eye for about two years after its first observation Thanks to the recorded observations of Far Eastern and Middle Eastern astronomers of 1054 Crab Nebula became the first astronomical object recognized as being connected to a supernova explosion

A binary pulsar is a pulsar with a binary companion often a white dwarf or neutron star In at least one case the double pulsar PSR J0737 3039 the companion star is another pulsar as well 

Binary pulsars are one of the few objects which allow physicists to test general relativity in the case of a strong gravitational field Although the binary companion to the pulsar is usually difficult or impossible to observe the timing of the pulses from the pulsar can be measured with extraordinary accuracy by radio telescopes Binary pulsar timing has indirectly confirmed the existence of gravitational radiation and verified Einsteins general theory of relativity

The first binary pulsar PSR B191316 or the Hulse Taylor binary pulsar was discovered in 1974 at Arecibo by Joseph Hooton Taylor Jr and Russell Hulse for which they won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics Pulses from this system have been tracked without glitches to within 15 s since its discovery

Binary pulsars are one of the few tools scientists have to detect evidence of gravitational waves Einsteins theory of general relativity predicts that two neutron stars would emit gravitational waves as they orbit a common center of mass which would carry away orbital energy and cause the two stars to draw closer together As the two stellar bodies draw closer to one another often one pulsar will absorb matter from the other causing a violent accretion process This interaction can heat the gas being exchanged between the bodies and produce X ray light which can appear to pulsate causing binary pulsars to occasionally be referred to as X ray binaries This flow of matter from one stellar body to another is known as an accretion disk Millisecond pulsars create a sort of wind which in the case of binary pulsars can blow away the magnetosphere of the neutron stars and have a dramatic effect on the pulse emission

The 1993 Nobel Prize was awarded to Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse after they discovered two such stars While Hulse was observing a new pulsar named PSR B191316 he noticed that the frequency with which it pulsed fluctuated It was concluded that the simplest explanation was that the pulsar was orbiting another star very closely at a high velocity Hulse and Taylor determined that the stars were equally heavy by observing these pulse fluctuations which led them to believe the other spacial object was also a neutron star

The observations made of the orbital decay of this star system was a near perfect match to Einsteins equations Relativity predicts that over time a binary systems orbital energy will be converted to gravitational radiation Data collected by Taylor and his colleagues of the orbital period of PRS B191316 supported this relativistic prediction They reported in 1983 that there was a difference in the observed minimum separation of the two pulsars compared to that expected if the orbital separation had remained constant In the decade following its discovery the systems orbital period had decreased by about 76 millionths of a second per year  this means that the pulsar was approaching its maximum separation more than a second earlier than it would have if the orbit had remained the same Subsequent observations continue to show this decrease

When the two bodies are in close proximity the gravitational field is stronger the passage of time is slowed and the time between pulses is lengthened As the pulsar clock travels more slowly through the weakest part of the field it regains time This relativistic time delay is the difference between what one would expect to see if the pulsar were moving at a constant distance and speed around its companion and what is actually observed

Mount Stromlo Observatory just outside of Canberra Australia is part of the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Australian National University

The observatory was built in 1924 as The Commonwealth Solar Observatory Mount Stromlo had already been used for observations in the previous decade with a small observatory being built in 1911 by Pietro Baracchi using the Oddie telescope The dome built to house the Oddie telescope was the first Commonwealth building built in the new Australian Capital Territory Until World War II the observatory specialised in solar and atmospheric observations During the war the workshops made gun sights and other optical equipment After the war the observatory began stellar and galactic astronomy and was renamed The Commonwealth Observatory

When ANU began in 1946 in nearby Canberra they shared staff and started graduate studies In 1957 the Mount Stromlo Observatory became part of the ANU

On January 18 2003 a huge bushfire hit Canberra and Mount Stromlo The observatory was surrounded by a plantation pine forest Five telescopes workshops seven homes and the historic administration building were destroyed The only telescope to escape the fires was the 1868 15 centimetre Farnham telescope Some items from the fire are on display in the National Museum of Australia They include a melted telescope mirror and a piece of melted optical glass The latter has pieces of charcoal and wire fused into it from the fierce heat of the fire

Rebuilding is largely completed and the Observatory is now a major partner in the construction of the Giant Magellan Telescope A copy of the Oddie telescope has been put on display at the observatory

The MACHO project found the first example of the gravitational lensing of one star by another known as Gravitational microlensing in 1993 This discovery was made by repeated imaging of the Magellanic Clouds with the 50 inch Great Melbourne Telescope using a mosaic of 8 2048 by 2048 pixel CCDs The camera was made by the Centre for Particle Astrophysics in California At the time it was the largest digital camera ever built Between July 1992 and December 1999 the MACHO project made over 200 billion stellar measurements The data was studied at the observatory and at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

Brian Schmidt an astrophysicist at Mount Stromlo led an international group the High z Supernova Search Team which looked at the rate of change of the Cosmic Expansion using type Ia supernovae In 1998 the team discovered that cosmic expansion was accelerating which was the opposite of the current theory This universal acceleration means that dark energy must exist The discovery was named the top science breakthrough of 1998 by Science magazine In 2011 Brian Schmidt shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Saul Perlmutter and Adam Riess for finding the evidence for the accelerating Universe 

The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey co led by Matthew Colless began the largest galaxy red shift survey of its time It was based at the Anglo Australian Observatory using the 39m Anglo Australian Telescope between 1997 and 11 April 2002 The survey measured more than 245000 galaxies With the Sloan Digital Sky Survey this provided the measurements of large scale structure in the low redshift Universe

The workshops at Mount Stromlo Observatory have built two instruments for the Gemini Telescope This includes the near infrared integral field spectrometer NIFS used on Gemini North and the adaptive optics imager for Gemini South GSAOI The NIFS was destroyed in the bushfires of 18 January 2003 and had to be rebuilt

A new rapid survey telescope SkyMapper is under construction SkyMapper will be built at the ANUs other observatory and operated remotely from Mount Stromlo

Mount Stromlo Observatory is at an altitude of convert770mft above sea level on Mount Stromlo

Pietro Paolo Giovanni Ernesto Baracchi was an Italian astronomer He moved to Australia in the 1870s and worked at the Melbourne Observatory In 1910 the Australian government asked him to find a suitable place for an observatory in the new Australian Capital Territory Barrachi set up a small observatory on Mount Stromlo in May 1911 This was the first government building in Canberra and was the beginning of the Mount Stromlo Observatory The observatory had a 9 inch telescope donated by Ballarat gold miner James Oddie

The Melbourne Observatory in Melbourne Victoria Australia was built in 1861 It replaced an earlier observatory at Williamstown The Melbourne Observatory is now part of Melbournes Royal Botanic Gardens The observatory had an important role as it used observations of the stars to keep accurate time It also kept the weather records and scientists were able to make weather predictions

In 1869 the observatory installed the Great Melbourne Telescope which at that time was the largest steerable telescope in world There were problems with its size and image accuracy and by 1890 it was no longer used As Melbourne increased in size the light from the city limited the use of the observatory for serious astronomy The Great Melbourne Telescope was sold to the Mount Stromlo Observatory in Canberra in 1944 It was destroyed in a bushfire in 2003 but there are plans to rebuild it and set it up as a display at the Melbourne Observatory

The Melbourne Observatory is no longer used but the historic equipment is kept in working condition by the Astronomical Society of Victoria This is an amateur group of volunteers interested in astronomy They have regular tours talks and observation nights using the telescopes The historic buildings are now used as offices for the gardens a cafe and a shop

Mng K who is usually known as Meng Zi which means Master Meng or Mencius was not in the generation of students who worked directly with Confucius but in the second generation after it He lived from about 371 BC to about 289 BC Mencius regarded Confucius as the greatest teacher and he wrote a book in which he tried to explain the full picture behind what Confucius taught The book is just called by his name so in English it is called the Mencius 

In his book Mencius taught that humans are born with four gifts The first is the natural ability to feel what other people feel and to want to help and protect them The second is to recognize when you are not doing your share of the job of maintaining a good society The third is to recognize conflict situations before they grow big and to defuse them The fourth is to recognize when some other people are hurting other people and want to obtain justice for those being hurt

Mencius believed that just as the people owed things to the ruler the ruler also owed things to the people So if a man held the position of ruler but did not do the things for the people that a ruler should do then it was acceptable for the people to get rid of the ruler and even to kill him

Mencius lived during the Zhu dynasty

The culture that Mencius came from believed that after people died they would have some kind of existence after life That belief goes back to distant prehistorical times At some time people began to say that the dead go to Tin Tin has several meanings including sky day Heaven and God The earliest versions of the character is a picture of a man with a very large head which suggests head man or leader Since Chinese people believed that when any person dies he or she goes to Tin and that dead ancestors are more powerful than they were while still alive it is possible that Tin originally was the name of the earliest ancestor of the Zhu ruling house from long before the fall of the previous dynasty the Shng If that idea is correct then Tin first was a name for an ancestor Later people may have forgotten that this very powerful spirit was originally a living human being so Tin became regarded as a god After that Tin could have been used to name the place where the god lived and since that place was high above us it came to mean not only Heaven but also the heavens sky day etc

China has myths that go back long before the Shng and Zhu dynasties There were several culture heroes who were regarded as ancient wise emperors There were Hung D known in English as the Yellow Emperor Yo Shn and Y who all came before what is called the first dynasty the Xi

The story of how Y came to be made emperor is very important to the Confucians The myth says that the world started to become flooded and the father of Y tried to fix the problem by building dams Gn was not successful because the water just kept coming and when it went over the top of the dams then all of the water that had built up came out very fast So Y took over the job of saving China and cleaned out all of the rivers so that the extra water could easily go to the sea

Mencius does not tell the part of the story about Gn but he does tell the part about how Y made all the rivers deeper to drain the land The lesson Mencius and the Chinese people learned from the story of Y was that in all things it is better to give forces a way to get out that will not cause harm and that damming forces up will always be bad in the long run

The founders of the Zhu dynasty believed in the idea that King Wen the father of King Wu continued to be able to act in the world of human beings even after his death He and his own father and grandfather were central figures in an important document called The Brass bound Coffer  Another important document is called The Announcement of Duke Shao Both of these documents introduce and support the idea that Tin decides who will be the human to act as steward or helper to carry out the will of Tin on earth and the idea that Tin will only let someone be king as long as he looks out for the welfare of all human beings

Mencius told the story of Y in his book at 3B9

 

At the time of the sage emperor Yao the rivers ceased their normal flow and flooded the Central Kingdom Then snakes and dragons took up residence and humans had no fixed abodes Those at lower elevations created nests in the trees for themselves and those at higher elevations made underground redoubts

 

The Book of Records says The inundation alarms me Inundation means flood waters Y was employed to manage the flood Y dredged the earth and conveyed the water to the sea He drove away the snakes and dragons and exiled them to the marshes When water traveled through the land it formed the Yangze River the Huai River the Yellow River and the Han River Since these marshes were located in remote and cut off places the depredations visited upon humans by birds and beasts were eliminated and after that humans got to live on the plains However after both Yao and Shun fell into obscurity the way of the sages went into a steep decline

At 4B26 Mencius also said 

If these wise ones could conduct themselves as did Y in managing the flood waters then what would there be to dislike in regard to them Y managed the flood waters by doing his work in ways that involved no great ado If these wise ones could also conduct themselves without making any fuss then their wisdom would be great

For Mencius Ys way of doing things was the best Y was one of the great heroes of Mencius

In the West there was a scientist named Konrad Lorenz who studied animals He was an ethologist which means that he carefully studied the behavior of animals and tried to understand why they do the things that they typically do He observed for instance that if baby ducks see a human instead of a duck during the first few days of their lives they will ever after follow humans and take them to be their parents He called this kind of learning imprinting

Mencius studied humans the way Lorenz studied other animals Mencius was an ethologist too but in the language of ancient China he was regarded as a master that is a teacher He was a Confucian and Confucianism is sometimes called a religion However Mencius does not quote religious texts and try to get people to act the way those books say to act He also does not name fundamental truths or axioms and try to figure out how people ought to act So he is not like most people that we regard as either religious leaders or philosophers

In modern times we divide philosophy from science but in earlier times the kinds of studies we now call science were called natural philosophy and Mencius was primarily a natural philosopher His work led to the same general kind of knowledge that Lorenz learned about ducks and other animals Mencius asked what kinds of things do people do that keep families and communities successful what kinds of things do they do that are harmful to families and communities and why do they do these thing

Mencius said that we do not need to teach people to love the taste of good food The feeling we have for fine cooking is natural Similarly he said we have other natural feelings that are good gifts that we are all born with We cannot really get rid of these gifts except by destroying ourselves but we can allow them to be covered over so that they do not work right It is a little like the way humans cannot just take off their noses and throw them away but they can put plugs in their nostrils and spoil their ability to smell things So it is important that humans not do anything that would prevent their four gifts from working well It is too bad that people often let their four gifts get messed up When humans are well nurtured and are protected from negative forces then they will be good of their own free will

The virtues or powers that humans have are things that they get directly from Heaven These same things are in Heaven When people do bad things it is because their other parts have taken control away from their virtuespowers Mencius gives a wonderful story that is called Ox Mountain as proof

The Chinese word for what has been called gifts above is d It is a cognate of a word that means to get so one way of explaining it is to say that a d is something that we get from Heaven It means virtue but only in the sense that it is the power to do something Humans have four virtues or powers Here are their Chinese names a translation of each and an explanation of each

Human beings might be able to live perfect lives if they had only these four kinds of motivations or emotional reactions to the world but they have many other motivations They include fear anger greed for wealth and power sex etc Humans very easily learn that they can satisfy these drives more easily if they ignore the inputs from their virtues For instance a child who is large for his age may discover that he can take by force whatever he wants from other children his age

Human beings are born with the four powers that would keep them from doing bad things and they are also born with the many drives or motivations that can lead them to do bad things to satisfy these needs So what determines who will be good and who will be bad

Mencius observed that humans depend on one more important mental function He called it the Zh which can sometimes be translated as aspirations but which in the case of Mencius is what we would call the will Something has to decide what to do when the ethical impulses the moral feelings of what Mencius called the four virtues conflict with the ordinary impulses that are involved with hunger sex aggression fear etc The part of humans that balances things and makes decisions is the zh

For Mencius if an individual is functioning well then his or her will can strike a healthy balance among all the impulses and can keep the virtues from being swamped by the ordinary desires If a persons will is not in control then that person may do damage to himself or herself or to other people So it is important while growing up to learn how to keep the zh from getting taken over by other forcesor by other people 

The individual has a free will choice about whether to integrate all his impulses and also his intellect or to give up and just act on whatever impulse is being felt at the moment So for Mencius the ideal path for a human being is to plan and to act to make himself or herself well balanced integrated and so a useful person to society

Somebody who operates at the very high end of the moral scale by having his act together is called a jn z or morally noble man 

Mencius said That by which humans differ from the birds and the beasts is extremely minute Ordinary people get rid of it but the morally noble man preserves it The sage emperor Shun clearly perceived the multitudes of creatures and he made a close examination of human social relationships His actions proceeded from benevolence and the sense of duty He did not act out a semblance of benevolence and the sense of duty So a jn z is somebody who has managed to hold onto the gifts that Heaven has given him the gifts that can make humans act with benevolence be led by a sense of duty want to act in ways that will keep good relations with others and try to aid and protect people who are being treated unfairly To be a real jn z the person has to have these true feelings and to act on them It is not enough just to act as though one has these feelings

According to Mencius anyone could become a morally noble man All it would take would be to really act on that decision Mencius talked about Yan Yuan who was the favorite disciple of Confucius



Yan Yuan said What kind of a man was Shun What kind of a man am I All it takes to be like him is to do it

Of course Mencius realized that just doing it is much harder than talking about it One has to keep watching oneself all the time 

One goal that Mencius had was to grow what he called an unmovable mind By those words he meant a mind that could not be knocked around by being hit from the outside An unmovable mind is guarded against doing the wrong thing because one is angry afraid etc Anything that can pull or push from the outside and make us go out of control could cause harm but Mencius says that if the will and the four virtuespowers are well integrated if the person is really together then these outside forces cannot take over control

Every culture and every society has developed ways to prevent children from getting into too much trouble Even in a single community people may used several different strategies for getting and keeping control over their children One way of controlling children is to beat them when they do things that the parents do not want them to do Another way of controlling children is to make them feel guilty and expect to be severely punished because they are bad humans A third way is to make children feel shame and expect people to laugh at them and then turn away from them Method number four is to explain to children the likely results of their actions If you pull the dogs ears he will bite you Many parents the world over use more than one of these methods and they may use all of them from time to time

The Chinese culture has another method that may not be well known and may be rarely practiced in other placescalling forth the use of the childs own virtuepower When a child does something hurtful to someone else instead of telling the child how bad he or she is the parents may say something like Just now we saw you take the eggs out of the sparrows nest We know that you are a good person at heart So we wonder whether you thought about how the mother sparrow will feel when she comes back and finds her children gone Would you like to put the eggs back now while they are still warm The mother sparrow will be coming back soon 

The object of getting the child to look at the feelings that come up in his heartmind when he or she really thinks about what he or she did is not to make the child feel like a horrible person and not to make the child fear punishment Once the child really listens to the quiet voice of what we in the West would call the conscience then the child will naturally feel what the mother sparrow would feel if she came home to an empty nest The child will then do something so that the mother sparrow will not need to have that bad feeling The next time the child may think about how the mother sparrow will feel before he or she steals any eggs

It takes a long time to get really good at listing to these four gifts from Heaven and it takes practice to understand the possible consequences of some things that one might do So becoming a really good person is a lifetime job that is never really finished In the traditional Chinese society young people were encouraged to read both the stories of the past that showed virtuous acts and also to read the books by people like Confucius and Mencius to get help in learning to see all the results and learning how to keep anger fear and all the other ordinary emotions from overpowering the four moral virtuespowers

The term Radio frequency refers to electromagnetic radiation in the range of frequencies lower than microwaves These are the frequencies that have been found useful for long range communications Among these frequencies short wave communications operate at frequencies that can be reflected by the ionosphere and therefore can bounce around the earth Long wave frequencies are used for relatively short range communications such as the most ordinary of the commercial amplitude modulation radio stations Their transmissions ordinarily do not get long bounces

Different short wave frequencies can be reflected well and transmitted by long bounces around the world during times when different conditions prevail in the ionosphere So transmitters for such organizations as VOA and BBC will change operating frequencies from month to month and also from time to time during a 24 hour period

The White Flippered Penguin is a subspecies of the Little Penguin Their name comes from the unique white edges on their flippers

Saraikistan is a term used by few Saraikis to mean the southern region of the Punjab province of Pakistan inhabited by Saraiki speaking people while most of the people in this region recognize their region and society with the term waseb Customs and traditions practised by the people of Southern Punjab have largely been similar to those of Punjabis and Sindhis National recognition of Saraiki as a separate language giving it an official status a Saraiki province a Saraiki regiment in Army establishment of Saraiki radio and television are among primary demands of Saraiki movement

Hexachlorobenzene is an aromatic compound The molecule structure resembles benzene except that hydrogen atoms are replaced by chlorine It is a colorless powder that is produced using catalysis from Iron chloride or from Hexachlorocyclohexane Hexachlorobenzene was used as a fungicide mostly to treat cereals The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants forbids its production and use The main reason for this restriction was that the outbreaks of rare diseases Certain people eating food that had been treated became ill and the illness could be linked to this substance 

Chlordane is an insecticide introduced in 1947 It is an organochloride that acts like a contact poison It can be produced using the DielsAlder reaction and has at least 147 constituents Its main use was in treating seeds eg of potatoes wheat or vegetables It was also used for wood preservation and against ants and termites Chlordane only degrades slowly which means that it is relatively easy to spread it over long distances It accumulates in the body of animals in mammals mostly in the nervous system and the liver Chlordane has been shown to cause cancer in mice it may cause cancer in humans Chlordane is toxic It is listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants

Aldrin is an insecticide which was used against termites locusts and the larvae of Click beetles Most plants and animals convert it to Dieldrin It is listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants its production use and trade are banned since 2004 Aldrin is a neurotoxin People inhaling it can develop headaches but also seizures In humans Aldrin is converted to dieldrin in the liver The change will mean that it can leave the body again The problem is that the change is slow and the half life is about a year Aldrin may be a teratogen and it probably causes cancer 

Aldrin is produced by combining hexachlorocyclopentadiene with norbornadiene in a Diels Alder reaction to give the adduct

 Aldrin is named after the German chemist Kurt Alder one of the coinventors of this kind of reaction An estimated 270 million kilograms of aldrin and related cyclodiene pesticides were produced between 1946 and 1976

In soil on plant surfaces or in the digestive tracts of insects aldrin oxidizes to the epoxide dieldrin Dieldrin is more strongly insecticidal than aldrin

Mirex is a chlorinated hydrocarbon that was commercialized as an insecticide It was later banned because it was harmful to the environment This white crystalline odorless solid is a derivative of cyclopentadiene It was popularized to control fire ants but by virtue of its chemical robustness and lipophilicity it was recognized as a bioaccumulative pollutant However the spread of the red imported fire ant was actually encouraged by the use of Mirex as it also kills native ants that are highly competitive with the fire ants The United States Environmental Protection Agency prohibited its use in 1976

Dieldrin was developed as an alternative to DDT and has proved to be a highly effective insecticide It was very widely used during the 1950s to early 1970s Endrin is a stereoisomer of dieldrin

However it is an extremely persistent organic pollutant it does not degrade easily Furthermore it tends to biomagnify as it is passed along the food chain Long term exposure has proven toxic to a very wide range of animals including humans For this reason it is now banned in most of the world

It has been linked to health problems such as Parkinsons disease breast cancer and immune reproductive and nervous system damage It can also adversely affect testicular descent in the fetus if a pregnant woman is exposed to Dieldrin

Dieldrin is listed in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants

It can be formed from the synthesis of hexachloro 13 cyclopentadiene with norbornadiene in a Diels Alder reaction followed by epoxidation of the norbornene ring

 Dieldrin is named after Otto Paul Hermann Diels the co inventor of the Diels Alder reaction

Mount Stromlo is located west of the centre of Canberra Australia near the district of Weston Creek It is about 751m above sea level and 200m above the surrounding plains The Mount Stromlo Observatory is on the top of the mountain Canberras main water supply treatment plant supplied by the Cotter River catchment area is nearby Road access to the mountain is by Cotter Road on the south side and Uriarra Road on the east and north The summit is reached by a road joining Cotter road just outside Duffy

The mountain had been part of the Yarralumla Station a farm now used as the residence the Governor General of Australia It was named Mount Stromlo by Frederick Campbell in the 1880s but it is not known where he got the name Mount Stromlo was chosen by Pietro Baracchi in 1910 as the site for an observatory The first telescope installed at Mount Stromlo was the Oddie telescope on 8 September 1911 The building housing this telescope was the first built by the Australian government in Canberra In January 1913 the first telephone was connected to the Queanbeyan telephone exchange

Mount Stromlo was burnt during bushfires in 2003 The fire burnt a pine plantation that covered the mountain destroyed much of the observatory and water treatment plant

Before the 2003 fires Mount Stromlo had some of the best and oldest mountain bike trails in Australia In May 2006 the trails were rebuilt and made bigger Stromlo Forest Park now has more than 35 km of cross country single trail a Four Cross course several observed trials areas and a downhill track The 2009 Union Cycliste Internationale Mountain Bike and Trials World Championships were held at Mount Stromlo About 30000 visitors from up to 40 countries came to the event More than 750 of the worlds top riders took part in the four mountain bike sports of Cross Country Downhill Four Cross and Observed Trials

Mount Stromlo also has a large building for events with offices and change rooms There is a childrens play ground barbecues a road cycling circuit a grass cross country running track and horse riding trails

The rock on Mount Stromlo is ignimbrite from a volcanic eruption during the upper Silurian period This is covering rhyodacite from a much earlier period which can be seen on the surface on the lower slopes in the east and southeast sides The northern lower slopes are covered with a calcareous shale also from the Silurian period This is cut off on the northwest side by the Winslade Fault which heads north east to Cook and Kaleen A spur fault heads off east from the Winslade Fault to under the Scrivener Dam On the other side of these faults are middle Silurian period rhyodacite volcanic deposits The northern side has been uplifted compared with the southern side 

Stoney Creek and its tributaries drain the north side of the mountain The east side drains into the Molonglo River The south side supplies Blugar creek that runs into the Murrumbidgee River

The top of the mountain near the observatory runs in a north south direction with a spur running to the southwest where the water treatment plant is situated

Page layout is a part of typography and graphic design It deals with the arrangement and style of elements on a page 

Page design has long been a consideration in printed material It began with early illuminated manuscripts in the hand copied books of the Middle Ages Today modern magazine and catalogue layouts consist of type images and occasionally place holder graphics for elements that are not printed with ink such as dielaser cutting foil stamping or blind embossing

Since the advent of computing page layout skills are used on electronic media as well as print The electronic pagethe graphical user interfaceis often where design now takes place 

A page layout may be designed in a rough paper and pencil sketch before producing or produced during the design process to the final form Both design and production may be achieved using hand tools or page layout software Producing a web page may require knowledge of markup languages along with WYSIWYG software Special considerations must be made for how the layout of an HTML page will change when resized by the end user Cascading style sheets are often required to keep the page layout consistent between web browsers

Grids and templates are page layout design patterns used in advertising campaigns and multiple page publications including websites 

Most desktop publishing software allows for grids in the form of a page filled with coloured lines or dots placed at a specified equal horizontal and vertical distance apart Automatic margins and booklet spine lines may be specified for global use throughout the document Multiple additional horizontal and vertical lines may be placed at any point on the page Invisible to the end useraudience shapes may be placed on the page as guidelines for page layout and print processing as well Software templates are achieved by duplicating a template data file or with master page features in a multiple page document Master pages may include both grid elements and template elements such as header and footer elements automatic page numbering and automatic table of contents features

With modern media content retrieval and output technology there is much overlap between visual communications and information technology Large print publications and electronic pages require meta data for automatic indexing automatic reformatting database publishing dynamic page display and end user interactivity Much of the meta data must be hand coded or specified during the page layout process This divides the task of page layout between artists and engineers or tasks the artistengineer to do both 

More complex projects may require two separate designs page layout design as the front end and function coding as the back end In this case the front end may be designed using an alternative page layout technology such as image editing software or on paper with hand rendering methods Most image editing software includes features for converting a page layout for use in a What You See Is What You Get editor or features to export graphics for desktop publishing software WYSIWYG editors and desktop publishing software allow front end design prior to back end coding in most cases Interface design and database publishing may involve more technical knowledge or collaboration with information technology engineering in the front end

The 1920 Duluth lynchings occurred when a mob attacked and lynched three black circus workers in Duluth Minnesota Beforehand there were rumours that black people had raped a teenager A physician who examined the girl found no evidence of rape or assault

The killings shocked the country particularly because they had occurred in the northern United States Four lynchings had occurred in Minnesota before that time In 2003 the city of Duluth erected a memorial to the murdered workers 

Lynching is the execution of a person by the people of an area without the use of a court trial Often people lynched have been hanged Other forms of lynching such as being dragged to death behind a car burning and use of a gun have been used What makes the execution a lynching is the nature of it being done without a court trial by people who believe the accused is guilty of a crime Lynchings have been used in the southern states of the United States of America against African Americans during the time of slavery but more commonly after the abolition of slavery during the time of civil rights activism and the times of the various Ku Klux Klans Lynching is considered murder

Grouped data is a statistical term used in data analysis Raw data can be organized by grouping together similar measurements in a table This frequency table is also called grouped data

For example someone gave a group of students a simple math question and timed how long it took them to answer it The numbers are below

The smallest amount of time was 8 seconds and the largest was 34 seconds One method we could use to analyze the needed time is to group close numbers together In order to keep the analysis fair well make each group be the same amount of seconds We can then count how many students fell in each group For example if we organized scores into 5 second ranges

Another way to group data is to organize the scores data into groups based on their performance Suppose there are three types of students

Note that this estimated mean may be different from the sample mean of the ungrouped data The mean of the grouped data in the above example can be calculated as follows

F is the seventh semitone of the solfge

It lies a chromatic semitone above F and a diatonic semitone below G thus being enharmonic to Sol Bmol or Gmusic

La or A is the sixth note of the solfge A is generally used as a standard for tuning When the orchestra tunes the oboe plays an A and the rest of the instruments tune to match that pitch Every string instrument in the orchestra has an A string from which each player can tune the rest of their instrument

A0 is the lowest note on the standard piano The octaves follow A1 A2 etc A7 is a few pitches lower than C8 the highest note on the standard piano The note A is not considered to be a certain milestone or mark to hit with voice as for example Tenor C is but it can be extremely demanding in certain octaves

The American Old West or the Wild West means the history geography people and culture of life in the Western United States This often referring to the period of the later half of the 19th century between the American Civil War and the end of the century 

Desktop publishing is the creation of documents using page layout software on a personal computer

The term has been used for publishing at all levels from small circulation documents such as local newsletters to books magazines and newspapers However the term implies a more professional looking end result with a more complex layout than word processing and so when introduced in the 1980s was often used in connection with homes and small organisations who could not previously produce publication quality documents themselves

Desktop publishing began in 1985 with the introduction of MacPublisher the first WYSIWYG layout program which ran on the original 128K Macintosh computer The DTP market exploded in 1985 with the introduction in January of the Apple LaserWriter printer and later in July with the introduction of PageMaker software from Aldus which rapidly became the DTP industry standard software

Before the advent of desktop publishing the only option available to most persons for producing typed documents was a typewriter which offered only a handful of typefaces and one or two font sizes Indeed one popular desktop publishing book was actually titled The Mac is not a typewriter The ability to create WYSIWYG page layouts on screen and then print pages containing text and graphical elements at crisp 300 dpi resolution was revolutionary for both the typesetting industry and the personal computer industry Newspapers and other print publications made the move to DTP based programs from older layout systems in the 1980s 

The term desktop publishing is attributed to Aldus Corporation founder Paul Brainerd who sought a marketing catch phrase to describe the small size and relative affordability of this software in contrast to the expensive commercial phototypesetting equipment of the day

Behind the scenes technologies developed by Adobe Systems set the foundation for professional desktop publishing applications Although Macintosh based systems would continue to dominate the market in 1986 the GEM based Ventura Publisher was introduced for MS DOS computers While PageMakers pasteboard metaphor closely simulated the process of creating layouts manually Ventura Publisher automated the layout process through its use of style sheets This software automatically generated indices and other body matter This made it suitable for manuals and other long format documents

During its early years desktop publishing acquired a bad reputation as a result of untrained users who created poorly organized layouts similar criticism would be levied again against early Web publishers a decade later However some were able to realize truly professional results 

There are two types of pages in desktop publishing electronic pages and virtual paper pages to be printed on paper All computerized documents are technically electronic and are limited in size only by computer memory or computer data storage space 

Virtual paper pages will ultimately be printed and therefore require paper parameters that coincide with international standard physical paper sizes such as A4 letter etc if not custom sizes for trimming Some desktop publishing programs allow custom sizes designated for large format printing used in posters billboards and trade show displays A virtual page for printing has a predesignated size of virtual printing material and can be viewed on a monitor in WYSIWYG format Each page for printing has trim sizes and a printable area if bleed printing is not possible as is the case with most desktop printers 

A web page is an example of an electronic page that is not constrained by virtual paper parameters Most electronic pages may be dynamically re sized causing either the content to scale in size with the page or causing the content to re flow

Master pages are templates used to automatically copy or link elements and graphic design styles to some or all the pages of a multipage document Linked elements can be modified without having to change each instance of an element on pages that use the same element Master pages can also be used to apply graphic design styles to automatic page numbering

Page layout is the process by which the elements are laid on the page orderly aesthetically and precisely Main types of components to be laid out on a page include text linked images that can only be modified as an external source and embedded images that may be modified with the layout application software Some embedded images are rendered in the application software while others can be placed from an external source image file Text may be keyed into the layout placed or linked to an external source of text which allows multiple editors to develop a document at the same time

Graphic design styles such as color transparency and filters may also be applied to layout elements Typography styles may be applied to text automatically with style sheets Some layout programs include style sheets for images in addition to text Graphic styles for images may be border shapes colors transparency filters and a parameter designating the way text flows around the object called wraparound or runaround

While desktop publishing software still provides extensive features necessary for print publishing modern word processors now have publishing capabilities beyond those of many older DTP applications blurring the line between word processing and desktop publishing

In the early days of graphical user interfaces DTP software was in a class of its own when compared to the fairly spartan word processing applications of the time Programs such as WordPerfect and WordStar were still mainly text based and offered little in the way of page layout other than perhaps margins and line spacing On the other hand word processing software was necessary for features like indexing and spell checking features that are common in many applications today

As computers and operating systems have become more powerful vendors have sought to provide users with a single application platform that can meet all needs

The key difference between electronic typesetting software and DTP software is that DTP software is generally interactive and WYSIWYG in design while other electronic typesetting software requires the user to enter the processing programs markup language without immediate visualization of the finished product This kind of workflow is less user friendly than WYSIWYG but more suitable for conference proceedings and scholarly articles as well as corporate newsletters or other applications where consistent automated layout is important

One of the early and comprehensive reference books on the art of Desktop Publishing is Desktop Publishing For Everyone by KSV Menon This publication deals with virtually every facet of publishing and nearly all tools available as at the time of the publishing of this book in the year 2000 It is currently out of print

There is some overlap between desktop publishing and what is known as Hypermedia publishing Many graphical HTML editors such as Microsoft FrontPage and Adobe Dreamweaver use a layout engine similar to a DTP program However some Web designers still prefer to write HTML without the assistance of a WYSIWYG editor for greater control and because these editors often result in code bloat

Many books specialise in the details of particular software These three teach the basics of page layout design on desktop systems

Neurospora is a genus of Ascomycete fungi The best known species in this genus is Neurospora crassa a common model organism in genetics and molecular biology

The first published account of this fungus was from an infestation of French bakeries in 1843 

N crassa is used as a model organism because it is easy to grow and has a haploid life cycle that makes genetic analysis simple since recessive traits will show up in the offspring Analysis of genetic recombination is facilitated by the ordered arrangement of the products of meiosis in Neurospora ascospores Its entire genome of seven chromosomes has been sequenced

Neurospora was used by Edward Tatum and George Wells Beadle in their experiments for which they won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1958 Beadle and Tatum exposed N crassa to x rays causing mutations They then observed failures in metabolic pathways caused by errors in specific enzymes This led them to propose the one gene one enzyme hypothesis that specific genes code for specific proteins Their hypothesis was later elaborated to enzyme pathways by Norman Horowitz also working on Neurospora

In the 24 April 2003 issue of Nature the genome of N crassa was reported as completely sequenced The genome is about 43 megabases long and includes approximately 10000 genes There is a project underway to produce strains containing knockout mutants of every N crassa gene

In its natural environment N crassa lives mainly in tropical and sub tropical regions It can be found growing on dead plant matter after fires Neurospora is actively used in research around the world It is important in the elucidation of molecular events involved in circadian rhythms epigenetics and gene silencing cell polarity cell fusion development as well as many aspects of cell biology and biochemistry

Strains and other materials for working with Neurospora are available from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center

A spectrograph is an instrument that breaks up a wave into a frequency spectrum These could be sound light or radio waves For example the frequency spectrum of light is the brightness and the amount of each colour There are several kinds of machines called spectrographs used to look at different waves The term was first used in 1884Merriam Webster Dictionary Spectrographref 

A spectrograph is closely related to a polychromator

In astronomy the first spectrographs used photographic paper as the detector The star spectral classification and discovery of the main sequence Hubbles law and the Hubble sequence were all made using photographic paper The plant pigment phytochrome was discovered using a spectrograph that used living plants as the detector New spectrographs use electronic detectors such as CCDs which can be used for both visible and UV light The type of detector depends on the wavelengths of light to be recorded

An echelle spectrograph is a special machine which is able to break up light waves with a high resolution and little interference It does this by using very narrow slits which breaks light into beams and then breaking up those beams again

Thelma is a female given name which in Greek means will and volition There are many celebrities going under this feminine name Also there are many television series featuring characters with the name Thelma In addition a deadly tropical cyclone by the name Thelma struck the Philippines in latter 1991

In astronomy first light is the first time a telescope is used to look at the Universe This is often not the first time the telescope has been used Tests will have been done during daylight to make sure everything is working Images taken during first light are not normally of scientific interest They are usually poor quality as the parts of the telescope have not been properly adjusted for best performance Usually a well known and spectacular astronomical object is chosen First light is always a moment of great excitement both for the people who designed and built the telescope and for the astronomical community

For example the 200 inch Hale Telescope saw first light January 26 1949 targeting a nebula located in the constellation Monoceros under the direction of American astronomer Edwin Hubble The image was published in many magazines 

The Large Binocular Telescope had its first light with a single primary mirror on October 12 2005 This was a view of NGC 891 a spiral galaxy in the Andromeda constellation The second mirror was installed in January 2006 and the telescope became fully operational in January 2008 

In physical cosmology first light refers to the light coming from the first generation of hyperstars These were formed less than a billion years after the big bang bringing an end to the cosmological Dark Ages

A party realignment is what happens when the balance of power between a countrys political parties changes greatly Their electoral coalitions change dramatically Sometimes this happens when political parties die out or are created Party realigments can be the result of major historical events They can also be the result of changes in demographics Party realignments can happen in many countries but the term is usually used in the United States

In the early 1800s America had the First Party System of Federalists and Democratic Republicans By the election of James Monroe the Federalists had died out There was one party rule by the the Democratic Republicans In the election of 1824 four different people ran as Democratic Republicans John Quincy Adams was elected After the election Andrew Jackson formed a new party called the Democrats Jacksons party was strongest in the South and West and in some cities Soon after Jacksons election another party formed around supporters of Adams and Henry Clay It was first called the National Republican Party and later the Whig Party The Whigs were strong in the North and among the middle class and businessmen The clash between Democrats and Whigs was called the Second Party System 

After the Kansas Nebraska Act the Second Party System ended and the following things happened 

America went from being mostly Republican in the 1920s to mostly Democratic in the 1930s This was due to America becoming much more urban and also due to the Great Depression  Franklin D Roosevelt formed a coalition that would mostly last until 1964 called the New Deal coalition How things changed

In the 1960s and 70s the New Deal coalition fell apart This was due to the Civil Rights Movement Roe v Wade and the suburbanization of America What changed

A rotating furnace is a special type of furnace used to make lenses or mirrors for telescopes Glass is placed in the furnace which is then spun up and heated The top surface of the melted glass takes on a concave shape The glass is cooled while still spinning The spinning makes the glass the same shape as the main mirror used in a telescope Computer controlled grinding machines can correct the shape of the glass The concave top surface can be coated with silver and be used as a focusing mirror The shape of bottom surface is made by the container the glass was melted in The technology is being used for the Giant Magellan Telescope seven mirrors 

Large focusing mirrors can also be made using liquid mercury such as the Large Zenith Telescope The rotation is continuous and the metal remains liquid once all waves and imbalances die out the telescope is then used 

An independent variable is the variable you have control over what you can choose and manipulate It is usually what you think will affect the dependent variable In some cases you may not be able to manipulate the independent variable It may be something that is already there and is fixed something you would like to evaluate with respect to how it affects something else the dependent variable like color kind time

Example You are interested in how stress affects heart rate in humans Your independent variable would be the stress and the dependent variable would be the heart rate You can directly manipulate stress levels in your human subjects and measure how those stress levels change heart rate

A dependent variable is the variable in an experiment that changes It depends on some change in other variables in the experiment For example if you want to know how much light a plant needs to grow the amount of growth is the dependent In math the dependent variable changes with the independent variable hence the name

Scratch means a light wound or a slight wound

The Large Zenith Telescope is a 60 metre diameter telescope located in the University of British Columbias Malcolm Knapp Research Forest about convert70km0abbron east of Vancouver It is one of the largest optical telescopes in the world 

A zenith telescope is only able to look straight up This means that it can use a mirror which is a smoothly spinning pan filled with liquid mercury The LZT uses 28 litres of mercury spinning once every 85 seconds This type of mirror can be made much larger and cheaper than a conventional mirror which means it collects much more light This light is focused into a CCD to make an image The LZT is used for transit imaging This means that earths rotation moves stars past the telescope Images can be taken by moving the sensor electronically in step with this movement

The telescope was made in 1994 using parts from the three metre diameter NASA Orbital Debris Observatory telescope which was retired a couple years earlier after several years of use

The Battle of Maryang San is known as Australias greatest accomplishment in the Korean War The battle occurred when the US General George Fleet called for forces to capture some positions just prior to the signing of the truce at Panmanjan

The Commonwealth forces fighting as part of the United Nations consisted of a number of British Australian an New Zealand units These included three Battalions of the 28th British Commonwealth Brigade the 1st Battalion The Kings Own Scottish Borderers 1st Battalion Kings Shropshire Light Infantry and 3rd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment Brigadier George Taylor was the Brigade Commander The British Commonwealth Division consisted of the 25th 28th and 29th Brigades under the command of Lieutenant General James Gentleman Jim Cassels and was part of 1 Corps These units was arrayed against the Chinese Communist forces3 Battalion RAR was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Frank Francis Hassett Commonwealth forces main aims were to take a number of hill positions eventually culminating in taking the main objective Maryang San

Initial attacks saw the Australian A and B company of 3 RAR take Hill 199 and the 1st Battalion Kings Shropshire Light Infantry take Hill 208 The The Kings Own Scottish Borderers had moved to take Hill 399 but were pinned down on its slopes by nightfall The Australians attacked at dawn moving against the Chinese held Hill 200 Chinese infantry were driven from their trenches and they fled leaving behind some prisoners of war The first gun emplacement was taken and then the second with the Chinese troops retreating down the slope of Hill 200

A B and D Companies attacked the Chinese units and drew them away from Maryan San the main objective Following United Nationas forces artillery and mortar fire Chinese Troops withdrew from Maryan San and the Australian troops moved to take the position Australian troops moved against an area that was used by the Chinese for artillery bombardments known as the Hinge After taking the Hinge they were subjected to constant attacks which eventually became sporadic and died off At about 8 pm the Chinese launched an attack in huge numbers The Australian units were well dug in using the Chinese own trench positions and responded to the waves of Chinese troops with machine gun fire Chinese troops fell in their hundreds South Korean porters moved forward constantly bringing supplies and taking away wounded 

By 5 November after the Australians were withdrawn to recuperate Maryang San had been recaptured by the Chinese It was a terrible blow to morale for those who had fought long and hard to capture it The tactically important ground of Maryang San remained in the hands of Chinese forces for the rest of the war

A gerund is a verb used as a noun 

In English the gerund is formed by adding ing to a verb root It is identical in form to the present participle and can behave as a verb within a clause but the clause as a whole acts as a noun within the larger sentence For example Eating this cake is easy

In Eating this cake is easy eating this cake although traditionally known as a phrase is referred to as a non finite clause in modern linguistics Eating is the verb in the clause while this cake is the object of the verb Eating this cake acts as a noun phrase within the sentence as a whole though the subject of the sentence is the non finite clause specifically eating

Other examples of the gerund

Not all nouns that are identical in form to the present participle are gerunds The formal distinction is that a gerund is a verbal noun a noun derived from a verb that retains verb characteristics that functions simultaneously as a noun and a verb while other nouns in the form of the present participle are deverbal nouns which function as common nouns not as verbs at all Compare

As the result of its origin and development the gerund has nominal and verbal properties The nominal characteristics of the gerund are as follows

The verbal characteristics of the gerund include the following

Verbs that are often followed by a gerund include admit adore anticipate appreciate avoid carry on consider contemplate delay deny describe detest dislike enjoy escape fancy feel finish give hear imagine include justify listen to mention mind miss notice observe perceive postpone practice quit recall report resent resume risk see sense sleep stop suggest tolerate and watch Additionally prepositions are often followed by a gerund

For example

The Institution of Electrical Engineers was a British professional organisation of electronics electrical manufacturing and Information Technology professionals It focused on electrical engineers The IEE was founded in 1871 as the Society of Telegraph Engineers It changed its name in 1880 to the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians The name changed again to the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1889 It was Incorporated by a Royal Charter in 1921 In 2006 the IEE merged with the Institution of Incorporated Engineers to form the Institution of Engineering and Technology Before the merger the IEE was the largest professional engineering society in Europe with a worldwide membership of around 120000

In linguistics a participle is a word that shares some characteristics of both verbs and adjectives 

Passive participles reflect past action in the passive voice for example

Examples of participle formation include

While English past participles like past tense forms are sometimes irregular all English present participles are regular being formed with the suffix ing The present participle in English is in the active voice and is used for 

The present participle in English has the same form as the gerund but the gerund acts as a noun rather than a verb or a modifier The word sleeping in Your job description does not include sleeping is a gerund and not a present participle

The past participle may be used in both active and passive voices

The Magellanic Clouds also called Nubeculae Magellani are two irregular dwarf galaxies This means that they do not have a regular shape for example round or spiral and only have a few billion stars The Magellanic Clouds can be seen from the southern hemisphere They are part of a group of about 30 galaxies which are in our part of the Universe They are orbiting the Milky Way galaxy The two clouds are known as

The first written record of the Magellanic Clouds was by the Persian astronomer Al Sufi In 964 he wrote the Book of Fixed Stars He called the Large Magellanic Cloud al Bakr of the southern Arabs He wrote that the Cloud could not be seen from northern Arabia and Baghdad but could be seen at the strait of Bab el Mandeb This is the southernmost point of Arabia

In Europe the Clouds were first seen by Italian explorers Peter Martyr dAnghiera and Andrea Corsali at the end of the 15th century They were also seen by Antonio Pigafetta who went with Ferdinand Magellan on his circumnavigation of the world in 1519 1522 However naming the clouds after Magellan did not become widespread until much later In Bayers 1661 book Uranometria they are called nubecula major and nubecula minor In the 1756 star map by French astronomer Lacaille they are called le Grand Nuage and le Petit Nuage

The Clouds can be easily seen without the use of a telescope They look like separated pieces of the Milky Way About 21 apart in the night sky the real distance between them is about 75000 light years Until the discovery of the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy in 1994 they were the closest known galaxies to our own The LMC is about 160000 light years away while the SMC is about 200000 The LMC is about 14000 light years in diameter and the SMC about 7000 For comparison the Milky Way is about 100000 light years across

Scientists believe that the shape of Magellanic Clouds has been caused by tidal interaction with the Milky Way as they travel close to it Streams of neutral hydrogen connect them to the Milky Way and to each other Both Clouds look like they were once spiral in shape Their gravity has affected the Milky Way as well distorting the outer parts of the galaxys disc shape

They have a different structure and lower mass than our galaxy There are two other big differences First they are gas rich they have more hydrogen and helium compared to the Milky Way They are also more metal poor than the Milky Way The youngest stars in the LMC and SMC have less than half the amount of other elements Both are noted for their nebulae and larger numbers of young stars Like our own Galaxy their stars range from the very young to the very old which shows the Clouds have a long history

A supernova SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud was the brightest object seen from Earth in over four centuries

In 2010 a French scientist said that the clouds may have been ejected from a collision that formed the Andromeda Galaxy six billion years ago However most astronomers believe the Magellanic Clouds were made in the same process that formed our Milky Way Galaxy

New research suggests that the SMC may in fact be split in two A smaller part may hidden about 30000 light years behind the SMC This could have happened with the LMC splitting the SMC and that the two sections are still moving apart This smaller section is being called the Mini Magellanic Cloud

The Siberian Crane also known as the Siberian White Crane or the Snow Crane is a critically endangered species of crane These cranes are found in three groups the eastern group which migrates from eastern Siberia to China the central group which migrates from western Siberia to India and the western group which migrate from western Russia to Iran

Adult Siberian cranes are 140 cm tall and weight 6 kg Their plumage is pure white except for some wing feathers which are black The front of the face does not have any feathers and is reddish in color

The Siberian crane is a migratory species with three major populations or groups

The eastern group is estimated to contain around 3000 4000 cranes over 95 of the total population  In 2008 3750 individuals were counted at Poyang Lake in China one of the breeding sites  This group of cranes breeds in the Yakutia region of northeastern Siberia and spends the winter in the Yangtze River valley However cranes sometimes are found in areas like Mongolia Japan and Korea although they do not breed there

The central group is believed to breed in western Siberia especially along the Ob River These cranes spend the winter in India Although no one has actually tracked a crane on its migration route researchers believe the cranes in Siberia fly over Kazakhstan and Afghanistan to reach Indias Keoladeo National Park They believe this because cranes were seen in Kazakhstan and may have even nested there and several cranes are known to stop in Afghanistans lakes during their migration However cranes of the central group were last seen in 2002 and there were only four cranes Therefore many believe this group is now extinct

A Light machine gun or LMG is a type of machine gun that is designed to be used by only one soldier When they are being used to support infantry they are usually called a squad automatic weapon

The light machine gun can be noticed either by looking at the weapon or the role it plays It usually fires in short bursts and from a bipod The light machine gun does not fire from a tripod as this is what the medium machine gun does 

Light machine guns were first used in World War I to boost infantry firepower When World War II ended light machine guns were being given out at around one per section or squad and the modern infantry had come up with tactics to use the light machine gun to give suppressing fire which means the light machine gun fires at one target in a long burst to allow the infantry to move

Razor shells also called razor clams are bivalves with the shape of an old fashioned cut throat razor They use their shells to work into the sand and hide beneath the surface

Ensis of the family Pharidae is found on sandy beaches in Northern Europe and Eastern Canada such as Prince Edward Island Ensis arcuatus prefers coarser sand than its relatives E ensis and E siliqua

There is also another family of razor shells the Solenidae Some think Solen and Ensis are close relatives and some think they are similar because of convergent evolution The matter will no doubt be settled by sequence analysis in due course

The razor shell has been known to reach convert23cmin in length The dorsal margin is straight while the ventral margin is curved It can easily be confused with the slightly shorter convert15cmin and more curved E ensis

Razor shells have a fragile shell with open ends The shell is smooth on the outside and whitish in color with vertical and horizontal reddish brown or purplish brown markings separated by a diagonal line The periostracum is olive green The inner surface is white with a purple tinge and the foot is creamy white with brown lines 

The razor shell lives under the sand using its powerful foot to dig to a safe depth The digging has six stages repeated A digging cycle involves the muscular foot and the opening and closing of the valve and one end 

The foot is inflated hydraulically and pushed down into the sand to anchor the animal Deflation of the foot then pulls the shell down The razor shell also squirts water down into the sand removing loose sand from its path The foot exerts a pressure of 2 kgcm2

The presence of the shell under the sand is revealed by a keyhole shaped hole in the sand made by its siphons during suspension feeding for plankton

In the razor shell sexual development is highly synchronous eggs and sperms are shed at the same time In winter and spring consecutive spawns take place interrupted by periods when more eggs and sperm are produced

Cockles are a group of small edible saltwater clams They are marine bivalve molluscs in the family Cardiidae 

They are very common on sandy sheltered beaches throughout the world The distinctive rounded shells of cockles are symmetrical and are heart shaped when viewed from the end In most genera there are numerous radial ribs The genus Laevicardium the egg cockles have very smooth shells

The mantle has three openings for siphoning water and for the foot to stick out Cockles are capable of jumping by bending and straightening the foot Cockles burrow using the foot and feed by filtering plankton from the surrounding water Some species reach maturity quickly

Confusingly the common name cockle is also given to a number of other small edible bivalves which have a somewhat similar shape however these bivalves are in other families such as the Veneridae and the Arcidae Cockles in the family Cardiidae are sometimes known as true cockles in order to distinguish them from these other species

 

Wildfire is a general term which includes forest fires grassland fires bushfires brush fires and any other vegetation fire in countryside areas

Wildfires occur on every continent except Antarctica Fossil records and human history contain evidence of wildfires as wildfires can occur in periodic intervals 

Wildfires can cause extensive damage to property and human life but they also have some beneficial effects on wilderness areas Some plant species depend on the effects of fire for growth and reproduction although large wildfires may also have negative ecological effects

Strategies of wildfire prevention detection and suppression have varied over the years One of the more controversial techniques is controlled burning permitting or lighting small fires to cut the amount of flammable material for a potential wildfire While some wildfires burn in remote forested regions they can cause extensive destruction of homes and other property located in the zone between developed areas and undeveloped wilderness

Plants in wildfire prone ecosystems often have adaptations to their local conditions Such adaptations include physical protection against heat increased growth after a fire event and flammable materials that encourage fire and may eliminate competition For example plants of the genus Eucalyptus contain flammable oils that encourage fire and hard sclerophyll leaves that resist heat and drought This makes them dominant over less fire tolerant species Dense bark shedding lower branches and high water content in external structures may also protect trees from rising temperatures Fire resistant seeds and reserve shoots that sprout after a fire encourage species preservation as shown by pioneer species which are first to start up after a fire 

Smoke charred wood and heat can stimulate the germination of seeds Smoke from burning plants promotes contains orange butenolide which induces germination of seeds

Grasslands in Western Sabah Malaysian pine forests and Indonesian Casuarina forests are believed to have resulted from previous periods of fire The deadwood litter of Chamise is low in water content and flammable and the shrub quickly sprouts after a fire Sequoia relies on periodic fires to reduce competition release seeds from their cones and clear the soil and canopy for new growth Some have adapted to and rely on low intensity surface fires for survival and growth The optimum fire frequency for Caribbean Pine in Bahamian pineyards is every 3 to 10 years Too frequent fires favour herbaceous plants and infrequent fires favour other tree species

A bipod is a device with two legs It is used to hold things up to make them more stable It makes things more stable along the two axes of motion which are up and down and left and right

A cultural icon can be a symbol logo picture name face person building or other image It is easily recognized and generally represents an object or idea with great cultural significance to a wide cultural group It has a special status as representing or important to or loved by a particular group of people a place or a period in history

In the media many well known examples of popular culture have been called iconic Some writers say that the word is overused

According to Times of India

Brands can show social values and changes but many people have become tired of them Many brands want to be cultural icons but fail Cultural icons are often timeless imprinted in our consciousness They can go through several stages from rumblings undercurrents via catharsis explosion and mass acceptance ripple effect to glorification representative value While brands are rational and driven by features cultural icons are emotional free driven by feeling and creating emotional bonds An example of branding might include the wearing of a consistent fashion look by such music stars as Michael Jackson or Elvis Presley making them instantly recognizable Royal or church clothing could also be understood as a form of emotional iconography 

Cultural icons may be national regional or about a city And they can be symbols for a nation or can show the values held by that state For example France uses Marianne as a symbol of the French Revolution Bruce Lee is a symbol for the martial arts and philosophical culture of insight and knowledge in the entire world Charlie Chaplin symbolises comical action while Clint Eastwood is a symbol for strength and masculinity Jackie Chan is a global icon of comical stunts and martial arts based action Salvador Dal is the worldwide icon for the bizarre and eccentric

Some writers say that the terms icon and iconic have been overused A writer in Liverpool Daily Post calls iconic a word that makes my flesh creep a word pressed into service to describe almost anything The Christian Examiner added iconic and amazing to its list of overused words It found over 18000 iconic references in news stories alone with another 30000 for icon including use of it for SpongeBob SquarePants

Sciadopitys the Japanese Umbrella pine is a unique conifer It is endemic to Japan and the sole surviving member of the family Sciadopityaceae It is a living fossil with no close relatives its fossils date from 230 million years ago 

It is an evergreen tree that can grow 15 27m tall Its brown main shoots have whorls of 712 cm long flexible green cladodes These look like and perform the function of leaves but are actually composed of stem tissues occasionally a cladode will be forked and produce a bud in the v of the fork 

The cones are 611 cm long mature in about 18 months and have flattish scales that open to release the seeds

It is a very attractive tree and is popular in gardens despite its slow growth rate and high cost Koyamaki was chosen as the Japanese Imperial crest for Prince Hisahito of Akishino currently third in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne

The plant was first introduced to Europe by John Gould Veitch in September 1860

Infrared microspectroscopy has identified conifers of the family Sciadopityaceae as the principal source of Baltic amber

Symphylans also known as garden centipedes or glasshouse symphylans are soil dwelling arthropods of the class Symphyla in the subphylum Myriapoda Symphylans look like centipedes but are smaller and translucent They can move quickly through the pores between soil particles and are typically found from the surface down to a depth of about 50 cm They consume decaying vegetation but can do considerable harm in an agricultural setting by consuming seeds roots and root hairs in cultivated soil

Pauropods are small centipede like arthropods They form the order Pauropodina belonging to the monotypic class Pauropoda About 500 species in four families are found worldwide living in soil and leaf mold 

Pauropoda are tiny soil myriapods 05 15mm in length with 8 11 body segments The body appears to have fewer segments when viewed from above because the dorsal shields are fused in pairs The true segments can be seen from the ventral side each segment bearing a single pair of walking legs A characteristic feature of pauropods is their branched antennae 

Plants have many defences to avoid being eaten Defence against herbivory describes a range of adaptations which improve the survival and reproduction of plants by reducing the impact of herbivores 

Plants use several strategies to defend against damage caused by herbivores Many plants produce chemicals which change the behaviour growth or survival of herbivores These chemical defences can act as repellents or toxins to herbivores or reduce plant digestibility

Other defensive strategies used by plants include escaping or avoiding herbivores in time or in place They may grow where plants are not easily found or got at by herbivores They may grow when herbivores are not around Herbivores may get diverted towards non essential parts or a plant may be able to recover from the damage caused by herbivory 

Some plants encourage the presence of natural enemies of herbivores which in turn protect the plant Each type of defence can be either constitutive or induced

Historically insects have been the most significant herbivores and the evolution of land plants is closely associated with the evolution of insects While most plant defences are directed against insects other defences have evolved that are aimed at vertebrate herbivores such as birds and mammals The study of plant defences against herbivory is important not only from an evolutionary view point but also because these defences can be used in agriculture including human and livestock food sources

The earliest land plants evolved from aquatic plants around 450 million years ago in the Ordovician period These early land plants had no vascular system and required free water for their reproduction Vascular plants appeared later and their diversification began in the Devonian era They had adaptations such as protective coatings to reduce evaporation from their tissues 

Reproduction and dispersal of vascular plants in these dry conditions was achieved through the evolution of specialized seed structures The diversification of flowering plants during the Cretaceous period is associated with the sudden burst of speciation in insects This diversification of insects represented a major selective force in plant evolution and led to selection of plants that had defensive adaptations Early insect herbivores bit or chewed vegetation but the evolution of vascular plants lead to the co evolution of other forms of herbivory such as sap sucking leaf mining gall forming and nectar feeding

Our understanding of herbivory in geological time comes from three sources fossilized plants which may preserve evidence of defense or herbivory related damage the observation of plant debris in fossilised coprolite and the construction of herbivore mouthparts

Long thought to be a Mesozoic phenomenon evidence for herbivory is found almost as soon as fossils which could show it Within under 20 million years of the first fossils of sporangia and stems towards the close of the Silurian around 420 mya there is evidence that they were being eaten Animals fed on the spores of early Devonian plants and the Rhynie chert also provides evidence that organisms fed on plants using a pierce and suck technique Many plants of this time are preserved with spine like enations which may have performed a defensive role before being co opted to develop into leaves

During the ensuing 75 million years plants evolved a range of more complex organs from roots to seeds There was a gap of 50 to 100 million years between each organ evolving and it being fed upon Hole feeding and skeletonization are recorded in the early Permian with surface fluid feeding evolving by the end of that period

Herbivores depend on plants for food and have evolved mechanisms to obtain this food despite the evolution of a diverse arsenal of plant defences Herbivore adaptations to plant defence have been likened to offensive traits and consist of adaptations that allow increased feeding and use of a host plant Relationships between herbivores and their host plants often results in reciprocal evolutionary change called co evolution 

When a herbivore eats it eats plants that do not mount a sufficient defensive response This creates the opportunity for plants which can mount a defence So plants with defences become the more common In cases where this relationship demonstrates specificity and reciprocity the species are thought to have co evolved 

The escape and radiation mechanism for co evolution presents the idea that adaptations in herbivores and their host plants have been the driving force behind speciation and have played a role in the radiation of insect species during the age of angiosperms Some herbivores have evolved ways to hijack plant defenses to their own benefit by sequestering these chemicals and using them to protect themselves from predators

The Wheeling Tunnel is a pair of tunnels in Wheeling Ohio County West Virginia The tunnels allow Interstate 70 and US Route 250 to go through Wheeling Hill Each tunnel has two lanes of each road 

The tunnel is run by the West Virginia Division of Highways Opened in 1966 the Wheeling Tunnel cost 69 million to build It was rebuilt between 2007 and 2010 for 137 million In 2009 an average of 59600 cars used the tunnel every day

The Wheeling Tunnel is between exits 1A and 1B on Interstate 70 and US Route 250 These two highways use the same road through the city of Wheeling to go through Wheeling Hill People who need to use exit 1A at the western end of the tunnels use the tunnels right lanes as acceleration and deceleration lanes Changing lanes is not allowed inside the tunnel

Several accidents involving semi trailer trucks caused local politicians to try to ban trucks from the tunnel Their plan would have the trucks use the nearby I 470

A total of 13000 square feet of industrial tile was used to cover the inside of the tunnels The tunnels cost 69 million to build The then governor of West Virginia William Wallace Barron and the state roads commissioner started construction on the tunnel on August 22 1963 Barron said it was the largest single building project in the states Interstate Highway program The state gave the construction contract to CJ Langenfelder Son Inc located in Baltimore Maryland During construction several workers became sick after breathing a lot of carbon monoxide As a result the company stopped construction in 1964 until fans were installed The tunnel officially opened to traffic on December 7 1966

The West Virginia Division of Highways began planning to rebuild the tunnel in 2005 Rebuilding began in January 2007 The plan allowed three months for the work However rebuilding of the eastbound tunnel took over eleven months There were problems with the glue that attached the tiles to the tunnel wall Problems with drains in the tunnel also caused delays Workers found a coal mine in the tunnel This also delayed the project

Local officials suggested closing the tunnels because of these problems They planned to just build a road over Wheeling Hill instead Building the new road would have removed at least fifty families from their homes The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People was against this plan because those peoples houses would be destroyed The state canncelled the plan for the new road Rebuilding of the eastbound tunnel started again in July 2008 

During this rebuilding of the eastbound tunnel the westbound tunnel was only closed overnight for rebuilding New guard rails fire sprinklers and security cameras were added The whole tunnel was also cleaned very well Workers put a new road surface in the tunnel A German tile maker replaced the tiles The German company got the contract because no other company could finish the work on time The company finished rebuilding the eastbound tunnel on October 31 2008 The state closed the westbound tunnel in February 2010 It opened a month ahead of schedule in September 2010 The total cost of the project was over double the original plan It totaled 137 million because of the delays

Karl Friedrich Schinkel was a Prussian architect city planner and painter He also designed furniture and stage sets Schinkel was one of the most importat architects of Germany and designed both neoclassical and neogothic buildings

Schinkel was born in Neuruppin Brandenburg When he was six his father died in Neuruppins disastrous fire He became a student of architect Friedrich Gilly and his father David Gilly in Berlin He made a trip to Italy in 1805 Then he started to earn his living as a painterHe worked for the stage and created in 1816 a star spangled backdrop for the appearance of the Knigin der Nacht in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts opera The Magic Flute When he saw Caspar David Friedrichs painting Wanderer above the Sea of Fog at the 1810 Berlin art exhibition he decided that he would never reach such mastery of painting and turned to architecture After Napoleons defeat Schinkel worked at the Prussian Building Commission In this position he was not only responsible for reshaping the city of Berlin into a representative capital for Prussia but also had to work projects in the expanded Prussian territories from the Rhineland in the west to Knigsberg in the east

From 1808 to 1817 Schinkel renovated and reconstructed Schloss Rosenau Coburg in the Gothic Revival style

Schinkels style was more influenced by Greek than by than Imperial Roman architecture His most famous buildings are found in and around Berlin These include Neue Wache the Schauspielhaus at the Gendarmenmarkt which replaced the earlier theater that was destroyed by fire in 1817 and the Altes Museum on Museum Island

Later Schinkel moved away from classicism altogether and preferred the Gothic Revival style Schinkel died in Berlin Brandenburg

Schinkel however is famous as well for his theoretical work and his architectural drafts Some of his merits are best shown in his unexecuted plans for the transformation of the Athenian Acropolis into a royal palace for the new Kingdom of Greece and for the erection of the Orianda Palace in the Crimea These and other designs may be studied in his Sammlung architektonischer Entwrfe and his Werke der hheren Baukunst He also designed the famed Iron Cross medal of Prussia and later Germany

Hardwood is wood from deciduous trees and broad leaf evergreen trees All hardwoods are angiosperms which are the most assorted and largest group of land plants Hardwoods all have enclosed nuts or seeds Hardwood is in contrast to softwood which come from conifers cone bearing seed plants Hardwoods are not always harder than softwoods Balsa wood being a notable exception Hardwoods have a more complex internal structure than softwoods It is mostly solid wood fibers with hollow tubes used to supply water to the tree Softwoods have a structure that looks like many drinking straws bound together all of which are used to supply water to the tree Hardwood trees are more varied than softwoods and there are about 100 times more species of hardwood than there are softwoods

Hardwoods are a type of tree that produce a dense wood Unlike softwoods hardwoods usually have broad leaves Deciduous hardwoods undo go a colour change usually once a year going from green to yellow then redpurple and then brown Except for brown these colours are always present in the leaves while they are green but are masked by the large amounts of chlorophyll which is green In a green leaf water drawn up from the ground carbon dioxide from the air and sunlight combine with water to make molecules of glucose which the tree uses as energy to grow In some cases such as the maple trees glucose gets trapped inside the autumn leaf and sunlight and cool weather turns the glucose into reds and purples The brown colours seen in autumn leaves are due to waste products left inside the leaf Hardwoods all have enclosed nuts or seeds where softwoods are Gymnosperms naked seed plants Hardwood species are much more in number than softwoods there being about 100 times more species of hard than softwoods

Each species of hardwood has its own set of properties however they have some properties in common Hardwoods normally have broad leaves and come from deciduous or broad leafed evergreen trees Hardwoods grow slower than softwoods Evergreen softwoods grow faster than deciduous hardwoods and can grow to a larger size Hardwoods are excellent for carving One of the hardest hardwoods is black ironwood which is recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the heaviest wood Ironwoods are so dense that they sink in water rather than float as other woods do

The properties of the wood are caused by its structure Hardwoods have a denser structure which is the reason they are usually harder and heavier Hardwook has xylem vessels which are used to transport water Their cell walls are strongly lignified lignin is a hard material used to support plants above the surface The quantity of lignin is probably the main factor in their hardness

Softwoods have a vascular structure which looks similar to a bunch of drinking straws held together They also have lignin but of a slightly different type and less of it than most hardwoods

Common species of hardwood found in the USA Many species are also found in other areas of the world This is not a complete list of all hardwood trees 

Hardwoods are often used to make items that get used a lot because of their density These items include furniture flooring and utensils They are also used in construction Hardwoods are also less likely to decay or rot than softwoods Furniture made by hardwood joinery is more expensive than that made from softwoods Utensils for use in preparing food can include things such as the vessel in the gallery below used by the Ede people to grind corn and grains for food Other utensils include spoons chopsticks bowls plates and cups Because of the dense nature of the wood used such a vessel can be used for many years without breaking Other examples include the handle of the Luzon knife seen in the gallery Because of the nature of sound transmission provide a good wood for musical instruments such as violins guitars pianos and hand drums such as the Djembe drum pictured in the gallery below Flooring is often made of hardwood because it can stand up to years of people walking on it with their shoes An example is the flooring made from tiger wood seen in the gallery below Hardwoods are also used to make wood veneers to glue over other cheaper woods making them less expensive than solid hardwood while still giving them the appearance of a particular species of wood This has become a common way of using tropical hardwoods that have a limited supply of trees due to deforestation occurring in many tropical countries In Europe hardwoods account for 29 and softwoods 71 of wood consumption Hardwood has very short fibers about 1mm in length and is so also used to make fine paper such as writing paper tissue and printing paper Paper with longer fibers such as paper bags cardboard and shipping containers is made of softwoods

HM Prison Pentridge was an Australian prison built in 1850 in Coburg Victoria The first prisoners arrived in 1851 The prison was closed on 1 May 1997

Pentridge was often known by the nicknames The Bluestone College Coburg College or the College of Knowledge The grounds were originally landscaped by renowned landscape gardener Hugh Linaker Since closing much of the prison has been pulled down to make way for a housing development Large buildings have been built and a 16 floor modern apartment block is being planned

The northern section of the prison being developed by Valad Property Group and the other areas by Pentridge Village The National Trust does not like the development plans approved by Heritage Victoria These plans include taking down sections of the outside walls and building apartments between the historic prison buildings

The prison was split into many divisions named using letters of the alphabet

Jika Jika opened in 1980 at a cost of AU7 million It was a gaol within a gaol designed to hold Victorias toughest and longest serving prisoners It was awarded the Excellence in Concrete Award by the Concrete Institute of Australia It was closed after the deaths of five prisoners in 1987

Jika Jika had six separate units each at the end of radiating spines It had electronic doors closed circuit television and remote locking This meant it could use less staff but still have maximum security The furnishings were sparse and prisoners exercised in escape proof yards

In 1983 four prisoners escaped from escape proof Jika Jika When two prison officers were disciplined in relation to the Jika Jika escape a week long strike occurred

Inmates Robert Wright Jimmy Loughnan Arthur Gallagher David McGauley and Ricky Morris  from one side of the unit  and Craig Slim Minogue and three other inmates on the other side sealed off their section doors with a tennis net Mattresses and other bedding were then stacked against the doors and set on fire They covered windows in the day room with paper so the prison officers couldnt see which prisoners caused the damage

Prisoners Robert Wright Jimmy Loughnan Arthur Gallagher David McGauley and Ricky Morris died in the fire Convicted Russell Street bomber Craig Minogue and three other inmates survived as they were evacuated when the fire started

The graves of executed prisoners were unmarked in a corner of the prison In 1929 32 bodies were moved from the Melbourne Gaol during the building of the Royal Melbourne Insitute of Technology These graves were found in 2008 The skeleton of bushranger Ned Kelly was among those discovered

There were 11 executions at Pentridge The gallows beam and the trapdoor were moved from the Melbourne Gaol and put into D Division in 1924

When the gaol was closed the beam and the trapdoor were taken back to the Melbourne Gaol to be part of its historical display

Ronald Ryan was the last man executed at Pentridge Prison and in Australia Ryan was hanged in D Division at 800 on 3 February 1967 He had been convicted of murdering a prison officer during an escape from the same prison Later that day Ryans body was buried in an unmarked grave within the D Division There is still debate about his hanging

Ox Mountain is a story by the Chinese philosopher Mencius In his time this mountain was in very bad shape and everybody knew how it looked Here is the story

 Mencius said The woods on Ox Mountain were once beautifull On account of its being on the edge of a large country it had been attacked with axes and hatchets and then how could it remain beautiful The refreshing breezes of day and night and the moisture provided by rain and fog did not fail to give rise to sprouts of vegetation But cows and sheep have been repeatedly pastured there and for that reason it has remained desolate People observe its denuded state and assume that it never had any good resources But how could this state be the true nature of this mountain

Mencius argued that bad human natures were produced just as the bad condition of Ox Mountain had been produced so the answer to bad humans was to protect and nurture them from birth He also thought that punishment does not do much good It does not cure the root of the problem

A human zoo was an exhibition that showed people from other cultures Very often this was done in similar ways than animals are shown in zoological gardens today Most such exhibitions were done between 1870 and 1940 Human zoos attracted many people in Europe They were often based on the idea of unilinealism scientific racism and social Darwinism Unilinealism or unilineal evolution is the idea that evolution only happens in one direction some animal will be at the peak of evolution As a consequence of these ideas some human zoos placed indigenous people in a continuum somewhere between the great apes and humans of European descent Ethnographic zoos have since been criticized as highly degrading and racist

Rye Beach is a community It used to be called Pannaway It is along the Atlantic Ocean It is in Rye New Hampshire United States It is along New Hampshire Route 1A near the south of a town named Rye 

In the community there is a hostel It is called the Ocean house and it was built in 1884 When it was built it was small but over time it reached 4 stories and it had room for 250 guests It was called the Philbrick Hotel when it was first built but an Admiral called David Farragut visited the hotel so it sometimes was called Farragut House

Daniel Clive Wheldon was an English auto racing driver He was the 2005 Indy Racing League IndyCar Series champion and winner of the Indianapolis 500 in 2005 and 2011 On October 16th 2011 Wheldon was killed in a 15 car crash at the Las Vegas Indy 300 He was 33 years old 

Dan Wheldon was born in Emberton near Olney Buckinghamshire England Wheldon started to race Go Karts at the age of four During his early career in open wheel racing Wheldon had a rivalry with Jenson Button before he left the United Kingdom to start racing in America Wheldon moved to America because he thought he thought the potential for success in America were greater than in the UK Wheldon moved to the United States in 1999 He spent many years racing in lower open wheeled circuits like the US F2000 Championship Series the Toyota Atlantic series and the Indy Lights series before moving to a higher series

In 2002 Wheldon moved up to the IRL IndyCar Series for two races He drove for Panther Racing with his teammate Sam Hornish Jr In 2003 Wheldon joined Andretti Green Racing winning the Rookie of the Year award In 2004 he won his first IRL race at Twin Ring Motegi in Japan He finished the 2004 season second in points with three wins

In 2005 Wheldon won the Indianapolis 500 and finished the season first in points winning the IndyCar Series championship He won six races during the season breaking the record for most victories in one season In November 2005 it was announced that Wheldon would be driving for Chip Ganassi Racing in the IndyCar Series in 2006 He went on to drive for Chip Ganassi Racing in the 24 Hours of Daytona winning the race with Ganassi teammates Scott Dixon and Ganassi NASCAR driver Casey Mears

Wheldon began the 2006 IndyCar season by winning the race at Homestead Miami Speedway This was a somber race as Paul Dana had died earlier while practicing for the race At the end of the 2006 IndyCar season Wheldon and Sam Hornish Jr were tied for the lead in the points They both had 475 points Hornish had four wins for the 2006 season and Wheldon only had two Because Hornish had more wins then Wheldon he was made the 2006 Indy Car Champion

The BMW Sauber Formula One team offered to let Wheldon drive for them but he declined their offer They couldnt give Wheldon a ride for the whole season so he decided to continue to focus on Indy

Ferdinand VI was a King of Spain July 1746 until his death in 1759 aged 49 He was the fourth son of the previous monarch Philip V and his first wife Maria Luisa of Savoy The third Bourbon to rule Spain he died childless and his half brother Charles became king 

Born at the Royal Alcazar of Madrid he was the youngest son of Philip V of Spain and his wife Queen Maria Luisa His parents enjoyed a loving relationship Ferdinand being their fourth child However his mother died in 1714 and the king married again this time to Elisabeth Farnese a niece of the Duke of Parma Queen Elisabeth was a domineering woman who ruled her husband As such the new queen would have a further seven children including Ferdinands own successor Charles III Ferdinand was by temperament melancholy shy and distrustful of his own abilities When complimented on his shooting he replied It would be hard if there were not something I could do Shooting and music were his only pleasures and he was the generous patron of the famous singer Farinelli whose voice soothed his melancholy As the younger son his brother Louis Prince of Asturias was heir to the throne However Louis died aged sixteen in 1724 having reigned for a mere eight months As such Ferdinand became Prince of Asturias and heir to the throne 

On 20 January 1729 Ferdinand married Barbara of Portugal daughter of John V of Portugal and Maria Anna of Austria This marriage further cemented a union with Portugal who had engaged Barbaras brother to Ferdinands half sister The very homely looks of his wife were thought by observers to cause the prince a visible shock when he was first presented to her Yet he became deeply attached to his wife and proved in fact nearly as adoring of her as his father was of Queen Maria Luisa

When he came to the throne Spain found itself in the War of the Austrian Succession which ended without any benefit to Spain He started his reign by getting rid of the influence of the widow Queen Elisabeth and her Italian courtiers As king he followed a firm policy of neutrality in the war between France and Britain and refused to be tempted to join the war by the offers of either The most important tasks during the reign of Ferdinand VI were carried out by the Marquis of Ensenada the Secretary of the Treasury Navy and Indies He suggested that the state help modernise the country To him this was necessary to maintain a position of outward strength so that France and Great Britain would consider Spain as an ally without supposing Spains renunciation of its claim to Gibraltar Plans for modernising Spain included a new Treasury the stimulation of commerce in the Americas modernising the Navy improving relations with the church and ensuring cultural progress 

The death of his wife Barbara who had been devoted to him and who carefully abstained from political intrigue broke his heart Between the date of her death in August 1758 and his own in August 1759 he fell into a state of prostration in which he would not even dress but wandered unshaven unwashed and in a nightgown around his park He was buried at the Convent of the Salesas Reales Spain

Teak is the common name for the tropical hardwood tree species Tectona grandis and its wood products Tectona grandis is native to south and southeast Asia mainly India Indonesia Malaysia and Burma but grows in many countries including those in Africa and the Caribbean Burma produces nearly one third of the worlds total teakCitation neededdateJanuary 2011

The word teak comes from the Malayalam word theka or tekka This tree is mentioned in the seventh century literature of Tamil popularly known as the Tevaram

Reel to reel tape recorders were used during the 20th century mostly in professional studios from the 1940s and quickly spread into peoples homes in the 1950s and 1960s The biggest popularity was in the 1970s probably because people needed higher quality recordings This technology was like a revolution because everyone could record any kind of sound then play it many times without the quality getting worse and they could overwrite it many times This technology has some weak points though size of reels sensibility durability but still it has certain advantages over todays digital media formats Also some famous bands and artists used reel to reel technology as a musical instrument or even as a separate band 

These reel to reel decks are usually analogue sound devices using a magnetic tape of inch width This plastic tape is covered by a special magnetic substance which is being made into magnetic domains when it is being recorded The tape recorder must have a record playback and an erase head which transfer the signal onto the tape The more expensive tape decks have three or six separate heads Tape recorders combine knowledge both on mechanics and electronics There must be very precise motors and moving parts but also a complicated circuit board It has to contain transistors amplifiers etc

The usual functions of tape recorders are 

These functions can be handled mechanically or electronically 

The tape speed is one of the things that finds out the playback time This table gives information on tape speed and the playback time with an 18 cm reel

There were many producers during the era of tape recorders such as Sony Akai Revox Teac Pioneer Technics Tesla and many others These producers usually had several product series which were different in price and functions The best ones had digital programmable counters reverse mechanic electronic buttons they could use big reels There was also a big selection of tape producers Maxell Basf Quantegy Agfa etc

There were only a few producers of tape recorders in Czechoslovakia The most important was Tesla np The main development was realized in Tesla Pardubice but the mass production was held in Tesla Pelou Product numbers were in thousands pieces and tens of model lines One of the most popular decks was monophonic Tesla Sonet Duo It was compact portable and reliable The collectors of Tesla decks agree that probably the most progressive model was Tesla B73 Hi Fi Stereo which provided the principles to the later models The supreme models were Tesla B115 B116 and Tesla CM130 CM160 which were able to compete with similar models made by worlds producers Still there were restrictions so the best ideas and solutions couldnt be realized The manufacture finished in 1990 as this technology turned out to be out of date

Tape recorders were one of the ways that you could store digital data Those with TTL control interface could be handled by special devices and data could be recorded as a sequence of tones of certain frequency Nowadays this method is not very good because the capacity of a reel is usually low

Internaional Covenant on Ecomonic Social and Cultural Rights is a treaty of United Nations to ensure economic social and cultural rights affirmed by Universal Declaration of Human Rights and one of the most important treaties on international human rights law This Covenant has adopted in 1966 together with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and enterd into force in 1976

Economic social and cultural rights are a part of human rights ensured by the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights Among the rights are right to education right to work in good condition and pay right to do strike action right to Social Security right to be health with the best condition right to enough standard of living including water food clothing and house

Those rights are already affremed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights but to ensure legally on global level those rights are separated from International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights because civil rights are considered to be protected stronglly than ecomonic social and cultural rights just as European Convention on Human Rights But the Vienna Declaration affirms that all human rights must be protected equally because all human rights are universal and cannot be divided Accoding the this Declaration Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ensures those rights as much as civil rights

The Royal Standard of Scotland also known as the Banner of the King of Scots or more commonly the Lion Rampant of Scotland is the Scottish Royal Banner of Arms Used historically by the King of Scots the Royal Standard of Scotland differs from Scotlands national flag the Saltire in that its correct use is restricted by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland to only a few Great Officers of State who officially represent the Sovereign in Scotland It is also used in an official capacity at royal residences in Scotland when the Sovereign is not present

The earliest recorded use of the Lion rampant as a royal emblem in Scotland was by Alexander II in 1222 with the additional embellishment of a double border set with lilies occurring during the reign of Alexander III This emblem occupied the shield of the royal coat of arms of the ancient Kingdom of Scotland which together with a royal banner displaying the same was used by the King of Scots until the Union of the Crowns in 1603 when James VI acceded to the thrones of the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Ireland Since 1603 the Lion rampant of Scotland has been incorporated into both the royal arms and royal banners of successive Scottish then British monarchs in order to symbolise Scotland as can be seen today in the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom Although now officially restricted to use by representatives of the Sovereign and at royal residences the Royal Standard of Scotland continues to be one of Scotlands most recognisable symbols

The Flag of Scotland also known as the Saint Andrews Cross or more commonly The Saltire is the national flag of Scotland The Saltire is the correct flag for everyone to fly in order to show both their loyalty and Scottish nationality It is also where possible flown from Scottish Government buildings every day from 8am until sunset with certain exceptions for example United Kingdom National Days

A Thistle is a group of flowering plants which have sharp prickles on around the flower and are in the Asteraceae family The prickles often all over the plant on the stem and flat parts of leaves This protects the plant against herbivorous animals stopping them from eating the plant 

The term thistle is sometimes taken to mean exactly those plants in the group Cynareae especially the genera Carduus Cirsium and Onopordum However plants outside this group are sometimes called thistles and if this is done thistles would form a polyphyletic group

According to a legend an invading Norse army was attempting to sneak up at night upon a Scottish armys encampment During this operation one barefoot Norseman had the misfortune to step upon a thistle causing him to cry out in pain thus alerting Scots to the presence of the Norse invaders Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the Battle of Largs which marked the beginning of the departure of King Haakon IV of Norway who having control of the Northern Isles and Hebrides had harried the coast of the Kingdom of Scotland for some years Which species of thistle is referred to in the original legend is disputed Popular modern usage favours Cotton Thistle Onopordum acanthium perhaps because of its more imposing appearance though it is unlikely to have occurred in Scotland in mediaeval times the Spear Thistle Cirsium vulgare an abundant native species in Scotland is a more likely candidate Other species including Dwarf Thistle Cirsium acaule Musk Thistle Carduus nutans and Melancholy Thistle Cirsium heterophyllum have also been suggested

Wolfgang Khler was a German psychologist who like Max Wertheimer and Kurt Koffka helped create Gestalt psychology He was the first to show that apes could solve problems by thinking

In 191013 he worked with fellow psychologists Max Wertheimer and Kurt Koffka He and Koffka were subjects for Wertheimers studies which led them to conclusions about the inherent nature of vision They collaborated on the founding of a new holistic attitude toward psychology called Gestalt theory aspects of which are indebted to the earlier work of Stumpf and Christian von Ehrenfels 

In an introduction to the 1969 book The task of gestalt psychology Carroll Pratt discusses Khlers famous quote The whole is different from the sum of its parts Though perhaps a simple error made in translation many lectures in textbooks of modern day psychology quote Gestalt theory by saying the whole is greater than the sum of its parts It is difficult to imagine that a translation error occurred here especially when considering that greater translates to grer and different translates to unterschiedlich in German respectively 

In 1913 Khler left Frankfurt for the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands where he had been named the Director of the Prussian Academy of Sciences anthropoid research station In this research Khler observed the manner in which chimpanzees solve problems such as that of retrieving bananas when positioned out of reach He found that they stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders in order to retrieve the food If the bananas were placed on the ground outside of the cage they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms Khler concluded that the chimps had not arrived at these methods through trial and error but rather that they had experienced an insight in which having realized the answer they then proceeded to carry it out in a way that was in Khlers words unwaveringly purposeful

After many observations with chimpanzees it was concluded that these animals were capable of problem solving and that they did not arrive at their methods through trial and error This is one of the prominent findings from the research done on apes Furthermore it has been stated in the past that Khlers work on the mentality of apes was a turning point in the psychology of thinking He believed that we underestimate the influence of a number of external conditions on such higher animals In the book The mentality of apes Khler explains that he was inspired to work with the chimpanzees for two main reasons The first was because the structure of their brains is more closely related to the chemistry of the human body and brain structure than to the chemical nature of the lower apes and their brain development Khler The fact that human traits can be observed in the everyday behaviours of this animal was very intriguing for Khler The second reason for studying chimpanzees was inspired by the theoretical aim Kohler wanted to gain knowledge of the nature of intelligent acts

In the early stages of observing chimps it was clear that the examinations should not be considered characteristic for each member of this species Khler recognized that like humans there is a great deal of individual differences in the intellectual field Chimps demonstrated that they were able to grasp the objects around them in a variety of fashions This is incorporated in their everyday playing behaviours For this reason it was not necessary to use experimental tests to introduce chimps to handle matter In his book Khler describes how the apes use their hands large powerful and flexible hands are natural links between himself and the world of things and he attains the necessary amount of muscular force and co ordination at an earlier age than the human child Khler

Most of the observations were made in the first six months of 1914 while Khler was working with Hans Lukas Teuber They provided the animals with problems that would be difficult for them to solve but not impossible for a chimpanzee Several tests were used on the animals to assess their abilities One test required that they be placed in a cage with food positioned an arms length away The chimps used sticks in order to obtain their food In another the chimps were aware that food was located in an area that was too high for them to reach and wooden boxes were made available to them It was observed that the chimps stacked the boxes and climbed them in order to retrieve the food

The conclusions drawn from the experiments with apes were that these animals exhibit insight and that they demonstrate intelligent behaviour that is common in humans Khler states that these findings hold true for every member of the species He describes that the correlation between intelligence and the development of the brain is confirmed Khler Khler points out that a downfall of educational psychology at the time of the experiments with apes was that it had yet to create a test that was capable of assessing how far mentally healthy and mentally ill children could go in particular situations Khler believes that studies of this type could be performed on young children and for this reason future research should focus on these possibilities He stated that where the lack of human standards makes itself so much felt I should like to emphasize particularly the importance and  if the anthropoids do not deceive us  the fruitfulness of further work in this direction Khler

Stringybark Creek is a small creek in the Wombat Ranges Victoria Australia It is famous as the place where bushranger Ned Kelly his brother Dan Kelly and friends Joe Byrne and Steve Hart killed three policemen on 26 October 1878 The policemen Sergeant Michael Kennedy Constable Thomas Lonigan and Constable Michael Scanlan were searching the forest for the Kelly brothers They were wanted for the attempted murder of another policeman Constable Fitzpatrick

The creek is in the Toombullup State Forest 50km from Benalla and 36km from Mansfield The area has been developed for visitors and includes picnic area camping toilets and walking tracks A memorial stone has been put in the picnic area and a tree at the site of the shootings the Kelly Tree has a small copy of Ned Kellys helmet attached to it

A group of four policemen from Mansfield set out to search for the Kelly brothers who they thought were hiding in the bush near Mansfield They set up camp at Stringbark Creek on 25 October 1878 not knowing that the Kellys were living in a small hut on Bullock Creek less than 1km away The next day Kennedy and Scanlan went to search the nearby forest while Lonigan and Constable Thomas McIntyre stayed at the campsite The Kellys heard noises from the police camp and went to investigate Ned Kelly decided to try and capture the policemen and take their guns horses and food He called on the two policemen to give themselves up McIntyre raised his hands but Lonigan hid behind a log and attempted to shoot his gun Ned Kelly shot him in the head

The bushrangers then waited for Kennedy and Scanlan to return When they rode into the camp McIntyre warned them that the Kelly brothers were there and to give themselves up Scanlan reached for his gun and was shot dead immediately Kennedy jumped off his horse and while shooting at the Kellys ran into the bush Ned Kelly chased after him shooting him twice As Kennedy lay on the ground Kelly walked up to him and shot him again in the chest and killed himrp97 During the shooting McIntrye was able to get onto Kennedys horse and escaped He reached Mansfield the next day to report the deaths

Gestalt psychology is a theory of mind and brain formed in Berlin early in the 20th century 

The operational principle of Gestalt is that the brain is holistic parallel and analog with self organizing tendencies The Gestalt effect is the form generating capability of our senses particularly with respect to the visual recognition of figures and whole forms instead of just a collection of simple lines and curves In psychology gestaltism is often opposed to structuralism The phrase The whole is greater than the sum of the parts is often used when explaining Gestalt theory A better wording is The whole is different from the parts

Early 20th century theorists such as Kurt Koffka Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang Khler saw objects as seen in an environment according to all of their elements taken together as a global construct This gestalt or whole form approach sought to define principles of perception seemingly innate mental laws which determined the way in which objects were perceived It is based on the here and now and in the way you view things It can be broken up into two figure or ground at first glance do you see the figure in front of you or the background

These laws took several forms such as the grouping of similar or proximate objects together within this global process Although Gestalt has been criticized for being merely descriptive it has formed the basis of much further research into the perception of patterns and objects and of research into behavior thinking problem solving and psychopathology

Gestalt psychology was a forerunner to modern cognitive psychology It is distinct from Gestalt psychotherapy

Max Wertheimer was a psychologist who was one of the three founders of Gestalt psychology with Kurt Koffka and Wolfgang Khler

From 1929 to 1933 Wertheimer was a professor at the University of Frankfurt When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of the Third Reich in 1933 it became apparent to Wertheimer that he must leave Germany In the end he accepted an offer to teach at The New School in New York 

In New York he continued to investigate problem solving or what he preferred to call productive thinking He completed his book on the subject in late September 1943 and died just three weeks later of a heart attack Wertheimer was buried in Beechwood Cemetery in New Rochelle New York

The phi phenomenon is an optical illusion described by Wertheimer in 1912 in which the persistence of vision was exploited by the cinema film applied by Hugo Mnsterberg in 1916 This optical illusion is based in the principle that the human eye is capable of perceiving movement from pieces of information for example a succession of images In other words from a slideshow of a group of frozen images at a certain speed of images per second we observe constant movement

An optical illusion is shows visually perceived images that differ from normal reality 

The information gathered by the eye is processed in the brain to give a perception That is normal but in these cases the appearance does not tally with a physical measurement of the stimulus source 

There are three main types of visual illusion 

The general explanation for most illusions is the way the brain works on sense data to produce a meaningful perception A great 19th century psychologist Hermann von Helmholtz described perception as unconscious inferences from sensory data and past experience Richard Gregory discussed how the brain makes an hypothesis about whats out there and sometimes the hypothesis does not quite work out His model of perception is an interaction between data from sense organs and previous knowledge and experience

Researcher Mark Changizi of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York thinks optical illusions are due to a neural lag When light hits the retina about one tenth of a second goes by before the brain translates the signal into a visual perception of the world Scientists have known of the lag and have discussed how humans compensate for it Some suggest that our motor system somehow modifies our movements to offset the delay

Changizi asserts that the human visual system has evolved to compensate for neural delays by generating images of what will occur one tenth of a second into the future This foresight enables humans to react to events in the present enabling humans to perform reflexive acts like catching a fly ball and to maneuver smoothly through a crowd Illusions occur when our brains attempt to perceive the future and those perceptions do not match reality 

Essentially the ideas of Helmholz Gregory and Changizi are similar We do not mechanically turn sense data into a picture of the world as some had thought What we do is use our brains to work out what it is we are looking at This involves the use of memory and logic though at a fast rate The process is very good but not foolproof When it fails we get an illusion

A cassette single is a recording of a single song sold on a compact audio cassette Record companies introduced this sales format in the 1980s At that time vinyl record album sales were declining in favor of cassette recordings the cassette single was introduced to replace the vinyl 45 record in a similar way

The sales of cassette singles did not exceed vinyl single sales to the same extent as cassette albums had As compact disc players became more common cassette singles were for the most part replaced by CD singles

A guitar solo is a portion of a musical performance when a guitar is used without other instruments

In addition to their roles of rhythmic and harmonic accompaniment guitars are well suited to performing solo lines This can take the form of a prominent section where the guitar is heard over other instruments or unaccompanied the guitarist providing all the necessary melody and harmony themselves Many times a guitar solo is a virtuosic performance in the rock music idiom with a heavily overdriven electric guitar However solo instrumentation for the guitar can be found in a wide variety of musical styles and eras

Many famous guitarists are known for their solo work Approaches to solo creation vary from the jaggedatonal approach of Andy Gill from Gang of Four and Andy Partridge from XTC the studio produced soundscapes of Jimi Hendrix or Bill Nelson or the composed approach of Frank Zappa

The use of the guitar solo in popular music was especially notable during the 1980s where a flashy and attention grabbing instrumental was virtually obligatory for a guitar based band In later years guitar solos became viewed as something of an 80s clich and their usage declined Guitar solos in pop music have subsequently become much rarer and more subdued and understated when used

Notable rock guitar soloists 

The music of Colombia is an expression of the Colombian culture and has many music types Modern Colombian culture is a mixture of African native and European music as well as more modern American and Caribbean musical forms such as Trinidadian Cuban and Jamaican

In the late 1950s Mexican rock artists like Enrique Guzmn and Cesar Costa became very popular in Colombia Soon native rock bands like Los Speakers earned popularity too Starting in 1967 native bands like Genesis combined native music types with rock

Cumbia is a mixture of Spanish and African music In the 19th century Colombia got rid of slavery Since that time Africans Indians and other ethnic groups mixed more fully in Colombian music Styles like bambuco vallenato and porro was very important When the waltz became popular in the 19th century Colombian musicians invented a version called pasillo

Power ballad is a name given to love songs that were predictably included in heavy metal albums in the 1980s 

The power ballad was usually slower in tempo and much less aggressive in lyrics than the other music on the album The songs were often made in a hope of scoring a Top Forty hit and were particularly associated with bands in the hard metal genre

The Band Perry are made up of Kimberly Reed and Neil Perry Their self titled debut record was released in October 2010

Criminal is the fourth single released under Britney Spears seventh studio album Femme Fatale This song was released on September 30 2011 and has gotten positive critical acclaim

A soundcheck is an activity that takes place a couple hours before a concert The performer and the sound crew run through a short song to make sure that the sound in the venue is clear and at the right volume and tonal frequencies Soundchecks are especially important for popular and other musical genres that use heavily amplified PA systems having correct sound is very important to the success of such events A soundcheck remains part art and not all science however because the acoustics of a venue often change somewhat once it is filled with an audience

Artists who change their set list during the course of a concert tour often use soundchecks as a rehearsal opportunity to try out new material or revive old material before possibly introducing such material into the concert proper

Chauchilla Cemetery is a cemetery that has prehistoric remains of prehispanics Their bodies which are mummified contain artifacts The cemetery is thirty kilometers south of the city of Nazca in Peru

The cemetery was discovered in the 1920s However it was last used in the 9th century AD The cemetery has a lot of very important burials that happened over a period of 600 to 700 years The cemetery was first used around the year 200 AD This cemetery is a very important source of archaeology to Nazca culture Because the cemetery was damaged a long time ago it was protected by Peruvian law in 1997 Tourists pay around seven US dollars for a two hour tour of the cemetery

The bodies inside the cemetery have been preserved which is probably because of the dry climate in the Peruvian Desert However the funeral rites were also an important factor The bodies had clothes on them which were made of cotton and were painted with a resin They were bought in the cemetery which was built from mud bricks The resin was thought to have kept out insects and slowed bacteria from feeding on the bodies

Estaquera a nearby cemetery may have given clues to show how the bodies were preserved At Estaquera archaeologists have found wooden pillars which was first thought to have been used for astronomical sightings However it is not thought that those posts were used to dry the bodies This was a mummification process This clue helped archaeologists to understand why these thousand year old bodies still had their hair and some soft tissue like skin still attached to them

Gigantoraptor is a genus of giant oviraptorosaur theropod dinosaur that lived 70 million years ago during the later Cretaceous period It was discovered in 2005 in Inner Mongolia

Since 2001 in a quarry remains of the sauropod Sonidosaurus have been uncovered In April 2005 Chinese paleontologist Xu Xing was asked to reenact the discovery of Sonidosaurus for a Japanese documentary Xu obliged them by digging out a thighbone As he wiped the bone clean he suddenly realized it was not from a sauropod but from an unidentifiable theropod about the size of Albertosaurus He stopped the filming to secure the serendipitous find This way the discovery of the Gigantoraptor fossil was captured on film

In 2007 the Gigantoraptor erlianensis was named and described by Xu and colleagues The type specimen was found in layers dating to about seventy million years ago It consists of the remains of a single subadult individual a partial skeleton lacking the skull but including the lower jaws a single neck vertebra most of the bac tail and frontlimb and hindlimb elements

Gigantoraptor belonged to the Oviraptorosauria a group named after Oviraptor but compared to other known members Gigantoraptor was much larger approximately three times as long and 35 times more massive than the heaviest earlier discovered oviraptorosaurid Citipati Xu et al estimated the length at convert8mft0 and the weight at 1400 kilogrammes In 2010 Gregory S Paul even gave an estimate of two tonnes

The toothless lower jaws of Gigantoraptor are fused into a broad shovel like mandibula The skull would have been over half a metre long and toothless probably equipped with a horny beak The back tail vertebrae are lightened by spongeous bone The front limb is rather long because of an elongated slender hand The humerus is bowed outwards to an exceptionally large extent and has a very rounded head The first metacarpal is very short and carries a strongly diverging thumb The hindlimb is also long because of an elongated lower leg The thighbone is relatively slender and short with a distinct head and neck The foot is robust with large and strongly curved toe claws

No direct evidence of feathers was preserved with the skeleton It might have been naked because it is three hundred times more massive than the smaller feathered species Very large animals rely more on mass for temperature regulation losing the insulating coverings found on their smaller relatives Arm feathers were probably still present on Gigantoraptor since their primary functions such as display and covering the eggs while brooding are not related to the regulation of body heat

In 2007 Xu et al assigned Gigantoraptor to the Oviraptoridae in a basal position Despite its size Gigantoraptor would thus have been more bird like than its smaller oviraptorosaurian relatives

In 2010 a second analysis of Gigantoraptor relationships found it to be a member a sister group the Caenagnathidae

The diet of Gigantoraptor is uncertain Although some oviraptorosaurs such as Caudipteryx and Incisivosaurus are thought to have been mostly herbivorous Gigantoraptor had long hind legs with proportions that allowed for fast movement and large claws a combination that is not usually found in herbivores of this size Paul suggested that Gigantoraptor also was a herbivore and used its speed to escape predators

The specimen has advanced ossification and growth rings in the fibula that indicate it was likely eleven years of age when it died It appears to have reached an early young adult stage at age seven and probably would have grown much larger when it reached the adult stage This indicates a growth rate that is faster than in most large non avian theropods

The existence of giant oviraptorosaurians as Gigantoraptor explains several earlier Asian finds of very large up to 53 centimetres long oviraptorosaurian eggs assigned to the oospecies Macroelongatoolithus xixiaensis These were laid in enormous rings with a diameter of three metres

A Jumping spider belongs to the family called the Salticidae These spiders generally catch their prey by jumping on them from pretty far away grabbing them and biting their necks They often hunt high up in bushes or on vertical walls To save themselves from falling they do something very much like what climbers do to protect themselves in the mountains Humans tie a rope to the mountain and attach the other end to the harness they wear Jumping spiders attach silk from their spinnerets to the thing on which they are standing and then they jump While they are moving through the air they make silk so that there is always a safety rope trailing out behind them 

These spiders go from 1 mm to 22 mm Various species work everywhere from leaves lying on the ground to the tops of trees in the forest and even way up on Mt Everest They are found on every continent in the world except for Antarctica Not all species have been counted yet but so far we know of 5026 species that are divided among 530 genera

Jumping spiders are easy to identify because they have eight eyes two of which are very large and because the front end of their body forms a very flat surface

Jumping spiders can jump long distances for their size as much as 16 cm When they jump they use their hind legs They raise their front legs to be ready to grab their prey

Many other kinds of spider hunt at night but jumping spiders depend on their eyes so they like to come out in the daytime Often they will find a sunny spot on a wall or tree trunk

Because they have very good eyes jumping spiders can see human beings when they approach Some jumping spiders may run away from approaching humans and others seem not to be very much afraid But either way a jumping spider will watch a nearby human being When they do not run away but do turn to keep watch over a human being it may seem that they are interested in us Some of them will even jump from where they are sitting on branches rocks etc onto a persons finger or camera These spiders only bite to get something to eat or to defend themselves so if they jump on somebodys hand they will not bite People get bitten if they pinch or squeeze a jumping spider

Very few kind of jumping spider make webs instead they use their silk for their safety rope and also to make a kind of tent where they sleep at night shed their skins lay their eggs and enjoy a long sleep during winter Their silk comes out of their spinnerets

Jumping spiders are able to climb glass and other very smooth surfaces because besides having two claws on each foot they also have sticky hairs that hold onto the surface Many tiny ends on each hair are held to the glass by Van der Waals forces the force that will make two very flat sheets of glass stick tightly together without any glue

Jumping spiders are able to see very clearly Two of their eight eyes are very large and are complicated inside The eyes cannot move so the spider will often move its body to look at what it wants to see However it can also move the retinas of its two main eyes on the inside of the eye so the center of the eyes picture can be movedSo the jumping spider has binocular vision

William Nunn Lipscomb Jr was a Nobel Prize winning American inorganic and organic chemist He worked in nuclear magnetic resonance theoretical chemistry boron chemistry and biochemistry

Lipscomb was born in Cleveland Ohio His family moved to Lexington Kentucky in 1920He lived there until he earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry at the University of Kentucky in 1941 Then he earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree in Chemistry from the California Institute of Technology in 1946

From 1946 to 1959 he taught at the University of Minnesota From 1959 to 1990 he was a professor of chemistry at Harvard University After 1990 he became a professor emeritus at Harvard

Lipscomb went to live in Cambridge Massachusetts until his death in 2011 from pneumonia

Lipscomb was one of the first people to use nuclear magnetic resonance to study chemical structures He learned out how to look at NMR data to find what atoms are connected together in a molecule This is called chemical shift

Lipscomb studied molecules These molecules included boron atoms Lipscomb used this work to learn basic ideas about how atoms form chemical bonds Lipscomb and his students created many important ideas in the field of theoretical chemistry His work on boron compounds won a Nobel Prize in 1976 Three of his students went on to also win separate Nobel Prizes in Chemistry

Lipscombs later research was on the atomic structure of proteins He studied how enzymes work His group used x ray diffraction to measure the three dimensional structure of these proteins He calculated the exact location of every single atom in these large molecules Lipscomb then studied these details to learn how the molecules work in biological systems

Carboxypeptidase A was the first protein structure from Lipscombs group

Five books and published collections of writings are dedicated to Lipscomb

People who are in favor of the bill say that the police and other law enforcers need to be able to go back and look at the records of IP addresses because these addresses can change over time So the police need to be able to check the records in order to catch people occurred Lamar Smith the bills sponsor said that Some Internet service providers currently retain these IP addresses for business purposes But the period of retention varies widely among providers from a few days to a few months The lack of uniform data retention impedes the investigation of Internet crimes Smith said that the number of child pornography cases grew by 150 a year every year for the past ten years

Isaac Titsingh FRS was a Dutch surgeon scholar merchant trader and ambassador 

At Dejima Island in Japan Titsingh was the head of the Dutch East India Company during 1779 1780 17811783 and 1784 In these years the Japanese policy of seclusion of isolation limited all contact with non Japanese In this highly controlled context the VOC traders became the sole official conduit for trade and for scientific cultural exchanges between Japan and the West

Titsingh is believed to have been the first Freemason in Japan 

In 1785 Titsingh was appointed Director of the VOC trading post at Chinsura in Bengal He formed a friendship with William Jones the philologist and Bengal jurist

Titsinghs return to Batavia led to new VOC positions as Ontvanger Generaal and later as Commissaris ter Zee

In Batavia Titsingh met with the British Ambassador do China Lord Macartney who was travelling to the Imperial Court in Peking Titsingh encouraged McCartney to abandon a planned expedition to Japan in 1793

Titsingh was appointed Dutch Ambassador to the court of the Emperor of China He was in Peking for the celebrations of the sixtieth anniversary of the reign of the Qianlong Emperor In Peking the Titsingh delegation included Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest and Chrtien Louis Joseph de Guignes 

Titsingh is believed to have been the first Freemason in China and the only to be received personally in the court of the Qianlong emperor

Among the Japanese books brought to Europe by Titsingh was a copy of An Illustrated Description of Three Countries by Hayashi Shihei This book which was published in Japan in 1785 deals with Chosen and the kingdom of Ryukyu and Ezo In Paris the text represented the first appearance of Korean hangl in Europe 

After his death Titsingh died in Paris and he is buried in Pre Lachaise cemetery

After Titsinghs death the printed original and Titsinghs translation were purchased by Jean Pierre Abel Rmusat at the Collge de France 

In 1832 Julius Klaproth at the Institut Royal publish his edited version of Titsinghs translation

The Morrison Formation is a geological formation named after Morrison Colorado It is a distinctive sequence of Upper Jurassic sedimentary rock in the western United States It has been the most fertile source of dinosaur fossils in North America 

It is composed of mudstone sandstone siltstone and limestone Its colour is light grey greenish gray or red Most of the fossils occur in the green siltstone beds and lower sandstones relics of the rivers and floodplains of the Jurassic period

It is centered in Wyoming and Colorado with outcrops in Montana North Dakota South Dakota Nebraska Kansas the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas New Mexico Arizona Utah and Idaho Equivalent rocks under different names are found in Canada It covers an area of 15 million square km although only a tiny fraction is exposed and accessible to geologists and paleontologists Over 75 is still buried under the prairie to the east and much of the rest was destroyed by erosion as the Rocky Mountains rose to the west

The first fossils were discovered by Arthur Lakes in 1877 That same year it became the center of the Bone Wars a fossil collecting rivalry between early paleontologists Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope 

In Colorado New Mexico and Utah the Morrison Formation was a major source of uranium ore 

According to radiometric dating the Morrison Formation dates from 1563 2 million years old at its base to 1468 1 million years old at the top which places it in the later Jurassic This is similar in age to the Solnhofen Limestone Formation in Germany and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania Throughout the western USA it lays over the Middle Jurassic Summerville Sundance Bell Ranch Wanakah and Stump Formations

At the time the supercontinent of Laurasia had recently split into the continents of North America and Eurasia although they were still connected by land bridges North America moved north and was passing through the subtropical regions

Dinosaur National Monument is a National Monument on the southeast flank of the Uinta Mountains on the border between Colorado and Utah at the confluence of the Green and Yampa Rivers The Dinosaur Quarry coord402629N1091804W is in Utah just to the north of the town of Jensen Utah This park has fossils of dinosaurs including Allosaurus Abydosaurus and various long neck long tail sauropods 

The dinosaur fossil beds were discovered in 1909 by Earl Douglass a paleontologist working and collecting for the Carnegie Museum He and his crews excavated thousands of fossils and shipped them back to the museum in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania for study and display President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the dinosaur beds as Dinosaur National Monument in 1915 The monument boundaries were expanded in 1938 from the original convert80acrem2singon tract surrounding the dinosaur quarry in Utah to its present extent of over 200000 acres in Utah and Colorado including the spectacular river canyons of the Green and Yampa

No firm dates can be assigned to the lives or reigns of this period but the reign of Emperor Ank is considered to have lasted from 456 to 479 and Oshiwa died during Anks reign

Dinosaur Ridge is part of the Morrison Formation just west of Denver

The Dinosaur Ridge area is one of the worlds most famous dinosaur fossil localities In 1877 some of the best known dinosaurs were found here including Apatosaurus Diplodocus Stegosaurus and Allosaurus 

In 1973 the area was recognized for its uniqueness as well as its historical and scientific significance when it was designated the Morrison Fossil Area National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service In 1989 the Friends of Dinosaur Ridge formed to address increasing concerns regarding the preservation of the site and to offer educational programs on the areas resources

The rocks on the west side of Dinosaur Ridge are part of the widespread Morrison Formation of Jurassic age It is in these rocks where Arthur Lakes discovered the dinosaur bones in 1877 Fifteen quarries were opened along the Dakota hogback in the Morrison area in search of these fossils

The rocks on the east side of Dinosaur Ridge are part of the Cretaceous Dakota Formation When Alameda Parkway was being constructed in 1937 to provide access to Red Rocks Park workers discovered hundreds of dinosaur footprints These were found to include mostly Iguanodon like footprints Carnivorous theropod tracks are also present

The site features the Dinosaur Ridge Exhibit Hall with displays about the dinosaurs found at the site Additionally Dinosaur Ridge has interpretive signs at trail locations that explain the local geology a volcanic ash bed trace fossils paleo ecology economic development of coal oil and clay and many other geologic and paleontological features

Lord of the Flies is a novel written by William Golding It was published in 1954 

It is based on two main things Goldings time teaching at boys public schools and his experiences in World War II He had read books such as Coral Island which showed young boys getting stranded on desert islands and living in perfect Utopia and believed this to be utter rubbishcn he wanted to write a book about what would really happen His experiences in the war showed him the evil of the human race and caused him to believe that everyone is to some degree essentially evil 

A group of boys of varying ages from different schools and backgrounds is stranded on an island after their plane is brought down The country they came from has been hit with a nuclear bomb and all the adults on their plane are dead there is no one else on the island and no one knows where they are On Piggys advice Ralph blows a conch shell to gather the boys from across the island to a meeting where we are introduced to Merridew who is head of the Choir and various other characters A vote is called for leader which is won by Ralph he assigns the task of registering the boys to Piggy while he Jack and Simon go to explore the island They discover that they are truly alone on the island and confirm that it is an island On the way back they walk through a the forest and come across a pig Jack pulls out a knife and makes to kill it but is unable to He swears to kill the next one he finds 

The three return to the beach where the first meeting was held and discover that Piggy was unable to take the register During a meeting concerns are raised by one of the younger children about a beastie or snake thing Ralph and the other older boys are quick to dismiss this theory but it does not prevent fear from some of the younger boys which spreads over time Ralph suggests that they build a signal fire the group is instantly excited by this idea and rush to the top of the mountain to pile wood They discover they have no way of igniting it then Piggy arrives with the conch and they use his glasses to start a fire which burns well then ignites a large potion of forest possibly killing a young child

Jack and half of his choir hunt while the other half is assigned to tending the signal fire Jack becomes obsessed with the idea of a kill while Ralph is still more interested in building shelters and escaping the island something Jack does not seem bothered about anymore He wants to kill a pig

Jack eventually gets angry with Ralph and goes and forms is own tribe They steal piggys glasses so they can start a fire Simon is killed by the boys because they thought he was the beast Only Ralph Piggy and SamnEric are left in the original tribe They go to the top of the mountain where Jacks tribe are Jack and Ralph fight and Roger sends a boulder tumbling down that narrowly misses Ralph but kills Piggy and breaks the Conch SamnEric are taken by Jacks tribe and Ralph runs away Ralph goes up to the mountain again to see SamnEric and they tell him that Jack planns on hunting him down He goes and hides but is soon found by the tribe A fire is created to smoke him out He runs for it down onto the beach being chased by the tribe holding spears Ralph runs into a navy officer who saw the smoke from the fire and has come to rescue them It is ironic because Jack only wanted to hunt for food and not bother keeping the fire going but he ends up starting the fire that gets them rescued

Natural deduction is a branch of mathematical logic developed in Poland in the 1920s and 30s It is meant to express inference rules closely related to the natural way of reasoning However it does not mean how ordinary people think

Spurred on by a series of seminars in Poland in 1926 by ukasiewicz that advocated a more natural treatment of logic Jakowski made the earliest attempts at defining a more natural deduction In 1929 he first suggested in 1929 using a diagrammatic notation and later updated his proposal in papers in 1934 and 1935 

John McCarthy was an American scientist Today he is mostly known for the work he did in the field of logic He was the first to use the term artificial intelligence in an article he wrote in 1955 He invented LISP to be able to do logic programming in 1958 This makes LISP the second oldest high level programming language that is still in use FORTRAN is older McCarthy studied mathematics He invented Garbage collection to solve some of the problems LISP had McCarthys work received many awards the Turing Award for his work on Artificial Intelligence in 1971 or the National Medal of Science in 2003 are among them

An electrical outlet or receptacle is a socket that connects an electrical device to an electricity supply In buildings electrical outlets are usually installed in the wall although they can also be installed in the floor Occasionally they are found in the ceiling for powering devices such as garage door openers Different countries often have different outlet types and voltages Adapters are available to convert between the different types

An anemometer is a device used to measure wind speed It is found in most weather stations The word comes from the Ancient Greek word  meaning wind It describes any airspeed measurement instrument used in meteorology or aerodynamics Leon Battista Alberti described an anemometer for the first time around 1450

Nuclear magnetic resonance is the physical phenomenon in which magnetic nuclei in a magnetic field absorb then re emit electromagnetic radiation This energy is of a specific resonance frequency that depends on the strengths of the magnetic field and magnetic properties for the isotopes of the atoms Many scientific techniques exploit the NMR phenomena to study molecular physics crystals and non crystalline materials through NMR spectroscopy NMR is also used for advanced medical imaging techniques for example magnetic resonance imaging

All isotopes that contain an odd number of protons andor of neutrons have an intrinsic magnetic moment and angular momentum in other words a nonzero spin while all nuclides with even numbers of both have a total spin of zero The most commonly studied nuclei are 1H and 13C although nuclei from isotopes of many other elements have been studied by high field NMR spectroscopy as well

A key idea of NMR is that the resonance frequency of a particular substance is directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field This resonance is used in imaging techniques If a sample is placed in a non uniform magnetic field then the resonance frequencies of the samples nuclei depend on where in the field they are located Scientists try to use the highest possible magnetic fields to get the best image quality

The principle of NMR usually involves two sequential steps 

The constant field and the pulse field are usually set perpendicular to each other This maximizes the NMR signal strength The resulting response by the total magnetization of the nuclear spins is the phenomenon that is used in NMR spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging Both use intense applied magnetic fields in order to achieve dispersion and very high stability to deliver spectral resolution Scientist explain their readings as chemical shifts the Zeeman effect and Knight shifts

NMR is used in low field NMR NMR spectroscopy and MRI in the Earths magnetic field and in several types of magnetometers

Nuclear magnetic resonance was first described and measured in molecular beams by Isidor Rabi in 1938 In 1944 Rabi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work In 1946 Felix Bloch and Edward Mills Purcell expanded the technique for use on liquids and solids They shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952 for this discovery

Purcell had worked on the development of radar during World War II at the Massachusetts Institute of Technologys Radiation Laboratory His work during that project on the production and detection of radio frequency power and on the absorption of such RF power by matter laid the background for Rabis discovery of NMR 

Rabi Bloch and Purcell noticed that magnetic nuclei like 1H and 31P could absorb RF energy when placed in a magnetic field of a strength specific to the identity of the nuclei When this absorption occurs the nucleus is described as being in resonance Different atomic nuclei within a molecule resonate at different frequencies for the same magnetic field strength The observation of such magnetic resonance frequencies of the nuclei present in a molecule allows any trained user to discover essential chemical and structural information about the molecule 

After World War II the development of NMR as a technique in analytical chemistry and biochemistry happened at the same time as the development of electromagnetic technology and advanced electronics and their introduction into civilian use In the 1960s William Lipscomb was a pioneer in using NMR to study chemical structures He worked out how to look at NMR data to tell what atoms are connected together in a molecule This is called chemical shift

Herbert Aaron Hauptman was an American mathematician and Nobel laureate He made a mathematical method to find a molecular structures based on the X ray patterns of crystallized materials With Jerome Karle he won the 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry

He was born in New York City He was the oldest child of Israel Hauptman and Leah Rosenfeld 

Hauptman was interested in science and mathematics from an early age He studied at Townsend Harris High School He graduated from the City College of New York He earned an MA degree in mathematics from Columbia University in 1939 He married Edith Citrynell on November 10 1940 and had two daughters

After World War II he began working together with Jerome Karle a physical chemist at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington DC He also enrolled in the PhD program at the University of Maryland College Park They used their mathematics and physical chemistry skills to solve the phase problem of X ray crystallography By 1955 he had received his PhD in mathematics and they had worked out the direct methods in X ray crystallography Their 1953 article Solution of the Phase Problem I The Centrosymmetric Crystal contained the main ideas the most important of which was the introduction of probabilistic methods

In 1970 he joined the Medical Foundation of Buffalo becoming its Research Director in 1972 At this time he developed the neighborhood principle and extension concept These theories were further developed during the following years

The Viking program was a NASA mission that sent two spacecraft to the planet Mars These spacecraft were called Viking 1 and Viking 2 Each spacecraft was made of an orbiter and a lander The orbiters took pictures of Mars while going around the planet and gave information to Earth The landers gathered scientific data on the surface of the planet

Both Viking spacecraft were launched in 1975 and both reached Mars in 1976 Scientists chose a landing places for both landers from the pictures that the orbiters had taken Then the landers were loosed from the orbiters and they went down to their landing places The orbiters still took pictures while the landers studied the surface of the planet and did other things All of the spacecraft including both orbiters and both landers kept working for longer than they had been planned to But eventually they broke down Viking 2 Orbiter broke down in 1978 Viking 1 Orbiter and Viking 2 Lander in 1980 and Viking Lander in 1982

The Viking program was the most expensive and difficult mission ever sent to Mars The programme cost a total of US1 billion The program was very successful Most of the knowledge about Mars until the late 1990s came from the Viking mission

Moulting is the manner in which an animal routinely casts off part of its body at particular times of year or at specific points in its life cycle Moulting is also known as sloughing shedding or for some species ecdysis

Moulting can involve the epidermis and hair fur wool or other external layer In some species other body parts may be shed for example wings in some insects Examples include old feathers in birds old hairs in mammals old skin in reptiles and the entire exoskeleton in arthropods

In arthropods such as insects arachnids and crustaceans moulting is the shedding of the exoskeleton 

This process of moulting is the defining feature of a whole group of invertebrates the clade Ecdysozoa comprising the arthropods nematodes velvet worms horsehair worms rotifers tardigrades and Cephalorhyncha Since the cuticuls of these animals often forms an inelastic exoskeleton it is shed during growth and a new larger covering is formed Amongst fossils trilobites and eurypterida used ecdysis 

Ecysis is part of the whole process of metamorphosis The different stages and the development of new apparatus is necessary as the creature moves from one form to another The new exoskeleton is initially soft but hardens after the moulting of the old exoskeleton 

Detention is a depriving of liberty of a person by the authority of a government or a country usually the police Such depriving liberty is allowed only in the case that the person can considered to have committed a crime Other depriving liberty is called arbitrary detention and prohibited by article 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights And even detention is done legally the person must be treated with humanity and respected the persons dignity according to the Convention against Torture

Many pages contain illustrations Many authors have been thought to have written this manuscript the author remains unknown The text is written in an unknown language in an unknown writing system It looks like there are no errors in the text There are no corrections to it The text is probably some ciphertext many people working in cryptography have tried to break its code both amateur and professional cryptographers Much less attention has been given to the illustrations which seem to show plants anatomic or astronomic links It has been described as the worlds most mysterious manuscript

In 2009 University of Arizona researchers performed C14 dating on the manuscripts vellum which they say was made between 1404 and 1438 In addition the McCrone Research Institute in Chicago found that much of the ink was added not long afterwards confirming that the manuscript is an authentic medieval document

As the text has not been translated yet it has been sectioned based on the images The sectioning is usually the following

The very last page seems to have some sort of key three lines of text with a script resembling that used in 15th century Germany

The manuscript consists of quires A quire is made of folded parchment The quires consist of folios with text or illustrations on both sides of the folio The quires are numbered from 1 to 20 the folios from 1 to 116 Some of the fold outs have unusual shapes Depending on the way of counting this gives a total of 240 pages As there are gaps in the numbering it seems likely that some pages were lost the manuscript probably had at least 272 pages The gaps were already there when Voynich bought the manuscript in 1912 

A quill pen was used for the text and figure outlines The figures were colored with paint possibly at a later date There is strong evidence that many of the books folios were reordered at various points in its history and that the original page order may well have been quite different from what we see today

The text is written from left to right because there are irregular margins on the right There is no obvious punctuation The person or people writing the text seem to have been fluent in the language There probably was another source they copied from The flow of the text is smooth which gives the impression that the symbols were not enciphered 

In total there are about 170000 glyphs Given the space between these there seem to be words and paragraphs It is difficult to determine the alphabet used in the text some glyphs may be variations of others and some may simply be two joined together The text can probably be represented with an alphabet of between twenty and thirty characters 

There are about 35000 words made of glyphs or characters A statistical analysis has been done and the words resemble natural language

The purpose of the book was probably to serve as a manual to make drugs or as a book about medicine The first section is almost certainly a herbal A herbal is a collection of plants with their description An identification of the plants based on the images has mostly failed though Two plants can be guessed with some certainty the Wild pansy and the Maidenhair fern Many of the plant pictures are composite they combine parts of plants the root of one plant is added to the leaves of another the flowers may be from a third species The leaves and fruit of the Castor oil plant have been identified as well 

Because of the tubes in the biological section the text may be related to alchemy This would also make sense if the text was about making certain kinds of medicine The problem with that theory is that alchemy books of the time all use a common set of motifs for their pictures these motifs cannot be found the manuscript

Another idea is that the book is about astrology practices common at the time such as bloodletting were often connected with astrology The problem with this approach is that except for the signs of the zodiac and one diagram possibly showing the classical planets no one has shown that the symbols are found in other astrological traditions

Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus was an important Ancient Rome Tribune who presented an important reform called the Lex Sempronia Agraria This law was meant to reduce the number of poor and homeless people by only allowing the rich to have a certain amount of land while giving the rest to homeless veterans of the Roman military But the Roman Senate did not like his plan They convinced another tribune named Marcus Octavius to oppose Tiberius Gracchus Eventually enough tension built up that some of the Senators beat Tiberius to death with their chairs and threw his dead body into the Tiber Tiberius death is seen as the first death caused by political problems in the Roman government

Tiberius brother Gaius Gracchus also tried to reform the Roman government and was also killed Together the two are called the Gracchi Their attempts at reform had a lasting effect on Rome because later on the Senate used some of the ideas from their reforms in their own laws

A significant event in the history of epidemiology and public health was Dr John Snows study of an 1854 outbreak of cholera in Soho He identified the cause of the outbreak as water from the public water pump located at the junction of Broad Street and Cambridge Street close to the rear wall of what is today the John Snow public house 

John Snow mapped the addresses of the sick and noted that they were mostly people whose nearest access to water was the Broad Street pump He persuaded the authorities to remove the handle of the pump thus preventing any more of the infected water from being collected The spring below the pump was later found to have been contaminated with sewage This is an early example of epidemiology public health medicine and the application of sciencethe germ theory of disease

Science writer Steven Johnson describes the 2006 appearance of places related to the Broad Street Pump cholera outbreak 

A replica of the pump with a memorial plaque and without a handle was erected near the location of the original pump

Zipfs law is an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics The law is named after the linguist George Kingsley Zipf who first proposed it

Zipfs law states that given a large sample of words used the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table So word number N has a frequency of 1N

Thus the most frequent word will occur about twice as often as the second most frequent word three times as often as the third most frequent word etc For example in one sample of words the most frequently occurring word accounts for nearly 7 of all the words True to Zipfs Law the second place word of accounts for slightly over 35 of words followed by and Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the sample of words

The same relationship occurs in many other rankings unrelated to language such as the population ranks of cities in various countries corporation sizes income rankings etc The appearance of the distribution in rankings of cities by population was first noticed by Felix Auerbach in 1913 

It is not known why Zipfs law holds for most languages

The Tawny owl or Brown owl is a stocky medium sized owl commonly found in woodlands across much of Eurasia There are eleven recognised subspecies and some variation in the colouring 

The nest is usually in a tree hole where it can protect its eggs and young against potential predators This owl is resident through the year and highly territorial Many young birds starve if they cannot find a vacant territory once parental care ceases

This nocturnal bird of prey hunts mainly rodents usually by dropping from a perch to seize its prey which it swallows whole in towns its diet includes a higher proportion of birds Vision and hearing adaptations and silent flight aid its night hunting The Tawny is capable of catching smaller owls but is itself vulnerable to the Eagle owl or Northern Goshawk Red foxes are an important cause of mortality in newly fledged young

Although many people believe this owl has exceptional night vision its retina is no more sensitive than a humans Rather it is its asymmetrically placed ears that are key to its hunting They give the Tawny owl excellent directional hearing Like most owls it hunts at night and had a rather strange but easily imitated call

Ocean acidification is the decrease in the pH and increase in acidity of the Earths oceans It is caused by the increase of carbon dioxide that humans have put into the atmosphere About 25 of the carbon dioxide in the air goes into the oceans Therefore when carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases the carbon dioxide in the ocean increases too

When carbon dioxide enters the oceans it makes it more acidic

The skeletons and shells of many sea animals need what is known as calcium carbonate minerals Due to ocean acidification there are less of these minerals and there are species that could no longer produce or keep their shells With more carbon dioxide in the ocean this problem becomes worse and many species will be at risk As a result if humans continue to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere ocean life will be at risk

Between 1751 and 1994 the oceans pH on the surface went from 825 to 81cndateJanuary 2012

A premise is a statement that an argument claims will induce or justify a conclusion The proof of a conclusion depends on both the truth of the premises and the validity of the argument

Aristotle held that any logical argument could be reduced to three premises and a conclusion Premises are sometimes left unstated in which case they are called missing premises for example

It is understood that Socrates is a man The fully expressed reasoning is thus

In this example the first two independent clauses before the comma are the premises while Socrates is mortal is the conclusion

In logic an argument requires a set of two declarative sentences known as the premises along with another declarative sentence known as the conclusion This structure of two premises and one conclusion forms the basic argumentative structure More complex arguments can use a series of rules to connect several premises to one conclusion or to derive a number of conclusions from the original premises An example of this is the use of the rules of inference found within symbolic logic

Clementss second term was hurt by actions he took at SMU On March 3 1987 Clements admitted that he and the SMU board of governors had approved a secret plan to pay 13 college football players using money from an alumnus The NCAA shut down the SMU football program for the 1987 season They did not have a team in 1988 as well The shutdown and other sanctions hurt the team for many years The College of Bishops of the United Methodist Church investigated the scandal The discovered Clements had met with athletic director Bob Hitch and agreed that the payments had to continue In late 1985 then SMU President L Donald Shields and board of trustees chairman Edwin L Cox wanted to stop the payments completely Clements told President Shields to stay out of it and to go run the university

A week later Clements said he was sorry that he kept making the payments He said the he had learned about the payments in 1984 and discovered that players had been paid since the mid 1970s The board reluctantly and uncomfortably decided to continue paying players who had already been guaranteed payments However he now knows that they should have stopped the payments immediately

Clements faced calls for his impeachment as a result of these statements Two state legislators argued that he would have never been elected Governor had told the truth about his role in the scandal Because of this Clements did not run for a third term as governor On January 15 1991 Democratic state Treasurer Ann Richards replaced him

Tidal stream power is electricity made from the tidal movement of water A tidal stream generator is a machine that extracts energy from moving water in tides Tidal stream generators draw energy from water currents in much the same way as wind turbines draw energy from air currents

Tidal stream power is the cheapest and the least ecologically damaging among the three main forms of tidal power generation

Tidal stream power is a relatively new technology It was first conceived in the 1970s during the oil crisis

The potential for power generation by an individual tidal turbine can be greater than that of similarly rated wind energy turbine Water is about 800 times the density of air So water pushing against a turbine can provide much more power than air pushing against a similar turbine at the same speed Also the lowest water speeds needed for an economic power project is lower than the wind speed needed for a wind turbine project In practice the tide must move at speeds of at least 2 knots even close to neap tides to be a source of power 

As with wind power selection of location is critical for the tidal turbine Tidal stream systems need to be located in areas with fast currents where natural flows are concentrated between obstructions for example at the entrances to bays and rivers around rocky points headlands or between islands or other land masses 

The main concern has been whether the turbines kill fish Very little direct environmental research or observation of tidal stream systems exists Most direct observations consist of releasing tagged fish upstream of the device and direct observation of mortality or impact on the fish

One study of the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy project in the East River utilized 24 split beam hydroacoustic sensors to detect and track the movement of fish both upstream and downstream of each of six turbines The results suggested very few fish using this portion of the river those fish which did use this area were not using the portion of the river which would subject them to blade strikes and no evidence of fish traveling through blade areas

Work is currently being conducted by the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center to explore and establish tools and protocols for assessment of physical and biological conditions and monitor environmental changes associated with tidal energy development

Age of consent is the age when law considers a person mature enough to agree to having sex In the United States the federal age of consent is 18 States have ages between 16 and 18 

The Federal government has a legal age of consent of 18 This law applies to any actions that take place between different states or on federal property This makes it a crime to use any form of communication between states to try to get a minor to have sex with an adult Even if the minor and adult are in the same state if the communication leave the state it is a crime For example if both people live in the same state and use an instant messaging progam to communicate If the server used for the communication is in another state this is a crime

It is also a crime for a minor to be taken to a different state to have sex This could happen if the 16 year old lived in a state that had an age of consent of 18 but travelled to a state where the age limit was 16 If the adult travels to a different state or a different country to have sex with a minor this is only a federal crime it the minor is under the age of 16 It may still be a local crime if the minor was under the age of consent of the state or nation where the sex happened but it is not a federal crime 

Each US state has its own age of consent State laws set the age of consent at 16 17 or 18 The most common age is 16

1 In Pennsylvania the age of consent is 16 If the minor is under the age of 18 the adult can be charged with Coruption of a Minor This is a misdemeanor If the adult is in a position of power this is a felony Even though the age of consent is 16 it is still a crime until the age of 18 Becase of this Pennsylvania is normally listed as if it had an age of consent of 18

Some states have exceptions to the law for people below the age of consent if their partners age is within a specific range This range is often between 2 and 4 years Most allow minors who are 16 or 17 to consent to sex with their spouses if they are married but not to anyone else 

These are two examples of the age of sexual consent in two US states

A decompression chamber is a large container that divers can enter after they have surfaced to help their bodies return to normal atmospheric pressure It is also called a recompression chamber or hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber

One of the problems that Wikipedia is most criticized for is that it is not always reliable This is true since anybody can change most articles and add anything they like Sometimes bad changes stay in place for a long time Wikipedia guidelines such as WikipediaVerifiability and WikipediaNo original research and the additional restrictions for living people at WikipediaBiographies of living persons have been made to help prevent this 

These guidelines are there for two reasons

However many sources are not suitable for use in Wikipedia because they are not reliable

This is a guideline about the types of sources which are reliable Wikipedia articles should use reliable third party published sources These sources can be in any language not just English or Simple English

Sources used in Wikipedia should have been published Some published documents are written by just one person and nobody else checks it before it is published It is easy for these sources to contain mistakes or untrue information Other documents are written by people who have studied the subject for many years and many other people have read them carefully to make sure that the information is correct Although both kinds of documents can contain things that are not true documents that people have checked are more likely to contain correct information and to reflect the most common views on a subject These are called reliable sources 

How reliable a source is depends on context Some publishers like the BBC become well known for having a reliable publication process This means that they only publish documents after they check them carefully As a guide the more people who help with checking facts analyzing legal issues and examining the writing the more reliable the publication

WikipediaCiting sources has help with how to add sources to an article If you are using Firefox Cite4wiki is a useful tool which will make adding sources much easier

Sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article and should be appropriate to the claims made if an article topic has no reliable sources Wikipedia should not have an article on it

Wikipedia articles should cover all major and significant minority views that have been published by reliable sources See WikipediaNeutral point of view

The best kind of sources for Wikipedia are reliable third party sources WikipediaHelp with sources has more information about these and why they are needed Unfortunately the Simple English Wikipedia has many articles which do not have these kinds of sources or in fact any sources at all

Here are some examples of useful places to find sources like this

Often it is helpful just to run a search using a search engine and avoid websites that are not reliable

Many websites are not reliable sources If a website is written by just one person it is often that persons opinion or their own point of view This may not be completely correct If a website is selling a product or promoting something it is not a reliable source as the information provided is there to help make money The best websites are those that are run by newspapers or other media agencies that are known to be trustworthy or those which have a reputation for providing good information 

Some websites that should be avoided are

A useful thing to look out for is the number of emotive words a source uses If they use many words like wonderful or terrible they may not have a neutral point of view Sources which are not neutral may sometimes be showing only one side of the facts which is not useful unless you are writing about opinions which people have

Part of the problem is the fact that many reliable academic sources do not write about subjects in the simple way that is required for this Wikipedia Sometimes it is very difficult to translate the meaning of these difficult texts into simple words Many users who write articles simply use websites or books that are already written for children or people learning English This is a problem because these sources tend to simplify things so much that they are no longer completely accurate When a Wikipedia user rewrites the information in these sources in their own words the meaning may be different from what is true

Be careful with sources which are written by someone who represents or is the subject These people have a conflict of interest In general if a person or organization writes about itself this writing is not a good source Such sources often support the subjects point of view and not a neutral point of view However that does not mean these sources should be avoided because often it is only the people close to the subject who know some of the facts about it A self published source can be used if all of the following are true

Be bold If you can find sources for the information in the article please do add them WikipediaCiting sources has help with how to do this

If you are not able to add sources you can place a tldunreferenced tag on it This will add it to a category of unreferenced pages that need to be fixed This is not as helpful because most users do not check the list of unreferenced pages for work to do 

If an article looks like it is probably a hoax or not true please do not add tldunreferenced Instead it should be deleted If it is obviously not true it can be deleted quickly by placing tldQDA6 If it is not as clear you can nominate it for deletion here

If an article has some sources but it also has some statements that may not be true and are not sourced you can place tldfact after them to show that they do not have a source However if the information is clearly false or if the article is about a living person it is best to simply remove it

Reliable sources in science need to be 1 Reliable 2 Secondary

Reliable published in a reputable journal or by a reputable scientist and a reputable publisher This is because reputable publishers employ qualified readers to critique manuscripts and have a reputation to uphold Websites are reputable if they have independent editorial supervision So a website of the University of California at Berkeley which supports a course is reliable because it has the particular departments supervision behind it

Secondary A primary source is one which announces an original finding or opinion of some kind Generally such papers are too specialised for our purposes They may need to be interpreted by an expert in the field Secondary sources are surveys and interpretations by experts in the particular field Reviews and surveys in Nature and similar journals university level textbooks semi popular accounts if written by experts Tertiary sources are such as articles in the press most books for children popular books by authors who are not experts They are not suitable for references in scientific topics because their reliability is open to question

A good source will combine both reliability and appropriate breadth So a leading encyclopedia has articles by renowned experts and supervised by an editorial team That makes it a suitable source for reference in one of our scientific topics Any reference to a website which does not have a similar backing is open to question

These guidelines are written with science in mind but would probably apply to many other scholarly areas

Fringe theories are ideas about a subject that most people who know a lot about that subject would strongly disagree with Some examples of fringe theories are conspiracy theories and ideas about science that do not have much scientific support Books and websites that promote fringe theories are usually not considered reliable sources unless they are being used in an article about those fringe theories For example the Simple English Wikipedia has an article about the Flat Earth Society which claims that the Earth is flat but the Flat Earth Societys website is not used as a source in the article about the Earth because it is not considered to be a reliable source For more information see enWPFRINGE on the English Wikipedia

The Pre Raphaelite Brotherhood was a group of English painters poets and critics founded in 1848 by William Holman Hunt John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti The three founders were soon joined by William Michael Rossetti James Collinson Frederic George Stephens and Thomas Woolner to form a seven member brotherhood

The groups intention was to reform art by rejecting what they considered to be the mechanistic approach This was first adopted by the Mannerist artists who succeeded Raphael and Michelangelo The Brotherhood believed that the Classical poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the academic teaching of art Hence the name Pre Raphaelite 

In particular they objected to the influence of Sir Joshua Reynolds the founder of the English Royal Academy of Arts whom they called Sir Sloshua To the Pre Raphaelites according to William Michael Rossetti sloshy meant anything lax or scamped in the process of painting and hence any thing or person of a commonplace or conventional kind In contrast they wanted to return to the abundant detail intense colours and complex compositions of Quattrocento Italian and Flemish art

The Pre Raphaelites continued to accept the idea of history painting and the imitation of nature as central to the purpose of art Despite this they were a reform movement they created a distinct name for their form of art and published a periodical The Germ to promote their ideas Their debates were recorded in the Pre Raphaelite Journal

The Brotherhood were highly praised by the art critic John Ruskin and in turn they were influenced by his ideas Rossettis wife Elizabeth Siddal was their favourite model and she developed into an excellent artist herself

Piccadilly is a major street in central London running from Hyde Park Corner in the west to Piccadilly Circus in the east It is completely within the City of Westminster St Jamess lies to the south of the eastern section of the street while the western section overlooks Green Park The area to the north is Mayfair

It is the location of Fortnum Mason the Royal Academy The Ritz Hotel the RAF Club and Hatchards book shop Simpsons once amongst the United Kingdoms leading clothing stores opened on Piccadilly in the 1930s The store closed in 1999 and the site is now the flagship shop of the booksellers Waterstones

The name Piccadilly may come from a tailor named Robert Baker in the late 16th century and early 17th century He amassed a large fortune by making and selling piccadills stiff collars with scalloped edges and a lace border which were then in fashion With his great fortune he bought a large tract of what was then open country to the west of London

After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660 Piccadilly and the area to the north began to be systematically developed as a fashionable residential locality Some of the grandest mansions in London were built on the northern side of Piccadilly Clarendon House Berkeley House and Sir John Denhams house were built in the 17th century Later mansions included Melbourne House Apsley House Bath House and Cambridge House Several members of the Rothschild family had mansions at the western end of the street and that part was colloquially referred to as Rothschild Row 

By the 1920s most of these buildings had been demolished or were in institutional use The enlargement of Park Lane and the formation of Hyde Park Corner as a major traffic gyratory system has cut off the western stretch of Piccadilly with the result that Apsley House has become detached from it

Lock picking is the art of opening a lock without the key and without damaging or destroying the lock or its door It is usually used by locksmiths to let people back in who have lost their keys or locked them inside a car or house Lock picking is very rarely used by criminals because picking a lock is difficult and other methods of entering such as breaking a window are much easier Some people pick their own locks as a hobby In most places picking locks that you own is legal but it is illegal to pick locks that you do not own or do not have permission to pick

Warded locks are the simplest locks to pick and are picked by inserting a warded lock pick into the keyhole and turning it as if it were the key A pick for warded locks can be made by filing down all of the teeth on a regular key except the last one or for some locks the last two

Pin tumbler and wafer tumbler locks normally open when the correct key pushes all of the pins or wafers to the shear line An incorrect key will push the pins or wafers too little or too far These locks are more difficult to pick than warded locks and are picked by putting tension on the keyhole and pushing the pins or wafers up individually until they reach the shear line When all of the pins have reached the shear line the lock will turn as if the key were inserted Other methods of raising the pins or wafers involve moving an S shaped pick called a rake through the keyhole to vibrate the pins or wafers to the shear line or using the pick gun which bounces the pins to the shear line It is also possible to pick a pin tumbler lock with a bump key which when struck with a hammer will bump the pins to the shear line The force on the hammer should be slightly less than that used for driving a nail because too much force will break off the head of the key leaving the rest of the key stuck in the lock Many newer locks have special pins that make picking more difficult The special pins are usually spool shaped and work by wedging into the shear line when pushed up by the pick

Most padlocks can be opened by inserting a thin piece of metal called a shim between the shackle and the body of the lock This will need to be done on both sides if there are locking levers on both sides The shim pushes the locking latch aside and allows the lock to open High security padlocks often use a ball bearing latch which can not be pushed aside with a shim Combination locks can not be picked but it is often possible to find the combination by feeling for certain clicks inside the lock except on certain high security safe locks Some combination locks have small cracks through which the parts inside the lock can be seen allowing the combination to be determined The Master Lock 175 brass combination lock has a very unique flaw allowing a small piece of metal to be inserted into the bottom of the lock which pushes the locking bar aside opening the lock A special pick exists for disc detainer locks but it is only effective on inexpensive locks that do not have false gates A well made disc detainer lock with false gates is considered almost impossible to pick Lever locks are considered difficult although possible to pick and also require a special pick Tubular locks can be picked with a special tubular pick Some poorly made tubular locks can be picked with an ordinary writing pen Most car locks can be defeated by inserting a metal or plastic rod with a small hook on the end into the area between the rubber seal on the window and the car body and using the hook to pull the lock lever that is normally pulled by hand from the inside of the car

Mimosa pudica is a well known species of Mimosa It is a creeping annual or perennial herb often grown for its curiosity value the compound leaves fold inward and droop when touched or shaken re opening minutes later The species is native to South America and Central America but is now a widespread weed

The stem is erect in young plants but becomes creeping or trailing with age The leaves of the Mimosa pudica are compound leaves

The leaves are bipinnately compound with one or two pinnae pairs and 10 26 leaflets per pinna The round shaped flower heads which are inflorescences are 810 mm in diameter The floret petals are red in their upper part and the filaments are pink to lavender The fruit consists of clusters of 2 8 pods from 12 cm long each The pods break into 2 5 segments and contain pale brown seeds some 25 mm long The flowers are pollinated by the wind and insects The seeds have hard seed coats which restrict germination

Mimosa pudica is well known for its rapid plant movement Like a number of other plant species it undergoes changes in leaf orientation termed sleep The foliage closes during darkness and reopens in light

The leaves also close when touched warmed blown or shaken When the plant is disturbed specific regions on the stems release potassium ions which force water out of the cell vacuoles The water diffuses out of the cells producing a loss of cell pressure and cell collapse this differential turgidity between different regions of cells results in the closing of the leaflets and the collapse of the leaf petiole This is quite a common trait in the Mimosoideae subfamily of the legume family Fabaceae The stimulus can also be transmitted to neighbouring leaves The function of this trait is not known The plant may use its ability as a defense from predators Animals may be afraid of a fast moving plant and would rather eat a less active one Another possible explanation is that the sudden movement dislodges harmful insects

Muhammad Ali Pasha al Masud ibn Agha was an Albanian commander in the Ottoman army who became Wli and self declared Khedive of Egypt and Sudan Though not a modern nationalist he is regarded as the founder of modern Egypt because of the dramatic reforms in the military economic and cultural spheres that he instituted He also ruled Levantine territories outside Egypt The dynasty that he established would rule Egypt and Sudan until the Egyptian Revolution of 1952

Muhammed Ali was born in the Ottoman Empire in the area which is now the Greek province of Macedonia His parents were Albanian and their language was the only one he spoke well He also spoke some Turkish but not Arabic He led a group of Albanian troops sent to Egypt The were part of an Ottoman force that reoccupied Egypt after Napoleons French troops left The Ottomans had ruled Egypt by a Wali with Mamluk troops The Mamluks were former slaves

The French withdrawal left a power vacuum in the Ottoman province Mamluk power had been weakened but not destroyed and Ottoman forces clashed with the Mamluks for power During this period of anarchy Muhammad Ali used his loyal Albanian troops to play both sides gaining power and prestige for himself As the conflict drew on the local populace grew weary of the power struggle A group of prominent Egyptians demanded that the Wli Ahmad Khurshid Pasha step down and Muhammad Ali be installed as the new Wli in 1805

Muhammad Alis goal was to establish a powerful European style state To do that he had to reorganize Egyptian society streamline the economy train a professional bureaucracy and build a modern military

In practice Muhammad Alis land reform amounted to a monopoly on trade in Egypt He required all producers to sell their goods to the state The state in turn resold Egyptian goods and kept the surplus This was very profitable for Egypt especially with their cotton which was of high quality The new found profits also extended down to the individual farmers as the average wage increased fourfold

Beyond building a more modern economy Muhammad Ali started to train a professional military and bureaucracy He sent promising men to Europe to study Students were sent to study European languages primarily French so they could translate military manuals into Arabic He then used both educated Egyptians and imported European experts to establish schools and hospitals in Egypt The European education also provided talented Egyptians with social mobility Bright boys from poor families could work their way up and become successful

A byproduct of Muhammad Alis training program was the establishment of a Civil service Establishing an efficient central bureaucracy was needed for Muhammad Alis other reforms In the process of destroying the Mamluks the Wli had to fill the posts that the Mamluks had previously filled He divided Egypt into ten provinces each leader responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining order Muhammad Ali installed his sons in most key positions however his reforms did offer Egyptians opportunities beyond agriculture and industry

At the start Muhammad Ali waged war on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II in Arabia and Greece Later he came into open conflict with the Ottoman Empire

His first military campaign was an expedition into the Arabian Peninsula The holy cities of Mecca and Medina had been captured by the House of Saud who held a form of Islam called Wahhabism Armed with their new religious zeal the Muhammad ibn Saud began conquering parts of Arabia 

With the main Ottoman army tied up in Europe Mahmud II turned to Muhammad Ali to recapture the Arabian territories Muhammad Ali in turn appointed his son Tusun Pasha to lead a military expedition in 1811 The campaign was turned back in Arabia however a second attack was launched in 1812 that recaptured Hejazp43 44 After a two year campaign the Saudis were crushed and most of the Saudi family was captured The family leader Abdullah ibn Saud was sent to Istanbul and executedp48

Muhammad Ali next turned his attention to military campaigns of his own design beginning with the Sudan which he viewed as a valuable addition of territory gold and slaves Sudan at the time had no real central authority and used primitive weaponry in its tribal infighting 

In 1820 Muhammad Ali dispatched an army of 5000 troops commanded by his third son Ismail south into Sudan with the intent of conquering the territory and subjugating it to his authorityp51 Alis troops made headway into Sudan in 1821 but met with fierce resistance Ultimately Egyptian troops and firearms ensured the conquest of Sudan Ali now had an outpost from which he could expand to the source of the Nile in Ethiopia and Uganda His administration captured slaves from the Sudan who were then made into a foot regiment of soldiers Alis harsh reign in Sudan and that of his immediate successors led eventually to the popular independence struggle of the self proclaimed Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad in 1881 

As Muhammad Ali was expanding his authority into Africa the Ottoman Empire faced ethnic rebellions in its European territories The rebellion in the Greek provinces of the Ottoman Empire began in 1821 The Ottoman army failed to put down the revolt and ethnic violence spread as far as Constantinople Sultan Mahmud II offered Muhammad Ali the island of Crete in exchange for his support in putting down the revolt

Muhammed Ali sent 16000 soldiers 100 transports and 63 escort vessels under command of his son Ibrahim Pashap71 Britain France and Russia intervened to protect the Greeks On 20 October 1827 at the Navarino the entire Egyptian navy was sunk by the European Allied fleet under the command of Admiral Edward Codrington Muhammad Ali suffered the loss of his competent expensive navy With its fleet destroyed Egypt had no way to support its forces in Greece and was forced to withdraw Ultimately the campaign cost Muhammad Ali his navy for no gains

To compensate for his and Egypts losses the conquest of Syria was set in motion Like other rulers of Egypt before him Ali desired to control the Levant both for its strategic value and for its rich natural resources Not only had Syria abundant natural resources it also had a thriving international trading community with well developed markets throughout the Levant It would be a captive market for the goods now being produced in Egypt Perhaps best of all Syria was desirable as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman Sultan

A new fleet was built a new army was raised and on 31 October 1831 under Ibrahim Pasha the Egyptian invasion of Syria started the First Turko Egyptian War The Egyptians overran most of Syria with ease The strongest and only really significant resistance was put up at the port city of Acre The Egyptian force eventually captured the city after a six month siege Unrest on the Egyptian home front increased during the course of the siege Ali was forced to squeeze Egypt more and more to support his campaign and his people resented the increased burden

After the fall of Acre the Egyptian army marched north into Anatolia At the Battle of Konya Ibrahim Pasha soundly defeated the Ottoman army led by the Grand Vizier Reshid Pasha There were now no military obstacles between Ibrahims forces and Constantinople itself

Through the course of the campaign Muhammad Ali watched the European powers carefully Fearing another intervention that would reverse all his gains he proceeded slowly and cautiously For example he continued the practice of using the Sultans name at Friday prayers in the newly captured territories He continued to circulate Ottoman coins instead of issuing new ones bearing his likenessp111 So long as Muhammad Alis march did not threaten the complete collapse of the Ottoman state the powers in Europe remained passive observers

Despite this show Muhammad Alis goal was now to remove the current Ottoman Sultan Mahmud II and replace him with the sultans son the infant Abdlmecid This possibility so alarmed Mahmud II that he accepted Russias offer of military aid This led to the Treaty of Hnkr skelesip72 Russias gain dismayed the British and French governments so they worked for a negotiated solution In May 1833 the Convention of Kutahya was signed 

The terms of the peace were that Ali would withdraw his forces from Anatolia and receive the territories of Crete and the Hijaz as compensation Ibrahim Pasha would be appointed Wli of Syria The peace agreement fell short however of granting Muhammad Ali an independent kingdom for himself leaving him wantingp122

This City is the first solo mainstream radio single released by American pop singer songwriter Patrick Stump off the debut album Soul Punk under Island Def Jam Records on July 26 2011 on his blog The song features American rapper and songwriter and producer Lupe Fiasco The original track does not feature Fiascos addition to the rap versus in the single In January 2010 Stump announced that he was producing his debut solo album titled Soul Punk This came after Fall Out Boys hiatus in late 2009 His album is a complete solo effort as he is doing everything performing composing all music penning all lyrics playing over ten instruments and producing with the albums recording is funded by his own Fall Out Boy earnings Its musical direction is generally popRB orientated and has been described by Stump as soul punk and smart pop drawing influence from a wide scope of artists including Prince Michael Jackson and David Bowie According to Stump the song changed the entire course of Soul Punk I had written a while draft of the album and then at the 11th hour came up with This City I really loved the song but felt like conceptually it didnt fit on the album I had to go back and make an album for that song because I loved it so much So one of the holdups on the album was re writing the record around it With Soul Punk originally due in February 2011 Stump delayed it to October 18 and rebuilt the album with the song releasing Truant Wave EP in the meanwhile for its delay in February 2011 I had this feeling that the album was disjointed and right before I was mastering I played This City for my manager I really liked it but I was unsure about it although I thought it was what I wanted to say and he was like Put it on its great Then I thought Well if Im going to put that on the record then I really need to go back to the drawing board Basically I took This City Everybody Wants Somebody Allie and a song called Dance Miserable and rebuilt the album around those four songs

A music video for the remix has been released directed by Ken Koller On September 13 Patrick Stump announced that the music video for This City would premiere on September 20 on Vevo with a teaser on Idolitor Prior to that he Tweeted about the video in the making Twitter Retrieved September 4 2011ref and a behind the scenes clip was reported by MTV on their website The video features Stump dancing and performing the song in a room with flashing lights projections and heavy use of special effects alternating with brief grayscale flashes of a city Despite not being available at first Lupe Fiasco appears for one scene by himself Stump and Koller made the video simplistic to let the music do the talking rather than the video

Theres not really a plot theres not really a story to it The songs called This City and it describes a lot of these images in a city and I feel like those images are already there it would be kind of redundant to take a camera into a city its almost like the colors and the lights and the images that are going to be around this are going to be representing the life in a city One thing that Ken and I were talking about is that a city is so complicated so we wanted to do something a bit different with it and a bit more abstract the treatment was really funny to look at it was literally one sentence like Patrick stands in a room and sings and we project all these images and lights on the walls  Stump reported by MTV

Anglo Egyptian Sudan was the name of the Sudan when it was a colony of the United Kingdom and Egypt It was officially under the joint rule of both countries but really the British controlled the government from the beginning Every Governor was British and all decisions about the country were made by the British although many of the administrators of the Anglo Egyptian Sudan were Egyptians The Anglo Egyptian Sudan was created in 1899 when the Egyptian Army under Herbert Kitchener recaptured the Sudan which was before an Egyptian colony from the Madhists a group of Islamic rebels against Egypt 

Condominium means a colony ruled jointly by two or more countries Examples include the Anglo Egyptian Sudan which was in name under the joint rule of the United Kingdom and Egypt although in fact a British colony with all political decisions up to the British despite having many Egyptians involved in administering the country and New Hebrides which was under the joint rule of the UK and France

The Neornithes are the modern birds These are the most recent common ancestor of all living birds and all its descendants There are about 9 to 10000 known living bird species in the world

Modern birds are divided into two superorders the Palaeognathae tinamous and flightless ratites and the Neognathae containing all other birds 

It is generally agreed that the Neornithes evolved in the Cretaceous and that the split between the Palaeognathae and Neognathae and then the split between fowl and the other Neognathae occurred before the KT extinction event The earliest fossil remains of the Neornithes are about ten million years after the start of the Cretaceous Gallornis is the first fossil 

There are different opinions about whether the radiation of the remaining neognathes occurred before or after the extinction of the other dinosaurs Molecular dating suggests a Cretaceous radiation while fossil evidence suggest an early Tertiary radiation Attempts made to bring together the molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial

The classification of modern birds is dificult Sibley Ahlquists Phylogeny and classification of birds is a landmark work on the classification of birds though it is often debated and revised Most evidence suggests that the modern bird orders are accurate taxa More recently new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders

Antipope is a term of the Roman Catholic Church in the context of its official list of popes An antipope is not included in the list of popes in the Vaticans annual directory Annuario Pontificio

An antipope is a pretender who falsely claims to be pope or who wrongly opposes the legitimate and recognized pope

The existence or claims of an antipope produces a schism in the Roman Catholic church A conflict is caused by those who are opposing the authority of the pope 

The Palaeognathae or paleognaths are one of the two living superorders of birds The other living superorder is Neognathae Together these two clades form the subclass Neornithes

Paleognath is a word derived from the ancient Greek for old jaws in reference to the skeletal anatomy of the palate which is described as more primitive and reptilian than that in other birds Paleognathous birds are uncontroversially the most primitive or basal living birds though there is some controversy about the precise relationship between them and the other birds 

This superorder contains four extant orders of flightless ratites and one order of flying tinamous

The order Tinamiformes includes nine living genera and forty seven species

The Apterygiformes include five species in one genus

The Casuariiformes have two genera The cassowaries have three species and the emus have one living and one recently extinct species

The Rheiformes have two genera with one species each

The Struthioniformes have only one living species

There are extinct orders the Lithornithiformes the Dinornithiformes and the Aepyornithiformes There are other extinct orders which have been allied with the Palaeognathae by at least one author but their affinities are a matter of dispute the Ambiornithiformes the Gansuiformes the Paleocursornithiformes the Gobipterygidae

Neognaths are birds within the subclass Neornithes of the class of birds The Neognathae include virtually all living birds their sister taxon Palaeognathae contains the tinamous and the flightless ratites

There are nearly 10000 species of neognaths Since the late Cretaceous from which the earliest fossils are known they have undergone an adaptive radiation producing the diversity of form function and behavior that we see today The Passeriformes are the largest order of land vertebrates containing some 60 of living birds and being more than twice as specious as rodents and about 5 times as specious as Chiroptera which are the largest orders of mammals On the other hand there are some very small orders usually birds of very unclear relationships like the puzzling Hoatzin

The neognaths have fused metacarpals an elongate third finger and 13 or fewer vertebrae They differ from the Palaeognathae in features like the structure of their jawbones Neognathae means new jaws but ironically it seems that the supposedly more ancient paleognath jaws are among the few apomorphic features of this group as compared to the neognaths

Lacewings or Green lacewings are insects in the large family Chrysopidae of the order Neuroptera There are about 85 genera and 13002000 species in this widespread group However in America and Europe the two genera Chrysopa and Chrysoperla are very common

Most species of lacewings and their larvae are active predators and are often used for biological control 

Many adults of Chrysopa can defend themselves by giving out a vile smell from glands at the front of their thorax

They have ears at the base of their front wings When they hear bat echolocation sounds they close their wings and drop down They can escape spider webs because being so light they do not create much vibration to alert the spider Instead of struggling like most insects the lacewing bites through the strands holding its legs and antennae When it is stuck only by its wings it become completely immobile Slowly the lacewing slides downwards out of the web Tiny hairs on the wings prevent the sticky spider silk from touching the wings surface 

The larvae are voracious attacking other insects of suitable size especially soft bodied ones When they touch a potential prey object the larva grasps it Their maxillae are hollow and inject a digestive secretion into the prey The organs of an aphid can be dissolved by this in 90 seconds

The Tanggu Truce sometimes called the Tangku Truce Tanku kytei was a ceasefire signed between China and Empire of Japan in Tanggu District Tianjin on May 31 1933 formally ending the Japanese invasion of Manchuria which had begun two years earlier

After the Mukden Incident of September 18 1931 the Japanese Kwantung Army invaded Manchuria and by February 1932 had captured the entire region The last emperor of the Qing Dynasty Puyi who was living in exile in Tianjin was invited by the Japanese to accept the throne of the new Empire of Manchukuo which was controlled by the Japanese army In January 1933 to guard Manchukuos southern borders a joint Japanese and Manchukuo force invaded Rehe and after conquering that province by March drove the remaining Chinese armies in the northeast outside the Great Wall into Hebei Province

The Western powers blamed Japans actions but did little else When the League of Nations demanded that Japan stop fighting the Japan withdrew from the League on March 27 1933

As the Japanese army was under clear orders from Emperor Hirohito not to go into the Great Wall the Japanese halted their attack in May 1933

On May 22 1933 Chinese and Japanese representatives met to talk the end of the fight The Japanese demands were serious a demilitarized zone covering one hundred kilometers south of the Great Wall from Beijing to Tianjin was to be set up with the Great Wall itself under Japanese control No regular Kuomintang military units were to be allowed in the zone although the Japanese were allowed to use scout aircraft or ground patrols to check that the agreement was maintained Public order within the zone was to be maintained by a police unit Demilitarized Zone Peace Preservation Corps

Two secret clauses left out any of the Anti Japanese Volunteer Armies from this Peace Preservation Corps and provided for any problems that could not be fixed by the Peace Preservation Corps to be arranged by agreement between the Japanese and Chinese governments Having lost every major battles and much territory and with the Chinese government under Chiang Kai shek more concerned with fighting the Chinese Communist Party than the Japanese the Chinese government agreed to all demands Furthermore the new demilitarized zone was mostly within the remaining territory of the Manchurian warlord Zhang Xueliang

The Tanggu Truce resulted in the de facto recognition of Manchukuo by the Kuomingtang government and acceptance of the loss of Rehe It brought a short end to the combat between China and Japan and for a brief period relations between the two countries improved On May 17 1935 the Japanese legation in China was improved to the status of embassy and on June 10 1935 the He Umezu Agreement was concluded The Tanggu Truce gave Chiang kai Shek time to merge his forces and to focus his efforts against the Chinese Communist Party though at the cost of northern China However Chinese public opinion was opposing to truce so favorable to Japan and so shameful to China Although the Truce set up a demilitarized buffer zone Japanese territorial desires towards China remained and the Truce proved to be only a short break until fightings broke out again with the start of the Second Sino Japanese War in 1937

The Mukden Incident also known as the Manchurian Incident was an event set up by Japanese soldiers as a reason for invading the northern part of China known as Manchuria in 1931

On September 18 1931 a little amount of dynamite was blown up by a Japanese soldier near a Japans South Manchuria Railway near Mukden Although the explosion was so weak that the rail was still useable the Japanese army blaming the action on the Chinese people fully invading Manchuria and leading to its occupation Japan set up its puppet state of Manchukuo six months later Soon the world knew the event leading Japan to diplomatic isolation and its withdrawl from the League of Nations

A sensory receptor or sense organ is the part which responds to a stimulus in the internal or external environment of an organism It is the input to the sensory system In response to stimuli the sensory receptor fires off a nerve fibre which goes to the central nervous system

The parietal lobe is a part of the brain positioned above the occipital lobe and behind the frontal lobe 

The parietal lobe brings together information from different senses particularly spatial sense and navigation For example it uses input about touch balance and the visual system This enables the parietal cortex to map seen objects in relation to the body This makes it possible for a person to reach out and handle objects

The name derives from the overlying parietal bone which is named from the Latin pariet  wall

The frontal lobe is an area in the brain of humans and other mammals at the front of each cerebral hemisphere It is in front of the parietal lobe and above and in front of the temporal lobes 

It is separated from the parietal lobe by a space between tissues called the central sulcus and from the temporal lobe by a deep fold called the lateral sulcus The precentral gyrus forming the back of the frontal lobe contains the primary motor cortex which controls voluntary movements of specific body parts

The frontal lobes takes action based on sensory information from the three rear areas of the cerebrum moderated by the influence of the pre frontal cortex The system is a delicate balance between the need to satisfy urges from the most ancient parts of the brain such as hunger self defence and sex with the need to act in a way which is socially acceptable 

For many years many scientists thought that the frontal lobe was comparatively larger in humans compared to other primates They thought that this was an important feature of human evolution and was the primary reason why human cognition is different from that of the other primates However this view has been challenged by later research Using magnetic resonance imaging to determine the volume of the frontal cortex in humans all living ape species and several monkey species Semendeferi et al found that the human frontal cortex was not relatively larger than the cortex in the other great apes but was relatively larger than the frontal cortex in the lesser apes and the monkeys

The temporal lobe is a region of the cerebral cortex that is under the Sylvian fissure on both cerebral hemispheres of the mammalian brain

The temporal lobe is involved in auditory perception and is home to the primary auditory cortex It is also important for the processing of semantics in both speech and vision The temporal lobe contains the hippocampus and plays a key role in the formation of long term memory

An area in the Sylvian fissure is the first place where auditory signals from the cochlea reach the cerebral cortex This part of the cortex is involved in hearing Other areas of the temporal lobes are involved in high level auditory processing In humans this includes speech for which the left temporal lobe in particular seems to be specialized Wernickes area which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes plays a key role The functions of the left temporal lobe extends to comprehension naming verbal memory and other language functions 

The underside of the temporal lobes do high level visual processing of faces and scenes Front parts of this area are involved in object perception and recognition

Deep inside the medial temporal lobes lie the hippocampus which is essential for memory function particularly the transfer from short to long term memory and control of spatial memory and behaviour

The cochlea is the auditory portion of the inner ear It is a spiral shaped cavity in the bony labyrinth making 25 turns around its axis A core component of the cochlea is the Organ of Corti the sensory organ of hearing which is distributed along the partition separating fluid chambers in the coiled tapered tube of the cochlea

The name is from the Greek kokhlias from kokhlos This is in reference to its coiled shape the cochlea is coiled in most mammals monotremes being the exceptions

Super Size Me is a 2004 American documentary film directed by and starring Morgan Spurlock It is about an experiment where Spurlock ate nothing but food from McDonalds for thirty days He ate at McDonalds three times a day eating an average of 5000 kcal per day This experiment lasted from February 1 to March 2 2003 This experiment was bad for his own physical and psychological health 

During the experiment Spurlock gained 24 lbs had a 13 body mass increase his cholesterol level went to 230 and he had mood swings sexual dysfunction and had fat accumulation in his liver After the experiment he recovered with a vegan diet his then future wife prepared for him 

This experiment was conducted because of the obesity epidemic in the United States and because of a case in which two teenage girls sued McDonalds who claimed they became obese as a result of eating food from McDonalds

Spurlock also uses this film to criticize McDonalds and the fast food industry ranging from the sale of unhealthy food to corporate marketing and to the personal profit of these organizations

A non newtonian fluid is a thixotropic fluid which changes its viscosity when the shearing forces it is exposed to change Other flow properties may also be affected Most commonly viscosity of such fluids is not independent of the shear rate or the shear rate history Examples of such fluids are blood quicksand and certain components of cement Many lubricants ketchup certain forms of dough and pudding also have this property 

The other kind of fluids that do not show this behaviour are called Newtonian fluids

A Newtonian fluid is a fluid where the ratio between shearing stress changes linearly in proportion to the stress it is exposed to This ratio is known as viscosity Note that the inverse is not true there are fluids with constant viscosity that are Non Newtonian fluids one example is the Boger fluid

Undergraduate education is a level of education taken before getting a first degree Therefore for many subjects in many systems of education undergraduate education is between secondary education and a bachelors degree like in the United States where a person starting at a university is known as undergraduate while students who have higher degrees are known as graduate students In some other educational systems and subjects undergraduate education is between secondary education and a masters degree for example in some science and engineering courses in Britain and some medicine courses in Europe

In the United States of America undergraduate education gives a bachelors degree Many times it is four years of study leading to a Bachelor of Arts a Bachelor of Science or sometimes another bachelors degree such as Bachelor of Fine Arts Bachelor of Social Work Bachelor of Engineering Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs or Bachelor of Philosophy Five Year Professional Architecture programs offer the Bachelor of Architecture Degree

Unlike in the British model degrees in law and medicine are not offered at the undergraduate level and are completed as graduate study after earning a bachelors degree Neither field specifies or prefers any undergraduate major though medicine has set prerequisite courses that must be taken before enrollment However nursing is taught as an undergraduate program

Thixotropy is the property of certain gels or fluids that are thick under normal conditions but flow when shaken agitated or otherwise stressed

In more technical language some Non Newtonian fluids show a change in viscosity the longer the fluid undergoes shear stress the lower its viscosity A thixotropic fluid is a fluid which takes a finite time to attain equilibrium viscosity when introduced to a step change in shear rate Many gels and colloids are thixotropic materials exhibiting a stable form at rest but becoming fluid when agitated 

Some fluids are anti thixotropic constant shear stress for a time causes an increase in viscosity or even solidification Constant shear stress can be applied by shaking or mixing They are much less common

It is a common experience walking on sand that in places it liquifies as one walks on it This is a thixotropic response to pressure In extremes a quicksand may be danger to man and animals

Some clays are thixotropic with their behaviour is of great importance in structural and geotechnical engineering Landslides such as those common in the cliffs around Lyme Regis Dorset and in the Aberfan disaster in Wales are evidence of this Similarly a lahar is a mass of earth liquefied by a volcanic event which rapidly solidifies once coming to rest 

Drilling muds used in geotechnical applications can be thixotropic Honey from honey bees may also exhibit this property under certain conditions 

Another example of a thixotropic fluid is the synovial fluid found in joints between some bones

Some clay deposits found in the process of exploring caves exhibit thixotropism an initially solid seeming mudbank will turn soupy and yield up moisture when dug into or otherwise disturbed These clays were deposited in the past by low velocity streams which tend to deposit fine grained sediment

These properties are often used in commercial products which are applied to surfaces such as paint or toothpaste With paint the fluidity vanishes quickly and the surface sets permanently as water evaporates

A squad automatic weapon sometimes called a light support weapon or even just a SAW is a kind of gun which is used to give a squad of soldiers a good amount of fully automatic gunfire The weapons used as squad automatic weapons are selective fire This means that the gunner can choose which fire mode of fire the gun is put in Some good examples of these are fully automatic semi automatic and three round burst They are usually fitted with a bipod or tripod so that they can be like light machine guns SAWs usually fire the same cartridge as the assault rifles or battle rifles that are carried by other soldiers in the squad This makes logistics easier because they only need to give one type of ammunition to a squad SAWs are light enough to be used by only one person

In mathematics the word sign refers to the property of being positive or negative Every real number is either positive or negative and therefore has a sign Zero itself is without a sign or signless In addition to putting signs in to real numbers the word sign is used throughout mathematics to indicate parts of mathematical objects that mean positivity and negativity Usually if numbers are seen without a sign they are seen as a positive number

The word sign is also sometimes used to refer to various mathematical signs such as the plus and minus signs and the multiplication sign

A real number is said to be positive if it is greater than zero and negative if it is less than zero The attribute of being positive or negative is called the sign of the number Zero itself is not considered to have a sign

In arithmetic the sign of a number is often denoted by placing a plus or minus sign before the number For example 3 would denote a positive 3 and 3 would denote a negative 3 When no plus or minus sign is given the main way of seeing it is that a number is positive

The sign of any number that is not zero can be changed to positive using the absolute value function For example the absolute value of 3 and the absolute value of 3 are both equal to 3 In symbols this would be written 3 3 and 3 3

The number zero is neither positive nor negative and therefore has no sign In arithmetic 0 and 0 both mean the same number 0

Because zero is neither positive nor negative the following are sometimes used to refer to the sign of an unknown number

Thus a non negative number is either positive or zero while a non positive number is either negative or zero For example the absolute value of a real number is always non negative but is not necessarily positive

The same definition is sometimes used for functions that take real or integer values For example a function would be called positive if all of its values are positive or non negative if all of its values are non negative

In many texts it is common to see a sign together with the measure of an angle particularly a located angle or an angle of rotation In such a situation the sign says whether the angle is in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction Though different conventions can be used it is common in mathematics to have counterclockwise angles count as positive and clockwise angles count as negative

It is also possible to put a sign to an angle of rotation in three dimensions assuming the axis of rotation has been oriented Specifically a right handed turn around an axis usually counts as positive while a left handed rotation counts as negative

In arithmetic and physics it is common to label certain directions as positive or negative For a basic example the number line is usually drawn with positive numbers to the right and negative numbers to the left

On the Cartesian plane the rightward and upward directions are usually thought of as positive with rightward being the positive x direction and upward being the positive y direction

In addition to the sign of a real number the word sign is also used in various related ways throughout mathematics and the sciences

A coordinate system is a system of ordered pairs in its own spot among the system

Lyme Regis is a coastal town in West Dorset England 25 miles west of Dorchester and convert25mikm east of Exeter The town lies in Lyme Bay on the English Channel coast at the Dorset Devon border It is nicknamed The Pearl of Dorset 

The town is noted for the fossils found in the cliffs and beaches which are part of the Jurassic Coasta World Heritage Site The harbour wall The Cobb features in Jane Austens novel Persuasion and in the film and novel The French Lieutenants Woman by local writer John Fowles

The towns population at the most recent census was 4406 45 of whom were retired

The town is noted for the fossils found in the cliffs and beaches which are part of the Jurassic Coasta World Heritage Site The Jurassic Coast stretches over a distance of convert153kmmi0 

The coastal exposures along the coastline provide a continuous sequence of Triassic Jurassic and Cretaceous rock formations spanning approximately 185 million years of the Earths history The localities along the Jurassic Coast include some important fossil zones The Blue Lias rock is host to a multitude of remains from the early Jurassic a time from which good fossil records are rare Many of the remains are well preserved with complete specimens of several important species Many of the earliest discoveries of dinosaur and other prehistoric reptile remains were made in the area surrounding Lyme Regis notably those discovered by Mary Anning Significant finds include Ichthyosaur Plesiosaur Dimorphodon Scelidosaurus one of the first armoured dinosaurs The town now holds an annual Mary Anning Day and Lyme Regis Fossil Festival A fossil of the worlds largest moth was discovered in 1966 at Lyme Regis

The coastal region near Lyme Regis is subject to large landslips This means that Jurassic age fossils are regularly exposed and can be found on the beaches but also causes devastation to the town

One of the most spectacular landslips occurred on 24 December 1839 convert3mikm west along the coast in Devon belonging to Bindon Manor and known as The Dowlands Landslip About convert45acreha of fields growing wheat and turnips were dislodged when a great chasm was formed more than convert300ftm across convert160ftm deep and convert075mikm long The crops remained intact on the top of what became known as Goat Island among the newly formed gullies On 3 February 1840 five weeks later there was a second landslip nearby but much smaller than the former This strange phenomenon attracted many visitors and the canny farmers charged sixpence for entrance and held a grand reaping party when the wheat ripened The area is now known as The Undercliff and is of great interest because of its diverse natural history

In 2005 work began on a 16 million engineering project to stabilise the cliffs and protect the town from coastal erosion The towns main beach was reconstructed and re opened on 1 July 2006 On the evening of 6 May 2008 a convert400mft section of land slipped onto the beach between Lyme Regis and Charmouth Local Police described the landslip as the worst for 100 years 

A non renewable resource is a natural resource which cannot be produced grown generated or used on a scale which can sustain its consumption rate Once it is used up there is no more available for future needs Also considered non renewable are resources that are consumed much faster than nature can create them Fossil fuels types of nuclear power and certain aquifers are examples Resources such as timber or metals are considered renewable resources

A perpetual resource has a never ending supply

The ASTM definition for a perpetual resource is one that is virtually inexhaustible on a human time scale Examples given include solar energy tidal energy and wind energy Other examples are salt stone magnesium and diamonds A study on the biogeophysical aspects of sustainability came up with a rule of prudent practice that a resource stock should last 700 years to achieve sustainability or become a perpetual resource or for a worse case 350 years

The perpetual resource concept is a complex one because it changes with new technology new needs and to a lesser degree with new economics On the one hand a material can enter a time of shortage and become a strategic and critical material but on the other hand a material can go out of use its resource can proceed to being perpetual if it was not before and then the resource can become a paleoresource when the material goes almost completely out of use Some of the complexities influencing resources of a material include the extent of recyclability the availability of suitable substitutes for the material in its end use products or other reasons

The Kimmeridge Clay Formation is a sedimentary deposit of fossiliferous marine clay which is of Upper Jurassic age It occurs in Europe It gives its name to a stage in the Upper Jurassic called the Kimmeridgian lasting from 15571508 million years ago

Kimmeridge Clay is perhaps the most economically important unit of rocks in the whole of Europe because it is the major source for oil fields in the North Sea 

It is named after the village of Kimmeridge on the Dorset coast of England where it is well exposed anf forms part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site It exists across England in a band stretching from Dorset in the south west north east to East Anglia and Hull The Humber Bridges foundations are in the Kimmeridge Clay deposits under the Humber estuary

The fossil fauna of the Kimmeridge Clay includes a reptile fauna of turtles crocodiles dinosaurs plesiosaurs pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs as well as many invertebrate species

The Kimmeridge Clay of the Upper Jurassic was laid down in an environment which is not present on the earth today with much of Western Europe being covered by a high sea level which has been related to opening of the Atlantic The consequence of this is that the UK was covered by a shallow and largely anoxic sea perhaps less than 100m deep with occasional landmasses 

This was shallower water than the Blue Lias of the Lower Jurassic It was often low in oxygen which in turn led to only partially decomposition of its organic material The mudstones are organic rich and gave rise to most of the North Sea oil

Enrico Fermis paradox wondered why given the age and size of the universe and that there are billions of stars and planets that have existed for billions of years we have not detected any other alien civilizations There have been attempts to resolve the Fermi paradox by finding evidence of alien civilizations along with thoughts that such life could exist without humans knowing

The physicist Enrico Fermi first asked the question in an informal discussion in 1950 A paper by Michael H Hart in 1975 started scientistsclarify to study the question in more detail So some people call it the FermiHart paradox Other common names for the same phenomenon are Fermis question the Fermi Problem the Great Silence and silentium universi

A tanning bed is a device that emits ultraviolet radiation to give people a tan Like the sun a tanning bed can also cause a sunburn if the person stays in too long There are many kinds of tanning beds but most look like the one in the photo

Tanning beds became popular in Europe and America because of the work of Friedrich Wolff around 1979 He patented his design and charged others to use his ideas His company Wolff Systems does not build the tanning beds they research and design for the tanning lamp Some of the early adopters of the Wolff technology include ETS Inc SCA Sun Industries Inc Montego Bay Sunal Later Friedrich sold Wolff Systems to his brother Jorg Wolff who was the founder of Cosmedico Ltd another pioneer in the tanning industry

Tanning beds use a special fluorescent lamps that creates visible light and ultraviolet light Like all fluorescent lights they use a ballast system to limit the electricity going to each lamp which is most often 100 watts per lamp The tanning beds use a special acrylic or clear shield over the lamps Most clear plastics will block ultraviolet but this special type of plastic lets most of the ultraviolet light pass through Most tanning beds also have a cooling fan system to cool the electronics inside the tanning bed and keep it from getting too hot All tanning beds have a timer a device to limit the amount of time the person is exposed to the ultraviolet light After a few minutes the timer makes the bed turn off

Like the sun tanning beds help your skin to produce vitamin D due to the exposure to the UV Both the sun and tanning beds can damage your skin if you stay exposed for too long Getting too much UV or many sunburns can cause skin cancer including melanoma which can be deadly There is a lot of controversy due to the risks Most countries have many laws and rules that regulate tanning beds

Bullet proof glass or bullet resistant glass is a type of strong clear material that resists bullets Complete protection against all weapons is not possible

It is usually made from two or more types of material one hard and one soft The softer layer makes the glass more elastic so it can flex instead of shatter There must be a clear view through the glass Bulletproof glass varies in thickness from three quarters of an inch to three inches

A popular method is stick a special plastic film to the the inner surface of ordinary glass This security laminate bonds to the glass with an adhesive This gives a protection similar to the multi layered bullet resistant glass Transparency is better tint free thickness and weight is reduced as much as 50 70 The laminate can be stuck on to existing windows this a called a retrofit

The plastic provides little bullet resistance Glass much harder than plastic flattens the bullet The plastic deforms absorbing energy and stopping the bullet The ability of the plastic layer to stop projectiles is directly proportional to its thickness Bulletproof glass may be up to three inches thick

All the parts of the glass must be transparent The essential components are these

The most usual method today requires three parts in layers

A simpler version is used for car windshields It consists of two panels of toughened glass bonded together with polyvinyl butyal The PVB stops cracks in the outer glass from spreading

The idea is for guards inside to be able to shoot out while attackers cant shoot in One way bulletproof glass is usually made of only two layers a brittle layer on the outside and a flexible one on the inside A bullet fired from the outside hits the brittle layer first shattering an area of it This absorbs some of the bullets kinetic energy and spreads it on a larger area When the slowed bullet hits the flexible layer it is stopped 

However when a bullet is fired from the inside it hits the flexible layer first The bullet penetrates the flexible layer because its energy is focused on a smaller area the brittle layer then shatters outward due to the flexing of the inner layer and does not significantly hinder the bullets progress A problem with this idea is that a two layer glass has limited stopping power

There is a new type of transparent armour with aluminium oxynitride instead of glass As the outside strike plate layer it is much lighter and performs better than traditional glasspolymer laminates Aluminum oxynitride glass can defeat 50 caliber armour piercing rounds Various types of other materials which closely resemble glass are also being developed

Certain types of ceramic can also be used for transparent armour They are denser and harder than traditional glass These new types of transparent ceramic armours make thinner armour with equal stopping power to traditional laminated glass

The political status of Kashmir region is the subject of a long running political dispute between Pakistan and the Republic of India since 1947 On October 20 1947 tribesmen backed by Pakistan invaded Kashmir The Maharaja of Jammu Kashmir initially fought back but on 27 October appealed for assistance to the Governor General Louis Mountbatten who agreed on the condition that the ruler accede to India Once the papers of accession to India were signed Indian soldiers entered Kashmir with orders to stop any further occupation but they were not allowed to expel anyone from the state India took the matter to the United Nations The UN resolution asked Pakistan to vacate the areas it has occupied and asked India to assist the UN Plebiscite Commission to organize a plebiscite to determine the will of the people Pakistan refused to vacate the occupied areas

Today Kashmir is split as follows

The status quo Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for more than 60 years Currently a boundary  the Line of Control  divides the region in two with one part military occupied by India and one administered by Pakistan India would like to formalise this status quo and make it the accepted international boundary But Pakistan and Kashmiri activists reject this plan because they both want greater control over the region

In 1947 8 India and Pakistan fought their first war over Jammu and Kashmir Under United Nations supervision they agreed to a ceasefire along a line which left one third of the state  comprising what Pakistan calls Azad Jammu and Kashmir and the Northern Areas administered by Pakistan and two thirds Jammu Ladakh and the Kashmir Valley controlled by India 

In 1972 under the terms of the Simla agreement the ceasefire line was renamed the Line of Control 

Although India claims that the entire state is part of India it has been prepared to accept the Line of Control as the international border with some possible modifications Both the US and the UK have also favoured turning the Line of Control into an internationally recognised frontier 

But Pakistan has consistently refused to accept the Line of Control as the border since the predominantly Muslim Kashmir Valley would remain as part of India Formalising the status quo also does not take account of the aspirations of those Kashmiris who have been fighting since 1989 for independence for the whole or part of the state

The AVR microcontroller architecture was developed by Atmel in 1996 It is based on the Harvard microcontroller architecture The AVR was one of the first microcontroller families to use on chip flash memory for program storage as opposed to one time programmable ROM EPROM or EEPROM used by other microcontrollers at the time

Many people think that AVR stands for Alf and Vegards Risc processor

This architecture replaces older MCS 51 architecture One machine cycle of MCS 51 takes 12 clock cycles and most of instructions are executed in one machine cycle

AVR microcontrollers can execute most of instructions in single machine cycle too but one machine cycle takes only one clock cycle Performance per clock cycle is 12 times higher with AVR

The core has 32 general purpose registers directly connected to ALU It allowing two independent registers to be accessed and instruction with them executed in one machine cycle

The Senedd also known as the National Assembly building houses the debating chamber and three committee rooms for the National Assembly for Wales in Cardiff The 5308 square meters Senedd building was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 1 March 2006 and the total cost was 696 million which included 497M in construction costs The Senedd is part of the National Assembly estate that includes T Hywel and the Pierhead Building  

After two selection processes the decision was taken that the debating chamber would be on a new site called Site 1E at Capital Waterside in Cardiff Bay The Pritzker Prize winning architect Richard Rogers won the international competition to design the building It was designed to be sustainable with use of renewable technologies and be energy efficient The building was awarded an Excellent certification by the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method the highest ever awarded in Wales and was nominated for the 2006 Stirling Prize 

The Senedd was constructed in two phases the first in 2001 and the second from August 2003 until it was handed over to the National Assembly in February 2006 Between phases the National Assembly changed contractors and the projects management structure but retained Rogers as the scheme architect The building was nearly six times over budget and four years and 10 months late compared to the original estimates of the project in 1997 Total costs rose due to unforeseen security measures after the September 11 attacks and because the National Assembly did not have an independent cost appraisal of the project until December 2000 three years after the original estimate Phase 2 costs rose by less than 6 over budget and that phase was six months late due to information and communication technology problems

Ultralight materials are very light substances They include silica aerogels carbon nanotube aerogels metallic foams polymeric foams and metallic microlattices The density of air is about 1275 mgcm3 which means that the air in the pores greatly lowers the density of the material

The lightest material ever made was invented in 2011 It is made out of a microscopic micro lattice of hollow tubes a criss cross diagonal pattern with open spaces between the tubes The researchers say the material is 100 times lighter than Styrofoam and is very strong The material is low density it has a density of 09 milligrams per cubic centimetre Silica aerogels the worlds lightest solid materials are only as low as 10 mg per cubic cm The metallic micro lattices are 9999 air and only 001 solid The metal used is nickel

The material is not just light it has some elastic properties When it is squashed the little tubes are also squashed but when the pressure is removed they rebound A sample squashed to half its height rebounds 98 when the pressure is lifted That makes the material similar in some ways to elastomers they are materials used to cushion against shock

Folie deux is the name for a condition where an otherwise sane person develops the symptoms and delusions of a person suffering from psychosis If more than two people share the symptoms or delusions people speak about folie trois folie quatre folie plusieurs or folie en famille Officially the condition is known as induced delusional disorder or shared psychotic disorder today but many publications still use the original terms which were developed in France in the 19th century Today there are two main forms of the condition

Newer studies seem to indicate that this classification may not be sufficient to fully describe folie deux There may be more symptoms than are usually described in the cases above Also in many cases separating the two patients may not be enough to make the condition go away in one of them Also the person described as sane before developing the folie deux may be already be suffering from a psychiatric illness or may develop one 

The condition was first described in an article pubilshed by Ernest Charles Lasgue and Jules Farlet in 1877

Mass hysteria can be seen as a form of folie deux

snRNP or snurps join with proteins to form spliceosomes The spiceosomes govern alternative splicing

The background to this is that in eukaryotes most genes code for a protein in separated strings of DNA This is because of a total gene coding bits are separated by non coding bits The process called alternative splicing can produce many possible proteins from the gene parts because the proteins are put together in different ways Alternative splicing produces alternative messenger RNAs and these produce different proteins Spliceosomes control the details of the splicing

The two essential components of snRNPs are protein molecules and RNA The RNA found within each snRNP particle is known as small nuclear RNA or snRNA and is usually about 150 nucleotides in length The snRNA component of the snurp is specific to individual introns because it recognises the sequences of critical signals at the ends and branch sites of introns The snRNA in snurps is similar to ribosomal RNA it acts both as an enzyme and builds structure

SnRNPs were discovered by Michael Lerner and Joan Steitz Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman also played a role in the discovery winning the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1989 for their independent discoveries that RNA can act as a catalyst in cell development

A Halkett boat is a type of lightweight inflatable boat The boat was first created by Lt Peter Halkett during the 1840s Halkett had been interested in the problems of travelling in the Canadian Arctic He wanted to make a boat that was light enough to be carried over bad terrain but strong enough to be used in very bad weather conditions

Halketts first design was a boat that was made using cloth combined with rubber This boat could be filled with air to float on water or the air could be removed so it would be smaller and lighter to carry When deflated the hull of the boat could be worn as a cloak The oar used as a walking stick and the sail could be used as an umbrella Next he created a two man boat that was small enough to fit into a knapsack When it was deflated It could be used as a waterproof blanket

Many people who explored Canada liked his ideas but they were not very useful to most other people He tried to show the Royal Navy that the boats could be useful to them but did not succeed He also could not sell them fishermen and people that hunted duck They were commercially unsuccessful Only two Halkett boats are still known to exist One belonged to Orcadian explorer John Rae The other is in the Hudsons Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum

Peter Halkett was a Lieutenant in the Royal Navy in the 1840s He was the son of John Halkett a director of the Hudsons Bay Company who had lived in Canada for many years before returning to England Peter Halkett was interested in the exploration of the Canadian Arctic for a long time He was very interested in John Franklins Coppermine Expedition of 18191822 This expedition had many problems 

Franklin explored the northern coast of Canada for three years He was looking for the Northwest Passage His search ended very badly It was said that people killed other members of the expedition and that some even ate the other people 11 of the 20 members of the group were killed The people that were not killed had to eat lichen their own boots and the remains of dead animals left by wolves They had become stranded on the wrong side of the Coppermine River after their boats had been destroyed in a storm John Richardson tried to swim to safety This caused him very bad hypothermia One person in the party built a small canoe from canvas and willow They had to cross the river one at a time using the canoe

Halkett was an amateur inventor During his spare time while in the navy he worked on building a boat that would be small and light enough to be carried through wilderness but strong enough to carry people in safety across wide bodies of water He chose to build a boat in which all parts could also be used as clothing or items that the user would normally carry with them

Halkett made a waterproof cloak It was created from an early form of Macintosh cloth This cloth was made of cotton combined with India rubber The inside of the cloak was an airtight and watertight inflatable ovoid It was made of four different airtight sections If one section was damaged and could not hold air the others would still keep the boat floating The cloak had a pocket that held a paddle blade and a small bellows The person wearing the cloak would carry a walking stick This stick was also used as the handle for the paddle There was also a large umbrella which was used as a sail for the boat The cloak weighed about convert712lb It took three to four minutes to inflate the boat Once the boat was inflated it could carry six to eight people

In early 1844 Halkett tested the first boat cloak on the River Thames He paddled it convert15km without taking on any water In November 1844 Halkett wanted to test the boat cloak in bad weather conditions The seas of the Bay of Biscay were usually very bad but the weather was unusually calm when he got there The boat cloak was very well liked by explorers John Richardson wrote that Had we been possessed of such a contrivance in our first expedition I have little doubt of our having brought the whole party in safely

Because of how well the boat cloak did during his tests Halkett built a larger version This boat could be folted into a knapsack When inflated it could carry two men Each man would use a paddle on each side of the boat When deflated the boat could be used as a waterproof blanket This would allow the users to sleep on wet ground The people in charge of the Royal Navy though the boat could be useful to some people but was not likely to be useful to the Navy On 8 May 1845 Lord Herbert First Secretary to the Admiralty wrote to Halkett that My Lords are of an opinion that your invention is extremely clever and ingenious and that it might be useful in Exploring and Surveying Expeditions but they do not consider that it would be made applicable for general purposes in the Naval Service

Although the Navy saw no use for Halketts boats in general naval service this larger boat was liked very much by explorers John Franklin bought one to take on the 1845 expedition This expedition ended badly All 129 men and their two ships wee lost and never found Franklin believed that Halkett boats were very needed to travel in Canada He gave the boat that was to be used for his expedition to Sir George Simpson Governor in Chief of Ruperts Land so that Simpson could use in his travels in the region He got another boat from Halkett to be used on his last expedition

Orkneyman John Rae known by the Inuit as was a Hudsons Bay Company surgeon He became a surveyor of the Canadian Arctic Unlike most Europeans of that time Rae believed that the local people knew the best ways to deal with the very bad weather conditions He travelled Inuit style using sledges and snowshoes He slept in snow igloos Rae took a Halkett boat on his first expedition in 1846 He said that it was most useful in crossing and recrossing the river at Repulse Bay He also said that although in constant use for upwards of six weeks on a rocky coast it never required the slightest repair and ought to form part of the equipment of every expedition

In 188 the Royal navy sent out people to find out what had become of the ships and men of Franklins expedition The search party was led by John Richardson and John Rae They were equipped with a Halkett boat bought by the government The party did not find Franklin but they learned that the Halkett boat very useful During the search they used the single boat to move their entire party across a river in 14 trips Rae said that that although the rubber of the boat became stiff from the cold it was not hard to warm it to soften the material when needed Halkett boats were also taken on 6 other expedition that were sent to look for Franklin During these they were used for fishing

In 1851 French explorer Joseph Ren Bellot led another expedition to find Franklin This was paid for by Franklins wife Bellot took a Halkett boat cloak on the journey He said that it was of immense value in a country where the want of wood renders it impossible to form any sort of raft Bellots expedition did not find Franklin It was not until 1853 that an expedition led by Rae found a group of Inuit who told them that they saw men dragging a boat four years earlier Their bodies were found soon after that

Even though the boats were said to be very good for lake fishing and duck shooting and were shown in the Great Exhibition of 1851 they did not sell well Halketts boat were not widely used except in the field of Canadian exploration Halkett died on 23 March 1885 aged 65 and the building of his boats stopped John Rae gave his boat from the 1853 expedition to a Miss Peace of Kirkwall Many years later it was found and is now in the Stromness Museum at Orkney A second boat is in the Hudsons Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum

After stylus pucks are the most commonly used tablet accessory A puck is a mouse like device that can detect its absolute position and rotation Professional pucks often have loupe for greater precision

These make use of electromagnetic induction technology The tablet generates an electromagnetic signal which is received by the circuit in the stylus The wires in the tablet then change to a receiving mode and read the signal generated by the stylus

Stylus use self powered electronics that generate and transmit a signal to the tablet Tablets may listen for pen signals constantly so it eliminate inaccuracy of transmission

Optical tablets operate by a very small digital camera in the stylus

These were early models A small sound generator was mounted in the stylus and the acoustic signal picked up by two microphones placed near the writing surface

Electromagnetic tablets work by generating and detecting an electromagnetic signal

Since stylus can sense a pressure tilts and other attributes its great for computer graphic usage These attributes can make differences between brush size opacity shape color etc in certain graphic programs
