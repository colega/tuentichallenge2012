A ticket of leave was an important document given to convicts who had been sent to Australia Convicts who were well behaved were given a ticket of leave This gave them some rights and they did not have to stay in gaol With a ticket of leave a convict was able to look for work in a particular area but could not leave the area without permission from a court Every change of employer or district was written on the ticket 

Governor Philip Gidley King started the tickets of leave in 1801 It gave prisoners a reason to behave themselves Also it helped to provide cheap workers for farmers who were settling in Australia The government saved money as it did not have to feed and clothe the prisoners 

Those with a ticket of leave were able to marry or to bring their families from Britain They could buy land but not carry guns or get onto a ship They were often made to pay back the cost of their travel in the prison ship to Australia The ticket of leave had to be renewed every year and those with one had to attend broken wikt linkmustermuster and church services Prisoners could lose their ticket and be sent back to prison if they were lazy if they tried to get paid too much or if they were rude to the police or soldiers Sometimes prisoners who helped the government by capturing escaped convicts for example might be given a ticket of leave as a reward

A convict who kept to the conditions of his ticket of leave was given a conditional pardon after half of the time he was supposed to be in gaol Then they were no longer a convict and could do everything except leave the colony Convicts who did not keep to the conditions of their ticket could be arrested without warning go to court without being able to appeal and lose all their property 

The ticket itself was a highly detailed document It listed the convicts number the name the ship in which sent to Australia the year that they arrived the captain of the ship where they came from their job the crimesthe place and date of trial the sentence the birth date what they looked like the area the prisoner was allowed to live in the court that gave out the ticket the date the ticket was given any other conditions of the ticket and any changes of where they lived A lot of this information has been kept which makes them a very important source of information for people looking at family history

If an anal fissure has become chronic and wont go away medical surgery can be a solution The circular muscle of the anus can be cut or stretched Also an injection with botox can have a positive result

The anal fissure can burst open very easily up to 3 months after healing for example during defecation The patient can do several things to reduce the chance that the fissure will return The advice includes the following tips

As long as the fissure is open the patient can put an ointment with zinc oxide and pramocane on and around the fissure Use toilet paper or tissue paper to spread out the ointment and wash hands afterward with soap This treatment has to be continued for several weeks to reduce the chance that the fissure will open again

Besides it is very important to have a good digestion and defecation The longer the faeces is in the intestine the more liquid will be withdrawal Because of this the faeces will become harder and get more volume and that gives more chance that the skin around the anus will crack again Patients are advized to eat fibres every day to eat the recommended amount of vegetables and fruit every day to use a little bit of butter or oil every day to drink enough during the day and to exercise every day The patient needs to avoid food that can cause constipation If necessary one can take enzymes as food supplement with every meal that includes bread

Patients should not postpone going to the toilet While waiting the faeces will push on the circular muscle of the anus which causes a pressure Besides the faeces can become harder and get more volume after a while When the patient feels the urge to go to the toilet the best thing is to go immediately While sitting on the toilet the patient has to press as little as possible but instead relax the circular muscle

As long as the wound is not healed taking a daily bath with soda can give relief Further more that will keep the wound clean

Its very important that the skin around the anus is completely dry before the patients gets dressed The slightest moisture in the folding of the skin can be the reason that the skin will get damaged easily

Some patients benefit by putting simple oil around the anus For example olive oil or sunflower oil The skin softens and wont tear or crack as easily Always remind hygiene

If the tips that are mentioned above do not help enough and the fissure continues to crack open the cause could be the use of toilet paper after defecation The paper rubs too strong over the skin and causes the wound to open again An easy solution to solve this problem is the use of baby ointment that is used for a babys red bottom Put this using toilet paper or tissue paper before defecation around the anus The skin will be more protected by wiping the anus and the fissure wont open again so easily If necessary the baby ointment can be applied again afterward Furthermore one can try to use another brand of softer toilet paper

By following all mentioned tips and advice always follow the normal principles of hygiene Use toilet paper or tissue paper and wash the hands afterward

These recommendations only make sense if the patient is sure that the problem is an anal fissure If there is any doubt especially when there is blood in the faeces please consult a doctor

The Philippines has varied university grading systems Most universities particularly public institutions follow the grade point system scale of 500  100 in which 100 is the highest grade and 500 is the lowest possible grade

Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila also employ a specific grading category for retention This system uses the General Weighted Average per semester as a basis whether or not a particular student shall be retained at the course or college he or she is enrolled to Some colleges have higher GWA requirement for retention but most of them demands a GWA of at least 250 per semester A few graduate schools on the other hand employ the Pass or Fail system

Notable exceptions include De La Salle University FEU East Asia College which follow the 1000  4000 grading system which patterns those of American universities This system uses the 40 grade point equivalence as the highest grade while 00 grade point equivalence is considered the lowest possible grade 00 grade point equivalence is considered a failing mark

Other universities such as the Ateneo de Manila University and its sister schools use the letter grade system with varied grade equivalence range

More importantly Philippine universities do not have standard grade equivalence Different universities have varied equivalence range while passing grades are subject to imposed academic quality of an institution

De La Salle University is a private Roman Catholic university in Manila Philippines

The General Weighted Average is the average of grades in all subjects taken whether passed or failed It is the result of combining the performance rating based on the screening criteria or subject It serves as the indicator of a students academic performance in a given semester or school year

Hello is there some message for welcoming editors who do not speak English or speak only a little English I recently left a message with one editor and I think in my haste I may have sounded rude I think people should use mostly English here to facilitate communication but I dont want to convey the impression that other languages are looked down upon Because this is Simple English Wikipedia we should be especially understanding of people who dont speak English well Thank you LovesMacs 1544 7 March 2009

Ive been wondering how we can encourage the adding of citations from WPRS for proper WPV in pages Ive been wandering around the current pages and the vast majority of them are either entirely unsourced or vastly undersourced As an encyclopedia this makes us practically unusable as a proper learning resource As a doctor Id be struck off the register in no time if I relied on information that had no source backing it up Many universities have out right banned Wikipedia from being used by students as a source and thats the enWP What does the community think we can do to improve the situation Cheers fr33kman talk 2206 9 March 2009

What would people think of starting an image of the week It could help hook readers into reading articles in a similar way to DYK I think that there is room on the front page if we moved things around a bit Itd be a bit like commons featured images but itd just be the one per week I think thatd cut down on overhead Thoughts fr33kman talk 1542 10 March 2009

Im sorry to say this but this project has some real issues Ive just gone over the Knowledge groups on the Main page and almost all of the links contained therein have no references to back up the information contained in them We can not call ourselves an encyclopedia if we cant back up what we say Without sources were not much better than a blog I think we need to join together as a community and fix the problems with citations in this project I propose that we start a focus group that contains all editors and that we have a blitz that firstly fixes all the links in Knowledge groups and then decides the focus that the community should have No offence to anyone but page after page of stubs on rivers asteroids little non notable towns and many other subjects are not going to keep us alive as a project We have to focus on literature science medicine social science geography history and other subjects our readers really need As it stands at the moment we are not usable as a knowledge resource to anyone Ive not done the research but Id guess that less than 10 of our pages are properly sourced and that makes us next to useless as a reliable resource We have to fix this 

I hate to be so blunt but we need to fix this site and deep down I think we all know this

Comments fr33kman talk 0551 12 March 2009 Well I never even thought about blocking users for not adding citations I believe in engendering cooperation rather than coercing users with threats I fully believe that every active editor here wants nothing but the best for this project Id only ask them to put their money where their mouth is and prove it by making a reliable encyclopedia rather than just one with lots of pages With regards to stubs so what If it is a fact then it can be sourced The current rules allow an editor to remove anything that is unsourced This goes regardless of length of article or who inserted the fact Finding sources and citing them is a practice thing The more you do it the easier it becomes I think Im personally pretty good at it Some of this is down to my profession and the fact that I cant do squat without proof of why it would help my patients The same should hold true here WE say we are here for schools but we cant offer them a reliable project because we dont verify our facts we just insert them fr33kman talk 1106 12 March 2009

Guilmant did not just play the organ for church services He became very famous for giving organ recitals Often he played on organs which had been constructed by the brilliant organ builder Aristide Cavaill Coll He helped to make these organs popular in France and they were a very important influence on the way that organists composed music for their instrument 

Both Guilmant and Widor produced large works for the organ which they called symphonies These usually had at least four movements each and gave the player opportunities to use many different sound effects 

Guilmant wrote eight organ symphonies as well as a symphony for organ and orchestra and several shorter works for the same combination He composed a great many miniatures not just for organ but also for harmonium This was useful for musicians in smaller churches which had a harmonium instead of a big organ He wrote a book on how to play the organ and for many years he edited collections of organ music which had been written by earlier composers

The Battle of Gettysburg was fought July 13 1863 The battle took place in and around the town of Gettysburg Pennsylvania It was the battle with the largest number of casualties in the American Civil War Gettysburg is often called the wars turning point Union Major General George Gordon Meades Army of the Potomac stopped attacks by Confederate General Robert E Lees Army of Northern Virginia This ended Lees invasion of the North

Lees army won an important battle at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863 He then led his army through the Shenandoah Valley His plan was to start his second invasion of the North Lee hoped to change the area of the summer from northern Virginia He hoped to force Northern politicians to give up the war by going as far as Harrisburg Pennsylvania or even Philadelphia President Abraham Lincoln told Maj Gen Joseph Hooker to have the Union army follow Lees army Lincoln took Hookers job away three days before the Battle of Gettysburg Gen Meade replaced Hooker

Parts of the two armies first fought at Gettysburg on July 1 1863 Lee quickly moved much of his army there He hoped to fight the Union army and destroy it Union Brig Gen John Buford defended low ridges in the northwest of town at first Two corps of Union infantry came to defend this area as well However two large Confederate corps attacked them from the northwest and north This broke apart the weaker Union lines The defenders retreating through the streets of town to the hills just to the south

On the second day of battle most of both armies had arrived The Union line was put in a defensive formation that looked like a fishhook In the late afternoon of July 2 Lee started a heavy attack on the Union left side Fights were held at Little Round Top the Wheatfield Devils Den and the Peach Orchard On the Union right demonstrations became big attacks on Culps Hill and Cemetery Hill All across the battlefield the Union defenders held their lines but lost a lot of soldiers

On the third day of battle July 3 fighting took place on Culps Hill Cavalry battles occurred to the east and south The main part of the battle was an infantry assault by 12500 Confederates against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge This attack is known as Picketts Charge The charge was stopped by Union rifle and artillery fire Many Confederate soldiers died in this attack Lee led his army on a tough retreat back to Virginia Between 46000 and 51000 soldiers from both armies were casualties in the three day battle That November a cemetery for the dead Union soldiers was opened at the Gettysburg National Cemetery President Lincoln spoke the Gettysburg Address at the ceremony to open the cemetery and honor the dead soldiers

Confederate infantry attacked the Union cavalry commanded by John Buford around 530 am on Herr Ridge Buford would run back to McPherson Ridge and Seminary Ridge as the Confederate forces marched in more men Buford would get more men later in the day and would be allowed to leave with his division Buford slowed down the Confederate attack long enough for Union forces to set up a defense on Cemetery Ridge That night Confederate General Richard Ewell was given orders to take Culps Hill if possible Ewell was too careful and decided not to take the hill The Union took the hill and set up defense This was the first major mistake of the battle for South The Army of the Potomac would end the day with around 21900 men on Culps Hill and Cemetery Ridge The Army of Northern Virginia would have around 27000 men from Benners Hill to Seminary Ridge

Both armies got more men over the night to begin the second day of action General James Longstreet commander of the I Corp of the Army of Northern Virginia set his troops on the right of the Confederate line Around 4 pm his forces attacked the Union left Earlier in the day Major General Daniel Sickles commander of the III Corp of the Army of the Potomac moved his Corp forward to the Peach Orchard without orders to do so When attacked in this position they were killed Sickles fell back to the Wheatfield Meade quickly rushed 20000 men to his left to aid Sickles and fight off Longstreet Meades men would take up position in Devils Den They would fall back and run the Union left on Cemetery Hill to Little Round Top The Confederate forces drove back the Union left but were unable to break it They would have to fall back They formed the Confederate right and ran the line from Seminary Ridge to Devils Den At 7 pm Ewell attacked Union forces commanded by General Henry Slocum on Culps Hill on the Union right Ewell was forced to fall back because Union forces were too strong

The night of July 2 Longstreets largest division commanded by General George Pickett arrived and was placed in the center of the Confederate line Lees plan was to attack on both the Union right and left as the day before Around 4 am fighting broke out on the Union right as Slocum attacked Ewells forces that had taken some ground on Culps Hill the day before This fighting ended around 11 am with no winner This changed Lees plans Now he was going to attack the union center with cannons and move across three quarters of a mile across open ground He would use three divisions General George Pickett General Isaac Trimble and General James Pettigrew The three divisions amounted to around 13000 men At 1 pm around 170 Confederate cannons opened fire After two hours the attack began Confederate forces broke the Union center commanded By General Winfield Hancock for a just a moment at The Angle This was the closest the Confederacy ever got to winning the war This point of the battle is called the High Water Mark for this reason Hancock would get more men and drive back the attack Picketts division was killed At the end of the battle Lee ordered Pickett to gather his division and get ready to fight against a Union attack Pickett said General Lee I have no division Lee knew he was defeated and took his men back to Virginia on July 4

Both the Confederate and Union forces had more than 23000 casualties apiece The battle took more American lives than any other battle in United States history Gettysburg is still the largest battle to ever be fought on American soil The Union victory over the Confederacy ended Lees invasion of the north Lee would never try to invade the Union again The Army of Northern Virginia would never get their strength back Lee never had more than 51000 men the rest of the war Numbers from the Union forces wore down Lee and his army This is why Gettysburg is said to be the turning point of the American Civil War

A planetary nebula is a nebula that is made up of gas and plasma They are made by certain types of stars when they die They are named this because they look like planets through small optical telescopes They do not last for very long compared to a star only tens of thousands of years

At the end of a normal sized stars life in the red giant phase the outside layers of a star are disposed of Because the outside is gone the star shines brightly and is very hot The ultraviolet radiation given off by the center of the star ionizes the gas and plasma that was thrown out from the star This is what causes a planetary nebula to look like it does

Planetary nebulae are very special objects because they can help make more stars When a star dies the metals that were in the core of the star are sent to other places in the universe The only place that these metals form are in stars This is called nucleosynthesis

The pictures of these nebulae show that they have very weird shapes Scientists are not sure why they are not all spheres There are many theories about why they are not They think that binary stars stellar winds and magnetic fields might be part of the reason they look so special

Planetary nebulae are not very bright None of them are bright enough to see without a telescope The first one discovered was the Dumbbell Nebula To early astronomers they looked like gas giants This is why people called them planetary nebula We still call them this even though we know they are not planets

Astronomers did not know what these objects were until the first spectroscopic experiments were done in the 1800s William Huggins used a prism to look at galaxies He noticed that they looked a lot like stars

When he looked at the Cats Eye Nebula it did not look the same He saw an emission line at a place that no one had seen before This meant that it looked like an element that no one had ever seen before Scientists thought it might be a new element They decided to call it nebulium

Later physicists showed that it is possible for gasses with a very low density to look like something else It turned out that the gas they were looking at was oxygen and not nebulium

The stars in planetary nebulae are very hot They are not very bright though This means that they must be very small The only time that stars get that small is when they are dying That means that they are one of the last steps in a stars death Astronomers saw that all planetary nebulae are expanding This meant that they were caused by a stars outer layers being thrown into space at the end of its life

Stars weighing more than 8 solar masses will supernova Stars that weigh as much as the Sun will become planetary nebulae After billions of years a star will run out of hydrogen This makes the star colder and makes the core smaller The suns core is about 15 million degrees Kelvin When it runs out of hydrogen the smaller core will cause it to rise to about 100 million degrees Kelvin

The outer layers of the star grow a lot because of the heat of the core and become much cooler The star becomes a red giant The core gets even smaller and hotter When its reaches 100 million K helium begins to fuse into carbon and oxygen When this happens the core stops shrinking Helium burning soon forms a core of carbon and oxygen with both a helium and a hydrogen shell surrounding it 

Because helium in fusion reactions is not very stable the core starts to grow and shrink very quickly This causes the gas and plasma in the outer layer of the star to move outwards These gases form a cloud around the core of the star As more and more of the gas moves away from the star deeper and deeper layers at higher and higher temperatures are sent out When the gas heats up to around 30000 degrees kelvin the gas starts to glow The cloud has then become a planetary nebula

We now know of about 3000 of these nebulae in our galaxy compared to 200 billion stars Their very short lifetime compared to a star is why there are not that many compared to stars They are found mostly in the plane of the Milky Way and there are more and more the closer you get to the center of the Milky Way

Only about twenty percent of planetary nebulae are spheres The rest of them have very weird shapes The reason for all of these shapes is not understood but it may be because of gravity with secondary stars if it is a binary star system A second theory is that planets near the star might change how the nebula forms A third theory is that magnetic fields cause the shapes 

A big problem in studying planetary nebulae is that astronomers can not always figure out how far away they are When they are close astronomers use something called expansion parallax to figure out how far away they are but this takes a long timeIf they are not close there is not a good way to figure out how far away they are yet

An emission nebula is a cloud of plasma emitting light in many colors The glowing is caused by a star being near the nebula There are many types of emission nebula H II regions are caused when stars are forming and are very hot causing the plasma to heat up Planetary nebulae are made when where a dying star has thrown off its outer layers This causes the core of the star to heat up the plasma

A nebulas color depends on what chemicals are in it and how ionized it is Because most of the universe is made of hydrogen many emission nebulae appear red Hydrogen glows red when it is hot If the nebula is very hot other types of gas will be heated and the it might also glow blue and green By looking at which colors are glowing in a nebula one can figure out what it is made of

Emission nebulae sometimes look like they have dark areas in them This is because clouds of dust block the light when it is traveling between the nebula and the Earth 

In astronomy reflection nebulae are clouds of dust which reflect light of a star or many stars The light from the nearby star or stars is not hot enough to ionize the gas of the nebula to make an emission nebula but is enough to make the dust visible because the light reflects off of the dust 

Reflection nebulae are usually blue because the scattering works better for blue light than red

Reflection nebulae and emission nebulae are usually seen together and sometimes are called diffuse nebulae A good example of this is the Orion Nebula

Reflection nebulae may also be the site of star formation

A Variable nebula is a reflection nebula that gets brighter and darker because of changes in its star

Ionization is the physical process of giving or taking away electrons from an atom

Nucleosynthesis is the physical process where lighter elements are changed into heavier elements This usually happens in the center of a star It is also thought that this happened at the beginning of the universe in the big bang

Stellar wind is gas being thrown off from the upper atmosphere of a star Different types of stars have different types of stellar winds

The Dumbbell Nebula is a planetary nebula in the constellation Vulpecula It is about 1360 light years away from earth The Dumbbell Nebula was the first planetary nebula to be discovered by Charles Messier in 1764 

Charles Messier was a French astronomer who is remembered for publishing a list of famous objects in space that came to be called the 103 Messier objects

Messier was born in Badonviller in the Lorraine region of France Six of his brothers and sisters died as children and in 1741 his father died Charles became interested in astronomy after he saw the great six tailed comet in 1744 and by a solar eclipse on July 25 1748

In 1751 he started working for Joseph Nicolas Delisle the astronomer of the French Navy who told him to write down everything he saw 

Messier discovered thirteen comets 

Astronomical spectroscopy is the science of using spectroscopy to figure out what astronomical objects such as stars planets and nebulae are made of It can also be used to figure out how those objects are moving using doppler shift

Sir William Huggins KCB OM FRS was an English astronomer best known for his work in astronomical spectroscopy 

William Huggins was born at Cornhill Middlesex in 1824 He married Margaret Lindsay who was also an astronomer Huggins built his own observatory from where he and his wife looked at spectral emission lines and absorption lines of astronomical objects He was the first person to figure out the difference between nebulae and galaxies Huggins was president of the Royal Society between 1900 and 1905 

The emission spectrum of an element or compound is how bright certain frequencies are when energy is added to the atoms or molecules

Each atoms emission spectrum is special and can be used to figure out if that atom is part of a compound

Luminosity is a measurement of how bright something is

In astronomy the interstellar medium is the mix of plasma gas and dust in outer space between the stars of a galaxy It is made mostly of ions atoms molecules cosmic dust and cosmic rays

Myopia also called near or short sightedness is a problem with the focusing ability of the eye It is when the eye is not able to focus properly on objects in the distance This condition is very common and it often occurs with many members of the same family It happens when the cornea becomes a different shape from normal or when the eye is longer than normal and so causes light entering the eye to focus on a point within the eye before the retina This causes the eye and brain to see the image of the distant object as a blurred image People with myopia often squint while watching television or trying to see distant objects Myopia can often be the first symptom of Type II Diabetes 

It can be corrected by using glasses contact lenses or surgery Myopia can also be corrected by practicing looking at distant objects

Lustre is a description of the way light interacts with the surface of a crystal rock or mineral For example a diamond has an adamantine lustre and pyrite has a metallic lustre The term is also used to describe other items with some kind of sheen

The word lustre comes from the Latin word lux meaning light and generally implies radiance gloss or brilliance

Carbonation is the process of carbon dioxide dissolving in a liquid For example carbon dioxide is added to flavored water under pressure to make it fizz as a carbonated soft drink

When rain passes through the atmosphere it takes in or mixes with carbon dioxide turning it into a weak carbonic acid When the rain falls in limestone it dissolves the calcium carbonate in the rock turning it into calcium bicarbonate This basically dissolves the rock Holes and large cracks can form in the rock which are called grikes or in German kruftkarren The limestone that is left is called clint In a large karst area which is a large area of limestone there are a lot of big grikes If a stream or river passes through it it could be swallowed up by a hole called a swallow hole It can go through a series of underground caves and may appear on the surface again An example of a karst area is the Burren in County Clare Ireland

Carbonation also describes the incorporation of carbon dioxide into chemical compounds Carbon based life originates from a carbonation reaction that is most often catalysed by the enzyme RuBisCO This carbonation process is so important that a significant fraction of leaf mass consists of this carbonating enzyme

A Feynman diagram is a diagram which shows what happens when elementary particles collide 

Feynman diagrams are used in quantum mechanics A Feynman diagram has lines in different shapesstraight dotted and squigglywhich meet up at points called vertices The vertices are where the lines begin and end The points in Feynman diagrams where the lines meet represent two or more particles that happen to be at the same point in space at the same time The lines in a Feynman diagram represent the probability amplitude for a particle to go from one place to another

In Feynman diagrams the particles are allowed to go both forward and backward in time When a particle is going backward in time its called an antiparticle The meeting points for the lines can also be interpreted forward or backwards in time so that if a particle disappears into a meeting point that means that the particle was either created or destroyed depending on the direction in time that the particle came in from

All the lines and vertices have an amplitude When you multiply the probability amplitude for the lines the amplitude for the particles to go from wherever they start to wherever they meet and to the next meeting point and so on and also multiply by the amplitude for each meeting point you get a number that tells you the total amplitude for the particles to do what the diagram says they do If you add up all these probability amplitudes over all the possible meeting points and over all the starting and ending points with an appropriate weight you get the total probability amplitude for a collision in a particle accelerator which tells you the total probability of these particles to bounce off one another in any particular direction

Feynman diagrams are named after Richard Feynman who won the Nobel Prize in Physics His diagrams are very simple in the case of quantum electrodynamics where there are only two kinds of particles electrons and photons In QED the only thing that can happen is that an electron can emit a photon so there is only one building block for any collision The probability amplitude for the emission is very simpleit has no real part and the imaginary part is the charge of the electron

Raymond VII of Saint Gilles was Count of Toulouse Duke of Narbonne and Marquis of Provence from 1222 until his death

He was the son of Raymond VI of Toulouse and Joan of England During the Albigensian Crusade in May of 1216 he set out from Marseille and besieged Beaucaire which he captured on August 24 He fought to get the county of Toulouse back from Simon de Montfort 5th Earl of Leicester and later Simons son Amaury VI of Montfort

When Raymond died Alphonse became count of Toulouse and after Alphonses death the county was captured by France Raymond VII was buried beside his mother Joan in Fontevrault Abbey

A rival is a person or group of people who are trying to do the same thing as someone else and trying to do it better They are competing against one another Usually they are about equally good

Competing in this way is called rivalry

Two businesses may be rivals For example they may be selling ice creams in the same area

Brothers and sisters may be rivals For example they may both be trying to get their mothers attention

Countries may be rivals For example they may be trying to have power over the same thing This can be a dangerous thing which in some cases can lead to war

In sport two teams may be rivals This is a more friendly kind of rivalry

Bon Scott was an Australian singer and songwriter He was the lead singer of hard rock band ACDC from 1974 until he died of alcohol poisoning in 1980 

Scott was born Kirriemuir Scotland He and his family moved to Fremantle Australia in 1952 He left school when he was 15 and spent a short time in a juvenile institution In 1964 he formed a band called The Spektors They later became a different band called The Valentines When the Valentines broke up in 1970 Scott joined a band called Fraternity Fraternity left Australia and went to Europe but came back soon after Scott then joined a band called the Mount Lofty Rangers In 1974 he had a motorcycle accident and was in hospital for a few months After he left hospital he joined ACDC 

ACDCs first two albums were High Voltage and TNT They were only released in Australia Their first worldwide album was released in 1976 It had songs from both High Voltage and TNT and was also called High Voltage They released another album that year called Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap Their next albums were Let There Be Rock Powerage and a live album called If You Want Blood Youve Got It ACDCs last album with Scott as their singer was Highway to Hell

Scott died of alcohol poisoning on 19 February 1980 He was 33 years old at the time Brian Johnson became ACDCs new lead singer There is a bronze statue of Bon Scott in Fremantle

The Hubble Deep Field sometimes called the HDF is an image of a small part of the night sky in the constellation Ursa Major that was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995 

It is important because it shows some of the farthest away galaxies ever seen over 3000 in total

The area of the sky the HDF was taken in makes up less than 110th the width of a full Moon yet it contains over 3000 galaxies 

Because of the time it takes for light from these galaxies to reach Earth some in the picture look the exactly as they did over 10 billion years ago Because of this it allows scientists to look at what the Universe was like at that time and how it changed to become what it is now Add to this the cosmological principle which suggests that on large scales the Universe is roughly the same no matter what direction you look and the HDF becomes a very important tool for astronomers studying how the Universe has changed 

For these reasons the HDF is sometimes called the most important image ever taken

Interlingue or occidental is a constructed language created by Edgar von Wahl one of the first esperantists Von Wahl was born in the family of German language living in the Russian Empire He had good reasons to be one of the persons who spoke esperanto first and his advices were followed by Zamenhof Without detailed university education he had natural ability in languages 

Officer of the navy made a choice for the tsarists in the Revolution of 1917 After the complete victory of the Soviets he escaped to France changing his surname for de Wahl 

Not satisfied with Esperanto he decided to create his own project that he would call occidental It publishes in 1922 his project of language He invented de Wahls rule He succeeded in gathering a small group of followers that would follow preparing the magazine Cosmoglotta for printing until the years 1950 

In 1947 he decided to change the name of the language for interlingue In spite of that the association did not go back to give living signals until the decade of the years 1990 through Internet 

In cryptography a commitment scheme is a way for a someone to tell something to someone without letting other people know Someone would do this to make sure they can prove who they are or make sure that someone does not cheat The way it is usually done is by using a one way function to change a string into a hash This is called the commit phase Afterward if someone needs to prove that they were the one who made the commitment then they can tell people the original string they used This is called the reveal phase

In cryptography a one way function is a function that is very simple to compute in one direction There is a series of instructions that can be simply and easily applied to an input to give a complicated output However the reverse of going from the output to the input is made to be as difficult as possible

The SHA hash functions are cryptographic hash functions made by the National Security Agency and the NIST SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm The three SHA algorithms are different and are called SHA 0 SHA 1 and SHA 2 SHA 2 uses one algorithm with different sized digests The number of bits in the digest are put after SHA in their names like SHA 224 SHA 256 SHA 384 and SHA 512

Hurricane Floyd was the strongest costliest and deadliest hurricane of the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season Floyd at first looked as if it were headed for Florida as a category 4 hurricane It was about twice as large as Hurricane Andrew which if Floyd struck Florida it could have caused even more damage than Andrew Instead of striking Florida Floyd struck North Carolina and caused flooding from North Carolina up to some states in New England Floyd left 45 billion in damage from Florida to Maine Floyd also killed about 76 86 people in the United States One person was also killed in the Bahamas

The name Floyd got retired in the Spring of 2000 The name Franklin was used in 2005 instead

Hurricane Lenny was the last major hurricane hurricane named storm and depression of the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season There are three main reasons to remember Lenny One it was strongest November Atlantic hurricane two the damage it caused in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and three it moved the opposite way storms usually moved across the Caribbean Sea Some people at the National Hurricane Center nicknamed it Wrong Way Lenny Lenny left 330 million in damage this amount is likely not all the damage This is because it was reported for US territories only such as Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands

Because the damage was high and likely higher the name Lenny was retired In 2005 the name Lee was used instead The name Lee in 2005 was not retired so Lee is on the list for 2011

The 1980 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 1980 and ended on November 30 1980 This season had about average activity with 15 storms of which 11 got named This season featured the very powerful Hurricane Allen

Dracaena sanderiana known as Ribbon Dracaena Lucky Bamboo Belgian Evergreen or sometimes Ribbon Plant is a species of Dracaena It is native to Cameroon in tropical west Africa It is one of a group of small shrubby species with slender stems and flexible strap shaped leaves that grow as understory plants in rainforests It is an upright shrub growing to 15 m tall Its leaves are 15 25 cm long and 15 4 cm broad at the base It is marketed in the developed world as a Chinese decorative plant Lucky Bamboo This name is bad though as the plant is neither related to bamboo nor native to Asia It is propagated from short cuttings usually in water

Dracaena sanderiana and related species are popular houseplants There are many cultivars The plant can survive in many indoor conditions but indirect lighting is best as direct sunlight can cause the leaves to turn yellow and burn

Although it grows better in soil it often is sold with the roots in water The water should be completely changed every two weeks The water should be bottled water soft tap water with very little fluoride or even water from a filtered established aquarium It does best in bright indirect lighting and temperatures between 15 C and 25 C

Often in large chain pet shops it will be sold in black slitted pots rooted in rockwool submerged stating it is an aquatic plant While it will live for months like this it will eventually rot unless the sprouts are allowed to grow above the surface

Yellow or brown leaf edges may be caused by too much direct light crowded roots or fluoridated or chlorinated water The problem with water can be prevented by leaving tap water exposed to the air for a day before plant use Salty or softened water can also cause this

Twisted shapes can be produced by rotating the plant with respect to gravity and directed light sources This is difficult to achieve for most home users but not impossible with a lot of spare time and a lot of patience

In mathematics particularly number theory a probable prime is a whole number that is likely to be prime by having passed a probabilistic test such as Fermats primality test Probable primes may be composite but the tests are designed so they are really unlikely to be composite These probabilistic tests are easier to do than tests that actually guarantee primality and the composite probable primes are useful too in encryption that uses prime numbers

The Orbitron is a custom car built by Ed Roth It was lost for many years until it was found again in Mexico in 2007 

Built in 1964 the car ran with a 1955 or 1956 Chevrolet V8 and a Powerglide automatic transmission The body was made by hand out of fiberglass The driver sat in a cockpit set all the way to the back of the car This was where racing drivers sat when they drove a drag racing car It was lined with a funny looking material called fake fur and it even had an 11 General Electric portable television in the console On top of the cockpit was a top made of heavy clear plastic A top like this is called a bubble top since it looks like half of a soap bubble sitting on top of the driver  It raised up by itself with the push of a doorbell button on top of the hood The hood raised by itself as well when a different button was pushed

Roth built the frame himself out of box shaped steel tubing The engine came from one of his 1955 Chevrolets He removed it so that he could put in a newer larger V8 engine given to him by General Motors The Orbitron was one of the very few cars which MRoth thought was a mistake after he built it He was very proud of the shiny chrome work he did to the engines and frames of his cars the Orbitrons engine and frame were covered by the body The Orbitron was one of his few custom cars to even have a hood It was said that the automatic hood did not fit well

The Orbitrons most fun feature was its front end It had three red green and blue tinted headlamps It was thought that combining the lights would make a white light the idea came from color television

Another car builder Darryl Starbird bought the Orbitron from Mr Roth in 1967 for US75000 Mr Starbird traded it to a man in Texas but Mr Starbird does not remember the mans name From Texas the Orbitron was traded to a carnival owner in Ciudad Jurez Chihuahua Mexico in 1991 By that time the special nose had been cut off and thrown away possibly to help keep the engine cool as it was driven around the carnivals

Michael Lightbourn a man who restores old cars heard that the Orbitron was in Ciudad Jurez He discovered it parked in front of an adult bookstore where it was in very poor shape and was being used as a trash can The car which used to be painted blue had been spray painted in black and was almost complete except for the hood the television the fur lining the cut off nose and the bubble top The top had to be destroyed in the early 1970s when it became stuck and trapped someone inside 

The family who owned the bookstore had also owned the carnival in which the car was used After Mr Lightbourn made a deal with the family he was able to bring the Orbitron to the United States It was then sold to Beau Boeckmann the host of the TV show Pimp My Ride He fully restored the Orbitron in 100 days He made it exactly like it was when it was new All the original parts which could not be used and which Mr Boeckmann removed from the car including the frame which was too rusted to reuse were stored away Mr Roth died in 2001 but Mr Boeckmann was able to get help from men who helped design and build the car in 1964 including designer Ed Newt Newton and painter Larry Watson The inside was redone by Joe Perez who did the original job

The restoration even includes the same type of television A small tape recorder and tape were found hidden in the cockpit This was played when the car was new It told people who were looking at the car what made it special and it still works today Planet Plastics of Chino California the original company which made the bubble top was asked to create a replacement Little bits of the cars original candy blue color were found inside the car They were used to match the color of the new paint The original Chevrolet engine with its very special carburetors and Chevrolet Corvette aluminum valve covers has been rebuilt and put back in the Orbitron

Glow fuel is a term used to tell about fuel used for model airplanes helicopters cars and boats Glow fuel can be burned by very simple two stroke engines or by four stroke engines Engines like this provide lots of power in a small size

Sometimes glow fuel is called nitro or just model fuel Some model fuel has only a little bit of nitro but some fuel has none at all It is called FAI fuel FAI stands for Fdration Aronautique Internationale They say that models used in racing or other competition under their rules may not have any nitro in their mix

Glow fuel is mostly made of methanol nitromethane and oil

Methanol is the main ingredient It provides most of the fuels ability to burn In order to burn the glow fuel a glow engine must have a glow plug The glow plug burns very hot as the engine runs because of a catalytic reaction with the methanol Since the engines turn very fast a phenomenon known as thermal inertia helps to keep the plug glowing as the engine runs A small amount of electricity is used to cause the glow plug to glow as the engine is started Once the engine is running the electricity is disconnected 

Nitromethane is added to the fuel for more power and to make the engine easier to tune Nitromethane contains less energy than the same amount of methanol but it requires less oxygen This means that more of it can be put into an engine during each turn of the engine This leads to more power

Fuel for most model planes boats and helicopters has 5 to 15 nitromethane For use in race cars the nitromethane can be from 30 to as much as 65

Nitromethane is hard to get in some countries since it is known as an explosive In these countries glow fuel sometimes has no nitromethane at all 

Since the engine doesnt have its own supply of oil its instead added to the fuel to help lubricate the moving parts and to keep them from burning up The oil can be castor oil or synthetic oils Some fuels include a mixture of the two The oils included in glow fuel are not burned by the engine Instead the oil comes out of the exhaust Not only does the oil lubricate the moving parts but the oil which comes out the engine helps carry away extra heat

Glow engines should be run slightly rich This means that the mix of fuel and air going into the engine has to have a bit more fuel in it than it can burn at once This unburned fuel and oil help keep the engine cool After a model has been run it is coated with a film of oil and must be cleaned Ordinary window cleaner and a paper towel do a nice job of removing the oil 

Glow fuel is not difficult to make but some of the ingredients are dangerous in large amounts Instead most modelers buy their glow fuel already made Some very small engines require more oil than larger engines More oil may be needed in the fuel The proper oil can be found at a hobby shop Companies which make glow fuel mix their fuels with the help of computers This helps each batch of fuel be of the highest quality it can be

The type of wire paper clip that is usually used was never patented It was first made by The Gem Manufacturing Company sometime during the 1890s The first time Gem was mentioned was in 1883 but historians do not think this is when they began making paper clips The first advertisement for paper clips was in August 1894 The Gem name was trademarked in the United States in 1904 The trademark paperwork said that the paper clip had been sold since March 1892

It has been said that Herbert Spencer invented the paper clip

It is proven that the paper clip was well known by 1899 A patent was given that year for a machine to make wire paper clips to William Middlebrook on April 27 The drawing in the patent shows a Gem paper clip There are many different kinds of paper clips Some have broken wikt linkpointypointy ends instead of round ones Some have a bent end This was done so that it is easier to put paper in Some of them have wires with bumps that allow them to hold the paper better Some paper clips are made to look good They are sometimes in a triangle or a circle

A Norwegian Johan Vaaler has sometimes been called the inventor of the paper clipFactdateMarch 2009 He was given patents in Germany and in the United States for a paper clip of a different design 

After Vaaler died some Norwegians made a myth that the paper clip was invented by a Norwegian genius Dictionaries since the 1950s have said that Vaaler is the inventor of the paper clip Dictionaries in other countries sometimes say this now tooFactdateMarch 2009

Vaaler was probably given a patent in other countries because patent laws in the 1800s were not as tough as they are today Vaaler worked in a patent office or place that deals with patents and could have given himself a patent very easily

The patents that Vaaler held have since expired The Gem paper clip was used around the world including in Norway His device did not work as well as the Gem version This was because it was hard to put pieces of paper in it and it did not look as good when there was paper in it 

The person who started the Norwegian paper clip myth was a person who worked for Norways patent office He visited Germany in the 1920s to get patents for some Norwegian inventions He came across Vaalers patent and did not realize that it was not the same as the Gem paper clip In a pamphlet put out by the patent office in celebration of its first 50 years he wrote about how Vaaler was the inventor of the paper clip This was put into many Norwegian encyclopedias after World War II

The war helped make the paper clip into a national symbol Some Norwegian patriots wore them on the outside of their clothing as a symbol of resistance to the German occupiers and local Nazi rulers when they were not allowed to protest Soon the Nazis made wearing them illegal 

The first Norwegian encyclopedia did mention it as a symbol of resistance but did not call it a Norwegian invention According to the encyclopedia the idea started in France

After the war Norway believed the paper clip was a national symbol Authors of books on the history of Norwegian technology used its status to make their stories bigger The did not mention that Vaalers clip was not the same as the Gem clip In 1989 a big paper clip almost 7 meters tall was put up in a college near Oslo in honor of Vaaler The monument is a Gem paper clip and not the one that was patented by Vaaler In 1999 100 years after the German patent was accepted Norway celebrated by making a postage stamp that had a paper clip on it However it was once again the Gem paper clip in the stamp In 2005 there was a Norwegian biography written about Johan Vaaler The inventor of the paper clip

Paper clips are usually made out of wire A paper clip can be useful when working with many things like computers The metal wire can be made straight with a little bit of work Some things have buttons that cannot be reached by fingers if the people who make the device do not want users pressing them accidentally Most CD ROM drives have small buttons like this to eject the CD ROM if there is not any power A paper clip bent into a U shape can be used to create a short circuit to start a computer if there is no power button

Paper clips can be used to pick a lock Usually professional lock picking tools are used because most paper clips are not strong enough for this use

Cryonics is when people are made very cold after a doctor says they are dead When they are warmed again there might still be a cure for them because of better medicine that can be invented in the future

Cold people like this are not awake at all as they have no brain activity The law also says they are dead Their body and its brain are made more like glass than ice because ice would harm their cells more To do this their blood is replaced with chemicals called cryoprotectants which act like anti freeze

Making them cold can stop cells from dying but can kill many of them Cryonics is not allowed unless you are already dead by law because this damage would make you dead by law To be dead in that way means you cannot live with help from medicine we have today The idea of people who do cryonics is that better medicine from tomorrow may be used for a cryonics patient so the person may be alive in a different sense than the law uses today

Polygar War or Palayakarar Wars refers to the wars fought between the Polygars of former Madurai Kingdom in Tamil Nadu India and the British colonial forces between March 1799 to May 1802 The British finally won after carrying out long and difficult protracted jungle campaigns against the Polygar armies and finally defeated them Many lives were lost on both sides and the victory over Polygars made large part of territories of Tamil Nadu coming under British control enabling them to get a strong hold in India

The war between the British and Kattabomman Nayak of Panchalankurichi Palayam in the then Tirunelveli region is often classified as the First Polygar war In 1799 a brief meeting between Kattabomman and the British ended in a bloody encounter in which the British commander of the forces was slain by the former A price was put on Kattabomman head prompting many Polygars to an open rebellion 

After a series of battles in the Panchalankurichi fort with additional reinforcements from Thiruchirapalli Kattabomman was defeated but he escaped to the jungles in Pudukottai country Here he was captured by Pudukottai Rajah and after a summary trial Kattabomman was hanged in front of the public in order to intimidate them near Kayattar Fort close to the town of Kovilpatti and in front of fellow Polygars too who had been summoned to witness the execution

Subramania Pillai a close associate of Kattabomman Nayak was also publicly hanged and his head was fixed on a pike at Panchalankurichi for public view Soundra Pandian Nayak another rebel leader was brutally done to death by having his head dashed against a village wall Kattabommans brother Oomaidurai was imprisoned in Palayankottai prison while the fort was razed to ground and his wealth looted by the troops

Despite the suppression of the First Polygar War in 1799 rebellion broke out again in 1800 The Second war was more stealthy and covert in nature The leaders operated more cohesive and united with people from Kerala and Mysore taking part Also it marked the joining of entire west Tamil Nadu Malabar and south Mysore regionsDheeran Chinnamalai commanded a vast armyHe settled down at Odanilai and constructed a fort there to continue his struggle against the British whom he defeated in battles at Cauvery in 1801 Odanilai in 1802 and Arachalur in 1804 Later Dheeran Chinnamalai left his fort to avoid cannon attack and engaged in guerrilla warfare while he was stationed at Karumalai in the Palani region

He was betrayed by his cook and captured by the British who hanged him at Sankari Fort on July 31 1805

During those days Kongu area was under the control of Mysore Muslim king Hyder Ali Hyder Ali was entitled to tax the Kongu people A Diwan appointed by Hyder Ali named Mohammed Ali and a Tax collector were troubling farmers in the collection of the taxes in the Kongu area They humiliated the farmers by confiscating their land their only means of livelihood away from them Hearing the atrocity committed by the Mysore Kings Diwan Theerthagiri and his two brothers mounted on their horses to meet them and stop them As they were searching for the Diwan the Diwan and his party were returning to their tents after colleting taxes Theerthagiri met them on a road between well known Sivan Malai and Cheeni Malai They recovered all the taxes from the Diwan and asked him to go and report to the Mysore King that a Chinnmalai that was in between Sivan Malai and Chennimali took away all the taxes Diwan was very angry and protested that the taxes belonged to Hyder Ali and Theertahagiri would face severe consequences for his actions When Diwan informed him that Kongunadu was ruled by Hyder Ali Theerthagiri asked the Diwan to inform Hyder Ali that Kongus could rule themselves and they did not need a Mysore King He distributed the taxes back to farmers The story of his encounter with Mysore Kings Diwan spread like wild fire and people named him as Chinnamali for this show of bravery

Mysore Diwan was humiliated But he wanted to take revenge against Chinnamalai and also wanted to punish him for violating the Mysore Kings rights in Kongu The Diwan sent a contingent of soldiers from Sankagiri Theerthagiri and his soldiers met them on their way to Gangayam at the Noyyal River and defeated them This was the first battlefield experience for Chinnamalai Knowing that he has to meet Mysore King in battle in course of time Chinnamalai collected an army of soldiers from all the villages He gave the new Kongu soldiers training in many martial arts Chinnamalai became a very powerful figure in the Kongu region

His house in Kankayam has become a guest house for the all Kongu activities The eldest brother Kulaniswamy and his wife Kempayammal took good care of the all the guests who visited them by providing food and shelter

Hyder Ali died on 12th July 1782 and his son Tippu Sultan became the Mysore King After Tippu became Mysore King hostilities broke between British and Tippu Sultan as Tippu claimed sovereignty to his kingdom and refused to pay taxes to the British Tippu Sultan wanted to raise a big army of soldiers to fight the British and invited the Kongus to join him to fight against the British Chinnamalai and his brothers Kilother Thambi decided to join with Tippu Sultan They also took with them their loyal friend Karuppan and Velappan Chinnamalai was made chief of Kongu Regimen About 1000 young Kongus joined the Kongu Regimen They were given proper military training by French who were collaborating with Tippu to fight the British It is worthwhile remembering that these were the days of aftermath of famous French Revolution The war between Mysore King and the British are known as Mysore Wars The fourth and crucial battle between Tippu took place in the year 1799 Chinnamalis soldiers battled against the British at MalaValli front and caused severe damage to the British forces Srirangapatnam war front was led by Tippu himself In the severe battle that took place Tippu himself was killed on April 5 1799 After the defeat of Tippu Kongu area came under the control of British technically

After death of Tippu Sultan Chinnamalai led all his soldiers through Kaveri River into Kongunadu However their loyal friend Velappan was captured by the British and remained in their custody Velappan promised the British that he would act as their agent Believing his words they gave him a position in their army However Velappan remained loyal to Chinnamalai and sent notes concerning British activities and helped Chinnmalai in many ways

After his return from the Mysore War to Kongu Chinnamali built a palace in a village called OdaNilai He advocated to all Kongus and the neighboring Palayakarars that they should all unite together and fight the British At that time Salem and Malabar areas were under the control of British But British could not control the Kongunadu due to opposition by Chiannmalai and his alliance If the British wanted to travel to Malabar from Salem they had to take a circuitous route through Mysore Kongu soldiers were guarding Kongunadu and were preventing the entry of British through Kaveri River The British wanted to take over the control of Kongunadu without a fight They sent a messenger to inform Chinnamali to accept the British Control of Kongunadu and pay the taxes Chinnamalai refused the offer and challenged the British for the hegemony over his land

Although Velappan was serving the British he informed Chinnmali and warned him in advance of the British activities through some secret messengers Chinnamali knew that British would enter Kongunadu in course of time He made preparations to the eventual fight with the British During this time he built an ordinance factory at Oda Nalli to make war preparations to face the British

Even during this tough times it is said that Chinnmalai was generous to poets and learned men under his rule He made Arunachala Kavi the poet of his kingdom He also generously donated large sums of gold coins to Punthurai Ambikapathi poet and honored him in his kingdom He punished the infiltrators sent out by the British into his Kingdom and made his kingdom safer for its subjects In all people lived a peaceful and happy life under the rule of Chinnamali

The British were very much annoyed that Chinnmalai was running his own independent kingdom and did not listen to their demands to accept their hegemony The British decided to strike him and take the land by force Initially they sent out a troop of soldiers under the captainship of Colonel Makiskan to arrest Chinnamalai Velappan who was in serving the British informed Chinnmalai of the British Plan though his informers As Chinnamali was forewarned he met Makistian and his soldiers on the banks of Noyyal River and defeated them in the battle thoroughly Makistan was beheaded in the battle and it is said that this head was paraded in the villages of Kongu

Learning what had happened to Makiskan the British became very furious and sent cavalry unit under Captain Harris to capture Chinnamalai When Harris was approaching Arasalur he heard the Puja sounds from the Arasalur Amman Temple Thinking that Chinnmali might be in the temple Captain Harris entered the temple in search of Chnnamalai As he could nor find him he was frustrated and proceeded to Oda Nilai where Chinnmanalis palace is located

A sentry at the top of the palace noticed the movement of the troop led by Harris and immediately informed Chinnamalai what he saw Chinnamali planned to attack them alone with a hand grenade first He advised his soldiers to attack them after he had a chance to throw the grenade at them Chinnamali mounted a horse and sped towards Harris and his troop As Harris was wondering why a single person was approaching him Chinnamalai swiftly threw his grenade at his horses side The horse got bewildered and started running away from the bomb and the smoke Harris lost control of his horse and a pandemonium ensued as Harris could not control his horse Meanwhile Chnnamalais troop joined him Harris and his troop had to withdraw Chinnmamali and his troop drive all the way to Kaveri River up north This battle is took place in the year 1802

Hearing what has happened to Harris the British became very furious and they decided to send in a troop carrying Cannons As soon as Velappan knew of the British plan he sent a word through the informers about the impending British attack on OdaNilai Chinnmalai used to wear a new pair of shoes every day The informer wrote the news in a chit and left it in his shoes When Chinnmalai was about the wear the shoes he found the note from Velappan After reading the note he left in there by mistake

Chinnmalai consulted with his brothers for a plan of action They decided to leave Karuppan in Melapalayam in a hiding Chinnamali and two of his brothers and the cook Nallappan decided to hide in the Karumalai area that is adjacent to well known Palani Malai Karumali area was full of thick forests and provided cover for the brothers to hide from the British attack

The British came to OdaNalli with their cannons and found that all had vacated the palace When they were searching the palace area they found the note sent out by Velappan The moment British came to know that Velappan was an informer to Chiinamalai they shot him dead They demolished the entire palace with cannon shots They decided to search and find Chinnmalai

Meanwhile Chinnamalai and his brothers stayed during the day time in the Karumalai area and returned in the night to a house at the foot of the hills for dinner and sleep They ate the food prepared by the cook Nallappan They always carried guns for precaution

Cook Nallapan was traitor He was tempted to accept bribery and inform Chinnamalais whereabouts He secretly informed a British agent about Chinnmalai and his brothers and their daily routine of eating food in the house at the foot of the hills The British dug a underground trench leading to the house and waited for Chinnmalai and his brothers

As usual when the brothers were entering the house he served them food That day he cunningly asked the brothers to leave their guns on the floor as there was no danger when they were eating food The brothers believed his words and left their guns on the floor as they also did not sense any danger

When they were about to eat Nallaplan opened the secret door leading to the underground trench and allowed the British soldiers in side the kitchen The British soldiers surrounded Chinnamalai and his brothers With all the fury Chinnmalai hit the traitor and killed him on the spot

The British arrested Chinnmalai and his brothers and kept them in Sankakiri prison A four person tribunal consisting of Genaman Marvul Horse and Backy Hart was formed Their loyal servant Karuppan who was in hiding at Melapalayam also surrendered to the British The tribunal asked Chinnmalai to accept the British rule over his Kingdom and pay taxes to the British They also offered him amnesty if he tendered an apology Chinnmalai refused the British offer and informed his decision to face the consequences

Preparations were made to hang them by rope tied to a Tamarind tree located at the top of the Sankakiri fort Chinnamalai his two brothers and Kapuppan were brought to the tree on the day of the hanging They asked the escorting soldiers to move away from them Then each one tied the rope around his neck and jumped down to embrace death The whole of Kongunadu wept for their heroic deed on that day The British saw to that that Chinnamalai name did not become household name by banning books or any literature on Chinnamali for a long period of time Theeran Chinnamali was hanged on July 31 1805

The story of Chinnmalai and his heroic battles with the British and the eventual sacrifice of his for the cause of freedom would have been completely consigned to oblivion but of the heritage of oral story telling that existed in our culture The singular credit goes to Pulavar Kulanthi who heard this story from his grand father during early 1900s However during the British rule it was not possible to write about the freedom fighters as the those literature was banned Pulavar Kulandi could write about Chinnamali only after independence However by the time he was about to write he could not recollect everything his grand father told him However he was able to create the first account of the Story of Theeran Chinnmalai and in course of time Kongus understood the heroic role of Chinnmalai of his independence from British Domination

The British finally won after a long expensive campaign that took more than a year However the superior British military who had recently defeated the powerful Tipu Sultan of Mysore quickly asserted itself The British had better artillery compared to the Polygar troops who had country made gunfire artillery barring a few proper ones received from erstwhile Tipu Sultans army The war being regional in nature the British forces could easily mobilize additional forces from other regions So savage and extensive was the death and destruction wrought by the English that the entire region was left in a state of terror

Tamil Nadu government constructed a mani mandapam for Chinnamalai in Arachalur Erode district at a cost of about 30 lakhs Tamil Nadu government placed a statue of Chinnamalai in Chennai1

The British arrested Chinnmalai and his brothers and kept them in Sankakiri prison A four person tribunal consisting of Genaman Marvul Horse and Backy Hart was formed Their loyal servant Karuppan who was in hiding at Melapalayam also surrendered to the British The tribunal asked Chinnmalai to accept the British rule over his Kingdom and pay taxes to the British They also offered him amnesty if he tendered an apology Chinnmalai refused the British offer and informed his decision to face the consequences

Preparations were made to hang them by rope tied to a Tamarind tree located at the top of the Sankakiri fort Chinnamalai his two brothers and Kapuppan were brought to the tree on the day of the hanging They asked the escorting soldiers to move away from them Then each one tied the rope around his neck and jumped down to embrace death The whole of Kongunadu wept for their heroic deed on that day The British saw to that that Chinnamalai name did not become household name by banning books or any literature on Chinnamali for a long period of time Theeran Chinnamali was hanged on July 31 1805

The story of Chinnmalai and his heroic battles with the British and the eventual sacrifice of his for the cause of freedom would have been completely consigned to oblivion but of the heritage of oral story telling that existed in our culture The singular credit goes to Pulavar Kulanthi who heard this story from his grand father during early 1900s However during the British rule it was not possible to write about the freedom fighters as the those literature was banned Pulavar Kulandi could write about Chinnamali only after independence However by the time he was about to write he could not recollect everything his grand father told him However he was able to create the first account of the Story of Theeran Chinnmalai and in course of time Kongus understood the heroic role of Chinnmalai of his independence from British Domination

Seismology is the study of what is under the surface of the Earth by measuring vibrations on the Earths surface A person who does this is called a seismologist 

It is part of the science of geophysics which studies the physics of the processes that formed the earth and other planets 

Seismology is done by seismologists and geophysiscists using devices to pick up the vibrations called geophones hydrophones or seismometers

Seismology can either be passive just listening to vibrations caused by earthquakes and volcanic activity or active using small explosive charges to send vibrations into the ground

Seismic detectors come in two types one which measures up and down vibrations and one which measures side to side vibrations Both types use and arrangement of a magnet and a coil of wire which will convert the vibrations into an electrical signal which ca be stored in a computer for analysis

Seismologists can find the location of earthquakes by plotting received vibrations on a map They can also pick up underground nuclear tests and this is what many of the seismic recording stations were set up for

They can also examine the crust in a seismic survey to try and find information about layers of rock locate oil or gas fields and to get information about the internal structure of volcanos

A grassland is an area of land that mostly contains grasses There are wild grasses and less trees There are several parts of the world that have grasslands Grasslands are found in Africa North America Central Asia South America and near the coasts of Australia The largest grasslands are in East Africa Grasslands with a few scattered trees are called savannas Little rain falls in a grassland biome Between 25 and 75 cm of rain falls each year which makes the weather in these savannas hot and sunny in the summer and cool in the winter months

There are a few trees in the grassland because of the low rainfall Thorny trees called acacias are one of a handful of trees that are able to grow here Wildfires are common and prevent trees from growing The animals also prevent trees from growing as they eat the tender sprouts before they can develop into grown trees Elephants are known to tear down trees and feed on their leaves making trees even more scarce

Grass can still grow because it survives the trampling of the animals and the little rain This is why grasslands can feed the vast numbers of animals from the mice rats and other small animals that eat the seeds and sprouts to the large herds of animals

There are many animals living in the grasslands Some examples of animals are mice rats snakes hawks eagles zebras lions ostriches giraffes rhinos elephants and antelope

Today grasslands are being destroyed by farming Many people are trying to save our grassland by preventing the expansion of farms and by restoring destroyed grassland Also the animals in grasslands are constantly killed due to hunting For example there used to be millions of buffalo in the United States grassland but after people came and hunted there only a few thousand are left

Sullivan Bay is the site of the first official European settlement in Victoria Australia It is a very small bay near Sorrento Victoria It is close to the entrance of Port Phillip Bay convert60kmmi0lkonabbron south of the city of Melbourne In 1802 Governor Philip Gidley King in Sydney had written to Lord Hobart Minister in charge of the colonies in London saying that Britain should start a settlement at Port Phillip Bay King thought it would be good area for fishing and sealing He was also worried that the French might settle in the area and then would control Bass Strait Lieutenant John Murray had explored Port Phillip Bay in 1802 and thought that the Sorrento area would be a good spot to start a settlement

Lieutenant Governor David Collins was put in charge of starting the new settlement He took 307 convicts some with wives and children 51 soldiers 17 free settlers some with wives and children and a government staff of 12 and a clergyman the Reverend Knopwood The group of more than 400 people left England in April 1803 in the store ship Ocean and the convict ship Calcutta

The two ships sailed to Tenerife in the Canary Islands Rio de Janeiro in Brazil Capetown in South Africa and arrived at Port Phillip Bay on 6 October and 8 October 1803 Only 14 people died on the trip Collins was unable to find a good place to land that had drinking water and good soil On 13 October 1803 he landed at Sullivans Bay which he named after the Under Secretary of the Colonial War Department

The new settlers were able to get water by putting wooden barrels into the sand and letting the water in the ground soak into them It was salty and not nice to drink The soil was very sandy and not suitable for farming There were very few trees suitable for cutting up into building timber The sandy ground meant that heavy items could not be carried in a wagon which would be stuck in the sand but had to be dragged instead The small entrance to the bay made it difficult for sailing ships to get in or out safely The tools brought from England such a spades hoes and axes were very badly made and broke easily Collins found that the convicts were not prepared to work hard he described them as being broken wikt linkworthlessworthless Many of them tried to escape He had hoped to increase the food supply with fresh fish and kangaroos but they were not able to catch any

Male convicts were given a set of clothes in October 1803 which included

The food ration each week was

Women were to be given 23 of that amount children half the amount and small children under 5 years of the broken wikt linkrationration

A convict printer Robert Walsh printed the orders and instructions for the settlement on a small printing press During the time of the settlement 43 such orders were printed

Collins told the convicts not to go into the water to wash because of the danger from hungry sharks and stingrays Some tried to escape by walking overland to Sydney They soon gave up and went back to the settlement Settler John Skilton died on 17 October 1803 On 25 November 1803 the first child William James Hobart Thorne was born to a soldier Sergeant Thorne and his wife One child of convict parents was John Pascoe Fawkner who returned to start the settlement of Melbourne in 1835

In November Collins sent the Ocean to Sydney with a letter asking King to let him abandon the settlement and move it to either Port Dalrymple or the Derwent River in Van Diemens Land The Ocean came back in December and Collins wasted no time in getting most of the convicts and settlers packed up He gave an order that convicts had to work on Sundays to make sure the group was ready to leave as soon as possible On 30 January 1804 the Ocean set sail for the Derwent River Lieutenant William Sladden was left behind in charge of a small group The Ocean returned and on 20 May 1804 the settlement was abandoned

Three people were left behind after the settlement was abandoned two were escaped convicts and one was a runaway soldier William Buckley When John Batman came to settle in Victoria 30 years later he found Buckley living with an aboriginal tribe The only sign of the settlement now is four graves at Sullivan Bay and the remains of a water barrel in the Latrobe Library collection

The Streamlined System for the Romanization of Bulgarian is a system of transliteration of the Bulgarian alphabet created in the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in 1995 which is defined by the following table

The system was originally developed in order to serve for the Romanization of Bulgarian geographical names in Antarctica and was adopted for that purpose by the Antarctic Place names Commission of Bulgaria on 2 March 2005 An early explanation of the Streamlined System was made available in 1997 to the US and UK Antartcic place naming authorities upon their request as they had noticed the difference from their 1952 BGNPCGN romanization of Bulgarian The new system became subject to comparative study at the Department of English and American Studies at Sofia University

Subsequently the system was chosen by the Bulgarian Government as the official transliteration system to be used in all identity documents road signs street names official information systems databases local authorities websites etc Eventually the Streamlined System became part of Bulgarian law by way of the Transliteration Law passed in 2009

The Streamlined System was designed with the aim of striking an optimal balance between the following partly overlapping and partly conflicting priorities

Exceptions 

It had been proposed to modify the Streamlined System so that Bulgarian letters and were transliterated as and TZ respectively However those proposals failed to gain wider acceptance and were not adopted for official usage

The system is not invertible for     are transliterated in the same way as are    respectively An auxiliary invertible variant of the system is proposed by L Ivanov D Skordev and D Dobrev to be used in those special cases when the exact retrieval of Bulgarian words from their Romanized forms is a priority with Cyrillic letters and combinations of letters        transliterated as A A Y Y ZH YA YU SH TS TSH TSHT SHT SHTS respectively

The Streamlined System is based on an English oriented transliteration taking advantage of the global lingua franca role of English A similar shift towards English oriented transliteration is observed in the case of other Cyrillic alphabets notably Russian and Ukrainian and to some extent Macedonian 

The Streamlined System is similar to the 1952 BGNPCGN System for the Romanization of Bulgarian which is still official in the USA and the United Kingdom The latter however transliterates the Cyrillic letters  and as KH and while the former uses H Y and A instead 

Another similar system not adopted for official use in Bulgaria is that of A Danchev M Holman E Dimova and M Savova which transliterates the Cyrillic letters and by OU and U respectively while the Streamlined System uses U and A for this purpose

An unsafe abortion is an abortion which is not done by a person which has the skills to do them or in a place that does not meet at least basic standards of hygiene Unsafe abortions can be very dangerous to the mother Many women die or get a disease because they had an unsafe abortion About 95 percent of unsafe abortions happen in developing countries

Two very common ways that unsafe abortions are done are

A back alley abortion is the common slang term for an illegal abortion in the English speaking world 

The method using the coat hanger as described above was known by many people This method was not what was done normally though In fact Mary Calderone former medical director of Planned Parenthood said in a 1960 printing of the American Journal of Public Health

Herbal abortions can also be described as back alley abortions because they are not induced in a medical facility

The argument of back alley abortions was used to help make abortion legal in the United States In 1973 the US Supreme Court decided that abortion should be legalized It was treating a case called Roe v Wade Since then it has become a central argument on the part of some prominent legal abortion advocates Gerri Santoro died of blood loss after a back alley abortion Her photo was used extensively to illustrate the dangers of illegal abortions

Bernard Nathanson performed many abortions but later was against them He has said that many of the statistics that show that many women died from back alley abortions in the US are false He said that he and his colleagues made many such statistics to lead people to believe that legalizing abortion was a good thing to do

It is a small shrub which is related to the boronia plants It is about convert50cmin0lkonabbron tall and convert50cmin0lkonabbron wide though some plants have grown up to convert1mft0lkonabbron tall It has a small white or pink flower with four petals about convert3mmin0lkonabbron long The plant has flowers in spring from August to October It also has small green leaves which are trifoliate in three parts like a clover leaf The leaves have a strong smell

The plants have only been found near the Araluen Creek They are growing on a steep rocky hillside

The plant has been listed as Endangered under the Australian Governments Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 It is also listed by the New South Wales Government Endangered on the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 It is endangered because there are so few of the plants and they are only found in one place A bushfire could destroy all the plants There is also a danger from wild goats in the area The goats do not eat the Zieria but they could walk on the new seedlings and crush them The goats might eat all the other plants which could lead to erosion and the soil could be washed away Weeds growing around the plants might also stop new Zierias from growing

There is now a plan to protect the plant These plans include

Jules Henri Poincar was a French mathematician and scientist He was described as a monster of mathematics when still a child Many people think he was the last person to understand all branches of mathematics before the subject became too big for anyone to do this 

He came from a clever family his father was a professor of medicine and his cousin Raymond Poincar became president of France He was sick as a child and for many years he had to be taught at home by his mother

He used his mathematical skills to look at some of the biggest problems in science in his day He was the first person to describe in mathematical terms how three planets in orbit affect each others paths as they pass near by one another This was called the Three Body Problem He also tried to understand why the speed of light seems to be the fastest speed at which anything can travel in the universe In some ways he beat the famous scientist Albert Einstein to solving this question but Einstein gave a more complete answer He gained fame for the discovery of the theory of relativity instead of Poincar

He created the Poincar Conjecture one of the most famous problems in mathematics which was only solved 100 years later He began the branches of mathematics which are known today as chaos theory and topology

He also wrote about science in a simple way that ordinary people could understand

The term toxic asset is a nontechnical term used to describe certain financial assets when their value has fallen significantly and when there is no longer a functioning market for these assets so that they cannot reasonably be sold This term became common during the financial crisis that began in August 2007 Toxic assets played a major role in that crisis When the market for such assets ceases to function it is described as frozen 

Markets for some toxic assets froze in 2007 and the problem grew significantly worse in the second half of 2008 Several factors contributed to the freezing of toxic asset markets The value of the assets were very sensitive to economic conditions and increased uncertainty in these conditions made it difficult to estimate the value of the assets Banks and other major financial institutions were unwilling to sell the assets at significantly reduced prices since lower prices would force them to significantly reduce their stated assets making them appear insolvent

ISO 8601 is an international standard to describe dates and times in the easiest way possible for computers to understand 

This standard is based on putting the biggest types of numbers first and the smallest numbers last Because years are bigger than months and months are bigger than days they are put in the order of YEAR MONTH DAY

A basic ISO date for today looks like CURRENTYEAR CURRENTMONTH CURRENTDAY2

The basic ISO time is CURRENTHOURCURRENTMINUTE

Another very important principle is that when a computer or human puts ISO 8601 dates into alphabetical order they are also in chronological order

People can also use these dates but it is currently not common for people in any country to write dates using this standard in their day to day lives

In mathematics a convex regular 4 polytope is 4 dimensional polytope which is both regular and convex These are the four dimensional analogs of the Platonic solids and the regular polygons

These polytopes were first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schlfli in the mid 19th century Schlfli discovered that there are precisely six such figures Five of these may be thought of as higher dimensional analogs of the Platonic solids There is one additional figure which has no three dimensional equivalent

Each convex regular 4 polytope is bounded by a set of 3 dimensional cells which are all Platonic solids of the same type and size These are fitted together along their respective faces in a regular fashion

The following tables lists some properties of the six convex regular polychora The symmetry groups of these polychora are all Coxeter groups and given in the notation described in that article The number following the name of the group is the order of the group

The following table shows some 2 dimensional projections of these polytopes Various other visualizations can be found in the other websites below The Coxeter Dynkin diagram graphs are also given below the Schlfli symbol

In four dimensional geometry a 16 cell is a regular convex polychoron or polytope existing in four dimensions It is also known as the hexadecachoron It is one of the six regular convex polychora first described by the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schlfli in the mid 19th century 

Conway calls it an orthoplex for orthant complex as well as the entire class of cross polytopes

The hexadecachoron is a member of the family of polytopes called the cross polytopes which exist in all dimensions As such its dual polychoron is the tesseract

It is bounded by 16 cells all of which are regular tetrahedra It has 32 triangular faces 24 edges and 8 vertices The 24 edges bound 6 squares lying in the 6 coordinate planes

The eight vertices of the hexadecachoron are All vertices are connected by edges except opposite pairs

The Schlfli symbol of the hexadecachoron is 334 Its vertex figure is a regular octahedron There are 8 tetrahedra 12 triangles and 6 edges meeting at every vertex Its edge figure is a square There are 4 tetrahedra and 4 triangles meeting at every edge

There is a lower symmetry form of the 16 cell called a demitesseract or 4 demicube a member of the demihypercube family and represented by h433 and can be drawn bicolored with alternating tetrahedral cells

One can tessellate 4 dimensional Euclidean space by regular 16 cells This is called the hexadecachoric honeycomb and has Schlfli symbol 3343 The dual tessellation icositetrachoric honeycomb 3433 is made of by regular 24 cells Together with the tesseractic honeycomb 4334 these are the only three regular tessellations of R4 Each 16 cell has 16 neighbors with which it shares an octahedron 24 neighbors with which it shares only an edge and 72 neighbors with which it shares only a single point Twenty four 16 cells meet at any given vertex in this tessellation

The cell first parallel projection of the 16 cell into 3 space has a cubical envelope The closest and farthest cells are projected to inscribed tetrahedra within the cube corresponding with the two possible ways to inscribe a regular tetrahedron in a cube Surrounding each of these tetrahedra are 4 other tetrahedral volumes that are the images of the 4 surrounding tetrahedral cells filling up the space between the inscribed tetrahedron and the cube The remaining 6 cells are projected onto the square faces of the cube In this projection of the 16 cell all its edges lie on the faces of the cubical envelope

The cell first perspective projection of the 16 cell into 3 space has a triakis tetrahedral envelope The layout of the cells within this envelope are analogous to that of the cell first parallel projection

The vertex first parallel projection of the 16 cell into 3 space has an octahedral envelope This octahedron can be divided into 8 tetrahedral volumes by cutting along the coordinate planes Each of these volumes is the image of a pair of cells in the 16 cell The closest vertex of the 16 cell to the viewer projects onto the center of the octahedron

Finally the edge first parallel projection has a shortened octahedral envelope and the face first parallel projection has a hexagonal bipyramidal envelope

In mathematics a regular polytope is the generalisation of the regular polygon For example a two dimensional regular polytope is a regular polygon and a three dimensional regular polytope is a regular polyhedron Like with the regular polygon there are certain kinds of symmetries Regular polytopes have regular facets and their vertex figures are regular

In geometry a simplex sometimes called n simplex is the n dimensional analogue figure of the triangle A triangle is a 2 simplex The 0 simplex is the point the 1 simplex is the line segment The 3 simplex is the tetrahedron and the 4 simplex is the pentachoron

A regular simplex is a simplex that is also a regular polytope A regular n simplex may be made from a regular simplex by connecting a new vertex to all the other vertices All the vertices have the same length

In geometry a Pentachoron is an object in four dimensional space It is a 4 simplex It is also called hyperpyramid 5 cell or pentatope It has 5 cells Each cell is a tetrahedron

Leonese Language Day is a celebration of the Leonese language This celebration was started in the city of Llin province of Llin Spain It was the result of a protocol signed between Leonese Provincial Government and the Cultural Association for Leonese Language El Fueyu The celebration is run by the Llin City Council

Some things that happen during the celebration are a display of traditional Leonese music as well as the display of some works about Leonese language There are also books about the Leonese language and Leonese films

Leonese Language Day started on June 10 2006 The celebration was organized by the Asociacin Cultural de la Llingua Llonesa El Fueyu with the help of the Asociacin Berciana en Defensa de la Llingua Llonesa El Toraln La Barda and Pro Monumenta There were traditional Leonese musical actuations and it was presented the book in Leonese language Cuentos del Sil and several personalities from the cultural universitary politic leonese world with young Leonese language students recited poems in Leonese language It counted with the support of Leonese Provincial Government

This second Leonese Language Day was celebrated on December 16 2007 The celebration was organized by the Leonese City Council with the help of several associations At the celebration a documentary called Asina falamos was shown as well as a play called Fuei a corteixar a Robles

The third Leonese Language Day was run by the Leonese City Council with help of several Leonese associations like puntuLLI That celebration was on December 30 There were meetings about the Leonese Language at the celebration

At the fourth Leonese Language Day there were musicians like Rodrigo Martnez Banda de Gaitas and Ciud de Llin During the celebration diplomas were given to the people who done Leonese language lessons in School

The Asociacin PuntuLLI is an association that promotes the creation of a Top Level Domain for the Leonese Language and Culture

Similar campaigns started in Scotland Wales Berlin or New York 

PuntuLLI is recognised by cityTLD as a Top Level Domain official initiative

The campaign for reaching a lli domain started on January 2007 looking for the support of associations and institutions Between theorganizations that support this requirement to the ICANN there are associations about culture language sport or nature

This association promotes the creation of a lli domain in Internet according to the ICANN policy of giving Top Level Domains for the languages and cultures In this sense puntuLLI promotes a Leonese language and cultural domain

In 2008 PuntuLLI have collaborated with other initiatives for promoting the Leonese language like an sponsor specially the Armwrestling World Championship developed in Llin the Leonese Country Pipe Bands Championship Leonese City Council selected puntuLLI as official developer of the Internet activities in the III Leonese Language Day

There are more than 800 people added and 44 organisations that support the campaign via web for reaching a Top Level Domain for Leonese language and culture webs 

Actually there are campaigns for reaching TLDs for languages and cultures in Scotland Wales Brittany Galicia Basque Country England Quebec and Cornwall

Similar campaigns requesting a TLD for cities are developed in Berlin London New York and Paris

There are several proposed top level domains that have not yet been submitted to or approved by ICANN as of 2008

These proposals are centered on creating an independent internet identity for linguistic and cultural communities They are mostly inspired by the success of the cat domain created for websites in the Catalan language or about the Catalan culture

kids is a top level domain that has been proposed by several entities So far none of these proposals have come to fruition

Applications for a kids domain have included

The European Parliament has also proposed kid for websites designed for childrenFactdateJune 2008 It would be monitored by an independent authority

A Travelcard is a ticket used for most transport in London including buses and the underground The ticket is issued by Transport for London and National Rail and can be used on the services of either

Before Travelcards were used travellers in Greater London had to pay every time they changed between London Transports bus and Underground services This was a problem as it led to delays while purchasing the next ticket

One ticket for all transport in London was one of the key promises made in 1981 by the newly elected Labour Greater London Council headed by council leader Ken Livingstone The policy with the slogan Just The Ticket meant that only one ticket was needed for London Transport bus and Underground services They also reduced the price of transport The price cut was then ruled illegal but the one pricing scheme was mostly a success and was extended during the 1980s and 1990s as new transport routes were opened in London

By 1985 there were two travelcards the Travelcard itself which covered only London Buses and the Underground and the Capitalcard which covered most bus Underground and local British Rail services The Travelcard replaced the original Capitalcard while including its greater availability around 1989

The original zonal system was mainly in Greater London The zone areas used both letters and numbers for the outermost zones such that bus availability ignored the letter while BR and Underground availability depended also upon the letter  eg a Travelcard or Capitalcard valid in zone 3a was valid on buses in zones 3a 3b and 3c but only in zone 3a when used on the railway services

A Travelcard entitles the holder to use the following modes of transport within Greater London

Travelcards also entitle the holder to a 33 discount on some London River Services

A top level domain or TLD are the letters that follow the final dot of the domain names

There are several kinds of TLDs

SS Andrea Doria was an Italian ocean liner or passenger ship It was owned by a ship line called the Italian Line It was said to be the biggest fastest safest and most beautiful ship in Italy after World War IIfactdateApril 2009 It could carry 1221 passengers and 563 crew

The ship was built by the Ansaldo Shipyards in Genoa Italy It was launched on June 16 1951 Its maiden voyage or first voyage was on January 14 1953factdateApril 2009 Three years later in 1956 it crashed with another ship SS Stockholm in the Atlantic Ocean At that time 1134 passengers and 572 crew were on boardfactdateApril 2009 Andrea Doria sank in 11 hours but Stockholm survived

The Andrea Doria was the last large ocean liner to sink before airplane travel became popular

Andrea Doria was built at the Ansaldo Shipyards which was a shipbuilding company in Genoa Italy At the time of building she was

Andrea Doria was a transatlantic ocean liner which is a ship that crosses the Atlantic Ocean The ship had three swimming pools and was the first ship to have that many Over 1 million dollars were spent on art to decorate the ship

The ship was also built for safety It had 11 watertight compartments These are special dividers in a ship to keep water in one place If two of them were filled the ship would not sink Andrea Doria also had very advanced radar Radar could warn the captain of the Andrea Doria if there was something in the path of the ship However one big problem was that the ship often tilted too much to one side

Andrea Doria had two rows of lifeboats which are small boats that can evacuate passengers if the ship sinks However if the ship tilted too much half of the lifeboats could not be used Andrea Dorias maiden voyage was on January 14 1953

Andrea Doria sank in the night between July 25 1956 and July 26 1956 When she sank she had 1134 passengers and 572 crew members and her captain was Piero Calamai She was sailing in the Atlantic Ocean Her path was from Genoa Italy to New York in the United States Andrea Doria entered very thick fog when it passed by Nantucket which is a small island near Massachusetts Soon another ship entered the fog This was SS Stockholm SS Stockholm was another passenger ship Because of the fog the two ships could not see each other When they finally noticed each other they tried to turn away Andrea Doria turned left to pass Stockholm But Stockholm turned right to try to pass Andrea Doria Because of the fog they could not see what each other was trying to do At 1110 PM of July 15 1956 Andrea Doria and Stockholm crashed together

Stockholm crashed into the right side of Andrea Doria near the middle It made a large hole that was almost convert40ftm deep It broke open several of the watertight compartments on Andrea Doria It also broke five fuel tanks The fuel tanks were filled by 500 tons of water Stockholm and Andrea Doria separated in 30 seconds Andrea Doria began to tilt to its right side Soon half of the lifeboats could not be used because it was tilting too much The weight of the fuel tanks that were filled by water also pulled it down Stockholms whole front end was destroyed but it did not sink 46 passengers on the Andrea Doria were killed by the crash Five crew members of the Stockholm were also killed However one incredible survivor was Linda Morgan an Andrea Doria passenger who landed on the Stockholm when they crashed

Thirty minutes after the crash the people on Andrea Doria decided to abandon the ship However some crew had already left This made it harder because no crew was there to help However there were still enough lifeboats to get everyone out safely The SS Ile de France a French ship arrived at the Andrea Doria to help rescue passengers It launched lifeboats to rescue passengers of the Andrea Doria The Ile de France had sailed only one day so it had lots of supplies left to help the passengers of Andrea Doria Andrea Doria continued to tilt right and eventually began to sink on 945 AM of July 16 1956 Before that at 900 AM all the survivors were off the ship At 1000 AM Andrea Doria was tilted so far to the right that its windows touched the ocean At 1009 AM the ship sank This was 10 hours and 59 minutes after it had crashed with the Stockholm The back of Andrea Doria rose and its left propeller lifted out of the water Some lifeboats that were still on the ship broke off and floated away upside down The ship had drifted 16 nautical miles from where it had crashed with the Stockholm

A total of six different ships rescued passengers of the Andrea Doria including the Stockholm and Ile de France Stockholm was the last to arrive because it was damaged Many families had their hopes of seeing loved ones again destroyed The most affected were those who were meeting members of several families immigrating to the United States in hope of new lives The Chrysler Norseman a prototype car headed to New York was also lost with the other cars aboard Andrea Doria A Rolls Royce luxury car was also on Andrea Doria

A series of lawsuits were filed by both ship lines in response to the disaster The reasons argued included

Andrea Doria landed on the ocean bottom sideways with her left side facing up in good condition At first the top of the shipwreck was in water about convert160ftm deep It was a popular destination for divers However the Andrea Doria has become a difficult ship to explore The wreck is at coord4049167 6985000nameWreck of SS Andrea Doria

More recently the top part of the ship has collapsed Inside the ship many supports have broken The ship is slowly getting shorter as its weight presses downwards The top of the wreck is now convert190ftm below the water Fifteen people have died exploring the Andrea Doria

The front of Stockholm was eventually fixed About 1 million was spent Now Stockholm is named Athena and still sails

Several books have been published about Andrea Doria This is a list of some of them

A memorial wreath was put at the place where Andrea Doria sank in July 2002

The Hakka people are a subgroup of the Han Chinese people They live mainly in the provinces of Guangdong Jiangxi and Fujian in China and speak the Hakka language The Hakkas have had an important influence on Chinese and overseas Chinese history in particular they have been a source of revolutionary political and military leaders Some of them were Deng Xiaoping Lee Kuan Yew and Thaksin Shinawatra

Deng Xiaoping listen was an important Chinese revolutionary politician and reformer He was leader of the Communist Party of China Deng never held office as the head of state or the head of government but was the de facto leader of the Peoples Republic of China from 1978 to the early 1990s Deng has often been described as a pragmatist due to his open market policies after the death of Mao whilst not deviating much from the original socialist elements of the Peoples Republic of China

Reform means a useful change or sometimes broken wikt linkreversionreversion to a pure original state 

Reform is generally distinguished from revolution Revolution means basic or radical change reform may be no more than fine tuning or the removing of serious wrongs without changing the whole system Reform seeks to improve the system as it stands never to overthrow it 

The UK government frequently uses the term reform to describe changes to public services such as the National Health Service But these changes are not accepted by all people as useful 

A note about grammar when used to describe something which is physically formed again such as re casting it in a moldmould or a band that gets back together the proper term is re form not reform

The Battle of Granada was a siege of the city of Granada It was fought several months and lead to the surrender of Granada on January 2 1492 The forces of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile fought against the armies of the Muslim Emirate of Granada 

This relatively small campaign was of enormous consequences because Granada was the last outpost of Al Andalus in Spain and its fall meant the end of 780 years of Muslim control in the Iberian Peninsula It also was the last act in the Reconquista the campaign by the medieval Christian states of Spain to drive out the Moorish invaders

Granada still celebrates the 2nd of January

Bibliography 

The Emirate of Granada was established in 1228 As the Reconquista was very successful after the conquest of Cordoba in 1236 the emirate officially became a tributary state in 1238 and was called the Kingdom of Granada The Nasrid emirs and kings were responsible for building most of the palaces in the Alhambra The taifa became a vassal state of the Christian kingdom of Castile for the next 250 years The Nasrid sultans and kings paid tribute to the Christian kings and cooperated with them in the battle against rebellious Muslims under Castilian rule 

On January 2 1492 the last Muslim leader Muhammad XII surrendered complete control of Granada to Ferdinand and Isabella after the city was besieged

Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone nicknamed Sly Stallone is an Italian American actor director producer and screenwriter He was one of the biggest box office draws in the world from the 1970s to the 1990s Sylvester Stallone is an action hero icon He has played two famous movie characters Rocky Balboa the boxer who overcame challenges to fight for love and glory and John Rambo a brave soldier who did violent missions

Stallone was born in New York City and he is the son of Frank Stallone Sr a hairdresser and Jackie Stallone an astrologer former dancer and supporter of wrestling for women During his birth doctors used broken wikt linkforcepsforceps an instrument that looks like a pair of pincers or tongs that damaged a nerve and caused paralysis in parts of Stallones face The paralysis caused his well known broken wikt linkslurredslurred speech and drooping lower lip

Stallones grandfather Silvestro Stallone was an immigrant from Gioia del Colle in the province of Bari Stallones mother was born in Washington DC and she was the daughter of a Parisian socialite When Stallone was between the ages of two and five he boarded in Queens and he only saw his parents on the weekends In 1951 he went back to live with his parents in Maryland where they owned beauty salons In 1961 he was enrolled in Devereaux Manor a private school for children that was in Berwyn Pennsylvania After he graduated from there he went to beauty school

In the 1960s Stallone stopped going to beauty school after he won a scholarship for the American College of Switzerland in Leysin There he studied drama and was well received in school productions When he went back to America he went to the Theater Arts Department at University of Miami for three years He came within a few credit hours of graduation before he decided to drop out and try a career at writing screenplays under the pen names Q Moonblood and JJ Deadlock At the same time he started acting in small parts in movies

Later Stallone asked that his acting and life experiences be accepted in exchange for his remaining credits and the President of the University of Miami gave him a Bachelors of Fine Arts degree in 1999

Stallone had his first role in the softcore pornography film Party at Kitty and Studs which was later re released as Italian Stallion He was paid US200 for two days work An uncut version of the film was released in 2007 and it claimed to show actual hardcore footage of Stallone However trade journal AVN said that Stallone was not in the hardcore scenes In 2008 scenes from Party at Kitty and Studs were in a German version of Roger Colmonts hardcore film White Fire

Stallone also starred in the broken wikt linkeroticerotic play called Score which had 23 performances at the Martinique Theatre from October 28  November 15 1971 It was later made into a film by Radley Metzger

Stallones other first few film roles were small and he did brief appearances that he did not get credit for in Woody Allens Bananas as a subway thug in the thriller Klute as an extra dancing in a club and in the Jack Lemmon vehicle The Prisoner of Second Avenue as a young person In the Lemmon film Jack Lemmon chases tackles and broken wikt linkmugmugs Stallone thinking that Stallones character is a thief He also starred in the broken wikt linkcultcult hit The Lords of Flatbush In 1975 he played supporting roles in Farewell My Lovely Capone and another broken wikt linkcultcult hit Death Race 2000 He also made guest appearances on the TV series Police Story and Kojak

Stallone was not very well known by a lot of people until his role in Rocky On March 24 1975 he saw the Muhammed AliChuck Wepner fight which gave him the idea for Rocky That night Stallone went home and in three days he had written the script for Rocky After that he tried to sell the script with the intent of playing the lead role Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler both liked the script and planned on having a star like Burt Reynolds or James Caan to play the lead character Rocky was nominated for ten Academy Awards this included Best Actor and Best Original Screenplay nominations for Stallone

The second movie Rocky II which Stallone had also written and directed was released in 1979 and also became a huge success The money it made was over US200 million

Apart from the Rocky films Stallone did many other films in the late 1970s and early 1980s which were critically acclaimed but were not successful at the box office He received critical praise for films such as FIST a social narrative styled drama where he plays a warehouse worker who becomes involved in the labor union leadership In Paradise Alley he plays one of three brothers who is a con artist and who helps his other brother who is involved in wrestling

Cone cells or simply cones special photoreceptor cells in the retina They react to light and work best in relatively bright light Cone cells are less sensitive to light that rod cells Human eyes usually have different types of cone cells This makes it possible to distinguish different colors Rod cells are more sensitive to light but cannot tell colors apart In a publication done in 1935 Osterberg thinks that there are about 6 million cone cells in a human eye 

That way cones allow to tell colors apart Their reaction to stimuli is faster that of the rod cells For this reason they can perceive finer details and more rapid changes in images Because humans usually have three kinds of cones with different photopsins which have different response curves and thus respond to variation in color in different ways they have trichromatic vision Being color blind can change this and there have been reports of people with four or more types of cones giving them tetrachromatic vision

Bruno Walter was a German born conductor pianist and composer He was one of the greatest conductors of his time He grew up in Germany but later became an Austrian and when the Nazis came to power he moved to several other countries finally settling in the United States where he became an American citizen His name was originally Bruno Schlesinger but from 1896 he was usually known as Bruno Walter Walter became his official surname in 1911 when he became an Austrian citizen

Bruno was born into a Jewish family in Berlin He had his early musical education at the Stern Conservatory when he was eight and played the piano in public when he was nine He went to concerts which were conducted by the great Hans von Blow Two years later in 1891 he heard Wagner operas in Bayreuth These experiences made him want to be a conductor

Bruno started his conducting career at the Cologne Opera in 1894 Later that year he went to the Hamburg Opera to work as a chorus director There he met and worked with Gustav Mahler from whom he learned a lot Mahler found him a job conducting at the opera house in Breslau This is when he changed his name from Schlesinger to Walter He then went to Riga returning to Berlin in 1900 where he conducted at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden where he worked with famous people such as Richard Strauss and Karl Muck

In 1901 Mahler invited Walter to be his assistant at the Court Opera in Vienna At his first performance he conducted Verdis Aida He was becoming very famous all over Europe He performed in Prague and in London where in 1910 he conducted Tristan und Isolde and Ethel Smyths The Wreckers at Covent Garden A few months after Mahlers death in 1911 Walter led the first performance of Das Lied von der Erde in Munich as well as Mahlers Symphony No 9 in Vienna the next year

Walter became an Austrian citizen in 1911 but two years later he went to Germany to become the Royal Bavarian Music Director in Munich The next year Walter conducted his first concert in Moscow He continued to conduct during First World War conducting operas by composers including Erich Korngold and Hans Pfitzner Among his friends in Munich was Eugenio Pacelli who later became Pope Pius XII

Walter left Munich in 1922 and went to New York the next year He conducted the New York Symphony Orchestra in Carnegie Hall He later conducted in Detroit Minnesota and Boston 

When he returned to Europe Walter was invited to play in many places including Berlin Leipzig Milan and London where he was chief conductor of the German seasons at Covent Garden from 1924 to 1931 

In the late 1920s the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler often complained that conductors at the Berlin opera were Jews He often talked about Walter adding that his real name was Schlesinger When the Nazis came to power in 1933 Walter left Austria He often conducted the Concertgebouw Orchestra and was invited to conduct concerts in New York with the New York Philharmonic When the Nazis took power in Austria Walter was conducting in Paris France offered Walter French citizenship His daughter was in Vienna She was arrested by the Nazis but Walter managed to persuade them to free her

On 1 November 1939 he sailed to the United States where he lived for the rest of his life His home was in Beverly Hills California Many people who lived there had fled from Europe because of the Nazis They became his friends They included the German writer Thomas Mann He worked with many famous American orchestras including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra the Los Angeles Philharmonic the NBC Symphony Orchestra the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra After the war he often came back to Europe He performed at the Edinburgh Festival and in Salzburg Vienna and Munich In his later life he made many stereo recordings with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra He made his last live concert appearance on 4 December 1960 with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and pianist Van Cliburn His last recording was a series of Mozart overtures with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra at the end of March in 1961 Bruno Walter died of a heart attack in his Beverly Hills home in 1962

Between 1923 and 1961 Walter made hundreds of recordings The earlier recordings made at a time when his conducting was at its best are often rather poor recordings When he made his last recordings after stereo records had been invented he was already quite ill In his early years he gave some of the first performances of Mahlers music He conducted the first performance of Das Lied von der Erde with the Vienna Philharmonic In 1936 he made the first recording of the same work with the same orchestra which still had the same leader Arnold Ros who was Mahlers brother in law This recording was made just before the Nazi Anschluss which forced Walter and Ros into exile Many years later in 1952 Walter and the Vienna Philharmonic once again made a famous recording of Das Lied von der Erde with the singers Kathleen Ferrier and Julius Patzak He also recorded Mahlers Ninth Symphony Since Walter had worked closely with Mahler and Mahler had never conducted either of these two great works of his we can imagine that Walters recordings show us how Mahler might have wanted the music to be played Walter made many recordings of other great Germanic composers such as Mozart Haydn Beethoven Schubert Johannes Brahms Johann Strauss II and Anton Bruckner

Walter was known as a kind modest man quite unlike some other conductors of the time who behaved like dictators He was an excellent pianist and sometimes accompanied singers such as Kathleen Ferrier at recitals He also composed several works He wrote an autobiography called Theme and Variations

Karl Muck was a German conductor He was one of the greatest conductors of his day especially famous for his conducting of operas by Richard Wagner

Karl Mucks father was a Bavarian politician and amateur musician After his school years he studied music at the Conservatory in Wrzburg He also studied classical philology at the University of Heidelberg In 1877 he continued his music studies in Leipzig learning the piano with Carl Reinecke His first public performance was in 1880 the year in which he graduated with a doctorate playing the piano in the Piano Concerto by Xaver Scharwenka at the Leipzig Gewandhaus

Soon he spent all his time conducting operas He conducted in Zrich Salzburg Brno and Graz and got a conductors job in Prague and later in Berlin He conducted the operas of Wagners Ring Cycle with great success as well as many performances of Parsifal In 1912 he became the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and from 1922 until he retired in 1933 he conducted the Hamburg Philharmonic Orchestra 

Muck was one of the first conductors to be internationally famous for travelling about conducting orchestras in many parts of the world He was a strict conductor who thought it was very important that the players should do exactly what the composer asks for in the score

He was imprisoned in the United States during World War I because of his support for Germany and because he refused to conduct the Star Spangled Banner After the war he was sent away and not allowed to return to America After his death a square in Hamburg was named after him although in 1997 it was renamed Johannes Brahms Square because Muck had praised Adolf Hitler

A town square is a large open area in the centre of a town Town squares were traditionally places where people came together to meet or to sell and buy things or to be entertained They often had markets or they were used for concerts They are often surrounded by shops or cafs

Other names for town square are civic center city square urban square market square public square Platz plaza piazza and place 

Many town squares in the 20th century became used as car parks In recent years cars have been banned from some town squares so that people can enjoy the open space once more free from traffic and pollution

In other parts of towns there are often smaller open spaces which are called squares They are often square in shape but some are different shapes

Some famous squares include Red Square in Moscow Beijings Tiananmen Square in Beijing Times Square in New York City and Trafalgar Square in London

Fiat money is legal tender or currency which has value only because a government says so Fiat money such as US dollars can be used to buy things

Some economists argue that an economy can only grow if it can produce more capital goods and not more money in the form of credit This means that good economies must produce things rather than borrow money to buy things produced in other countries

Alan Greenspan was an early critic of fiat money arguing that Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the confiscation of wealth He thought the value of money should be backed by gold

In the psychology ideas of Freud the anal stage is said to follow the oral stage of development in babies and young kids This is usually when they are learning toilet training Freud made a theory which said that children who experience troubles during this time may develop anal personality traits as well as a general interest in collecting and keeping things

Although Freuds theories have been influential research suggests pattern of attitudes of parental attitudes has a major effect on how a baby will grow up

The San Joaquin River is one of the two major rivers of California in the United States At convert330mikm long it is the second longest river in California after the Sacramento River It begins on the west Sierra Nevada Mountains and flows west and north to its end at San Francisco Bay at the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta Its basin which is about 32000 square miles in size contains mostly farmland The river provides drinking water to over 22 million California citizens Its three largest tributaries are the Merced Tuolumne and Stanislaus rivers

The river was once one of the richest river ecosystems in California However now over convert60mikm of the river is dry except during floods because lots of water has been taken away for irrigation In fact below Friant Dam a dam built in the 1940s on the San Joaquin River 95 percent of the rivers flow is dry Much of the river is polluted destroying the historic population of chinook salmon once the southernmost in the United States Pesticides selenium and many more toxic materials are carried by the San Joaquin into San Francisco Bay

Now one of the largest projects in the American West has been begun to restore the San Joaquin River On September 13 2006 the Natural Resources Defense Council signed an agreement with Friant Dam users and the United States Department of the Interior This agreement would restore the San Joaquin River below the dam reducing pollution

Three forks of the San Joaquin River join to form the San Joaquin River at two places called Balloon Dome and Junction Butte 

The river continues west into the Central Valley of California and is joined by many other rivers flowing off the Sierra Nevada mountains The most largest of these are the Stanislaus River Tuolumne River and Merced River The Tuolumne and Merced river both flow out of Yosemite National Park 

As the river flows north and west it is joined by the following tributaries

The San Joaquin River and its tributaries pass throughfeed the following lakes and reservoirs

Several man made channels are also part of the river system

The San Joaquin River eventually meets the Sacramento River forming the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta This is one of the biggest estuaries in the United States It is near the city of Antioch At this place the San Joaquin River splits into two rivers the Old River and the Middle River The Old River sometimes confuses fish to go down its channel As a result a wall is built between the San Joaquin River and the Old River

Before humans began to develop the Central Valley in the 1850s the San Joaquin River and its surrounding lands were one of the richest biological habitats in California In winter the river would flood the valley leaving behind wetlands These wetlands became rich habitat for birds and other animals The habitat of the endangered San Joaquin Kit Fox and the riparian brush rabbit also was near the San Joaquin River 

In 1942 a big dam Friant Dam was built on the San Joaquin River This dam took away a lot of water from the river to irrigate crops provide drinking water and provide electricity The dam destroyed the salmon habitat in the river and also destroyed the creation of these wetlands 

The Friant Dam is

The San Joaquin River has been used a lot for shipping of products via boats and ships otherwise known as navigation The river was first used for navigation during the California Gold Rush of 1849 Boats carried people over convert200mikm up the river to look for gold in the mountains Now there is a channel that runs all the way upriver to the city of Stockton This channel allows big ships to sail in the river up to this point Sediment however has clogged a lot of the river channel above this point preventing big ships from going any farther

The Central Valley is a very large valley in the middle of California in the United States About 42000 square miles in size it is about the size of the state of Tennessee It consists of two connected differently named valleys the Sacramento Valley and the San Joaquin Valley

The Sierra Nevada Mountains border the valley on the east side while the Coast Range borders it on the west side The Sacramento River flows through the north part of the Central Valley This part of the valley is also called the Sacramento Valley The San Joaquin River flows through the larger south part of the Central Valley also called the San Joaquin Valley Both rivers merge eventually and empty into the Pacific Ocean via San Francisco Bay The capital of California Sacramento is located in the north part of the Central Valley In total the Central Valley is around convert450mikm long

The Central Valley has 18 California counties 15 of these counties are among the 25 most productive farmland in California Overall the Central Valley economy depends on farming However this has led to serious environmental damages such as pesticides and selenium and other bad materials being washed into the rivers and polluting the San Francisco Bay Many once productive acres of farmland in the valley have now been lost to contamination by salt

The valley floor is a flat smooth land area covering about 42000 square miles in size convert450mikm long and convert40mikm wide It covers 18 California counties These counties are

 from north to south

The Sierra Nevada mountains are on the east side of the valley These mountains are very tall and steep Lots of rivers and streams flow off the Sierra Nevada The highest mountain in the Sierra Nevada is Mount Whitney which is also the tallest mountain in California and the rest of the United States On the west side there is the California Coast Ranges an extension of the Pacific Coast Ranges Its highest point is approximately 8848

The Sacramento River begins in the north part of the Central Valley near Mount Shasta It actually begins in the Cascade Range which are mountains north of the Central Valley though most of its length is in the Central Valley The Sacramento River flows south about convert447mikm to San Francisco Bay Some of its tributaries include the Pit River Feather River and American River All these rivers come off the Sierra Nevada

The San Joaquin River begins at the south Sierra Nevada and flows west and north into the Central Valley and to San Francisco Bay Altogether its length is sone convert330mikm The San Joaquin is more polluted than the Sacramento and about convert63mikm of it is actually dry

Together the Sacramento San Joaquin river system is the water supply of 22 23 million people in California

The climate of the Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley are very different The Sacramento Valley has a Mediterranean climate This means that it has warm dry summers and cool wet winters The San Joaquin Valley is much hotter and drier Most of it is Mediterranean steppe which is similar to Mediterranean except that it is warmer and drier Some of it however can be close to desert climate This section of the Central Valley is said to have the worst air quality in California

The Central Valley is home to about 65 million people The ten largest cities in or near the valley are by population

However since most of the land area of the Central Valley is devoted to farming the population density is actually quite low The population density of the Central Valley is 155 people per square mile In contrast the population density of Los Angeles the biggest city in California is 25904 people per square mile

Farming has always been the main economy of the Central Valley Except for the city of Sacramento where the focus is on the government the rest is mostly agricultural Immigrants provide a large amount of the work done in farms in the Central Valley Overall 123 of jobs in the Central Valley are directly agriculture related Not including Sacramento County the percentage is 16

The main road transport routes through the Central Valley are Interstate 5 and California State Route 99 These two highways run from north to south Interstate 5 is the larger of the two and carries more traffic Highway 99 is older than Interstate 5 The Highway 99 separates from Route 5 at the south end of the Central Valley and joins again at the north end of the valley

The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad go through the Central Valley as well Some of their branch lines include

Amtrak is one of the main rail service providers in the Central Valley and is also popular in much of the rest of California

The 715 mile California Aqueduct the longest aqueduct in California runs through the Central Valley Water from the northern Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada goes into this aqueduct The Central Valley Project is another major water supply project in the Central Valley This project includes

A Separately Managed Account or SMA is a type of financial investment account popular with some individual investors SMAs are offered by financial consultants and brokerage firms and managed by independent money managers A money manager is simply a business that manages stock and other securities portfolios or baskets of investments for an investor SMAs have varying fee structures Common characteristics of SMA programs are they provide open investment choices have multiple managers and offer a customized investment portfolio created for a clients specific needs By customizing the portfolio investors can limit the investment risk with various strategies such as using stock options according to the Wall Street Journal  

SMAs were first introduced in the US in the 1970s by the former investment firm EF Hutton  Since that time SMAs have grown in popularity are offered in the US UK Australia and other countries For some investors Separately Managed Accounts are rivals to mutual funds and other types of investments 

While there is no long term research that compares SMAs performance to that of mutual funds or other investment categories the available research does show them as a strong competitor

Morningstar Inc a fund research firm released research that showed that SMAs beat mutual funds in 2008 Morningstar said that SMAs outperformed mutual funds in 25 of 36 stock and bond market categories that year In addition Morningstar said that from 2006 to 2008 SMAs surpassed mutual funds in 22 of 26 categories   

The Wall Street Journal reported that Separately Managed Accounts may beat popular mutual funds because SMAs tend to have smaller amounts of assets than popular mutual funds allowing them to trade more nimbly    

Unlike mutual funds SMAs permit the investor to tailor their basket of stocks and bonds which can limit the investment risk Registered Rep an investment trade magazine said that SMAs also can provide tax advantages that may not be available with mutual funds and other investments  

The Wall Street Journal recognized top SMA performers including PTI Securities Futures LPs Protected Index Program and Robinson Value Management Ltds Market Opportunity Composite Strategy   

Pensions Investments a US investment trade magazine reported on several of the highest performing SMAs for 2008 

Financial experts point out that past performance of any investment is not a predictor of future performance So investors should talk with a licensed financial adviser and carefully review all information available before making any investment decision In addition before making an investment investors should check with the appropriate licensing and regulatory authorities to ensure that the firm offering SMAs is properly licensed and in good standing

A taifa was an independent Muslim ruled principality Taifas developed during the history of Iberia They were usually emirates or little kingdoms but there was one oligarchy as well A number of taifas formed in the Al Andalus after the end of the Umayyad Caliphate of Cordba in 1031

The reason that taifas developed was that there was an administrative division of the Umayyad Caliphate of Crdoba and also an ethnic division of the elite of this state It was divided among Arabs Berbers Eastern European former slaves and Iberian Muslims known as Mulades 

There was a second period when taifas developed That was about the middle of the 12th century when the Almoravid rulers were in decline

In the 11th century and again in the mid 12th century the emirs of thr taifas competed very much among themselves not only militarily but also for cultural broken wikt linkprestigeprestige They tried to recruit the most famous poets and artisans

After the end of the Caliphate the rival Muslim kingdoms were much weaker than the Christian ones and had to submit to them and to pay tribute 

The taifa princes appealed for North African warriors to help them fighting Christian kings on two occasions The Almoravids were invited after the fall of Toledo and the Almohads after the fall of Lisbon These warriors did not in fact help the taifa emirs but rather annexed their lands to their own North African empires

Taifas often hired Christian mercenaries to fight neighbouring realms The most dynamic taifa which conquered most of its neighbours before the Almoravid invasion was Seville Zaragoza was also very powerful and expansive but broken wikt linkinhibitinhibited by the neighbour Christian states of the Pyrenees Zaragoza Toledo and Badajoz had previously been the border military districts of the Caliphate

The Nasrid dynasty or Banuu Nasri was the last Arab and Muslim dynasty in Spain The Nasrid dynasty came to power after the defeat of the Almohad dynasty in 1212 at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa Twenty three different emirs ruled Granada from the founding of the dynasty in 1232 by Muhammed I ibn Nasr until January 2 1492 when Muhammad XII of Granada surrendered to the Christian Spanish kingdoms of Aragon and Castile Today the most visible evidence of the Nasrids is the Alhambra palace built under their rule 

The Almoravids were a Berber dynasty from the Sahara that ruled over a wide area of northwestern Africa and the Iberian peninsula during the 11th century

Under this dynasty the Moorish empire included present day Morocco Western Sahara Mauritania Gibraltar Tlemcen and a great part of what is now Senegal and Mali in the south and Spain and Portugal to the north in Europe At its greatest extent the empire stretched 3000 kilometres north to south

Different bases are often used in computers Binary is used because at the most simple level computers can only deal with 0s and 1s Hexadecimal is used because of how computers group binary digits together Every four binary digits turn into one hexadecimal digit when changing between them Because there are more than 10 digits in hexadecimal the six digits after 9 are shown as A B C D E and F

The oldest systems of counting used base one Making marks on a wall using one mark for each item counted is an example of unary counting Some old systems of measurement use the duodecimal radix This is shown in English as there are words such as dozen and gross and lengths such as feet

When typing a base the small number which shows how many digits in that base is usually in base 10 This is because if the radix was written in the base it is it would always be 10 so there would be no way of knowing what base it was 

Here are some examples of how numbers are written in different bases

The Portuguese Man o War is a Cnidarian invertebrate It lives in the sea It is sometimes called the blue bubble or man of war Its common name comes from a Portuguese war ship of the 15th and 16th century The ship had triangular sails similar in shape to the bladder of the Man o War

The Portuguese Man o War has a reputation for swarming in groups of thousands It is also known for its powerful sting

Physalia look like a jellyfish but they really are not The Portuguese Man o War is not a single animal It is rather a siphonophore This is a colony of four kinds of zooids Zooids are very small highly modified individuals These zooids are specialized polyps and medusoids Though structurally similar to other cnidarians the zooids do not live by themselves they are attached to each other Each type of zooid does not have some structure and functions It depends for survival on the others doing what it cannot do by itself

A similar group of animals are the chondrophores They are specialized hydroids which also float at the surface of the open ocean

The Loggerhead Turtle feeds on the Portuguese Man o War It is a common part of the turtles diet The skin of the turtle is too thick for the Portuguese Man o Wars sting to enter and launch its venom The sea slug Glaucus atlanticus and the violet snail Janthina janthinaalso feed on the Portuguese Man o War The blanket octopus Tremoctopus is immune to the venom of the Portuguese Man o War The blanket octopus has been known to rip off the Portuguese Man o Wars tentacles and use them for defensive purposes

The Portuguese Man o War is often found with many different kinds of marine fish Some of them are shepherd fish clown fish and yellow jack These species are rarely found anywhere else The clown fish can swim among the tentacles without being stung This is possibly due to its mucus that does not trigger the nematocysts The shepherd fish seems to avoid the larger stinging tentacles It feeds on the smaller tentacles under the gas bladder These fish benefit from the shelter by the stinging tentacles It also helps the Portuguese Man o War for the presence of these species may attract other fish to feed on

Sleep apnea is a problem certain people have When they sleep they may stop breathing for short periods These periods can last for 10 seconds or more 3 4 breaths are missed As a result of this those affected are often tired during the day Mainly because such people also tend to have microsleep they should not drive vehicles 

Microsleep is a very short sleep that occurs when people are awake It can last from under a second to about 30 seconds It may happen as a result of sleep deprivation fatigue sleep apnea narcolepsy or hypersomnia Microsleeps can occur at any time Most of the time they do so without warning When people have a microsleep during conversation they may lose track of the subject that was talked about 

Microsleep can be extremely dangerous in situations when people drive a car work on a machine or otherwise need to stay alert People with microsleeps usually are not aware of them They instead believe that they were awake all the time One example is called gap driving a person is driving a car and suddenly realizes that several seconds have passed by unnoticed The driver does not feel that she or he has been asleep during those missing seconds although this is in fact what happened The sleeping driver is at very high risk for having an accident during microsleep 

Many accidents and catastrophes have resulted from microsleep episodes in these circumstances For example a microsleep episode is claimed to have been one factor contributing to the Waterfall train disaster in 2003 the driver had a heart attack and the guard who should have reacted to the trains increasing speed is said by his defender to have microslept 

Hello all

I assume that nothing has happened and I want to relaunch the discussion on what icons to use

Thats pretty much all from my side  Eptalon 2033 26 March 2009

My two cents I would much rather have the icons be something that looks professional and would give the readers of the articles the impression that we actually care about or VGAs and GAs The stars that TOM changed our icons to are not professional and do not give our readers the sense of professionalism that we should be showing to our readers Heck that might even get those readers to join our site I understand that TOM went through a lot of work into making the icons however I do not think that those icons are the way to go I believe that the icons that I changed them to were much better and as Djsasso brought up above the symbols need to be different for our color blind editors to be able to differentiate between GAs and VGAs I believe that I accomplished that The tlsupport image is pretty universal and I believe that that means that it resembles other Wikipedias versions of this The gold VGA star that I added is used on one of the Slavic language Wikipedias Thanks for hearing me out Razorflame 2145 26 March 2009

Just wondering if this is possible to create a tool similar to VandalWarner that would put the following automatically into your edit summary if you clicked the button based on enPAGENAME 1629 2 April 2009

Hi could I invite some more of the community to take part in the discussion for the proposal There seems to be a fair bit of support for the idea but we really need more of the community to discuss the proposal Discussion is taking place at User talkFr33kmanNon free content proposal and the entire proposal can be reviewed here Thanks fr33kman talk 1951 19 March 2009

 I see the two basic opposition positions as 1 legal and 2 not enough editors I dont think that legal issues will be a major problem here No one is going to be sued because they uploaded a non free image that didnt meet the criteria the worst that will happen is that the lawyers for the copyright holder will make a request that the image is removed We would then of course remove the offending image Regarding not enough editors the upload flag would not be given to everyone youd have to show that you can use it wisely and I think that there is enough editors now to support the limited amount of images thatd be uploaded on a day to day basis enWP has issues with non free content because it has so many people who are able to upload restricting the number of editors doing uploads would fix this I only ask that editors ignore their prior reasons and deal with this proposal as if it were a new idea Think on it and then tell us where you are opinionwise Thanks fr33kman talk 2100 19 March 2009

You may ask for image uploader at the administrators noticeboard or on an bureaucrats talk page You may also use image uploader requests for requesting image uploader Please note these few rulesId support if the following were true

If all this is sorted you have my support Kennedy 0858 20 March 2009

Ive asked Mike Godwin Esq to chime in on the discussion from a legality viewpoint Thanks fr33kman talk 0559 21 March 2009

The following is an email I received from Mike Godwin JD the WMF legal counsel He indicates that the project the uploader and the WMF have negligible legal worries in allowing fair use image uploading

 Basically the Wikimedia Foundation has significant protection under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act The general procedure is that a copyright holder will contact us with a complaint if an image is claimed to be infringing and well remove it We normally wont raise the defense of fair use  we get complete immunity if we simply remove the image

This leaves the uploader  few uploaders are going to be worth suing especially if there has been a removal of the image under the DMCA takedown provisions which immunizes WMF and reduces or eliminates damage to the copyright holder Since the community is typically pro active in removing copyrighted material in response to a complaint we usually dont even see the formalities of a DMCA takedown notice 

Overall it is ordinarily the case that if there is a credible fair use justification for use of material in any project the risk of liability for WMF is very low and the risk for an uploader isnt much higher

 Mike 

I personally think this closes down the legal objection to fair use images fr33kman talk 2134 21 March 2009

I dont know if Ive been around long enough on simplewp to be trusted with the uploader ability but Ive helped out a bunch at enWikipediaMedia copyright questions and am quite well versed with non free content guidelines on en and the requirements to comply with them Ill be glad to offer advice to our uploaders on the proper way to tag images As far as I see it unless we actually block users from uploading the best way to do this is to change the current QD definition to exclude non free images uploaded by authorized users Otherwise all other image uploads would still be immediately deleted by the first available admin There is technically no need for a special tag as these users would not be doing anything they cant actually do now Wed still have to agree on a way of selecting who should be allowed to upload non free images and not have them immediately deleted EhJJTALK 0027 23 March 2009

I would note that legal issues were only one of many reasons put out for why it wont work Its not even the biggest issue I still think the project will be irreperably harmed if we switch to allowing images People keep arguing why should such and such limit our ability to make the wiki better but I still dont see it as a given that images would make the wiki better We could limit it to trusted users as mentioned above but what would constitute a trusted userand the other option as mentioned with speedying if its not by someone allowedwell that just increases the workload of admins which was the whole point of not allowing images in the first place Djsasso 2254 23 March 2009

A perhaps very simple question Counting benevolently we have perhaps 30 people editing here who do you think is going to run this  The old DYK is history and did not neede any new privileges Eptalon 2305 23 March 2009

Well I think that all the arguments have now been stated and its time to hold a poll and see if we can establish a consensus or not This is a poll not a vote Its merely to see if there is a growing consensus or not No action will be taken on the results Its a sort of plebiscite and not a referendum Right now where consensus lies is hard to determine More discussion will take place after this poll People can close it early if they disagree with it 

Do we really need a vote for this Its completely unecessary consensus should be looked at through discussion not voting Goblin 1603 26 March 2009

I think that unless objections are raised by others we can close this proposal at this time Reasons for and against have been given and the debate seems to lean towards not going forward at this time Personally my reasons for allowing fair use have all been given in the proposal and I am personally unable to offer more valid reasoning than what I have already offered I think that we can call the debate a success however as legal concerns were raised and were addresses by way of official WMF opinion and this will make success more likely in any future proposal assuming other objections can be addressed I think another admin should consider whether or not the debate is exhausted at this time and if so to archive wrap the discussion Thank you to all for taking part fr33kman talk 1237 3 April 2009

Its clear from the discussion above that there is still no clear consensus for this proposal Its been a useful discussion but something that we are apparently still not ready for here on Simple English Wikipedia The Rambling Man 1300 3 April 2009

Request we have a bunch of articles sitting at WPPGA and a couple at WPPVGA Its been mighty quiet over there in the past few days so please please lets get the Wikipedia up and rocking Go read a PGAPVGA make suggestions give commentsget involved The Rambling Man 1828 3 April 2009

Hello all Yesterday Synergy deleted around half a dozen articles I created under the G12 criterion ie as copyright violation  Each article was a stub and each was created to satisfy a higher purpose namely that a PVGA should not have a single red link While each article was similarly worded to its en wiki counterpart each article was also stripped to a minimum perhaps two sentences which contained the most important facts such as name birth date and place and profession Within the English speaking Wikipedias there is a generally accepted style for such biographical articles and as such there will be the inevitable looky likey issue 

So thats the background I restored the articles and reworked them further making them less useful to ensure they didnt fall foul of this implementation of G12 But when I started thinking about it and looking around I found dozens of well established articles all of which are clearly based on en wiki but offer no attribution My test case at the moment is Ronald Reagan whose opening sentence is pretty much identical on this Wikipedia and en wiki No template exists on the talk page stating a dependency on the en wiki article Another case Eastern Grey Kangaroo created yesterday by an admin Peterdownunder This article once again is clearly based on en wiki and in fact Peter has said as much when he created the article with an edit summary of Started page from enwiki Is this sufficient attribution

Late yesterday Eptalon changed WPCOPY adding a section of exceptions to the policy This change exempts very short texts Are we sure this is the correct thing to tell people

With admins speedily deleting other admins stubs weve once more found ourselves in drama I dont want to make the situation worse but I also dont want new editors here to have their work summarily deleted if it really isnt the correct approach After all the time taken to determine that a Simple article is based on en wiki is a little less than the time taken to then add a template stating thats the case rather than just speedy deletion If it is determined that its okay to G12 stubs created like this we should seek to include a serious warning banner on our Create this page telling people about how exactly to attribute such work I would be interested in the communitys comments The Rambling Man 1007 29 March 2009

I often create pages starting with the en wiki page as a starting point I will take out all complex words simplify etc to get it into simple english This will mean that the page will often look the same uses the same pictures etc as the original I always put an attribution in the edit summary and a note on the talk page Copyright should not be a problem with this process as the the GDFL rules allow copying between wikis as long as there is attribution Pages copied in this way should only be deleted if they do not meet our simple english standard We need to be able to create simple stubs to remove redlinks while bringing some articles up to standard I always try to get back to them and add to them but this process takes time But if you have copied the stub it should be attributed even if you have then simplified or changed it There is a template to use its not hard just an extra step  Peterdownunder 1147 29 March 2009

Okay so our guideline about pages from other Wikipedia says that to adequately attribute pages copied we need to clearly state where and when you got the information from on the other Wikipedia I see a number of instances of pages being created with just a link to the English Wikipedia article not a version of it Is the guideline wrong Can we simply attribute an article without saying what version of that article we used The Rambling Man 2206 29 March 2009

It seems to me that everyone is just making up whatever policy they think is right We should base our policies on the actual text of the GFDL If youre going to write Short articles are exempt then cite the law that says that Im not a lawyer either but I think we need to find a long term solution that will stand up to scrutiny EhJJTALK 2240 29 March 2009

Hello all this is just to clarify the changes I made to WPCOPY Please note I am not a lawyer either

Of course this is all very vague as a real world example does Kilogram need to mention enKilogram as a base Our article is much shorter and not a verbatim copy yet was probably written with another wikipedia article in mind It will really be good to get a guideline which clarifies those things This unsigned comment was added by Eptalonif  on 2 When I posted the comment above my intent was not to get to an admin bashing scenario If the articles is question were really wrongly deleted they can be restored easily enough Our main aim here is to find out what is effectively a copyright violation and what isnt When we have clarified this and the articles that now look like they are wrongly deleted are still so we can restore them But before we do that we need to agree on this thread here  Eptalon 1428 30 March 2009

When I deleted the 6 or 7 articles I apparently forgot that templating the talk page could easily fix it For that I apologize Ive been developing a zero tolerance attitude for these types of creations but will wait until this is all hashed out to delete any other pages per copy vio Mind you I didnt delete any pages per how to copy but per WPCOPY or more specifically the Moving things from other Wikipedias section So if we can get back to firmly grounding and drafting a policy that is satisfactory for simple while compliant with GFDL I would appreciate it As I would like to get back to cleaning up our pedia Synergy 1902 30 March 2009

According to our current deletion policy pages that should be discussed for seven days before deletion include Pages directly copied from other Wikipedias It is not entirely clear if this encompasses portions of pages copied directly from other Wikipedias If it does then G12 currently should never apply to transwikied articles Either way we need to revisit this in parallel with redefining G12 And we ought to check our policies and guidelines actually agree with one another The Rambling Man 0911 1 April 2009

Hurricane Georges caused much damage and many deaths in on the norther Caribbean islands and the Gulf Coast of the United States Even though it was very strong caused a lot of damage and many deaths it was not the strongest costliest or dead list of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season that would be Hurricane Mitch later on Hurricane Georges crossed some islands Puerto Rico Hispaniola and Cuba before it made landfall in Mississippi Georges killed 604 people and caused 59 billion in damage much of it from high winds and severe flooding 

Hurricane Mitch was the most powerful storm of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season Hurricane Mitch was one of the most powerful storm ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean Mitch was the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane because it killed 11000 18000 in Central America and Mexico it is second only to the Great Hurricane of 1780 Mitch also caused over 6 billion in damage Because the damage and deaths were very high the name Mitch was retired and will never be used for a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean again

On October 10 a tropical wave moved off of Africa It stayed as a tropical wave because the conditions in Atlantic wasnt good enough for it to become a tropical depression or tropical storm The tropical wave became Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 22 because conditions became better On October 23 Tropical Depression Thirteen strengthened and became Tropical Storm Mitch Tropical Storm Mitch made a small loop after becoming a tropical storm and then turned north 

Tropical Storm Mitch strengthened and became Hurricane Mitch on October 24 Hurricane Mitch then turned west Mitch strengthened very fast and on October 26 Mitch reached its top winds Its top winds were are 180 mph making it a category 5 Mitch stayed as a category 5 turned south 

Mitch started weakening on October 27 and by October 29 Mitch was only a category 1 On October 29 Hurricane Mitch made landfall in Honduras with the winds at 80 mph Mitch quickly weakened into a tropical storm Tropical Storm Mitch moved very slowly and almost froze over Honduras Tropical Storm Mitch weakened into a tropical depression as it entered Guatemala 

As Tropical Depression Mitch entered Mexico it became a remnant low and was not a tropical depression anymore The remains entered the Bay of Campeche and became Tropical Storm Mitch again on November 3 Mitch moved northeast and made landfall in the Yucatn Peninsula Mitch weakened into a tropical depression over the Yucatn Peninsula Once Tropical Depression Mitch reached the Gulf of Mexico it became Tropical Storm Mitch Tropical Storm Mitch continued northeast and made landfall in Naples Florida on November 5 as a tropical storm with the winds at 65 mph 

After Tropical Storm Mitch crossed Florida it became extratropical and was no longer a tropical storm The remains were last seen on November 9 north of Great Britain 

Many countries of the in Central American Region had record amounts of rainfall

The worst affects from the hurricane were seen in Honduras where Mitch caused 7000 deaths and 38 billion in damage In Honduras rainfall could have been up to 75 inches Crops in Honduras were impacted very badly Mitch destroyed 58 of the corn output 24 of sorghum 14 of rice and 6 of the bean crop Mitch also destroyed 85 of banana 60 of sugar cane 29 of melons 28 of African palms and 18 of coffee Just the crop damage from Hurricane Mitch in Honduras was at 900 million 

Also in Nicaragua rainfall may have been up to 50 inches The rains stopped a volcano in Nicaragua instead the volcano caused a mudslide The mudslide covered an area 10 miles long and 5 miles wide Hurricane Mitch left between 500000 and 800000 people homeless Damaged in Nicaragua totaled to 1 billion and at least 3800 were killed in Nicaragua 

In the US only Florida was affected In Florida Mitch destroyed buildings in the Keys that were damaged by Hurricane Georges Mitch killed 2 people and left 40 million in damage 

Hurricane Mitch caused rain all the way down to Panama where the hurricane killed 3 people Offshore in the Caribbean Sea the hurricane sunk a boat causing 31 people to drowned In Costa Rica Hurricane Mitch caused about 4000 people to become homeless Hurricane Mitch caused mudslides that affected nearly 800 miles of road Hurricane Mitch left 92 million in damage and killed 7 people In El Salvador the flooding from Mitch destroyed 37 of the bean production 19 of the corn production and 20 losses in sugar canes Hurricane Mitch also killed 10000 cattle In El Salvador the damage from Mitch was at 400 million and 240 people were killed In Guatemala Hurricane Mitch caused 6000 houses to be destroyed and damaged 20000 others Damage just the banana and coffee exports were at 325 million Mitch caused a plane to crash leaving 11 people to get killed indirectly Mitch also caused 268 people to get killed directly Damages left from Mitch in Guatemala was at 748 million In Belize Mitch caused some crop damage and damage many roads Damage in Belize was not as bad as it could have been Mitch killed 11 in Belize but no one knows the damage it caused Hurricane Mitch caused waves about 7 feet in Jamaica Mitch killed about 3 people but no one knows the damage Also a house in Spanish Town was destroyed 

Because of the deaths and damage the name Mitch was retired Meaning the name will not be used again to name a storm in the Atlantic Ocean In 2004 the name Matthew was used instead The name Matthew will be used again in 2010 because it was not retired

Later in the war he led Soviet forces to victory at Stalingrad and Kursk broke the Siege of Leningrad destroyed the German center with Operation Bagration invaded Germany and led the Battle of Berlin

BoseEinstein condensate is what happens to some things when they are made very very cold It forms when the particles that make up something all lie down using the littlest energy Only special particles called bosons can make a BoseEinstein condensate and they can only do this if they are very close to the coldest temperature possible near to 0 K this is called absolute zero A BoseEinstein condensate is a type of change of state like when water turns into ice And like when water turns to ice it gets slippery things that are BoseEinstein condensates have 0 viscosity This means they are as slippery as possible 

Particles can only have a set amount of energy They either have the energy to bounce around in gases or just the energy to flow like a liquid or be fixed like a solid If you take enough of the particles energy away you get to the littlest amount of energy possible This is a BoseEinstein condensate This makes all of the particles exactly the same and instead of bouncing around randomly in all different directions they all bounce up and down in exactly the same way forming something called a giant matter wave

The Bose Einstein Condensate was first thought up by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein in 192425 but we then had to wait seventy years for somebody to prove that it existed Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman made the first BoseEinstein condensate in 1995 at the University of Colorado Cornell Wieman and Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT were then given the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics

Usually to get stuff cold enough to make a BoseEinstein condensate you have to first trap the stuff using magnets and then by bouncing lasers off them take all of their energy away through red shift This still does not get things quite cold enough Some of the particles will still be bouncing around a lot and only some will be lying down nicely The magnetic field is then slowly lowered bit by bit to let the faster bouncing particles out This just leaves us with the coldest and slowest atoms inside

The San Gabriel River is a river in Los Angeles and Orange counties in the state of California It is about convert75mikm long It begins in the San Gabriel Mountains and flows southwest into the Los Angeles Basin then flows into the Pacific Ocean near Long Beach and Seal Beach Like the Los Angeles River it is heavily polluted and is lined with concrete in many places

The Los Angeles River is a river flowing through Los Angeles County California in the United States About convert51mikm long it flows from a place called Canoga Park south and west to its end at the Long Beach Harbor in San Pedro Bay part of the Pacific Ocean The basin is rimmed by the San Gabriel Mountains Santa Monica Mountains and Santa Susana Mountains as well as several smaller mountain ranges Much of the water that flows in the Los Angeles River flows in from tributaries that come from the mountains

The river was once free flowing winding across a floodplain that occupied much of the Los Angeles Basin With its frequent floods it often changed course causing erosion and depositing silt in other places When the city of Los Angeles had its first settlers around the 1850s the river was its main water source With the opening of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913 the Los Angeles River was no longer needed as a water source Today the Los Angeles River runs in a fixed course through a concrete channel for nearly its whole length It is heavily polluted Plans for restoration of the river are being discussed

The watershed of the Los Angeles River covers 834 square miles The Santa Monica Mountains and smaller Simi Hills border it on the east side On the west side lies the San Gabriel Mountains and Santa Susana Mountains Seven major tributaries flow into the Los Angeles River Burbank Western Channel Aliso Wash Tujunga Wash Verdugo Wash Arroyo Seco Compton Creek and Rio Hondo 360 square miles of the watershed are open space while the remaining 474 square miles are highly developed with all kinds of land uses

The river officially begins in a place called Canoga Park in the San Fernando Valley Bell Creek and Calabasas Wash flow from opposite sides of the valley to a point where the Los Angeles River officially begins At this point the river already flows in a concrete channel In times of flood the channel can move between convert25mikm per hour to up to convert35mikm or even convert45mikm per hour 

Tujunga Wash Aliso Wash and Browns Canyon Wash join the river from the left The river flows on to a basin called the Sepulveda basin controlled by a dam at its southeastern end This basin is incredibly rich in wildlife and plants Normally there wouldn not be a year round flow of water here But because of 75 million gallons of water flowing into the river every day from the Donald C Tillman Water Reclamation Plant there is an year round flow of water This water is not suitable to be drinking water but is safe to touch

An important tributary Verdugo Wash flows in from the left The Verdugo Wash begins in the Verdugo Hills and flows west to the Los Angeles River Uniquely the intersection of Interstate 5 and Route 134 is located right above this point The Los Angeles River makes a great bend west around Griffith Park a big park in the middle of Los Angeles Here the river has an earthen bottom which is unique because most of the river is covered with concrete Further downstream there is a place uniquely named Frogtown because of the many frogs once found in the river there Downstream from this place the river picks up another important tributary Arroyo Seco on the left The Arroyo Seco begins in the San Gabriel Mountains and flows south to the Los Angeles River One important feature of the Arroyo Seco is the giant Devils Gate Dam The Arroyo Seco is free flowing in many places 

After flowing a few more miles the Los Angeles River becomes very wide The final large tributary Rio Hondo flows in from the left in the city of South Gate Notably the sediment here is over convert30000ftm deep Here the threat of floods is always present In fact in a flood in 1992 the water was only a few inches below the top of the riverbank As the river approaches San Pedro Bay and eventually the Pacific Ocean it passes by the RMS Queen Mary a retired ocean liner now a museum and hotel

The Los Angeles River was originally a free flowing river running across a wide basin that would periodically flood The river would have heavy flows in the winter and spring and little to no flow in the summer and fall However water being forced out of an aquifer below the Los Angeles Basin gave parts of the river an year round flow This phenomenon can still be seen today most notably in a place called Griffith Park where water rises out of the ground and feeds the river

The river was used for hundreds of years by Native Americans as a source of drinking water and food When Spanish explorers came to the area in the 1760s they named the river the Porciuncula seeing that it was a good site for a settlement The full name they gave the river was actually El Ro de Nuestra Seora La Reina de Los ngeles de Porcincula which translated to English means The River of Our Lady Queen of the Angels of Porcincula But they were to soon find out the Los Angeles River had and still has a long history of floods Many times when the river flooded it would change course from Ballona Creek a stream flowing into Santa Monica Bay on the northeast to its original channel flowing into San Pedro Bay One big flood in 1825 it left Ballona Creek and flowed into its old channel and Ballona Creek became a separate convert9mikm long waterway It still is that way today

The city of Los Angeles rose beside the Los Angeles River inland at the site of the old Spanish settlement In 1889 San Pedro Bay the place where the river flows into was chosen as the city harbor A series of railroads were needed to connect the city with the port The most logical route was beside the river since that was the smoothest land With the railroads came industry which rose up all along the lower Los Angeles River With its disastrous flood history and the fact that it was too shallow for boats the river was finally forced into a concrete channel beginning in 1938 

1938 was the same year that a terrible flood struck the region From February 27 to March 1 1938 a storm approached the California coast Over 44 inches of rain fell That was the equivalent of one fourth the average yearly rainfall in the area Finally on 545 AM on March 4 the rain ended and the flood slowly dropped in level it seemed similar to the earlier flood in 1934 Everyone thought that it was already over but it was not 15 hours later another storm hit Southern California dumping another 6 10 inches of rain The soils of the region could not take in any more water from the rains of the past few days The three major rivers in the region the Los Angeles San Gabriel and the Santa Ana burst their levees and flooded three California counties

It was the 5th largest flood in the recorded history of the area 5601 houses were destroyed 1500 houses were damaged and 800 cars were trapped in the mud But Los Angeles County was not as affected as neighboring Riverside County and Orange County for it was those two counties that suffered the worst floods

However the flood was not as bad as it could have been Fourteen flood control dams in the mountains and around the Los Angeles area held back huge amounts of water which would otherwise add to the flood These dams included the Hansen Dam Big Tujunga Dam and San Gabriel No 1 and No 2 At its peak the Los Angeles Rivers flow was about 38000 cubic feet per second The nearby San Gabriel Rivers flow though approached 100000 cubic feet per second Most flooded of all was the crazy mad Santa Ana River which looked like a slightly smaller version of the Mississippi

Many restoration efforts to convert the river from a concrete lined channel back to its natural state have been proposed recently Also some river conservation groups most notably Friends of the Los Angeles River have been created 

The Los Angeles River Master Plan was created in 1991 as a plan to restore a large stretch of the river and one of its large tributaries the Tujunga Wash Part of the incentive for the project is because the Great Wall of Los Angeles one of the largest murals in the world is painted on the wall of the Tujunga Wash Other than that the plan seeks to improve recreation health property value environment and education in the communities surrounding the river by building a series of parks This helps to increase the open space available in Los Angeles its open space percentage is uncharacteristically low For example the city of Boston has 9 open space over twice as much as Los Angeles 4 open space

Notably the City of Los Angeles agreed in 2007 by a 12 0 vote to spend some 2 billion USD over the next 50 years The money will be used to fund over 200 separate projects including parks walkways and pedestrian bridges along a convert31mikm stretch of the river Some factories and other buildings near the river will be removed so houses can be built closer to the river

The biggest city beside the Los Angeles River is Los Angeles There are many other cities and towns that lie beside the river

A chord progression is a part of music made up several of chords played one after another Chord progressions are important for people who write songs or play musical instruments that can play chords such as the guitar Chord progressions are used in many types of music How a piece of music sounds has to do with its chord progression

The circle of fifths is an idea in music theory that has to do with keys It also has to do with chord progressions If you have a song with the chord progression G C D you can see those chords are right next to each other in the circle So if you want to play the same song in a different key you can use any other three chords right next to each other This works for any chord progression

One of the most used chord progressions is based on the first fourth and fifth notes of a major scale In the key of C these are the C F and G chords This progression is used in many simple songs Since these songs have only three chords they are sometimes called three chord songs Many country blues rock pop and punk songs are three chord songs

Positivism is the belief that the scientific method is the best approach to discovering knowledge about things or humans In other words all true knowledge is scientific 

Although the positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of western thought from the Ancient Greeks to the present day the concept was developed in the early 19th century by the philosopher and founding sociologist Auguste Comte

In its strongest original formulation positivism could be thought of as a set of five principles

This was an important development in early 20th century Vienna led by Moritz Schlick 

It held that not just that propositions were true or false but that statements which could not be verified were meaningless Thus statements like There is a God or There is no God are not true or false but meaningless

The whole idea was explained in English by a famous little book Language truth and logic in 1935

The FBI confirmed the active development of Magic Lantern a keylogger intended to obtain passwords to encrypted e mail as part of a criminal investigation Magic Lantern was first reported in the media by Bob Sullivan of MSNBC on 20 November 2001 and by Ted Bridis of the Associated Press The FBI intends to deploy Magic Lantern in the form of an e mail attachment When the attachment is opened it installs a trojan horse on the suspects computer The trojan horse is activated when the suspect uses PGP encryption often used to increase the security of sent e mail messages When activated the trojan horse will log the PGP password which allows the FBI to decrypt user communications Symantec and other major antivirus vendors have whitelisted Magic Lantern rendering their antivirus products including Norton Internet Security incapable of detecting Magic Lantern Concerns include uncertainties about Magic Lanterns full potential and whether hackers could subvert it for purposes outside the jurisdiction of the law

Graham Cluley a technology consultant from Sophos said We have no way of knowing if it was written by the FBI and even if we did we wouldnt know whether it was being used by the FBI or if it had been commandeered by a third party Another reaction came from Marc Maiffret chief technical officer and cofounder of eEye Digital Security Our customers are paying us for a service to protect them from all forms of malicious code It is not up to us to do law enforcements job for them so we do not and will not make any exceptions for law enforcement malware or other tools

FBI spokesman Paul Bresson in response if Magic Lantern needed a court order to deploy Like all technology projects or tools deployed by the FBI it would be used pursuant to the appropriate legal process Proponents of Magic Lantern argue the technology would allow law enforcement to efficiently and quickly decrypt messages protected by encryption schemes Implementing Magic Lantern does not require physical access to a suspects computer unlike Carnivore a predecessor to Magic Lantern since physical access to a computer would require a court order

In 2006 Oli Warner published two articles comparing the system performance impact of various Windows applications including Norton Internet Security 2006 He later reran the experiments revising his methodology and included 2007 version at Symantecs request  Warner benchmarked the processor and the disk performance with and without each application compiling two scripts in C a programming language One calculated all prime numbers between 100000 and 200000 and the other tested file readwrite time BootVis was used to measure boot time All testing was conducted inside a virtualized environment created by VMware Despite the 2007 versions improvements Warner noted its significant boot delay and impact on file operations

Recent testing conducted by PassMark Software found the 2009 version had the least impact on system performance As noted earlier Symantec funded the testing and provided some of the scripts used Warners scripts were also used to test file readwrite time The second and third ranked suites were ESET Smart Security 2008 and Kaspersky Internet Security 2009 respectively Systems were benchmarked with a clean installation of Windows Vista then again with a security suite installed The 2009 version had the least impact on boot time the fastest scan speed lowest memory utilization and the program itself installed the fastest out of its competitors However the 2009 version had the second most impact on file readwrite time as highlighted by Warner earlier

Norton Internet Security have been criticized for refusing to uninstall completely leaving unnecessary files behind Versions prior to 2009 installed a separate LiveUpdate program which updates Norton branded software The user must uninstall both Norton Internet Security and the LiveUpdate component manually The LiveUpdate component is purposely left behind to update other Norton branded products if present In response Symantec developed the Norton Removal Tool to remove leftover registry keys and values along with files and folders Uninstallation will not remove subscription data preserved to prevent users from installing multiple trial copies

When Norton Internet Security 2008 is installed users encountered incompatibilities upgrading to Windows XP Service Pack 3 or Windows Vista Service Pack 1 Users report numerous invalid registry keys being added by a tool named fixcssexe resulting in an empty Device Manager and missing devices such as wireless network adapters Symantec initially blamed Microsoft for the incompatibilities but has since accepted partial responsibility

Dave Cole Symantecs senior director of product management acknowledged that users running Norton products were experiencing problems but said the numbers are small Cole also said that Symantec had done extensive testing of its products with Windows XP SP3 but this issue had not surfaced Cole essentially blamed Microsoft This is related to XP SP3 he stated Microsoft recommended users to contact Windows customer support To resolve the problem Symantec has issued a fix intended for users before upgrading Symantec also recommends disabling the tamper protection component in the 2008 release dubbed SymProtect A tool to remove the added registry entries is also available from Symantec

Sarah Hicks Symantecs vice president of consumer product management voiced concern over Windows Vista 64 bits PatchGuard feature PatchGuard was designed by Microsoft to ensure the integrity of the kernel a part of a operating system which interacts with the hardware Rootkits often hide in a operating systems kernel complicating removal Mike Dalton European president of McAfee said The decision to build a wall around the kernel with the assumption it cant be breached is ridiculous claiming Microsoft was preventing security vendors from effectively protecting the kernel while promoting its own security product Windows Live OneCare Hicks said Symantec did not mind the competition from OneCare Symantec later published a white paper detailing PatchGuard with instructions to obtain a PatchGuard exploit After negotiations and investigations from antitrust regulators Microsoft decided to allow security vendors access to the kernel by creating special API instructions

The Salton Sea is a large inland endorheic lake in the United States state of California It is approximately convert35mikm long from north to south and convert15mikm wide from east to west It is well below sea level with its surface elevation at convert 226ftm and its deepest part is convert52ftm deep The New River and Alamo River flow in from the south while the Whitewater River flows in from the north It was created in 1905 when heavy rain flooded the Colorado River and caused it to flow into the basin that now holds the Salton Sea

An endorheic basin also called an internal drainage system is a drainage basin or watershed that does not flow to one of the Earths major oceans This is unlike normal basins that collect in rivers and flow to the ocean Endorheic basins usually end in a saline lake or a salt flat They can be found in all parts of the world but usually in desert locations

Endorheic lakes in Antarctica are located in the McMurdo Dry Valleys Victoria Land Antarctica the largest ice free area in Antarctica

Much of western and Central Asia is a single giant inland basin It contains several lakes including

Australia being very dry and having exceedingly low runoff ratios due to its ancient soils has a great prominence of variable endorheic drainages The most important are

Many small lakes and ponds in North Dakota and Manitoba are endorheic some of them have salt encrustations along their shores

All these lakes are drained however either through manmade canals or via karstic phenomena Minor additional endorheic lakes exist throughout the Mediterranean countries Spain Italy Cyprus and Greece

Some of the Earths ancient endorheic systems include

The Great Salt Lake is a massive saline lake in the United States It is in the state of Utah It is an endorheic lake meaning that the water in it does not flow to the ocean The lake one of the biggest endorheic lakes in the world is in the Great Basin a large area of desert terrain covering parts of the states of Nevada Utah Idaho California and Arizona It is a very salty lake and is many times saltier than the average of the worlds oceans

The lake is about convert75mikm long and convert28mikm wide Its surface area averages 1700 square miles but because of its desert location its size changes very often The three major rivers that flow into it are the Jordan Weber and Bear rivers Because of its similarity to the Dead Sea in Asia it has been called Americas Dead Sea However the lake is a rich habitat for many species of bird shrimp and other animals

Zenobia is a genus of small shrubs in the family Ericaceae There is only one species in this genus Zenobia pulverulenta from bogs of south east of USA The common english name of this plant is Honeycup

It is an evergreen plant with blue green leaves and small white flowers in the shape of bells

The genus was named in honour of Zenobia Septimia Queen of Palmira

Honeycup is cultivated as a garden plant 

In mathematics hyperbolic geometry is a non Euclidean geometry meaning that the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry is replaced The parallel postulate in Euclidean geometry says that in two dimensional space for any given line l and point P not on l there is exactly one line through P that does not intersect l This line is called parallel to l In hyperbolic geometry there are at least two such lines through P As they do not intersect l the parallel postulate is false Models have been constructed within Euclidean geometry that obey the axioms of hyperbolic geometry These models prove that the parallel postulate is independent of the other postulates of Euclid

Because there is no hyperbolic analogue to Euclidean parallel lines the hyperbolic use of parallel and related terms varies among writers In this article the two limiting lines are called asymptotic and lines that have a common perpendicular are called ultraparallel the simple word parallel may apply to both

An interesting property of hyperbolic geometry follows from the occurrence of more than one parallel line through a point P there are two classes of non intersecting lines Let B be the point on l such that the line PB is perpendicular to l Consider the line x through P such that x does not intersect l and the angle between PB and x counterclockwise from PB is as small as possible ie any smaller angle will force the line to intersect l This is called an asymptotic line in hyperbolic geometry Symmetrically the line y that forms the same angle between PB and itself but clockwise from PB will also be asymptotic x and y are the only two lines asymptotic to l through P All other lines through P not intersecting l with angles greater than with PB are called ultraparallel to l Notice that since there are an infinite number of possible angles between and 90 degrees and each one will determine two lines through P and disjointly parallel to l there exist an infinite number of ultraparallel lines

Thus we have this modified form of the parallel postulate In hyperbolic geometry given any line l and point P not on l there are exactly two lines through P which are asymptotic to l and infinitely many lines through P ultraparallel to l

A number of geometers made attempts to prove the parallel postulate including Omar Khayym and later Giovanni Gerolamo Saccheri John Wallis Lambert and Legendre Their attempts failed but their efforts gave birth to hyperbolic geometry The theorems of Alhacen Khayyam on quadrilaterals were the first theorems on hyperbolic geometry Their works on hyperbolic geometry had a influence on its development among later European geometers including Witelo Alfonso and John Wallis

In the nineteenth century hyperbolic geometry was explored by Jnos Bolyai and Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky after whom it sometimes is named Lobachevsky published in 1830 while Bolyai independently discovered it and published in 1832 Karl Friedrich Gauss also studied hyperbolic geometry describing in a 1824 letter to Taurinus that he had constructed it but did not publish his work In 1868 Eugenio Beltrami provided models of it and used this to prove that hyperbolic geometry was consistent if Euclidean geometry was

The term hyperbolic geometry was introduced by Felix Klein in 1871 For more history see article on non Euclidean geometry

There are three models commonly used for hyperbolic geometry the Klein model the Poincar disc model and the Lorentz model or hyperboloid model These models define a real hyperbolic space which satisfies the axioms of a hyperbolic geometry Despite the naming the two disc models and the half plane model were introduced as models of hyperbolic space by Beltrami not by Poincar or Klein

M C Eschers famous prints Circle Limit III and Circle Limit IV illustrate the conformal disc model quite well In both one can see the geodesics It is also possible to see quite plainly the negative curvature of the hyperbolic plane through its effect on the sum of angles in triangles and squares 

In the Euclidean plane their angles would sum to 450 ie a circle and a quarter From this we see that the sum of angles of a triangle in the hyperbolic plane must be smaller than 180 Another visible property is exponential growth In Circle Limit IV for example one can see that the number of demons within a distance of n from the center rises exponentially The demons have equal hyperbolic area so the area of a ball of radius n must rise exponentially in n

There are several ways to physically realize a hyperbolic plane A particularly well known paper model based on the pseudosphere is due to William Thurston The art of crochet has been used to demonstrate hyperbolic planes with the first being made by Daina Taimina In 2000 Keith Henderson demonstrated a quick to make paper model dubbed the hyperbolic soccerball

In geometry the parallel postulate is one of the axioms of Euclidean geometry Sometimes it is also called Euclids fifth postulate because it is the fifth postulate in Euclids Elements

The postulate says that 

if you cut a line segment with two lines and the two interior angles the lines form add up to less than two right angles then the two lines will eventually meet if you extend them long enough

The field of geometry which follows all of Euclids axioms is called Euclidean geometry Geometries which do not follow all of Euclids axioms are called non Euclidean geometry

Some mathematicians thought that Euclids fifth postulate was much longer and more complicated than the other four postulates Many of them thought that it could be proven from the other simpler axioms Some mathematicians announced they had proven the proposition from the simpler propositions but they all turned out to be mistaken

Playfairs axiom Another more recent proposition known as Playfairs axiom is similar to Euclids fifth postulate It says that

Given a straight line and a point not on this line you can only draw one straight line through this point that will not meet the other straight line

In fact mathematicians found out that this axiom is not only similar to Euclids fifth postulate but has the exact same implications Mathematically the two propositions are called equivalent propositions Today Playfairs axiom is used more often by mathematicians than Euclids original parallel postulate

Eventually some mathematicians tried to build new geometries without using the axiom One of these new geometries is now called elliptic geometry In elliptic geometry the parallel postulate is replaced by an axiom that states that

Given a straight line and a point not on this line you cannot draw a straight line through this point that will not eventually cross the other straight line

Mathematicians found that when they replaced Euclids fifth postulate with this axiom they were still able to prove many of Euclids other theorems This formed a new geometry called elliptic geometry

One way to imagine elliptic geometry is by thinking of the surface of a globe On a globe lines of longitude appear to be parallel at the equator but they all meet at the poles

Elliptic geometry was shown to be consistent This proved that Euclids fifth postulate was independent of the other postulates After this mathematicians mostly stopped trying to prove the fifth postulate from the other four postulates Instead many mathematicians began studying other geometries that do not follow Euclids fifth postulate

Another axiom mathematicians sometimes replace Euclids fifth axiom with says that

Given a straight line and a point not on this line you can draw at least two straight lines through this point that will not eventually cross the other straight line

This is called hyperbolic geometry

Another geometry simply removes Euclids fifth postulate and does not replace it with anything This is called neutral geometry or absolute geometry

San Juan province has Santiago Rodrguez and Santiago provinces to the north Azua province to the east Baoruco province to the south and Elas Pia province to the west

The name comes from the name of the capital city San Juan de la Maguana San Juan is a short version of San Juan Bautista

Since colonial times the territory was part of Azua province until the dictator Rafael Trujillo created this province in 1938 with the name Benefactor

San Juan has a total area of 356939 km2 It has 73 of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the largest province of the country

There are six municipalities and 17 municipal districts in the province These are

In 2002 there were 241105 people living in San Juan province and just 114133 living in towns and cities The population density was 675 personskm2

The Cordillera Central is in the northern part of the province and the Sierra de Neiba runs across the southern half The area between those two mountain ranges is the San Juan valley which the Tano call Maguana meaning small valley

The highest mountain in the province is Pico Duarte with 3087 m It is the highest mountain in the West Indies and is on the border with Santiago province

The main rivers of the province are the San Juan and Yaque del Sur rivers

The climate of the province is a tropical climate hot most of the year but it is cooler in the mountains

Twelfth Night Or What You Will is a play written by William Shakespeare It is a comedy

Viola has been shipwrecked in a violent storm off the coast of Illyria in the process she has lost her twin brother Sebastian She disguises herself as a boy and assumes the name Cesario for protection Thus disguised Viola becomes a page in the service of Orsino the Duke It seems that Orsino is having little luck courting Olivia who is in mourning for the deaths of her father and brother As Orsinos proxy Viola is sent to Olivia with love letters Viola refuses to budge until she is let in to see Olivia Olivia intrigued by the impudent young boy contrives to get Cesario to return by sending her steward Malvolio after her with one of Olivias rings Viola realizes to her dismay that Olivia has fallen for her Cesario rather than Duke Orsinofurther complicated by the fact that Viola has had stirrings herself for Orsino

In the two major subplots of the play Sebastian comes ashore in Illyria thinking that Viola has drowned in the shipwreck A man named Antonio rescued him from the surf and continues to aid himat some risk to himself as Antonio fought against the Duke at one time Meanwhile in Olivias house Sir Toby Belch has hoodwinked a foppish Sir Andrew Aguecheek into supporting him by convincing him that he could be a suitor to Olivia There is a running feud between Malvolio and Belch with the help of Maria Olivias maid and Feste a clown Belch plots to make a buffoon of the steward Maria writes a love letter to Malvolio that will make him think Olivia has fallen for him

Malvolio falls entirely for the sport which eventually leads to his confinement as a madman All the while Belch is egging Sir Andrew into a duel with Violas Cesario character as she departs from Olivia Olivia is now entirely smitten with Cesario even though Viola continues to press Orsinos cause As Viola and Sir Andrew prepare for a duel that neither one wants Antonio happens upon the scene Believing Viola to be Sebastian he intervenes and is arrested Viola of course does not recognize Antonio Later Belch and Sir Andrew encounter Sebastian who does not back down from Aguecheek when challenged and resoundingly beats him Olivia intervenes in the matter andmistaking Sebastian for ViolaCesariopresses her suit for him A bemused Sebastian agrees to marry her

Antonio is brought before the Duke for questioning and Viola relates the events of the duel Antonio tells everyone how he dragged this man from the surf saving his life Then Olivia enters searching for her new husbandwhich she thinks is Viola Adding to this confusion Belch and Aguecheek enter claiming that ViolaCesario has violently assaulted them In the midst of Violas denials Sebastian appears The brother and sister recognize one another and are reunited Sebastian helps to clear the confusion as to who fought and married who At the end Orsino and Viola pledge their love Olivia and Sebastian will remain satisfactorily wed and Olivia rebukes Belch and Maria for their abuse of Malvolio who vows his revenge upon the whole lot Belch agrees to wed Maria to make up for getting her in trouble and allexcept the disgruntled Malvoliowill apparently live happily ever after

The Quokka Setonix brachyurus is a small marsupial about the size of a large cat Like other animals in the macropod family such as kangaroos and wallabies the Quokka eats grass and small plants and is mainly nocturnal It lives on some small islands off the coast of Western Australia mainly on Rottnest Island near Perth and Bald Island near Albany A small number live on the main land in the protected area of Two Peoples Bay which they share with Gilberts Potoroo The Quokka is the only member of the genus Setonix

The Quokka weighs between convert25kglb0lkonabbron and convert5kglb0lkonabbron It is around convert50cmin0lkonabbron long with a convert30cmin0lkonabbron tail This is short for a macropod It has a solid build rounded ears and a short broad head It looks like a very small fat kangaroo but it can climb small trees and shrubs It has rough fur which is a brown colour fading to pale brown underneath The Quokka eats a small amount of its waste products

The Quokka is a social animal and lives in large groups They eat grass sedges succulents and leaves They can become very sick if fed with things like bread given to them by visitors to Rottnest Island Visitors are now told not to feed them Quokkas breed at any time on the mainland but in late summer on Rottnest The female Quokka has one baby in a year 

The Quokka moves in the same way as a kangaroo using both small and large hops

Quokkas are not scared of people so you are able to get quite close to them particularly on Rottnest Island It is against the law on Rottnest Island to handle or touch the animals in any way A A100 fine can be given by the Rottnest Island Authority for picking up a quokka People can even be taken to court and get a fine of up to 1000 These fines have been used in some unusual cases where Quokkas have been hurt or killed by visitors to Rottnest

There are a lot of Quokkas living on the small offshore islands because this is only a small area they are listed as vulnerable On the mainland they are attacked by dingoes as well as introduced animals like foxes dogs and cats They also need thick ground cover for shelter Farming has cleared much of the land which is another reason the species is threatened 

The Quokka was one of the first Australian mammals seen by Europeans The Dutch sailor Samuel Volckertzoon wrote about seeing a a wild cat on Rottnest Island in 1658 In 1696 Willem de Vlamingh thought they were rats and named the island Rottenest Dutch for rat nest

The word quokka is comes from a Nyungar word which was probably gwaga

very important person

Henry the Young King was the junior king to his father Henry II of England He was crowned king in 1170 but never actually used the power The meaning of this is that Henry IIs territory covered much of northern France as well as England and Ireland The idea may have been to have an official deputy for legal actions when Henry was in France and to indicate the succession to the throne In practice Young Henry was not interested in government According to his tutor William Marshal he spent his time in France going from one knights tournament to another

The boy was married as a child to Margaret of France daughter of the French King Louis VII The intention was political but it did not work War came between Henry II and Louis Henry joined in rebellions directed at his father A civil war occurred in which Young Henry and his mother with Scots and French support fought against Henry II The king won just Young Henry died ten years later of dysentery As he died before his father he never achieved power

Historiography is the study of historians and their work It is writing about rather than of history Historiography is meta level analysis of descriptions of the past The analysis usually focuses on the narrative interpretations worldview use of evidence or method of presentation of other historians

Rod cells are one of two types of photoreceptor cells that can be found in the retina of the eyes of humans as well as other animals The other type are the cone cells Rod cells are very sensitive to light They allow night vision They are concentrated at the edge of the retina where they also allow peripheral vision There are about 120 million of them in the human eye

A photoreceptor cell is a specialized nerve cell that is sensitive to certain wavelengths of light 

The Three Gorges Dam is a dam in the Three Gorges region on the Yangtze River in Sandouping in the country of China One of the largest dams in the world it also generates the biggest amount of hydroelectric power pushing the massive Itaipu Dam in Brazil from first place to second place The Three Gorges Dam project was completed on October 30 2008 The dam was built for flood control irrigation and electricity However this has not come without problems The dam covers a lot of historic sites and has caused 124 million people to lose their homes under the rising water The dam forms the Three Gorges Reservoir which extends nearly convert410mikm0lkonabbron upstream to the city of Chongqing 

The dam was proposed by Sun Yat sen a Chinese political leader in 1919 The site was surveyed in 1932 and 1939 by the Chinese and Japanese respectively The Japanese drew up a plan for the dam only to realize later that China would remain under Chinese control Later in 1944 the United States helped make plans for the dam but all work on the dam stopped in 1947 because of the Chinese Civil War In 1949 work resumed but the work was slow because of problems in the economy Later in 1958 some engineers who were against the dam were put in jail

In 1980 work on the dam continued faster But many people voted in 1992 against the dam However the dam was accepted by the government and on December 14 1994 construction began In 2009 the dam began to make hydroelectricity Some new plans such as a set of 6 new power generators under construction will become operational in the year 2011 The reservoir filled to capacity at the end of 2008

The Three Gorges Dam consists of a main dam wall and a section on the right with a set of five locks which are devices used to raise boats and ships 

The dam cost 180 billion Chinese Yuan Renminbi While this cost seems huge it actually was 20 million yuan less than the original budget of 2039 billion yuan However this cost will be recovered when the dam makes money by making electricity In about 10 years the complete cost of the dam will be recovered

One of the big reasons the dam was built to control floods It protects large cities like Wunan Nanjing and Shanghai which are very close to the river Lots of farms small villages and towns and factories are also located near the river In the event of a flood there are 22 cubic kilometers of space behind the dam to hold back the flood waters The flood waters are stored behind the dam for future use In the dry season the water is released down the river and the reservoir level drops to prepare for the next flood However the dam does not protect the lower river tributaries from flooding

Another reason the dam was built was for water navigation or the transport of people and goods by ship There are two sets of canal locks each of which has five stages Each lock is convert918ftm long convert114ftm wide and convert164ftm deep which is comparable in size to the locks of the Panama Canal one of the biggest canals in the world The reservoir behind the dam floods a lot of dangerous sections of the river which makes it easier for boats and ships to sail There is also a ship lift that can lift ships that weigh up to 3000 tons

The Three Gorges Dam generates 22250 megawatts which makes it the biggest single hydroelectric power source in the world It has 34 electricity generators and 32 are main generators Each generator is powered by water that comes from the reservoir Each of these 32 generators makes about 700 megawatts of electricity The other two generators will make power for the dam itself These two generators each make 50 megawatts 

Of the 32 main generators 24 generators are on the north side of the dam 12 are on the south side of the dam 6 are in a separate powerhouse under a mountain just south of the dam Another 6 generators were added in 2002 The generating capacity of the dam is 10000 MWh megawatt hours or the amount of megawatts generated per hour Each main generator weighs a massive 6000 tons The water drops convert264ftm from the reservoir to the generator which uses a type of turbine called a Francis turbine Each turbine is convert34ftm wide and convert32ftm tall The amount of water that goes into the turbine can be from 1968 cubic feet to 3116 cubic feet per second The turbines turn at a speed of 75 RPM The efficiency of the generators is from 94 to 965 percent

The 14 main generators on the north side were installed from 2003 to 2005 The first one to begin making electricity started on July 10 2003 The last one started on September 7 2005 The full power of the north side generators was first tested on October 18 2006 when the reservoir had risen to convert511ftm above sea level The 12 main generators on the south side were installed from 2007 to 2008 The first one to begin making electricity started on June 11 2007 The last one started on August 19 2008 

From its completion to March 2009 the Three Gorges Dam has generated about 296550 MWh of electricity 

Three power lines send electricity away from the dam to three electricity grids called the East Central and South China grids

The dam provides about 3 of Chinas electricity However the dam was originally planned to supply 10 of Chinas electricity The reason for the decrease is Chinas energy use grew much faster than the designers expected

Because of reducing electricity needs on fossil fuels like coal and oil the Three Gorges Dam has saved 31 million tons of coal per year and prevented

The dam has also benefited transportation on the river Because of the locks installed on the dam the benefits are

In response to the dam many sewage pipes that once dumped sewage straight into the Yangtze River now have to be treated Over 65 percent of this waste water is now treated before flowing into the reservoir There are now about 50 water treatment facilities in the area Also solid waste is now collected in 32 landfills They can handle 76645 tons of waste every day

The dam also persuaded the government of China to think seriously about the pollution in the Yangtze River and the rest of China

A total of 124 million people had to move to different places because their homes were flooded by the dam This number is about 15 of the total population of Hubei Province and Chongqing City where the reservoir is located 140000 from Hubei Province alone On July 22 2008 most of the people were safely relocated 4 million more people will ultimately have to move to Chongqing from their homes near the Three Gorges Dam 

A large amount of animal habitat will also be destroyed Many animals with critically low populations will lose their vital habitat These include the endangered Siberian Crane the Yangtze river dolphin and Yangtze sturgeon About one billion tons of dirty water flow into the Yangtze River each year The dam would stop this dirty water from being washed away and lead to serious pollution problems 

About 1300 historic sites have been flooded by the Three Gorges reservoir The Three Gorges will be turned into much less spectacular gorges because the water level will rise up to convert300ftm in places reducing the depth of the canyons Many of these historic sites have been moved to safer places But some historic sites cannot be moved because of their location size or design

A lot of silt that is carried by the river will be trapped in the reservoir Eventually if the dam is not removed the reservoir will fill with silt making it useless Also because the rivers silt doesnt go downstream anymore the city of Shanghai will suffer because there will be no silt to replace land that is washed away at the rivers mouth In a high silt content river like the Yangtze sediment can clog the dams outlets and it cannot release water The water would back up behind the dam and have nowhere to go and would eventually go over the dam making it collapse

The dam is also a possible target in war weakening Chinas national security It is also possible that the dam sits on a seismic fault

The Gezhouba Dam is an afterbay of the Three Gorges Dam It forms a pool that extends upstream to the base of the Three Gorges Dam improving navigation The dam was built from December 30 1970 to December 10 1988 The dam is convert8513ftm long and up to convert154ftm tall It generates 2710 megawatts of electricity There are three ship locks at the dam Lock No2 which is convert918ftm long convert111ftm wide and convert165ftm deep is among the 100 largest in the world

A series of other dams are also planned upstream on the Yangtze and Jinsha rivers About four dams are planned on the stretch of the Yangtze River and they will produce 38500 megawatts in total Eight dams are planned on the Jinsha River and eight more upstream of it and one original plan called for a dam in the Tiger Leaping Gorge one of the deepest river canyons in the world This plan was however scrapped in December 21 2007 because of the gorges status as a World Heritage site

Ericaceae is a family of flowering plants in the order Ericales Plants of this family grows both in Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere The common english name of Ericaceae is heath family

Many plants of Ericaceae are shrubs but there are also trees and herbs

There are about 120 genera and about 4000 species in this family

Many plants of Ericaceae are evergreen plants with small flowers in the shape of bells or tube The color of flowers may be white pink red violet rarely yellow It may be interest plants for gardens

Fruits of some species are edible

Some plants of Ericaceae have a poison in all their parts 

The term Alternation of generations is used to describe the life cycle of certain eukaryotes plants fungi and protists 

In sexual reproduction organisms have a haploid phase with one set of chromosomes alternating with a diploid phase with two sets of chromosomes In animals the body is usually diploid while the haploid stage is restricted to the gametes In other eukaryotes alternation of generations may occur The classic example is the mosses where the green plant is a haploid gametophyte and the reproductive phase is the diploid sporophytep18 

The term alternation of generations refers only to the sexual cycle organisms often have asexual reproduction as well

The alternation of generations is an important concept in the evolution of plants

All land plants and some algae have life cycles in which a haploid gametophyte generation alternates with a diploid sporophyte which has a double set of chromosomes In mosses the gametophyte is the dominant generation while the sporophytes consist of sporangium bearing stalks growing from the tips of the gametophytes For flowering plants the sporophyte generation comprises almost their whole life cycle except phases of small reproductive structures

The sporophyte produces spores by meiosis These meiospores develop into a gametophyte Both the spores and the resulting gametophyte are haploid meaning they only have one set of chromosomes Later the mature gametophyte produces male or female gametes by mitosis The fusion of male and female gametes produces a diploid zygote which develops into a new sporophyte This is the cycle which is known as alternation of generations or alternation of phases

Most algae have dominant gametophyte generations but in some species the gametophytes and sporophytes are morphologically similar 

Bryophytes have a dominant gametophyte stage on which the adult sporophyte is dependent on the gametophyte for nutrition The embryo of the sporophyte develops from the zygote within the female sex organ and in its early development is therefore nurtured by the gametophyte

An independent sporophyte is the dominant form in all clubmosses horsetails ferns gymnosperms and angiosperms that have survived to the present day 

Early land plants had sporophytes that produced identical spores but the ancestors of the gymnosperms evolved complex heterosporous life cycles in which the spores producing male and female gametophytes were of different sizes the female megaspores tending to be larger and fewer in number than the male microspores 

During the Devonian period several plant groups independently evolved heterospory and subsequently the habit of endospory in which single megaspores were retained within the sporangia of the parent sporophyte These endosporic megaspores contained within them a miniature multicellular female gametophyte complete with female sex organs containing egg cells which were fertilised by free swimming sperm produced by windborne miniatuarised male gametophytes in the form of pre pollen 

The resulting zygote developed into the next sporophyte generation while still retained within the pre ovule the single large female meiospore or megaspore contained in the modified sporangium of the parent sporophyte The evolution of heterospory and endospory were among the earliest steps in the evolution of seeds of the kind produced by gymnosperms and angiosperms today

A guinea is a coin that was minted in the Kingdom of England between 1663 and 1813 It is not used any more

Although guinea coins had not been made for a long time prices often continued to be shown in guineas until British prices became decimal in 1971 A guinea was worth 11s0d This is the same as 105p in modern money

Because a guinea was close to a pound putting prices in guineas made the price seem less A price of 39 guineas might look like about 39 In fact it is nearly 41

A chorale is a hymn which is sung in a Lutheran church by all the people Chorales developed during the late Renaissance and early Baroque period Most of them were written at that time

Martin Luther thought that the congregation should have music to sing that was not too difficult He thought that the words should be in German instead of Latin so that everybody would understand what they were singing about Luther wrote the words of many chorales himself He even composed some of melodies himself such as Ein feste Burg Sometimes he used the traditional Gregorian Chant melodies from the Catholic worship and added new German words to it for example Christ lag in Todesbanden

The words of a chorale have a rhyming pattern Most of the melodies have an AAB shape This shape is called Bar form in German 

Johann Sebastian Bach used many chorale tunes usually adding harmony of his own He used these in his cantatas Many of these chorales in four part harmonies are sung as hymns today in German Protestant churches and some of the tunes are used in English speaking countries as well

Chorale tunes also appear in chorale preludes pieces for the organ These would usually have been played during the church services before the chorale was sung

Chorales were used by many later composers in their compositions eg Felix Mendelssohn Anton Bruckner and Max Reger

An alpha particle is made up of two protons and two neutrons It is a kind of helium Radioactive elements give out alpha particles when they go through a kind of radioactive decay known as alpha decay

During alpha decay the atomic nucleus releases an alpha particle The nucleus will lose two protons and two neutrons when this happens After the decay the atom will change to another element because the atom loses two protons For example if Americium were to go through alpha decay it would change into Neptunium because Neptunium is defined by have two protons less than Americium Alpha decay usually happens in heavy elements those containing more neutrons and protons such as uranium thorium plutonium and radium

Alpha particles cannot even go through a few centimeters of air Alpha irradiation cannot hurt humans when the alpha source is outside the human body because human skin does not let the alpha particles go through Alpha radiation can be very harmful if the source is inside the body such as when people breathe dust or gas containing materials which decay by emitting alpha particles

For example there is an element called americium 241 which gives off alpha radiation This radiation can be very harmful if it is inside someones body because it can change the DNA in the cells But it is not harmful when it is outside of the body because alpha radiation does not travel through the outside layers of the skin very well

the alpha symbol is  2 He2

A seal is something such as a piece of wax which has an official mark on it and which is attached to an important letter or document to make it official It can also mean the device which is used to make the official mark The word comes from the Latin sigillum

The study of seals is called Sigillography

Seals are used on documents to prove that they really did come from the person who signed it A seal could be put on the letter itself or on the envelope where it is stuck down The writer would pour some wax over the joint of the letter then press a ring or metal stamp which has his official mark on  This meant that no one would be able to open the letter and then close it again because the seal will break when the letter is opened Most governments still put seals on important documents Letters do not normally have seals any more even important letters

Sometimes lead pewter or ivory were used instead of wax

Each seal is different from any other This means that an important person has his own personalized stamp 

Seals were used in very early civilizations In ancient Mesopotamia seals were engraved on cylinders which could be rolled to create an impression on clay Signet rings of kings from Ancient Egypt have been found From Ancient Egypt seals in the form of signet rings of kings have been found Other ancient seals come from Saudi Arabia or the Ancient Greek and Roman times 

After the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 seals were not used so much The Popes used lead seals and Charlemagne had a special seal engraved with Jupiter Sarpis In England all the kings from Edward the Confessor onwards had their own seal of majesty

Seals from East Asian later developed into block printing Seals from China have been found from the 5th century BC

The wearing of signet rings is an old tradition among nobles in European and some other cultures In Latin America it is also traditional for the descendants of the old criollo aristocratic families to wear signet rings in the Spanish tradition

Signet rings were often worn on the little finger of either the right or left hand although some countries have different customs In the United Kingdom signet rings are typically worn on the little finger of the left hand of the bearer and are often cast of gold The ring is worn with the seal facing outwards so that the wearer can make a seal without taking the ring off

A similar tradition is found with blacksmiths who use their touchmark on whatever they made When they died their touchmark was destroyed

The study of seals is very useful in many areas genealogy political history art history etc This is because modern science can work out very closely how old a seal is This makes it possible to date documents or works of art

The word seal is often used as a metaphor 

Because seals are used to close something officially the word seal can also be used in other situations with a similar meaning

The Attitude Era was a period in the World Wrestling Federation and professional wrestling history It began with the Monday Night Wars and reached its end with the conclusion of the Wars in 2001 The Attitude Era professional like the 1980s wrestling boom made wrestling more popular in the United States from the late 1990s to early 2000s Television ratings and pay per view buy rates reached their highest points Unlike the more traditional WWF programming the Attitude Era tried to attract the young adult demographic It did this by transforming the product into a more controversial shock value form of entertainment similar to the Trash TV genre popularized in the 1990s

The official date of the Attitude Era was between March 29 1998 Stone Cold Steve Austin became the WWF Champion at WrestleMania XIV It lasted until March 26 2001 when World Championship Wrestling was bought out by the WWF The Attitude Era actually developed with 1996 King of the Ring Stone Cold said the famous catchphase of Austin 316 and officially started the WWFs transition to an edgier product

Classical conditioning is a form of associative learning 

Ivan Pavlov was the first to show how it works He did this in 1927 using dogs There is one stimulus which is called neutral and there is another which has some meaning If the two stimuli are often presented together the organism learns that they belong together As a result it is enough to show the neutral stimulus to get a response

Pavlov did the experiment with dogs Each time before he fed the dogs he rang a bell The dogs then learned that when the bell rang they would be fed So they started to salivate when they heard the bell ring even before they saw or smelled the food 

Pavlov referred to this learned relationship as a conditional reflex today it is called a conditioned reflex or response

The Billups Neon Crossing Signal was a special signal to warn car and truck drivers that a train was coming It was placed at a dangerous Illinois Central railroad crossing on Mississippi State Route 7 in Grenada

It was put up in the mid 1930s by inventor Alonzo Billups Mr Billups and the railroad were worried the crossing had many accidents between trains and motor vehicles He wanted drivers who were going to cross the tracks to know that a train was coming and he wanted to do it in a very big way The Billups signal was built like a giant steel gantry which went up and over the entire highway This is similar to crossing signals used today in North America Mr Billups signal may have been the very first time such a signal was built A pair of flashing red lights similar to those used today topped giant neon signs on either side of the big gantry The signs lit up with the words Stop DEATH Stop along with a neon skull and crossbones Flashing neon arrows pointed toward the train to tell drivers which way the train was coming The Billups Neon Crossing Signal even had a special way of warning drivers with sound Instead of the electric or electronic bells used now this signal used a very loud air raid siren

After World War II started neon became hard to get The signal had electrical problems as well Often the air raid siren would go off even if no train was coming and it wouldnt shut off until the railroad sent a repair crew No more of these special signals were ever built and the only one ever built was taken down after less than twenty years

Otto Klemperer born Breslau 14 May 1885 died Zrich 6 July 1973 was a German born conductor and composer He is thought of as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century

Klemperer was born in Breslau Silesia which was then in Germany but is now called Wrocaw in Poland He was born into a Jewish family He studied music at the Conservatory in Frankfurt am Main and then went to Berlin where he studied conducting and composition with Hans Pfitzner In 1905 he met Gustav Mahler who was very impressed with him He recommended him for the job of conductor at the German Opera in Prague He soon got jobs in other places Hamburg Barmen Strasbourg Cologne and Wiesbaden He was offered a job at the Berlin Staatsoper but he did not want it because he thought he would not be able to do things there the way he wanted However four years later in 1927 he took a job with a special branch of the Staatsoper which had been started in order to perform new music in modern performances They played in the Kroll Theatre Klemperer became very famous for the performances that he conducted there

The Kroll Theatre had been started by politicians who supported the Weimar Republic They wanted opera to be different from the traditional operas that were performed in the Theatre Unter den Linden supported by the monarchy The operas that Klemperer conducted there included Leo Janeks From the House of the Dead Arnold Schnbergs Erwartung Igor Stravinskys Oedipus Rex and Paul Hindemiths Cardillac

By 1931 the political situation had changed and the Kroll Opera was shut down By 1933 the Nazis had gained power and Klemperer left Germany and went to the United States He became conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and also conducted the New York Philharmonic Orchestra the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Pittsburg Orchestra

In 1939 he had a series illness and was operated on for a brain tumour For some time he was not well enough to work Then from 1947 to 1950 he conducted the Budapest Opera He left there because the communist politicians did not allow a lot of music to be played Other orchestras in Europe and America invited him to conduct during the 1950s and although his health was never good he kept working In 1955 he became conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra in London By this time Furtwngler was dead and Toscanini had retired so Klemperer was thought of as the greatest conductor of German music He made many recordings with the Philharmonia Orchestra and conducted operas at the Royal Opera House He lived in Switzerland but spent much time in London conducting

Klemperer became an Israeli citizenship in 1970 He retired from conducting in 1971 and died in Zrich in 1973 aged 88

Klemperers performances that we have on record show us that he was a musician who understood the shape of a musical work perfectly He often chose slow speeds but the music could sound very heroic His health problems included manic depression which made him sometimes very difficult to work with He also had a bad fall in Montreal From then onwards he always had to sit down to conduct He also burnt himself badly because he was smoking in bed and he tried to put out the flames with a glass of whisky which made the fire worse 

Klemperer is less well known as a composer but he wrote a number of works although he hardly ever performed them and most of them are now forgotten

Runes are found carved into stones in many places in Scandinavia and in the British Isles Iceland Greenland the Faroe Islands and Frisia Runes have been used for writing poems and eulogies and they are still sometimes used to write ciphers Runes were also used by J R R Tolkien in his fantasy works which were based on Germanic mythology Because of their association with Germanic mythology runes were also used by the Nazis to support a new mysticism and a romantic sense of Germanic heritage The rune survived into the Middle Ages in the English language and to modern times in Icelandic as the letter  After the Norman conquest this letter was replaced by the letters th because it was unknown to the French speaking Normans Similarly the letter was used in Old English and is still used in Icelandic but it is from Irish not from the runes

When the runes were first used the Germanic languages were not yet split into their modern branches there was only one unified language with many regional dialects Each rune had a name like our modern letters have names but these very old names are no longer known By their association with later letters the old names of the runes have been reconstructed The before a runes Proto Germanic name means this is a reconstructed name Not all runes were drawn the same way however and some of the runes and their names were different in some places

Physically the visual cortex is at the back of the brain in the occipital lobe

David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel did research on the visual cortex for many years They won the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries about information processing in the visual system 

The primary visual cortex is the best studied visual area in the brain This is where the messages arrive from the lateral geniculate nuclei which are relay stations for information from the retina

Research on the primary visual cortex can involve recording action potentials from electrodes within the brain of cats ferrets rats mice or monkeys Alternatively signals can be recorded outside the animal by EEG MEG or fMRI These techniques gather information without invading the brain

A Vernier scale is a way to get a much better result when measuring how long something is or the size of an angle

Sometimes when measuring things we need to get our measurement as accurate as possible Accuracy is important in surveying the land navigation of ships making parts for machines like car engines looking at stars and planets in astronomy and when doing experiments in science 

Length has been measured with a straight ruler for hundreds of years If the object we are measuring is somewhere in between two of the marks on our ruler then we would have to estimate where between the two marks to take the measurement A Vernier scale on our ruler does this last fine piece of measuring between the two marks for us So for example if the measurement with our eye said it was between 15 and 16 centimeters we would look at the Vernier and we would be able to say the measure is actually 157 something it would be very hard to see with the eye alone

When measuring angles the same problem occurs and a vernier may be part of a device to measure fine angles in between two of the marks on the scale

We dont need to be sharp eyed to read the Vernier scale because its marks are almost as big as our main measuring scale We just count how many marks there are to the next place where there is a mark on both the main and vernier scales that are exactly lined up That number of marks tells us the size of the small extra measurement

Kenneth Ken Moore Whisenhunt is the American football head coach of the Arizona Cardinals NFL football team leading them to the first Super Bowl in ream history during the 2008 season Before that he was known for his well planned offensive plays including the success he had with the Pittsburgh Steelers in his 3 years as their offensive coordinator under Bill Cowher in which the Steeers won Super Bowl XL during the 2005 season 

After attending the Academy of Richmond County in Augusta Georgia for high school Whisenhunt played college football at Georgia Tech where he graduated with a degree in Civil Engineering During his senior season he was an honorable mention All American He also finished first team all ACC during his final two college seasons 

Whisenhunts career as a player included 4 years as a tight end with the Atlanta Falcons who drafted him in the twelfth round and then short periods with the Washington Redskins and New York Jets He retired from the league in 1993 after nine seasons in which he was mostly known as a blocker

He began his coaching career at Vanderbilt University where he coached special teams tight ends and H backs for the Commodores from 199596 In 1997 he returned to the NFL as the tight ends coach for the Baltimore Ravens Whisenhunt changed teams very often in his early years in the league moving to the staff of the Cleveland Browns in 1999 and to the New York Jets the following season

In 2001 Whisenhunt was hired by the Steelers to coach their tight ends He was able to make players such as Mark Bruener and Jay Riemersma both considered no longer at their best into great blocking backs He became offensive coordinator in Pittsburgh for the 2004 season after Mike Mularkey became the head coach of the Buffalo Bills Whisenhunt had instant success in his role While Mularkey was known for creating exciting trick plays Whisenhunt became more of a cautious play caller whose well timed trick plays surprised the Steelers opponents because they were very unlike the conservative Pittsburgh run game 

Whisenhunts most famous moment is the trick play he called in Super Bowl XL With Pittsburgh leading 14 10 over the Seattle Seahawks Whisenhunt called a wide receiver reverse pass that allowed Pittsburgh to get a big lead which they did not give away 

On January 14 2007 the Arizona Cardinals hired Whisenhunt as their new head coach The contract he received promised him an average of 25 million annually Whisenhunt had also interviewed for the head coaching position with the Steelers Atlanta Falcons and Miami Dolphins In February 2006 the Oakland Raiders were interviewing him to become their new head coach but Whisenhunt ended the talks before a deal could be offered The Cardinals were better in Whisenhunts first season finishing with 8 wins and 8 losses after finishing with 5 wins and 11 losses the two seasons before that and losing 10 or more games in seven of the previous eight campaigns It was their first non losing season since 1998 even though they still failed to make the playoffs 

Before his second season Whisenhunt made the experienced Kurt Warner his starting quarterback In Whisenhunts first season Warner had split time with the teams younger quarterback Matt Leinart although Warner started the final 11 games of the 2007 season after Leinart suffered a season ending injury This was a good decision because Warner put up good numbers in leading the Cardinals to a 9 win and 7 loss regular season record in the 2008 season This was good enough to win NFC West Division the Cardinals first division title since 1975 when the team played in St Louis Missouri Whisenhunts second season was also the Cardinals first time in the playoffs since 1998 After beating the Atlanta Falcons and the Carolina Panthers in the first two rounds of the NFC playoffs the Cardinals defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship on January 18 2009 and advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time in franchise history to face the Pittsburgh Steelers This gave Whisenhunt an opportunity to play against the team he used to be the offensive coordinator of The Cardinals lost the game 27 23 Whisenhunt credited the Steelers players and staff with the win but also said penalties were one of the reasons for the loss

GNU GRUB is a boot loader package from the GNU Project GRUB is the main example of the Multiboot Specification which allows a user to have more than one operating systems on their computer at once and to choose which one to run when the computer starts GRUB can be used to select from different kernel images available on a particular operating systems partitions as well as to pass boot time parameters to such kernels

When a computer is turned on the computers BIOS finds the primary bootable device and loads the initial bootstrap program from the master boot record the first 512 bytes of the hard disk and then transfers control to this code

The MBR contains GRUB stage 1 Because of the small size of the MBR Stage 1 just loads the next stage of GRUB Stage 1 can either load Stage 2 directly or it can load stage 15 GRUB Stage 15 is located in the first 30 kilobytes of hard disk immediately following the MBR Stage 15 loads Stage 2 

When GRUB Stage 2 receives control it presents an interface to the user in order to select which operating system to boot This normally takes the form of a graphical menu although if this is not available or the user wishes further control GRUB has its own command prompt where the user can manually specify the boot parameters GRUB can also be set to automatically load a particular kernel after a timeout period

Once boot options have been selected GRUB loads the selected kernel into memory and passes control on to the kernel which then continues to start itself At this stage GRUB can also pass control of the boot process to another loader using chain loading for operating systems such as Windows that do not support the Multiboot standard In this case copies of the other systems boot programs have been saved by GRUB instead of a kernel the other system is loaded as though it had been started from the MBR This may be yet another boot manager such as the Microsoft boot menu allowing further selection of non Multiboot operating systems

The history of saffron growing reaches back more than 3000 years The wild plant from which the saffron crocus came was called Crocus cartwrightianus Humans began choosing wild plants that had long stigmas Gradually a form of C cartwrightianus C sativus came into being in the late Bronze Age Crete Experts believe that the first document to mention saffron is a 7th century BC Assyrian book about botany which was written in the time of Ashurbanipal Since then we have found evidence for the use of saffron in the treatment of about 90 illnesses during the past 4000 years 

The Minoans had pictures of saffron in their palaces as long ago as 15001600 BC showing how it could be used as a medicine Later Greek legends told of sea voyages to Cilicia where adventurers hoped to find the worlds most valuable saffron Another legend tells how someone named Crocus was bewitched and transformed into the original saffron crocus Ancient Mediterranean peoplesincluding perfumers in Egypt physicians in Gaza townspeople in Rhodes and the Greek hetaerae courtesansused saffron in their perfumes ointments potpourris mascaras divine offerings and medical treatments 

In late Hellenistic Egypt Cleopatra used saffron in her baths to make her feel good Egyptian healers used saffron as a treatment for all varieties of gastrointestinal ailments Saffron was also used as a fabric dye in such Levant cities as Sidon and Tyre Aulus Cornelius Celsus prescribes saffron in medicines for wounds cough colic and scabies and in the mithridatium Such was the Romans love of saffron that Roman colonists took their saffron with them when they settled in southern Gaul where it was extensively cultivated until Romes fall Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th century AD Moors or with the Avignon papacy in the 14th century AD

Paints made from saffron were being used for drawing 50000 years ago These have been found in the country that is today called Iraq Later people called the Sumerians used wild growing saffron in their remedies and magical potions Traders carried saffron for long distances before the 2nd millennium BC Ancient Persians were growing their own type of saffron in Derbena Isfahan and Khorasan by the 10th century BC Sometimes saffron threads were woven into textiles They were given as offerings to the gods and used in dyes perfumes medicines and body washes Saffron threads were also scattered across beds and mixed into hot tea as a way of curing sad feelings Other people were afraid that the Persians would use saffron as a drug and aphrodisiac During his Asian campaigns Alexander the Great used Persian saffron in his tea rice and baths to help heal his battle wounds Alexanders troops copied their leaders actions and brought the habit of saffron bathing back to Greece

No one knows how saffron arrived in South Asia Traditional Kashmiri and Chinese accounts date its arrival anywhere between 9002500 years ago Meanwhile historians studying ancient Persian records date the arrival to sometime prior to 500 BC attributing it to either Persian transplantation of saffron corms to stock new gardens and parks or to a Persian invasion and colonization of Kashmir Phoenicians then marketed Kashmiri saffron as a dye and a treatment for melancholy From there saffron use in foods and dyes spread throughout South Asia For example Buddhist monks in India adopted saffron coloured robes after the Buddha Siddhartha Gautamas death However the robes were not dyed with costly saffron but turmeric a less expensive dye or jackfruit 

Some historians believe that saffron first came to China with Mongol invaders by way of Persia On the other hand saffron is mentioned in ancient Chinese medical texts including the forty volume Shennong Bencaojing pharmacopoeia a tome dating from 200300 BC Traditionally attributed to the legendary Yan Emperor Shennong it documents 252 phytochemical based medical treatments for various disorders Yet around the 3rd century AD the Chinese were referring to saffron as having a Kashmiri provenance For example Wan Zhen a Chinese medical expert reported that the habitat of saffron is in Kashmir where people grow it principally to offer it to the Buddha Wan also reflected on how saffron was used in his time The saffron crocus flower withers after a few days and then the saffron is obtained It is valued for its uniform yellow colour It can be used to aromatise wine

In Europe saffron cultivation declined steeply following the Roman Empires fall Saffron was reintroduced when the Islamic civilization Al Andalus spread to Spain France and Italy During the 14th century Black Death demand for saffron based medicine skyrocketed and much saffron had to be imported via Venetian and Genoan ships from southern and Mediterranean lands such as Rhodes The theft of one such shipment by noblemen sparked the fourteen week long Saffron War The conflict and resulting fear of rampant saffron piracy spurred significant saffron cultivation in Basel which grew prosperous Cultivation and trade then spread to Nuremberg where epidemic levels of saffron adulteration brought on the Safranschou code under which saffron adulterers were fined imprisoned and executed Soon after saffron cultivation spread throughout England especially Norfolk and Suffolk The Essex town of Saffron Walden named for its new specialty crop emerged as Englands prime saffron growing and trading center However an influx of more exotic spices such as chocolate coffee tea and vanilla from newly contacted Eastern and overseas countries caused European cultivation and usage of saffron to decline Only in southern France Italy and Spain did significant cultivation endure

Europeans brought saffron to the Americas when immigrant members of the Schwenkfelder Church left Europe with a trunk containing saffron corms indeed many Schwenkfelders had widely grown saffron in Europe By 1730 the Pennsylvania Dutch were cultivating saffron throughout eastern Pennsylvania Spanish colonies in the Caribbean bought large amounts of this new American saffron and high demand ensured that saffrons list price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold The trade with the Caribbean later collapsed in the aftermath of the War of 1812 when many saffron transporting merchant vessels were destroyed Yet the Pennsylvania Dutch continued to grow lesser amounts of saffron for local trade and use in their cakes noodles and chicken or trout dishes American saffron cultivation survived into modern times mainly in Lancaster County Pennsylvania

Hanged drawn and quartered was a punishment In England it was used for high treason 

Until reformed under the Treason Act 1814 the full punishment for the crime of treason was to be hanged drawn and quartered in that the condemned prisoner would be

Typically the resulting five parts were gibbeted in different parts of the city town or in famous cases in the country to deter would be traitors who had not seen the execution After 1814 the convict would be hanged until dead and the mutilation would be performed post mortem Gibbeting was later abolished in England in 1843 while drawing and quartering was abolished in 1870

There is debate among modern historians about whether drawing referred to the dragging to the place of execution or the disembowelling but since two different words are used in the official documents detailing the trial of William Wallace there is no doubt that the subjects of the punishment were disembowelled

Judges delivering sentence at the Old Bailey also seemed to have had some confusion over the term drawn and some sentences are summarized as Drawn Hanged and Quartered Nevertheless the sentence was often recorded quite explicitly For example the record of the trial of Thomas Wallcot John Rouse William Hone and William Blake for offences against the king on 12 July 1683 concludes as follows

The Oxford English Dictionary notes both meanings of drawn To draw out the viscera or the like to the place of execution It states that In many cases of executions it is uncertain which of these senses of drawn is meant The presumption is that where drawn is mentioned after hanged the sense is the second meaning

The condemned man would usually be sentenced to the short drop method of hanging so that the neck would not break The man was usually dragged alive to the quartering table although in some cases men were brought to the table dead or unconscious A splash of water was usually employed to wake the man if unconscious then he was laid down on the table A large cut was made in the gut after removing the genitalia and the intestines would be spooled out on a device that resembled a dough roller Each piece of organ would be burned before the sufferers eyes and when he was completely disembowelled his head would be cut off The body would then be cut into four pieces and the king would decide where they were to be displayed Usually the head was sent to the Tower of London and as in the case of William Wallace the other four pieces were sent to different parts of the country The head was generally par boiled in brine to preserve the appearance of the head in display while the quarters were more often prepared in pitch for longer lasting deterrent displays

Intermodal Perception is the integration of information gathered from two or more stimuli of different sensory modes That is to say using more than one of your five senses together Many actions provide both an auditory and visual stimulus that the brain perceives as a unit for example playing a guitar and strumming the brain connects these individual stimuli one auditory and one visual This seems very trivial and is easily taken for granted in adults but could present challenges for infants

Elizabeth Spelke a cognitive psychologist Tested Infants ability to match both auditory and visual stimuli in 1979 with this experiment Four month old infants were shown two videos at the same time both played music and displayed puppets dancing In one of the videos the puppets movements were synchronized with the music in the second they were not Spelke determined that infants looked more at the video in which the movements were synchronized than the video were they were not by measuring their gaze This supports the idea that infants can match auditory and visual stimuli through Intermodal Perception

It is thought that a newborn possesses very crude ability to match auditory with visual stimuli Newborns will often look in the direction of an object making noise but auditory and visual perception are not developed enough at this point to accurately make intermodal perceptions This ability to mentally connect stimuli from different modes of perception is possessed in a crude form for the first six months of an infants life but develops from significantly from six months to a year in age

Production for the film began in February 2006 with a budget of around 20 million The main photography for the film was shot in Auckland New Zealand in sixty days Film editing took ten weeks Post production music mixing and visual effects took a few months The film was finished by November 2006 This was because the crew had to rush to finish it by February 16 The film was directed by Gbor Csup Walden Media President Cary Granat first recommended him to direct the film Csup had never done a live action film before However he said it didnt worry Granat in the least Csup noted that he was interested in making the film He had the ambition to do a live action film for a long time but that he didnt like anything until I read this book He called the book beautiful and said that it moved him The cinematographer of Bridge to Terabithia was Michael Chapman This was his final film before he retired Chapman mentioned in the films DVD commentary that he retired after the film because he wanted his last film to be a good one He said this is such a beautiful story and its exactly the kind of movie I want to do at this time in my life

Director Csup stated they had thought of no actors for the film at first The first actor cast was AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie Burke Robb wrote Csup such a beautiful heartwarming letter that showed she loved the book and character Csup said Robb was cast for the film because of her letter her enthusiasm and her love of the material Robb also talked with Lauren Levine the producer of the film before casting even began Their conversation convinced her that without a doubt AnnaSophia was meant for this role Csup stated Levine said it was just so clear in talking to her about all this fantasy that I was basically talking to Leslie that she had that same kind of spark and magical presence She might be physically different from Leslie in the book but the spirit of Leslie and the spirit of AnnaSophia are nearly identical It was a match made in heaven With regard to the character Robb said Leslies one of those people whos just always lit up who has this glow about her and no one can bring her down Leslies such a lively and energetic character it was really fun for me to become her

Levine noted that looking for Jess was a really tough hunt We needed someone who could go from an introverted boy in an isolated world to someone who completely taps into his imagination and becomes a confident brave leader in Terabithia Thats a heck of a range for such a young actor Josh Hutcherson was not their first choice for the role of Jess Aarons He was chosen as they felt the chemistry between AnnaSophia Robb and him Hutcherson said that he liked the project because of the real life day to day drama as well as the arc of the character Jess

The filmmakers cast Robert Patrick as Jess father He was chosen due to his experience in several films in the past Patrick explained that he could relate to the plot He was constantly creating imaginary worlds as a kid himself and that the film reminded him of the place where he grew up He also said that he agreed to act because it was a film his children could watch

Bailee Madison was cast as May Belle Aarons Csup said they searched for a long time for someone to play her role She had such a charm even before the camera she was just like a little sweetheart he said She was confident shook hands with everybody and was totally sweet and perky Csup was pleased by her attitude and cast her for the film

Csup explained that it was a very conscious decision from the very beginning that were not going to overdo the visual effects because of the storys integrity and the books integrity There was only a small mention of Jess and Leslie fighting creatures in Terabithia in the book For this reason they tried to do the absolute minimum which would be required to put it into a movie version

To design the creatures of Terabithia Csup wanted to use little more artsy imaginative fantastical creatures than the typical rendered characters you see in other movies He was inspired by Terry Gilliam and Ridley Scott Dima Malanitchev drew the creatures Csup helped him in this Csup chose Weta Digital render the 3D animation He was impressed with their artistic integrity the teamwork the fact that people were really nice and also they responded to our designs very positively Weta modified some of the creature designs However they mainly used Csups original designs

100 crew members from Weta worked for the film Weta was doing the animations when the film was being shot Weta crew members saw the shooting of all scenes involving these creatures Wetas Matt Aitken said the process of animation was split into two steps First natural looking creatures were created based on pencil sketches by Csup and Malanitchev Photoshop pictures made by visual effects art director Michael Pangrazio was used for this The second step was to use the best animation and motion style for the creatures

Leslies costumes in the film were designed to look as if the character might have made some of them herself They were updated from those described in the book This was because the descriptions in the book would appear odd now

Producer and screenwriter David L Paterson is the novels authors son His name was featured on its dedication page The story was based on his real life best friend Lisa Hill Hill had been struck by lightning She was killed when they were both eight years old Paterson had asked his mother Katherine Paterson if he could write a screenplay of the novel She agreed not only because hes her son but also because hes a very good playwright Paterson found it difficult to market his screenplay It was mainly because of Leslies death If you can believe this I did meet with some companies that asked if I could just hurt Leslie a little bitput her in a light coma and then bring her out

Paterson said it was very important for him to keep the spirit of the book alive At the same time he had to change it from a novel that takes place mostly in the characters heads to a dynamic visual medium Paterson knew that the film had to be about friendship and imagination He focused bringing out the emotions of the story He said he found it difficult to write about Terabithia This was because it was too close He credited fellow screenwriter Jeff Stockwell for recreating Terabithia for the film What Jeff was able to do as an outsider who wasnt so attached to the story was to really let his imagination go free and make up this world in a wonderful way David said Csup said that the two main characters are a little bit older in the film Csup claims the movie deals with so many issues including friendship and maybe first innocent love things like that so it made more sense to make the characters older

The films musical score was composed by Aaron Zigman He was hired after Alison Krauss did not compose the music Zigman said there are similarities between the music he made fro Bridge to Terabithia and the film Flicka He said at times theres a bit of a Celtic influence but not much but he also went on to say that there was a more modern feel to the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia The score he composed for the film is described as very large compared to his other work and Zigman commented that Aside from the minimalist stuff and coloring that I love to do I also like big orchestral stuff and want to do more of that and this film enabled me to spread my wings out a bit The official soundtrack for the film was released by Hollywood Records on February 13 2007

Reviewers criticized the films advertisement campaign One critic said the film was actually grounded in reality far more than in fantasy Another thought far from a computer generated created escapist fantasy this film is an unpretentious not pretending and touching tale of preteen companionship and loss

James Berardinelli of ReelViews called Bridge to Terabithia easily the best family feature of the early year Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post praised the script She said it was utterly recognizable and authentic and thought Robb and Hutcherson were perfectly cast Hornaday said the final five minutes showed oversweet sentiment Viewers would remember the films warmth and respect with which it pays homage respect to first love she added Jessica Grose of The Village Voice praised director Csup for not showing cutesy tween neither a child nor a teenager stereotypes She felt Jess relationship with his father made Bridge to Terabithia from a good kids movie to a classic contender The New York Times Jeannette Catsoulis believed that the fantasy was kept in the background to find magic in the everyday and thought Csup directed like someone intimate with the pain of being different allowing each personality more than a single characteristic She particularly praised Deschanel and Madison Catsoulis said the film handled adult topics with with nuance cleverly and sensitivity Since it was smart and delicate as a spider web it was the kind of childrens movie rarely seen nowadays Miriam di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun Times praised Hutcherson and Robbs performances The films heart and soul rests on the abilities of its young lead characters to make us really see the world through childrens eyes The dynamic duo of Hutcherson and Robb do not disappoint she noted

Not all reviews were positive Claudia Puig of USA Today said for a movie about the power of imagination Bridge to Terabithia is not as clever as you would hope Puig said it was an average translation of the novel But the adult characters were too caricatured or exaggerated in the film The real life portions of the movie were derivative and simplistic but Jess emotional feelings seemed powerfully authentic and this is where the film finds its truth and soul The Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern felt the film overused fantasy The critic added that the agreeable simplicity in between computer generated monsters The young members of the cast were appealing but unpolished Morgenstern thought Csup lacked experience in direction Although Deschanel was the best among the adults she seemed self directed

A terrestrial planet is mostly made of rock and may or may not have much atmosphere Earth is the original terrestrial planet and we extended the term to include our nearest rocky neighbours Mercury Venus and Mars It is often said that they are similar to Earth However this similarity is not meant to include the planets surface conditions It is the bulk structure and composition which is similar not the atmosphere

With the discovery of planets orbiting other stars the term terrestrial planet has been extended again to any planet which is similar to Earth orbiting any star

All have a core a mantle and a crust These structures can be compared to a boiled egg the central yolk is the core the white albumin is the mantle and the shell is the crust The crust of a terrestrial planet is comparatively thin with the core and the mantle taking up the vast bulk sometimes with a very large core sometimes much smaller

Our terrestrial planets have metallic cores of mostly iron with rocky mantles and crusts

Mania is a severe medical condition characterized by an extremely strong mood Maniacs are very energetic they have unusual thought patterns Some maniacs show signs of psychosis The word itself comes from from Greek and that from  mainomai to rage to be furious

Mania is just a symptom and not an illness as such There are many causes for it including wrongly using drugs or using them for fun as well as tumors of the brain Most of the time it is associated with bipolar disorder though In bipolar disorder there are episodes of mania that alternate with ones of clinical depression These cycles may be influenced by patterns in nature as well as stress 

Like with other illnesses there are different levels of mania Mild forms are usually known as hypomania stronger forms may include psychosis with hallucinations and delusions 

In some cases manic patients need to be hospitalized for protection On the other hand mania and hypomania have also been associated with creavtivity and artistic talent

Symptoms Symptoms of mania include talking very fast racing thoughts less need for sleep impulsiveness and increased interest in goal directed activities The affected person may behave unusually They may spend lots of money engage in risky sexual activity or act unusual around other people These behaviors can cause stress in everyday lifeFactdateAugust 2008

Another symptom of mania is racing thoughts during which the sufferer is excessively distracted by unimportant stimuli This negative experience creates an inability to function and an absentmindedness where the manic individuals thoughts totally preoccupy him or her making him or her unable to keep track of time or be aware of anything besides the neurological pattern of thoughts 

Although severely elevated mood sounds somewhat desirable and enjoyable the experience of mania is often quite unpleasant and sometimes disturbing if not frightening for the person involved and may lead to impulsive behavior that may later be regretted It can also often be complicated by the sufferers lack of judgment and insight regarding periods of exacerbation of symptoms There are different levels of mania

It is possible to treat mania using a combination of drugs and therapy Before starting the treatment an exact medical diagnosis of the causes of mania must be done This needs to be done to rule out that the mania is caused for example by a tumor If this was the case treating the tumor would be better 

The mania in bipolar disorder is usually treated using a combination of mood stabilizers and antipsychotic drugs During the treatment the patient needs to be monitored to rule out certain side effects The patient may also need medical supervision until he or she is stabilized that is until no more manic episodes occur 

When the symptoms of mania have gone long term treatment then focuses on prophylactic treatment to try to stabilize the patients mood Very often this is done using a combination of drugs and psychotherapy

Lithium is the classic mood stabilizer to prevent further manic and depressive episodes Anticonvulsants such as valproic acid and carbamazepine are also used for prophylaxis More recent drug solutions include lamotrigine Clonazepam is also used

The calcium channel blocker verapamil is useful in the treatment of hypomania and in those cases where lithium and mood stabilizers are contraindicated or ineffective Verapamil is effective for both short term and long term treatment

Andrea del Verrocchio was an Italian sculptor goldsmith and painter He had an important workshop in Florence Many other Renaissance painters were Verrocchios apprentices or worked in his workshop These included Botticelli Ghirlandaio and Perugino Verrocchios most famous apprentice was Leonardo da Vinci 

Verrocchio was born in Florence in 1435 His father was Michele di Francesco Cioni who was not married to Verrocchios mother Michele made tiles and bricks Later he worked as a tax collector He worked for the Medici family of bankers then he moved to Venice 

When Verrocchio was born he was named Andrea di Francesco di Cioni His name was changed to Andrea del Verrocchio when he was apprenticed to a goldsmith called Verrocchio As an apprentice to a goldsmith Verrocchio would have learnt how to make jewellery and golden tableware such as plates dishes jugs and salt containers He would have learnt how to hammer gold into thin sheets called gold leaf and use it to decorate picture frames statues and illuminated manuscripts He also learnt how to make bronze statues Verrocchios bronze statues are his most famous works 

At this time Verrocchio would have met Donatello Donatello became one of the most famous sculptors ever He made many more statues than Verrocchio However Donatello and Verrocchio both made a statue of David with the head of Goliath and both made a huge statue of a famous soldier on horseback Art historians often compare the two Davids and the two equestrian statues 

It is thought that Verrocchio began painting in the 1460s when he worked at Prato with the painter Fra Filippo Lippi There is only one known painting that was signed by Verrocchio This is an altarpiece of the Madonna and Child with Saints in the Cathedral of Pistoia painted in the late 1470s There are several more paintings from Verrocchios studio They have probably been painted partly by Verrocchio and partly by his students 

The most famous of these paintings was done between 1472 and 1475 It is a Baptism of Christ Giorgio Vasari writing in his book Lives of the Great Artists says that the angel on the left was painted by Leonardo da Vinci Vasari says that when Verrocchio saw how beautifully the eighteen year old apprentice could paint he put down his brush and never painted again On close examination it can be seen that most of the painting is painted in old fashioned tempera but the angel parts of Jesus body and the background landscape have been painted in the new technique of oil painting This makes art historians think that Leonardo worked on many parts of this picture It has also been suggested that Botticelli painted the second angel

Verrochio made two large beautiful things out of stone a coffin and a wash basin He is thought to have also carved a Madonna and Child in low relief 

Verrocchios most famous sculptures are made in bronze which is a sort of metal To make a bronze statue Verrocchio made the statue in wax Then plaster was put over the wax and the wax was removed leaving a mould The metal was heated over a furnace until it melted and became molten The molten metal was poured into the mould and slowly allowed to cool When the plaster was chipped away the bronze statue was inside The statue then needed to be finished and polished

The Church of San Lorenzo was a new church in Florence It was built by the architect Brunelleschi in the new style of the Renaissance The Medici family were the most important patrons of this church The family chose Verrocchio as the sculptor to make three works for San Lorenzo 

In 1465 Verrocchio made a wash basin for the room of San Lorenzos where the robes and Communion vessels were kept Above the basin is carved an eagle the symbol of St John the Evangelist On the bowl of the basin is carved the Medici coat of arms Verrocchio then had to design a tomb for Cosimo the famous banker and grandfather of the Medici family 

In the early 1470s Lorenzo de Medici gave him the job of designing the tomb of Lorenzos father Piero and uncle Giovanni The tomb that Verrocchio designed was very unusual He made a large sarcophagus out of beautiful dark red stone trimmed with green stone and sculptured leaves of bronze Instead of being placed against a wall in the usual way the tomb was designed to stand in an archway leading into the Sacristy Verrocchio designed a net that looks as if it is made of rope but is made of bronze This network makes a screen in the archway so that people who look at the tomb can see through into the sacristy

The most unusual church in Florence is Orsanmichele This building is an ancient corn market that had painted on the wall a precious image of the Madonna and Child The corn market was turned into a church and the sides of the building which used to be open were given walls The walls had niches which is a hollow that a statue can stand in The niches were big enough for life sized statues Many people worked at different jobs in the city of Florence The people of different jobs belonged to organisations called guilds Every important guild in the city wanted to have a statue of their patron saint in a niche at Orsanmichele Church The statues were made by some of the finest sculptors of Florence 

In 1466 the Guild of Traders gave Verrocchio the job of making a bronze statue of their saint St Thomas Verrocchio made a group of two figures which shows the most important moment in the story of St Thomas At the back of the niche stands the figure of Jesus raising one hand to Heaven St Thomas stands at the edge of the niche looking at Jesus in amazement and reaching out his hand to touch the spear wound in Jesus side Verrocchios statue was admired for the way in which he had fitted the two figures into the space and the way in which he had told the story 

At about this time Verrocchio also made a huge brass candlestick for the Palazzo Vecchio This candlestick is now in Amsterdam 

In the 1470s Lorenzo Medici and his brother Giuliano gave Verrocchio the job of making a statue of David David a shepherd boy in a story from the Bible had killed the giant Goliath He was one of the patrons of the city Nowadays there are at least eight statues of David in Florence the most famous one being by Michelangelo 

When Verrocchio made his statue the most famous David in Florence was a life sized bronze statue by Donatello This statue shows David naked except for his boots and hat The figure stands gracefully looking down at the giant head at his feet It looks very much like an Ancient Greek statue Verrochios statue of David is very different even though it is a similar size and is also made of bronze 

Verrocchios statue looks like a real live boy dressed in modern parade clothes He does not stand elegantly His muscles are all drawn tight He grips the handle of the sword so tightly that the sinews of his arm stand out The muscles of his face are pulled into the silly grin that people sometimes get when they are very frightened Verrocchios David has just killed the giant but now he is facing the whole enemy army and wondering what will happen next The handsome boy that Verrocchio used as his model for David is believed to have been Leonardo da Vinci 

The Medici also gave Verrocchio the job of making a bronze statue of a Cherub with a Dolphin to go in the fountain of their home in the countryside The statue now stands in the small courtyard of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence

In 1478 Verrocchio began work on his most famous statue It is a equestrian statue a statue of a man on horseback The statue was made for the Republic of Venice in memory of a famous soldier who had lead military troops many times when Venice was at war His name was Bartolomeo Colleoni and he had died in 1475 Colleoni was admired by many people who thought he was a good man as well as a brave soldier and great military leader Colleoni left a message to say that he wanted a statue of himself in the main square of Venice right opposite St Marks Basilica The town council would not allow this The statue was put in another important square near the Hospital of St Mark and the Church of two Roman soldier saints St Giovanni and St Paolo 

When Verrocchio started making this statue there had been only one big equestrian monument made in more than a thousand years Donatello had made an equestrian statue of another soldier who was nick named Gattamelata Verrocchio must have looked at Donatellos statue which was in Padua and at the four ancient bronze horses that stood high on the front of St Marks Basilica Verrocchio decided to make his horse do something which the St Marks horses do but Donatellos horse does not do The horses at St Marks all have one front hoof raised so that they are perfectly balanced on only three legs 

Verrocchios horse looks as if it is moving forward quite fast It is full of action The figure of Colleoni is not sitting down in the saddle he is standing in the stirups as if he is looking out to spot the enemy The horses head turns one way and the body and face of Colleoni turns the other way Colleoni looks fierce as if he is leading his troops into battle The statue is very lively and very life like 

Verrocchio moved from Florence to Venice in 1488 to help with the casting of the bronze statue But he died that year and never saw his most famous work finished

The Myelodysplastic syndrom is a group of diseases and conditions that affect how blood is made These diseases were formerly known as preleukemia mostly because sometimes they can lead to leukemia Often its name is shortened to MDS 

Myelodysplastic syndromes affect the bone marrow stem cells The production of blood does not rely on good stem cells but ones that have been modified genetically This means that the production of red blood cells sometimes of white blood cells and blood platelets changed The production becomes inefficient or goes wrong altogether Most of the time this manifests in anemia  not having enough blood Depending on the severity of the condition it can also cause hemorrhages and infections with fever

Most of the people who have these conditions are 60 years or older but younger people can get it too especially if they went through a form of chemotherapy Most of the suffers die from the disease usually after six to thirty months The only known cure is a stem cell transplant About a third of those suffering contract leukemia within a few months to a few years

At birth all bone marrow is red With age more and more of it is converted to the yellow type About half of adult bone marrow is red1 Red marrow is found mainly in the flat bones such as the hip bone breast bone skull ribs vertebrae and shoulder blades and in the cancellous material at the epiphyseal ends of the long bones such as the femur and humerus Yellow marrow is found in the hollow interior of the middle portion of long bones

In cases of severe blood periods the body can convert yellow marrow back to red marrow to increase blood cell production

When an organism grows stem cells specialize and take specific functions For instance mature tissues like skin muscle blood bone liver nerves all have different types of cell Because stem cells are not yet differentiated they can change to become some kind of specialized cells Organisms also use stem cells to replace damaged cells during lifetime

Stem cells are found in most if not all plants and animals They divide and differentiate into a range of cell types Research in the stem cell field grew out of findings in the 1960s

The two broad types of mammalian stem cells are embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells which are found in adult tissues In a developing embryo stem cells can differentiate into all of the specialised embryonic tissues In adult organisms stem cells act as a repair system for the body replenishing specialized cells but also maintain the normal turnover of blood skin and intestinal tissues

Stem cells can be grown in cell culture In culture they can be transformed into specialised cells such as those of muscles or nerves Highly plastic adult stem cells can be taken from a variety of sources including umbilical cord blood and bone marrow They are now used in medical therapies and researchers expect that stem cells will be used in many future therapies

Embryonic stem cells are stem cells taken from the inner cell mass of the early stage embryo known as a blastocyst Human embryos reach the blastocyst stage 4 5 days after fertilization At that time they are made up of between 50 and 150 cells 

The stem cells state and what the daughter cells turn into is influenced by signals from other cells in the embryo

Textual criticism is the study of different copies of books or manuscripts The purpose is to find the original and see what changes were made to the later versions

Textual criticism started with the study of the Bible but now these techniques are used to study many texts

The basic problem as described by Paul Maas is as follows

The lack of autograph manuscripts applies to many cultures other than Greek and Roman In such a situation a key objective becomes the identification of the first exemplar before any split in the tradition That exemplar is known as the archetype If we succeed in establishing the text of the archetype the reconstruction of the original is considerably advancedpp2223

The textual critics ultimate objective is the production of a critical edition This contains a text most closely approximating the original which is accompanied by a critical apparatus that presents

The famous French conductor Pierre Monteux was asked to come and get the orchestra back to a good standard He was very successful and the orchestra were soon offered more recordings In 1949 Monteux invited Arthur Fiedler to lead summer pops concerts in the Civic Auditorium Fiedler worked with the orchestra until the mid 1970s

When Monteux left the orchestra in 1952 several conductors led the orchestra including Leopold Stokowski Georg Solti Erich Leinsdorf Karl Mnchinger George Szell Bruno Walter Ferenc Fricsay and William Steinberg 

Two years later the young Spanish conductor Enrique Jord became their music director At first things went well He had a lot of energy and sometimes his baton flew out of his hand as he conducted Gradually the orchestra became less happy with Jord who did not seem to be able to control the orchestra and did not rehearse them properly Eventually after George Szell the conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra criticized him the orchestra got rid of him

In 1963 the Austrian conductor Josef Krips became music director He was very strict and rehearsed them in great detail He started a tradition of playing a special concert every New Years Eve A Night in Old Vienna with music by Johann Strauss and other 19th century Viennese composers The Japanese Seiji Ozawa was their next conductor He gave very exciting concerts which were always sold out They made many recordings together He sometimes conducted operas and ballets which were partly acted and he used university choirs for choral works

Ozawa was followed by Edo de Waart the young Dutch conductor He did not show off like Ozawa had done but he kept the standard of the orchestra very high He conducted the orchestras very first performances in the Davies Symphony Hall The orchestra used the huge new organ in the Hall for works such as Saint Sans Third Symphony In de Waarts final season 1984 85 there were four sold out performances of Mahlers hugh Eighth Symphony with the Symphony Chorus the Masterworks Chorale the San Francisco Boys Chorus and the San Francisco Girls Chorus

The Bell Beaker culture is the name of a cultural phenomenon that occurred in large parts of Western Europe roughly between 2800 BC and 2200 BC Today it is unclear whether this can be seen as a culture

Paul Reinecke was the first to use the word Glockenbecher in German around 1900 Other historians from Italy and Tchechoslovakia had used similar terms before 

Gordon Childe thought that the people were missionaries who also had the knowledge how to make copper They spread from the Iberian peninsula on the edges of Europe with the oceans The typical items linked to the movement were prestige items reserved to the upper class according to Steven Shennan Christian Strahm talk about a Glockenbecherphnomen to avoid the word culture

People of the movement were buried in a special way Often stone chests were used In the western part of the culture burials in megalithic tombs and caves are common  the burial rites are often adapted to local customs People where buried in an embryonic position

This means that both looked east when buried

Today little is known about the settlements used by the culture The only places where settlementsremains of settlements that were done at approximately the same time were found is in Knowth in Ireland and one in Switzerland 

Another culture that might have influenced the Beaker culture is the Corded Ware culture mainly found in Northern Europe

The famous conductor Otto Klemperer led the orchestra in 1933 He was one of many German emigrants fleeing from Nazi Germany He gave many new orchestral pieces their first performance and introduced the audience to the music of Igor Stravinsky and Arnold Schoenberg The orchestra played well for him but Klemperer had health problems and suffered from manic depression

William Andrews Clark died without leaving the orchestra an endowment A new orchestra called the Southern California Symphony Association was started to try to keep the concerts going Then a businessman called Harvey Mudd offered to pay Klemperers salary and the orchestra started to earn more money playing in the Hollywood Bowl so they managed to keep going during the Great Depression

By the mid 1950s the wealthy business woman Dorothy Buffum Chandler was funding the orchestra They were looking for a really good conductor to be their musical director They had hoped to get Eduard van Beinum but he suddenly died Then Georg Solti agreed to come for three years He was going to begin officially in 1962 but then he resigned because he had not been consulted when the orchestra had appointed Zubin Mehta as assistant conductor So Zubin Mehta became musical director

In 1969 Ernest Fleischmann became the manager of the orchestra He had some new ideas including starting the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society and the Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group Both these groups had musicians from the large symphony orchestra in them It gave the musicians a change to play different sorts of music Other orchestras in the world gradually copied this idea

When Zubin Mehta left to go to the New York Philharmonic in 1978 Carlo Maria Giulini took over as Music Director Giulini left when his wife became ill and went back to Italy Andr Previn was the next conductor He was a good conductor but he had some arguments with Fleischmann and so he resigned in 1989 and Esa Pekka Salonen took over He has conducted every season since then

The Plastic Island formed because currents near the center of the Northern Pacific Ocean move around in a kind of circle which catches and holds floating pieces of plastic It has been called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch

The Plastic Island actually has two areas described as an eastern patch and a western patch which are separated because of ocean currents Scientists estimate that the size of the plastic island is approximately equal to the land area of the United States but it could be as much as twice the size Also it is not really a floating island It is more like a soup of plastic pieces floating in the ocean just below the surface It is convert900kmabbron from California between Hawaii and Japan

Ships try to avoid this patch of garbage because it can get caught in their screws Unfortunately birds and other sea animals often eat the smaller pieces of plastic thinking that they are food swimming in the ocean The United Nations Environment Program estimates that the plastic soup causes the death of one million sea birds and 10000 sea animals every year Some micro invertebrates have also been found to eat tiny pieces of plastic with similar results

Since the plastics are organic compounds they tend to absorb other organic compounds such as pesticides Scientists have discovered high levels of DDT and other organic compounds in this deadly plastic soup

The pieces of plastic come from all over the world Any country that has a shore or river where such pieces blow or wash out to sea is a source Scientists estimate that the United States and other industrial countries contribute less garbage to the plastic island due to modern garbage disposal but such countries also produce and sell much of the plastic that becomes garbage for non industrial countries 

Changing winds and currents often cause parts of this plastic island to break away and send pieces of plastic toward the beaches and shorelines of Pacific Islands and the continents Its considered a major problem for tourism and because of the problems that it causes the island and ocean environments For example many birds turtles and other animals go to Pacific Islands to lay their eggs and raise their young They can eat or get caught in the garbage

This is a world wide environmental problem

In April 2008 Richard Sundance Owen and Steven Santos two building contractors and scuba dive instructor started the Environmental Cleanup Coalition to solve the problem of the pollution in the North Pacific They are working with other groups to find ways to safely remove plastic and organic compounds from the oceans

The Viking Age was a period in Northern European and Scandinavian history from the eighth to eleventh centuries Scandinavian Vikings also called Norsemen explored the oceans and rivers of Europe through trade and warfare The Vikings also reached Iceland Greenland Newfoundland and Anatolia Some Vikings are believed to have settled at LAnse aux Meadows an archaeological site on the northernmost tip of the island of Newfoundland Canada at a place they called Vinland

In England the Viking Age began dramatically on June 8 793 when Norsemen destroyed the abbey on Lindisfarne Monks were killed in the abbey thrown into the sea to drown or carried away as slaves along with the churchs wealth The Viking devastation of Northumbrias Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe Never before has such an atrocity been seen declared the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin of York More than any other single event the attack on Lindisfarne cast a shadow on the perception of the Vikings for the next 1100 years In the 1890s scholars outside Scandinavia began to rethink the achievements artistry technological skills and seamanship of the Vikings

Until Victorias reign in Britain Vikings were portrayed as violent and bloodthirsty The stories from medieval England had always portrayed them as wolves among sheep During the nineteenth century public opinions changed The first challenges to the many anti Viking images in Britain emerged in the 17th century Some scholarly works on the Viking Age became available to readers in Britain Archaeologists began to dig up Britains Viking past Linguists started to work on identifying Viking Age origins for rural idioms and proverbs The new dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled the Victorians to study some of the Icelandic Sagas

During the second half of the 18th century the Icelandic Sagas were still used as important historical sources but the Viking Age was regarded as a barbaric and uncivilized period in the history of the Nordic countries Until recently what was known about the history of the Viking Age was based on the Icelandic Sagas the history of the Danes written by Saxo Grammaticus the Russian Primary Chronicle and the War of the Irish with the Foreigners Few scholars still accept these texts as reliable sources historians nowadays rely more on archaeology and numismatics which have helped people understand the period

The Norsemen were explorers colonizers and traders as well as plunderers The Vikings from Norway explored the North Atlantic and settled Iceland the Faroe Islands Shetland and Orkney Islands Caithness in Scotland Greenland and North America The Vikings from Denmark raided ports and coastal towns along the coasts of Europe and Britain The Vikings from Sweden pushed east into areas that are now parts of Russia and Ukraine establishing trade connections with the Middle East and beyond

By the 9th century a strong central authority was established in Jutland and the Danes were looking beyond their own territory for land trade and plunder Norway had been settled over many centuries by Germanic peoples from Denmark and Sweden who made farming and fishing communities around its coasts and lakes The mountains and fjords formed strong natural boundaries The communities remained independent of each other unlike the situation in Denmark which is lowland By 800 some 30 small kingdoms existed in Norway The sea was the easiest way of communicating between these Norwegian kingdoms and the outside world In the eighth century Scandinavians began to build war ships and send them on raids The Viking longships were capable of travel on the open seas but also had a very shallow draft meaning they could sail into shallower bays and farther up rivers than other ships of their time This led to the term Viking which came from the Old Norse word vk A person who went on raids was said to go viking

It is unknown what triggered the Vikings expansion and conquests This era was at the same time as the Medieval Warm Period and stopped with the start of the Little Ice Age The lack of pack ice during their time may have allowed the Norsemen to go a viking or raiding It is believed that the heathen Norsemen suffered from unequal trade practices by Christian merchants who were given preference through a Christian network of traders A two tiered system of pricing existed among merchants who secretly traded with the Norse heathens Viking raids occurred both separately and together with regular trading expeditions 

Historians also suggest that the Scandinavian population was too large for the peninsula and there were not enough crops to feed everyone This led to a hunt for more land to feed the ever growing Viking population Internal conflicts especially during the period of conquest and settlement that followed the early raids caused the progressive centralisation of power into fewer hands This meant that lower classes who did not want to be oppressed by greedy kings went in search of their own lands Those who settled Iceland created Europes first modern republic with a yearly assembly of elected officials called the Althing

The earliest date given for a Viking raid is 787 CE when according to the Anglo Saxon Chronicle a group of men from Norway sailed to Portland in Dorset There a royal official mistook them for merchants They killed him when he tried to lead them to the kings manor to pay a trading tax on their goods The beginning of the Viking Age in the British Isles is however often given as 793 It was recorded in the Anglo Saxon Chronicle that the Northmen raided the important island monastery of Lindisfarne AD 793 This year came dreadful fore warnings over the land of the Northumbrians terrifying the people most woefully these were immense sheets of light rushing through the air and whirlwinds and fiery dragons flying across the firmament These tremendous tokens were soon followed by a great famine and not long after on the sixth day before the ides of January in the same year the harrowing inroads of heathen men made lamentable havoc in the church of God in Holy island by rapine and slaughter Anglo Saxon Chronicle

In 794 according to the Annals of Ulster there was a serious attack on Lindisfarnes mother house of Iona which was followed in 795 by raids on the northern coast of Ireland From bases there the Norsemen attacked Iona again in 802 causing great slaughter amongst the Cli D Brethren and burning the abbey to the ground

The end of the Viking Age is traditionally marked in England by three major events the failed invasion by Haraldr Harri who was defeated by Saxon King Harold Godwinson in 1066 at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in Ireland the capture of Dublin by Strongbow and his Hiberno Norman forces in 1171 and in Scotland by the defeat of King Hkon Hkonarson at the Battle of Largs in 1263 Harold Godwinson was subsequently defeated within a month by William Duke of Normandy who was another descendant of Vikings Normandy had been acquired by Normans in 911 Scotland took its present form when it regained territory from the Norse between the thirteenth and the fifteenth centuries

Most Scandinavian historians and archaeologists give a different definition Instead the Viking age is said to have ended with the establishment of royal authority in the Scandinavian countries and the adoption of Christianity as the dominant religion The date is usually put somewhere in the early 11th century in all three Scandinavian countries The end of the Viking Age in Norway is marked by the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030 They proclaimed Norway as a Christian nation and Norwegians could no longer be called Vikings

The Kingdom of the Franks under Charlemagne was especially hard hit by Viking raiders who could sail down the Seine without much difficulty Near the end of Charlemagnes reign and throughout the reigns of his sons and grandsons a string of Viking raids began leading to a Scandinavian conquest and settlement of the region now known as Normandy 

In 911 French King Charles the Simple made an agreement with the Viking warleader Rollo a chieftain of either Norwegian or Danish origin Charles gave Rollo the title of duke and granted him possession of Normandy In return Rollo swore fealty to Charles converted to Christianity and swore to defend the northern region of France against raids by other Viking groups Several generations later the Norman descendants of these Viking settlers identified themselves as French and brought the French language and their variant of French culture to England in 1066 With the Norman Conquest they became the ruling aristocracy of Anglo Saxon England leading to the change from Old English to Middle English language

At the start of the Viking age the Vikings adhered to the Norse religion and system of beliefs They believed in a broken wikt linkpantheonpantheon of gods and goddesses as well as Valhalla a heaven for warriors The lower class of society would go to a place called hel similar to life on earth According to Viking beliefs Viking chieftains would please their war gods by their bravery and would become worth ship that is the chieftain would earn a burial at sea They also performed land burials which often still included a ship treasure weapons tools clothing and even slaves and women buried alive with the dead chieftain for his journey to Valhalla and adventure in the after life Poets composed sagas about the exploits of these chieftains keeping their memories alive 

Freyr and his sister Freya were fertility gods They made sure that people had many children and that the land produced plenty of crops Some farmers even called their fields after Freyr in the hope that this would ensure a good harvest Toward the end of the Viking Age more and more Scandinavians were converted to Christianity often by force The introduction of Christianity did not immediately end Viking voyages but it may have been a factor that helped the Viking Age to an end

Some of the most important trading ports during the period include both existing and ancient cities such as Jelling Ribe Roskilde Hedeby Aarhus Vineta Truso Kaupang Birka Bordeaux Jorvik Dublin and Aldeigjuborg

Claret is a type of European red wine

The standard style of Bordeaux wine has not always been deep red It used to be more of a ros which is why its name is based on the French word clairet meaning pale The Plantagenet kingdom covering England and a lot of France from 1152 to 1453 supported wine trade between the regions As the taste for clairet developed in England claret was adopted to describe it

In the Late Middle Ages a claret was a spiced wine based drink produced by pouring wine usually a red over a bag containing a mix of spices It was similar and often the same to hypocras Spices that were specific to medieval clarets include anise caraway cardamom cinnamon and fennel The term now more often applies to unspiced red Bordeaux wine

The meaning of claret has changed over time and now means a dry dark red Bordeaux wine

The Treaty of Nantes allowed for freedom of religion in France It was made official for the first time on April 13 1598 King Louis XIV revoked the Treaty of Nantes and made Catholicism the religion of France in 1629 This made many Huguenots workers leave

Louis XIV did not like the Edict of Nantes Being an broken wikt linkabsolutismabsolute ruler Louis thought that there should be one king one nation and one church only  and that church had to be the Roman Catholic Church The king let Roman Catholics broken wikt linkpersecutepersecute Huguenots even after the Edict He hoped the Huguenots would become Roman Catholics Finally in 1685 King Louis withdrew the Edict of Nantes 

The government declared that no one could believe in any religion except Roman Catholicism Anyone joining in a Protestant service could die Because of this many Huguenots died for their faith Some though gave up and became Roman Catholics Others refusing to stop being Protestants ran away from France

Louis XIV was horrified when he lost the Huguenots They were among the most skilled workers in France Many bankers weavers and merchants were Huguenots Louis XIV ordered that Frances borders be closed and said that nobody could leave the country without his permission However Protestants still found ways to escape Some hid in barrels on ships sailing away from France Others disguised themselves as peasants and escaped All together probably more than two hundred thousand Huguenots ran away 

Protestant countries in Europe were glad to have such hard working subjects over a third of the Huguenots went to the Netherlands From there many of them went to the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope Many went to England and from there to America especially Virginia and the Carolinas

These immigrants were very valuable to their new home countries They were hard working obedient and talented They also brought many secrets of French manufacturing with them for example they introduced silk production to the rest of Europe

Trial by ordeal is a way to decide if someone is guilty or innocent of a crime This was usually done by causing the accused person to do a task that was painful If that task was completed without injury or if the injuries healed fast this was usually taken as a sign of God which meant that the accused was innocent People believed that God would not allow the innocent to be harmed He would therefore help them by doing a miracle The practice has been shown to exist in polytheistic cultures as far back as the Code of Hammurabi and the Code of Ur Nammu and in animist tribal societies such as the trial by ingestion of red water in Sierra Leone There the intended effect is magical rather than invocation of a deitys justice

In pre modern society the ordeal typically was done together with the oath and witness accounts as the central means by which to reach a verdict Indeed the term ordeal itself Old English ordl has the meaning of judgment verdict from Proto Germanic uzdailjam that which is dealt out 

In Europe ordeals commonly required an accused person to test himself or herself against fire or water How this was done in detail varied and was different at different places and times In England ordeals were common under both the Anglo Saxons and the Normans Fire was the element typically used to test noble defendants while water was more commonly used by lesser folk 

Priestly cooperation in trials by fire and water was forbidden by Pope Innocent III at the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 and replaced by compurgation Trials by ordeal became more rare over the Late Middle Ages often replaced by confessions extracted under torture but the practice was discontinued only in the 16th century Johannes Hartlieb in 1456 reports a popular superstition on how to identify a thief by an ordeal by ingestion practiced privately without judicial sanction

He was killed as a main target during the Night of the Long Knives by the SS Hitler justified his actions the next day by announcing that Von Schleicher and Ernst Rhm were plotting to overthrow him His wife Elizabeth was also killed in the attack

The Vienna Philharmonic is an orchestra based in Vienna Austria It is thought of as one of the greatest orchestras in the world

The orchestra play in a concert hall called the Musikverein Before becoming a member of the Vienna Philharmonic the musicians have to work for at least three years in the opera house Then they are allowed to try to become a member of the Vienna Philharmonic

The orchestra started in 1842 when Otto Nicolai formed the Philharmonische Academie The members of this orchestra made all the decisions about how the orchestra should be organized and the orchestra still works in this way today

When Nicolai left in 1847 the orchestra nearly came to an end They did not play very much until 1860 when Karl Anton Eckert joined as conductor Since then the orchestra has given concerts all the time

On single reed instruments like a clarinet or saxophone the mouthpiece is shaped like a wedge The reed is placed near the players bottom lip This area is called the table When the player blows the reed vibrates This is then made louder by the instrument

The shape of the inside of the mouthpiece can change the sound very much The sound made by a mouthpiece that is large and round will be very different from the sound made by a mouthpiece that is small and square

The space between the end of the reed and the end of the mouthpiece is called the tip opening

The facing is the part of the reed that starts to curve around the end of the mouthpiece The length of the facing can change the response of the instrument

The ligature is what holds the reed onto the mouthpiece Anything that can hold the reed onto the mouthpiece can be called a ligature Most ligatures are made from metal or plastic Some people like to use ordinary string to hold the reed onto the mouthpiece

Other hostile Indians attacked San Luis Obispo on three separate occasions before 1774 During the attack the thatched roofs of the mission buildings were set afire by blazing arrows In May 1807 the mission was designated as one of six in which the California priests could make their annual retreats for spiritual exercises Following Mexicos war against Spain in 1810 all the California missions were forced to contribute food and clothing to the army  In 1834 it was destroyed in an earthquake but later was rebuilt with stone

The tambourine is a well known percussion instrument It is often used in large orchestras but can also be used in marching bands and other music groups

The tambourine looks like a small hand held drum but in addition to the skin which can be hit in various ways by the other hand or fingers there are also small pairs of jingles  like tiny cymbals  which are fixed in slots around the frame This is the usual kind used in orchestras However tambourines come in many shapes and forms Some are made without a skin particularly for use in schools They are also found in various forms in many parts of the world The tambourine came to Europe through the Arabs who brought it to Italy and Spain They can be used in classical music as well as in pop music and rock music

The tambourine is usually held in the hand The jingles can be made to sound by hitting the frame of the instrument with the other hand or by shaking the instrument in various ways Very often the player will hold the instrument high in the air This not only looks good but it can also be heard well The other hand can tap rhythms on the skin which makes it sound like a drum as well as making the jingles sound It can be hit by the knuckles or with the finger tips or the flat of the hand or the back of the hand It can also be hit against the side of the leg A good player with a good tambourine can sometimes create a nice effect with a thumb roll This is done by making the tip of the thumb slightly wet and then moving it fast along the edge of the skin so that the thumb bounces very fast

It is also possible to put the instrument with the head up on the players lap or on a table or chair and play with the fingers or with drumsticks

When a tambourine is used in an orchestra it is usually just one tambourine although Berlioz asked for two tambourines in his overture Le carnaval romain It is very often used in music which sounds Italian or Spanish It nearly always makes music sound very lively eg in the last movement of Prokofievs First Violin Concerto

A Tachyon is any hypothetical particle that could travel faster than the speed of light Curiously the slower a tachyon moves the more energy it has Conversely the more energy a tachyon has the slower it would go but never to be equal to or slower than the speed of light

Scientists do not know if tachyons exist Einsteins theory of special relativity says nothing can travel faster than the speed of light If a tachyon did exist it would have an imaginary number as its mass Scientists do not know how something with imaginary mass would act because a particle going this fast may not be affected by the normal cause and effect force that affects normal particles

Many scientists believe that if one tachyon existed in the universe at any time then the universe would be overrun by more and more tachyons This is probably due to the fact that as they slow down they increase energy However other scientists still believe that they could exist if they did not interact with normal matter

All known particles that go below the speed of light are known as bradyons

Naturist Christians are the Christians who practice naturism or nudism and are a part of the clothes free movement They believe that the human body was the greatest making of God and is neither shameful nor should be covered Naturist Christians can be found in almost all of the different groups of Christianity and they do not find any conflict with the teachings of the Bible and living their lives and worshiping God without any clothing However most have various differences with New Age and man centered philosophy which is common among other naturists and wish to be separated from it This includes not worshiping nature at all

In the Book of Genesis Adam and Eve were living in the Garden of Eden as man and wife They ate the fruit not allowed by God after being talked into it by the devil in the form of a snake Then their eyes were opened and they knew that they were naked So they gathered fig leaves to be used as simple clothing to cover their sexual organs These became lacking very quickly and Adam and Eve hid themselves from God in the trees

Naturist Christians believe that it was the devil not God who told them that they were naked Nor was it the desire of God that Adam and Eve wore clothing even though they sinned Still God did not take away the fig leaves of theirs Just the opposite they had free desire and He made them clothing from the skins of animals which required a killing an animal After the execution of Jesus the sacrifice of animals is no longer needed for the punishment of sin For these reasons Naturist Christians believe that we do not need to wear clothing and the desire of the flesh can be avoided through Gods power

Lake Eyre is the lowest point in Australia at about Convert15mft0abbron below sea level When it fills with water it is the largest lake in Australia being convert144kmmi0lkonabbron long and convert77kmmi0lkonabbron wide It is also in the driest part of Australia getting only about convert100mmin0lkonabbron of rain each year It is in the north of South Australia about convert700kmmi0lkonabbron north of Adelaide The lake was named after the explorer Edward Eyre who was the first European to see it in 1840 It is the centre of the Lake Eyre National Park

Lake Eyre is in the driest desert region of central Australia It is a large endorheic lake system which means that the water flows in but does not flow out As the water evaporates the lake dries up leaving a dry salt lake The lake does not usually completely dry up there is often water in small areas on the lake surface The rate that the water dries up is convert25min0lkonabbron per year that is about 20 times more than the rainfall in the area

During the wet season the rivers from Queensland flow towards the lake through the Channel Country These rivers drain about one sixth of Australia an area the size of Spain How much water reaches the lake depends on how rain falls in Queensland Since 1885 the lake has filled in 18861887 18891890 19161917 1950 1955 and 1974 1976 In 1974 Lake Eyre was convert6mft0lkonabbron deep Local rain filled Lake Eyre to convert35mft0lkonabbron in 1984 and 1989 Very heavy rain in January 2007 took about six weeks to reach the lake but put only a small amount of water into it In February 2009 water from flooding rains in Queensland were flowing along the creeks to the lake covering about 40 km per day The lake fills to about convert15mft0lkonabbron every three years to convert4mft0lkonabbron every ten years and fills up about four times every 100 years

When Lake Eyre is full the water is almost fresh and native fresh water fish can live in it The lake becomes saltier as the convert450mmin0lkonabbron salt crust dissolves over six months This kills millions of fish When about 4m deep the Lake is as salty as the sea It becomes more salty as the water evaporates At about 500mm depth the Lake becomes a pink color because of a beta carotene pigment made by the algae Dunaliella salina

Beaches made by wave action suggest that during the Medieval Warm Period Lake Eyre possibly held permanent water at levels above those of 1974 

The local Aboriginal people the Arabunna people have stories that explain the creation of Lake Eyre These stories are part of their sacred traditions and are only told to initiated people

Fresh water fish found in the full lake include boney bream the Lake Eyre Basin sub species of golden perch and various small hardyhead species The Lake Eyre hardyhead can live in water up to 15 times saltier than the ocean

When there is water more than 8 million birds from more than 60 different species flock to the lake The pelicans are usually the first to arrive followed by silver gulls hoary headed grebes Australasian grebes cormorants ducks banded stilts kites falcons and wedge tailed eagles Scientists still do not know how the birds know when the lake holds water

There is also a lizard the Lake Eyre Dragon Ctenophorus  maculosus that lives in the cool mud below the salt crust of the lake

The Lake Eyre Yacht Club is a small group of people who sail on the lakes floods including recent trips in 1997 2000 2001 2004 2007 and 2009 A number of 6 m Trailer Sailers sailed on Lake Eyre in 1975 1976 and 1984 when the flood depth reached 36 m

The salt crust on the lake is not thick and can break like glass under a persons weight At Level Post Bay the crust is more than one metre thick and because of its flat surface it has been the site for various land speed record attempts In 1964 British driver Sir Donald Campbell set a new record of convert664kphmph0lkonabbron in the Bluebird Proteus CN7

Castanets are percussion instruments which come from Spain They are often used in an orchestra Castanets are hollowed out wooden shells A hardwood such as ebony or rosewood is used

Castanets are used in pairs Traditionally two pairs are played together one pair held in each hand There is a string which passes through small holes in the shells The player winds the string round the thumb and finger so that the two shells can be clicked together The two pairs of castanets used are slightly different sizes so that they make a slightly different pitch The higher pair known as hembra is usually held in the right hand with the larger macho pair held in the left

Castanets are traditionally played by singers and dancers Spanish folk dancers often use castanets They are often associated with flamenco dancing

When they are played in an orchestra they are often attached to a stand The technique of playing is therefore different They can be tapped by the fingers and palm of the hand They are often used in music which is supposed to sound Spanish In ballet and opera they are used to accompany Spanish dances Carmen the character in Bizets opera Carmen sings a song and accompanies herself on the castanets Normally the opera singer will not have the skill to play them so the castanets are played by a percussion player in the orchestra while Carmen pretends to be playing them

The vibraphone is an percussion instrument It looks like a xylophone but the bars are made of aluminium instead of wood Like the xylophone the bars are arranged in a similar way to a piano keyboard so that tunes can be played An alternate form is the 6 plus 6 system where each row has the bars in a whole tone distance and both rows are in a half tone distance The player uses mallets either one or two in each hand There are tubes underneath each bar These are called resonators They make the sound louder There is also an electric motor which can be switched on by a pedal This makes fans go round and round in the ventilators and makes a very strong vibrating sound This is why the instrument has its name Sometimes people call a vibraphone vibes  

Vibraphones were first made in the United States in 1921

The mallets are beaters with a rubber ball at the end Yarn or a hard cord is wound tightly round these balls Vibraphone mallets are usually slightly harder than the ones ones used for the marimba They usually consist of a rubber ball core wrapped in yarn or cord and attached to a narrow dowel most commonly made of rattan or birch Mallets suitable for the vibraphone are also generally suitable for the marimba There are different ways of holding them A common way is to hold them between the thumb and index finger using the other fingers to help control the sticks Playing with four mallets is harder but allows the player to play harmony

Sometimes special techniques are used such as pitch bending This is done by sliding one of the mallets along a bar in a special way Occasionally players are asked to use a bow such as cello or double bass bow and bow across the edge of a bar

The vibraphone is used in the orchestra in Alban Bergs opera Lulu It is also used in works by Olivier Messiaen Leonard Bernstein Benjamin Britten and Vaughan Williams Vibraphones are commonly heard in jazz especially in combos

Infantilism or Paraphilic Infantilism is a paraphilia to desire to wear diapers and be treated like an infant or more commonly a toddler Such people are usually referred to as Infantilists or Adult Babies

Some Infantilists are diaper lovers as well so they are usually referred to as ABDLs Most infantilists are heterosexual or straight males

Infantilism or diaper fetishes are different in self image and the focus of attention Both ideals can be found in the same person at the same time and are similar However it must be said that both have nothing to do with having a sexual preference for children or pedophilia In any case there is no single form but a variety of infantilism types Some infantilists are not obvious and try to blend in while others wish they could be free of all guilt and responsibilities All variations focus on diapers and babyhood

The new strain of swine influenza A is called H1N1 is responsible for the swine flu outbreak in 2009 in humans It resulted from a combination of several strains of influenza in humans and influenza in birds as well as swine influenza Tests were done they found that the hemagglutinin gene was similar to that of swine flu viruses present in United States pigs since 1999 but the neuraminidase and matrix protein genes resembled versions present in European swine Viruses that were built like this had not been found in humans or pigs before There is no program to monitor what viruses are circulating in pigs in the United States however People currently ignore where this new strain of viruses came from 

The first known case was a five year old boy named Edgar Hernandez The boy had been near a pig farm in La Gloria Veracruz state in Mexico This farm raises almost one million pigs a year People living nearby have been complaining about the clouds of flies These flies are attracted by so called manure lagoons which is one of the problems such large farms have It was first thought the boy had a normal influenza Laboratory tests showed however that he had contracted swine flu The boy fully recovered

If the people who are supposed to be familiar with this didnt know what it was how will we ever know how my son got it Edgars mother Hernandez said

La Gloria Perote Veracruz is a small community surrounded by large pig farms Reports indicate that during February 2009 over 400 people in the town had flu like symptoms and 2 infants died of pneumonia 

Juan Rodriguez died of pneumonia February 9th at age 7 months

Yovanni Apolinar also died of pneumonia March 12th aged 2 months

An unidentified Mexican toddler contracted swine flu in Brownsville Texas United States and died April 29th in Houston Texas United States at age 23 months

The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say that while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick it does not block infection or shedding of the virus

Dr Anne Schuchat interim Deputy Director for CDC Science and Public Health said that the American cases were found to be made up of genetic elements from four different flu viruses North American swine influenza North American avian influenza human influenza and swine influenza virus typically found in Asia and Europe an unusually mongrelised mix of genetic sequences Pigs have been shown to act as a potential mixing vessel in which reassortment can occur between flu viruses of several species This new strain appears to be a result of reassortment of human influenza and swine influenza viruses presumably due to superinfection in an individual human Influenza viruses readily undergo reassortment due to antigenic shift because their genome is split between eight pieces of RNA

The current strain of swine flu can adapt to humans and spread more efficiently than previously known swine H1N1 strains Moreover co infection of H1N1 swine flu and Oseltamivir resistant H1N1 season flu can lead to acquisition of the H274Y mutation by the swine flu via recombination or reassortment Swine H1N1 with human H1 and N1 have been reported

The 1918 flu pandemic strain had undergone polymorphism from swine and human H1N1 in all eight pieces of RNA gene segments Similar swapping of gene segments in humans co infected with seasonal human influenza and swine H1N1 can lead to rapid evolution

The new strain of swine influenza A is currently listed by the United States and World Health Organization as a Stage 5 pandemic virus

The Myers Briggs Type Indicator is a set of questions based on psychology By answering the questions people can learn about how they tend to make choices They can also learn about how they view the world After answering the questions in the Myers Briggs Type Indicator people are placed in one of sixteen groups These groups are based on theories by Carl Gustav Jung in his book Psychological Types which was published in 1921

Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers first created the set of questions in the time of World War II The set of questions was made to help women who were working for the first time Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Meyers thought that the set of questions would help women be happier and work better The set of questions has grown into the Myers Briggs Type Indicator The MBTI that we use today was created in 1962 

The MBTI measures four things The first is Introversion and Extraversion Extraversion and Introversion are outlooks Extraverts are people who get energy from the outside world Extraverts tend to like to spend their time with other people Introverts are people who get energy from the inside world Introverts tend to get energy from thinking and reflecting

The second measure is Sensing and Intuition Sensing and Intuition are ways of gathering information People who are Sensing trust facts Sensing people accept things if they can see hear touch taste or smell them People who tend to like Intuition are more likely to accept outcomes based on other people and meanings that cannot be tested 

The third measure is Thinking and Feeling Thinking and Feeling are ways that people make decisions Those who prefer Thinking tend to make decisions alone They heavily weigh reason good sense order and cause and effect Those who prefer Feeling are more likely to think of the effect that a decision may have on other people They tend to try to gain balance and agreement with everyone that is involved It is important to note that those who prefer Thinking do not think better than those who prefer Feeling and those who prefer Feeling do not make decisions based only on people

The last measure is of Judging and Perceiving Judging and Perceiving detail how people deal with the outside world A person who likes Judging tends to report that they use Thinking or Feeling to deal with the outside world A person who likes Perceiving tends to report that they use Sensing or Intuition to deal with the outside world

A Myers Briggs type is made up of each of the preferences above 

For example an ESTJ would be a person who prefers Extraversion Sensing Thinking and Judging

An INFP would be a person who prefers Introversion Intuition Feeling and Perceiving

It is a type of philosophy It says that whatever works for you is true

A Vindication of the Rights of Woman with Strictures on Political and Moral Subjects is a book written by Mary Wollstonecraft in 1792 Today it is known as one of the first books about feminism In the 18th century some people thought that women should not get a formal education Wollstonecraft wrote this work as a reply to them She says that women should have an education that fits their position in society She says women are very important to the nation because it is women who usually educate their children She says that an educated woman can also be companions to their husbands rather than just uneducated wives Wollstonecraft does not see women as ornaments to society or property to be traded in marriage She argues that they are human beings and therefore deserve the same basic rights men have

In 1791 Charles Maurice de Talleyrand Prigord wrote a report to the French National Assembly In this report he argued that women should only receive a very basic education Wollstonecraft used this report to write her reply She also led an attack on the sexual double standards the society of the day had She also indicted men for encouraging women to indulge in lots of emotion Wollstonecraft wrote the Rights of Woman quickly so that she could directly respond to ongoing events she wanted to write a more thoughtful second volume but died before doing so

Wollstonecraft calls for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life such as morality but she does not write that men and women are equal in all things This has made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist as they believe men and women are equal in all things She could not use either the word or the concept of feminism because they were only developed later Today many people believe that her work was not received well but this may be wrong People who believe this also believe that Wollstonecraft was as reviled during her lifetime as she became after the publication of William Godwins Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman However the Rights of Woman was actually well received when it was first published in 1792 One biographer has called it perhaps the most original book of Wollstonecrafts century

The Oyster card is a form of electronic ticketing used on public transport services within the London region of the England It is promoted by Transport for London and is valid on a number of different travel systems across London including London Underground buses the Docklands Light Railway London Overground trams some river boat services and most National Rail services within the London Fare Zones More importantly it is very similar to Travelcard a branch from the original Londons e payment cards

A standard Oyster card is a blue credit card sized stored value card which can hold a variety of single tickets period tickets and travel permits which must be added to the card prior to travel It is also a contactless smartcard which passengers must touch onto an electronic reader when entering and leaving the transport system in order to validate it or deduct funds The cards may be recharged in person from numerous sales points by recurring payment authority or by online purchase The card is designed to reduce the number of transactions at ticket offices and the number of single paper tickets sold on the London transport network Use is encouraged by offering substantially cheaper fares on Oyster than payment with cash

The card was first issued to the public in July 2003 with a limited range of features and there continues to be a phased introduction of further functions By June 2010 over 34 million Oyster cards had been issued and more than 80 of all journeys on services run by Transport for London used the Oyster card

Cymbals are percussion instruments They are discs made of copper bronze or a special alloy They look rather like saucepan lids but in the middle they jut out a little and they have straps there that pass through a hole

There are two ways of playing cymbals One way is to use a pair of cymbals that are the same The player holds one cymbal in each hand holding them by the strap He then bangs the cymbals together There are many ways of doing this depending on the sort of sound that is wanted For example a very quiet sound can be made by rubbing the edges of the cymbals together A very loud sound can be made by hitting them together as the arms form a circle and letting the cymbals vibrate for a long time by holding them in the air

Another way of playing the cymbal is to use just one cymbal and to hang it on a stand It can then be played with a beater stick or wire brush It can be hit at the edge in the middle or half way between depending on the sound that is wanted 

Cymbals are made in different sizes Some may be just 25 cm across large ones may be up to 60 cm across Cymbals do not normally give any particular pitch There are however small ones based on an old form of cymbal which are called crotales There are also Chinese cymbals which have a turned up edge 

Cymbals are used in many different musical groups They are heard in an orchestra in jazz groups percussion groups and bands including marching bands A drum kit always has at least one cymbal This may be a crash cymbal or a pair of hi hats a pair of small cymbals operated by pressing a pedal with the foot

The word cymbal comes from the Latin cymbalum which itself comes from the Greek word kumbalom meaning a small bowl It was used in many ancient cultures including Egyptian civilisations

Cymbals are often used in orchestras The first composer to use them was probably Joseph Haydn in his Military Symphony They are often used when there is a big climax for example in the Academic Festival Overture by Johannes Brahms but they can also sometimes be played very quietly Sometimes players should let the cymbal vibrate for a long time after a big crash but at other times he may have to hold the cymbals against his body quickly to stop the noise This is called damping the sound

Cymbals have traditionally often been played together with the bass drum This makes a crash bang wallop noise

Berwickshire is a British county in Scotland It is also the name of a committee area of the Scottish Borders Council Berwickshire is on the boundary of Scotland with England It is named after Berwick upon Tweed but Scotland lost Berwick to England in 1482

Berwickshires first county town was the Royal Burgh of Berwick upon Tweed In 1482 England seized Berwick After that the shires business was done at Duns or Lauder until Greenlaw became the county town in 1596

A Sheriff Court sits in Duns

Berwickshire County Council like all the County Councils in Scotland was made in 1890 The Council met in Duns Berwickshire County Council was ended in 1975

In 1975 a new Borders Region was made A Berwickshire District Council was made within it too with an area like the countys but not the same Berwickshire District Council was ended in 1996

Berwickshire is now all in the Scottish Borders Council Area

In 1890 when Berwickshire County Council was made the Council asked the Lord Lyon King of Arms to give them a shield and arms He gave a shield and arms to the County Council on 10 October 1890

The shield shows a bear chained to a wych elm tree The bear and wych elm are part of Berwick upon Tweeds shield because they sound like the towns name

On 12 November 1975 the Lord Lyon gave the arms again to Berwickshire District Council When the district council ended in 1996 the right to the arms went back to the Queen

Berwickshires name is still used locally The Berwickshire News is a newspaper in the county and many groups keep Berwickshire in their titles

The Berwickshire Civic Society is asking the Council to put road signs up to tell drivers who are coming into the county that they are coming into Berwickshire The Berwickshire Civic Society has a Keep Berwickshire Tidy competition each April

The Pacific Electric Railroad Bridge or Southern Pacific Railroad Bridge is a historic railroad bridge in Torrance California USA It spans across Torrance Boulevard at Bow Street a short distance west of Western Avenue It was once part of the northsouth Torrance to San Pedro spur line of the Pacific Electric Railway The line was the railroads first interurban line to San Pedro After splitting off to the east from the Union Tool Company plant which was once a short distance south of the bridge the line ended at a Columbia Steel steel mill by running up and over the eastwest Torrance local line It is the only part of the PE which crossed itself this way This was due to the areas geography If the railroad simply built a spur off of the main line it would have meant that trains trying to get to the steel mill would have faced too steep a climb The steel mill has since been torn down to make way for the national headquarters of American Honda Motor Company but the remaining part of the Torrance line  which once had two separate tracks  was rebuilt in 2003 and is still in use for local train runs by the Union Pacific Railroad Gone too are the Pacific Electrics Torrance shops at the western branch of the split now the site of an industrial park and which still receives trains on the local line

The bridge was designed by Irving Gill and was built in 1913 as part of the original layout of the city as drawn up by Jared Sidney Torrance and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr It became the citys second entry in the National Register of Historic Places on July 13 1989 after Torrance High School  It is also listed with the California Office of Historic Preservation 

Though tracks and track parts remain on the bridge it is no longer in use nor has it been for quite some time There is no chance of the bridge ever being used to carry trains again since the right of way at either end has been changed and the tracks removed Even so the Pacific Electric Railroad Bridge has become a symbol of the city as part of the Torrance Police Departments logo as of January 1 2000 only the third such change in the departments history

Anglerfish are marine fish that belong to the order Lophiiformes Anglerfish are noted for having a bait like appendage in front of their heads right above their mouths 

The appendage which resembles a fishing pole is attached to the end of the dorsal fins front spine which is separated from the rest of the fin Anglerfish light their rod with bioluminescence and then wiggle it to mimic a small marine animal When other creatures come to eat the small marine animal the anglerfish eats them They are called anglerfish because they catch fish with bait just like anglers who use a rod and line

A mitochondrial genome phylogenetic study suggested that anglerfishes diversified in a short period of the Lower Cretaceous between 130 and 100 million years ago

Influenzavirus B

Influenzavirus C

Isavirus

The Orthomyxoviridae are a family of RNA viruses They include five genera Influenzavirus A Influenzavirus B Influenzavirus C Thogotovirus and Isavirus The first three genera contain viruses that cause influenza in vertebrates including birds humans and other mammals Isaviruses infect salmon thogotoviruses infect vertebrates and invertebrates such as mosquitoes and sea lice

The three genera of Influenzavirus can be told apart by the structure of their proteins They infect vertebrates as follows

There are three genera of influenza virus Influenzavirus A Influenzavirus B and Influenzavirus C Each genus includes only one species or type Influenza A virus Influenza B virus and Influenza C virus respectively Influenza A and C infect multiple species while influenza B almost exclusively infects humans

Influenza A viruses are further classified based on the viral surface proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase Sixteen H subtypes and nine N subtypes of influenza A virus have been identified

Further variation exists thus specific influenza strain isolates are identified by a standard nomenclature specifying virus type geographical location where first isolated sequential number of isolation year of isolation and HA and NA subtype

Examples of the nomenclature are 

The type A viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the three influenza types and causes the most severe disease The serotypes that have been confirmed in humans ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths are

Influenza B virus is almost exclusively a human pathogen and is less common than influenza A The only other animal known to be susceptible to influenza B infection is the seal This type of influenza mutates at a rate 2 3 times lower than type A and consequently is less genetically diverse with only one influenza B serotype As a result of this lack of antigenic diversity a degree of immunity to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age However influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible This reduced rate of antigenic change combined with its limited host range ensures that pandemics of influenza B do not occur

The influenza C virus infects humans and pigs and can cause severe illness and local epidemics However influenza C is less common than the other types and usually seems to cause mild disease in children

Lohengrin is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner Wagner wrote both the words and the music The story comes from an old German legend

Some of the music has become very famous especially the music from Act III where Elsa Lohengrin enter the bridal chamber This music is called the Bridal Chorus It is also popularly known as Here comes the Bride It is very often played on the organ at the beginning of weddings

Lohengrin is a story written by an unknown German author It is related to other stories that belong to the Knight of the Swan tradition

Wagners opera is like a fairy tale It immediately became very popular The young King Ludwig II of Bavaria built a fairy tale castle in the south of Germany and called it Neuschwanstein meaning New Swan Stone The King was very fond of Wagners music and gave him a lot of money to help him with his next operas especially for the cycle known as the Ring of the Nibelung 

It was first performed in Weimar Germany on 28 August 1850 with Franz Liszt conducting Liszt chose to conduct it on that particular day because 28 August was the birthday of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe who had lived in Weimar

Wagner did not hear the first performance In May 1849 he had run away from Germany because he had been involved in a revolution He fled to Switzerland He did not hear his opera Lohengrin until 15 May 1861 when he saw a performance in Vienna

The opera starts with a prelude played by the orchestra It describes an angel coming down from the sky with the Holy Grail 

King Henry the Fowler has arrived in Brabant He is sitting by the banks of the river Scheldt Around him are Counts and nobles of the Saxon army Opposite them are Counts and nobles of Brabant King Henry explains that he had been fighting Hungarians who came to invade his country They had agreed not to fight for nine years but these nine years were now coming to an end and his men would have to fight again The King wants the Brabantines to help them He asks one of their bravest knights Friedrich von Telramund to explain why the Brabantines are arguing amongst themselves

Count Telramund explains that the Duke of Brabant had recently died As he lay dying he had asked Telramund to look after his daughter Elsa and his son Gottfried One day the two children had gone into the forest and Elsa had returned alone The Duke tried to find out what had happened to Gottfried The Dukes wife Ortrud persuades the Duke to accuse Elsa of murdering her brother The duke then makes himself the king of Brabant

Elsa knows that she is innocent and asks God to be her judge She needs a knight to fight for her Telramund agrees to fight him

The second time that the Herald calls the unknown knight a miracle happens A boat pulled by a swan appears A knight in shining armour stands in the boat He gets out of the boat tells the swan that it can go and then he greets the king He asks Elsa if he can be her knight Elsa kneels in front of him and asks for his help He says that he will serve her but he asks one thing that she should never ask him what his name is or where he comes from Elsa agrees Everyone except for Ortrud prays and the fight starts The unknown knight wins but then he spares Telramunds life The unknown knight now takes Elsas hand and asks her to marry him

The action takes place in the courtyard outside the cathedral It is night Telramund and Ortrud have been told to go away Ortrud is a heathen witch the daughter of Radbod the Duke of Frisia She tries to make Telramund brave again She is going to persuade Elsa to ask the unknown knight what is name is 

When Elsa comes onto the balcony in the morning she sees Ortrud and feels sorry for her An announcement is made that the king has decided to give the unnamed knight the title of Duke of Brabant He says he does not want the title and prefers to be known just as Guardian of Brabant 

The King the Knight Elsa and her attendants are about to go into the church Ortrud beautifully dressed appears and says that the knight is a magician Telramund appears and says that the result of the fight he had did not count because the knight has not told his name The knight still refuses to tell his name

The bedroom of the young couple Elsa and her new husband enter to the well known music called the Bridal Chorus The couple say they love one another However Elsa still remembers how Ortrud was pressing her to ask the Knight his name She asks him who he is Telramund and four of his friends rush into the room to attack the knight but Telramund is killed instead The Knight is very sad and tells Elsa they will now go to the King and he will tell him who he is

The scene changes to the banks of the river as in Act I The army is ready for war Telramunds dead body is carried in The Knight explains why he killed Telramund He tells the story of the Holy Grail and says that he is Lohengrin Knight of the Holy Grail and son of King Parsifal He says that he now has to return to his home He had only stayed so long so that he could prove that Elsa was innocent 

Sadly he says goodbye to his young wife The swan comes again Lohengrin prays that Elsa may get her lost brother back The swan dives into the river and appears again in the form of Gottfried Elsas brother He had been turned into a swan by the evil magic of Ortrud

A dove comes down from heaven and takes the place of the swan at the head of the boat It takes Lohengrin to the castle of the Holy Grail Elsa is so upset that she dies

Wagner Nights by Ernest Newman

The Helmeted honeyeater Lichenostomus melanops cassidix is an endangered species of bird It is the only species of bird found only in Victoria Australia The Helmeted honeyeater became the state of Victorias official bird emblem in 1971

Famous ornithologist John Gould first described the bird as being a separate species which he named Ptilotis cassidix in 1867 It now one of the three sub species of the Yellow tufted honeyeater Lichenostomus melanops The other sub species are not endangered

This bird is only found in a five km long patch of forest along two streams in the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve 50 km east of Melbourne A reserve was set up in the Bunyip State Park for releasing birds raised in captivity In 2003 there were 103 individuals in the wild with 20 breeding pairs known as well as a further 34 birds in captivity at the Healesville Sanctuary The 2009 Victorian bushfires burnt to within 200 metres of bird colony at Bunyip State Park Captive birds had to be moved to the Melbourne Zoo when the fires also came close to the Healesville Sanctuary However on April 28 2009 13 birds bred in captivity were released back into the wild The number of wild birds is now believed to be 113

 National Fuel Gas Co NYSENFG is an energy company It is made up of five business divisions

National Fuel Gas was incorporated in 1902 and is based in Williamsville New York

The Utility division sells natural gas or moves natural gas from one part of the country to another The Pipeline and Storage division provides interstate natural gas transportation and storage services for related and non related companies The Exploration and Production division prospects for and extracts natural gas and oil from the ground The Energy Marketing division markets natural gas to industrial commercial government and residential customers The Timber division markets wood from its New York and Pennsylvania forests and it owns two sawmills in northwestern Pennsylvania to cut wood into useful sizes and treat it with chemicals to make it last longer

National Fuel Gas was one of the first gas utility companies in the United States and so they have been the first to create some new technologies Engineers at the company discovered that empty underground gas fields could be used to store gas that has been taken from the ground somewhere else Thus the first such storage facility in the US was set up at Zoar Field about forty miles south of Buffalo This turned out to be a good financial decision for NFG in the 1940s and 50s when increased demand for natural gas led to long pipelines in the eastern states being connected to new pipelines and fields in the southwestern states NFG could then buy huge amounts of cheaper summer gas from the southwest pipe it to the New York storage fields pump it down into the ground then take it back out when demand and prices went up in the winter months 

The company was also the first in the industry to make a gas fired generator to electrify pipelines so they wouldnt corrode so much

In 1975 with the introduction of Balanced Billing the company claimed that it was the only gas utility in the country with a flexible plan for customers to pay bills in eleven equal monthly payments with settlement of any overpayment or underpayment in the twelfth month This is a sort of system of installment credit

National Fuel Gas Co is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol NFG Its fiscal year ends September 30

In abstract algebra an isomorphism can be thought of as a function that preserves sets and the relations among their elements Formally an isomorphism between two groups is a bijective map that preserves the group operation That is for x and y elements of a group G   

As an example consider the group Z of integers under ordinary addition and the function  2x which maps elements of Z to elements of the even integers 2Z since  2 2a2b  this is an example of an isomorphism that is also an automorphism  

in abstract algebra an automorphism is an isomorphism from a group or set of elements onto itself

In abstract algebra the center of a group G denoted by Z is the set of elements which commute with every element of G meaning that for any element x of a group G and an element y of Z xy yx The center is equal to the intersection of the centralizers of the group elements 

The notation Z comes from the fact that in German the word for center is zentrum

In 1978 Gilbert Baker of San Francisco designed and made a flag with six stripes representing the six colors of the rainbow as a symbol of gay and lesbian community pride Slowly the flag took hold offering a colorful and optimistic alternative to the more common pink triangle symbol Today it is recognized by the International Congress of Flag Makers and is flown in lesbian and gay pride marches worldwide In 1989 the rainbow flag received nationwide attention after John Stout successfully sued his landlords in West Hollywood when they prohibited him from displaying the flag from his apartment balcony Meanwhile Baker is still in San Francisco and still making more flags 

In computer science a program specification is the definition of what a computer program is expected to do It can be informal in which case it can be considered as a blueprint or user manual from a developer point of view or formal in which case it has a definite meaning defined in mathematical or programmatic terms In practice most successful specifications are written to understand and fine tune applications that were already well developed although safety critical software systems are often carefully specified prior to application development Specifications are most important for external interfaces that must remain stable

In systems engineering a specification is a document that clearly and accurately describes the essential technical requirements for items materials or services including the procedures by which it can be determined that the requirements have been met Specifications help avoid duplication and inconsistencies allow for accurate estimates of necessary work and resources act as a negotiation and reference document for engineering changes provide documentation of configuration and allow for consistent communication among those responsible for the eight primary functions of Systems Engineering They provide a precise idea of the problem to be solved so that they can efficiently design the system and estimate the cost of design alternatives They provide guidance to testers for verification of each technical requirement

In computer science debugging is the process of finding errors in a computer program If we think that the program may have an error we must debug the program in order to find the error If we find an error then we must try to correct it so that the program will then work correctly

Hubbles Law is a law of cosmology It was suggested by Edwin Hubble an American astronomer 

Hubble confirmed that there were other galaxies further away than the Milky Way Hubbles Law states that the degree of redshift from a galaxys light spectrum is in proportion to its distance from Earth This redshift is a kind of Doppler effect which had been discovered by another scientist before Hubble

Hubbles law is important because it shows the Universe is expanding

Maloula is a town in Syria dominated by speakers of Western Neo Aramaic With two other nearby towns Bakha and Jubbadin it is the only place where the Western branch of the Aramaic languages is still spoken The town is located 56 km to the northeast of Damascus and built into the rugged mountainside at an altitude of more than 1500 meters The distance and geological features only aided the longevity of this linguistic oasis for over one and half thousand years However modern roads and transportation as well as accessibility to Arabic language television and print media  and for some time until recently also state policy  have eroded that linguistic heritage As of 2005 the town has a population of 2000

Religiously the population consists of both Christians and Muslims For the Muslim inhabitants the legacy is all the more remarkable given that they were not Arabized unlike most other Syrians who like them were Islamized over the centuries but also adopted Arabic and shifted to an Arab ethnic identity

Most people go on to assume that people in the Middle East are Arab While the majority are and that Arabic is the official language there are groups in Arab countries that have a clearly distinct culture These people are united by a common language and usually church such as the Syriac Orthodox Church in the case of Aramaics These Aramaics are not Arab but have actually dwelled in Syria thousands of years before the Arabs came along They decended from Assur and are also known as the Assyrians While a lot of them have turned to speak Arabic they retain an identity and some what of the language which they use in church fellowship

When it comes to other matters such as food for example both cultures do share similarity

George Szell was a famous conductor He was born Hungarian and became a naturalized American He is particularly remembered for his work with the Cleveland Orchestra which he made into one of the worlds finest orchestras

George Szell was born in Hungary and grew up in Vienna Austria His music teachers included Mandyczewski who had been a friend of Brahms and Max Reger who taught him composition He was an excellent pianist and was only 11 when he first performed in public playing one of his own compositions He started touring Europe He was only 16 when he conducted the Vienna State Orchestra and 17 when he appeared with the Berlin Philharmonic both as pianist and conducting his own music

Szell soon realized that what he wanted to do most was to conduct He stopped composing although he kept up his piano playing until the end of his life Richard Strauss got him some work with the Berlin Staatsoper in 1915 He conducted in several German opera houses including Darmstadt Dsseldorf again in Berlin from 1924 1929 and then Prague He first conducted in the United States in 1930 with the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra At this time he was better known as an opera conductor than as a conductor of orchestral concerts

When World War II started in 1939 Szell was in the US on his way to Europe after having toured Australia He stayed in the US and settled with his family in New York City At first he earned a living as a teacher but he soon began to get invitations to conduct He conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra in 1941 From 1942 he often conducted the Metropolitan Opera and the following year he appeared with the New York Philharmonic In 1946 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States

In 1946 Szell got the job he was to keep for the rest of his life Music Director of the Cleveland Orchestra This orchestra had suffered because of the war and needed someone strong to turn it into a good orchestra Szell agreed to do this so long as they always did exactly what he wanted

Szell was a very strict conductor In rehearsals he made them work very hard at every tiny detail Like Toscanini he was absolutely ruthless If he thought that a musician had made some mistakes that musician would be fired If anyone questioned what Szell was doing he would be fired He even showed the cleaner the proper way to mop the floor

By the end of the 1950s the Cleveland Orchestra had become famous for its precise playing It had become one of the greatest orchestras in America and Europe They toured in the US and to Europe the Soviet Union Australia and Japan 

Szells strictness in his conducting was well known He was however an excellent musician and the members of the orchestra who managed to keep their jobs were delighted with the standard of their playing They said that he praised them when they were good and did not keep on rehearsing once the piece was perfect Szell never showed off when conducting he never made the music sound sentimental Like Toscanini he thought that a conductor should do exactly what the composer had written in the score without adding his own personal feelings to the music Some critics thought that his Mozart sounded a bit too lacking in feeling but Szell said I cannot pour chocolate sauce over asparagus He conducted music by the main central European composers Haydn Mozart and Beethoven Mendelssohn Schumann and Brahms Bruckner Mahler and Strauss He also conducted some modern music particularly by Dutilleux Walton Prokofiev Hindemith and Bartk He encouraged Pierre Boulez to conduct the Cleveland Orchestra

After World War II Szell often conducted other famous orchestras including the Concertgebouw Orchestra the London Symphony Orchestra the Vienna Philharmonic the New York Philharmonic and at the Salzburg Festival

Szell married Olga Band in 1920 They were divorced in 1926 In 1938 he married Helene Schultz Teltsch Their marriage lasted until his death

When Szell was not working he enjoyed cooking He also liked driving cars Although he could have been driven to his concerts by a chauffeur he often preferred to drive his Cadillac himself

He died in Cleveland Ohio in 1970

The history of Vietnam begins around 2700 years ago Successive dynasties based in China ruled Vietnam directly for most of the period from 207 BC until 938 when Vietnam regained its independence Vietnam remained a tributary state to its larger neighbor China for much of its history but repelled invasions by the Chinese as well as three invasions by the Mongols between 1255 and 1285 Emperor Trn Nhn Tng later diplomatically submitted Vietnam to a tributary of the Yuan to avoid further conflicts The independent period temporarily ended in the middle to late 19th century when the country was colonized by France During World War II Imperial Japan expelled the French to occupy Vietnam though they retained French administrators during their occupation After the war France attempted to re establish its colonial rule but ultimately failed in the First Indochina War The Geneva Accords partitioned the country in two with a promise of democratic election to reunite the country

However rather than peaceful reunification partition led to the Vietnam War During this time the Peoples Republic of China and the Soviet Union supported the North while the United States supported the South After millions of Vietnamese deaths the war ended with the fall of Saigon to the North in April 1975 The reunified Vietnam suffered further internal repression and was isolated internationally due to the continuing Cold War and the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia In 1986 the Communist Party of Vietnam changed its economic policy and began reforms of the private sector similar to those in China Since the mid 1980s Vietnam has enjoyed substantial economic growth and some reduction in political repression though reports of corruption have also risen

As many of you might have noticed userChristianMan16s behavior has become increasingly troubling as of late Ill try to keep this post short but here are a couple examples widespread POV pushing demonstrated here and here which has led to disruption such as edit warring incivility and inappropriate conduct long checkered history both here and at enwiki At the moment his problematic behavior is in my opinion detrimental to the encyclopedia and Id like to propose that some sort of action be taken whether it be editing restrictions or simply a formal warning Regards Juliancolton Talk 2341 22 April 2009

I have publically insisted this before Wikipedia should be fun We all enjoy editing here Its not a job we decide ourselves whether or not to edit The moment I stop enjoying editing here then Im leaving However the fun can only go so far before it becomes annoying and useless This is a prime example of taking fun too far and harms the wikipedia I dont know whether or not Id support a blockban whatever Id like to see a formal proposal before I decide Kennedy 0803 23 April 2009 Just thought id give my 002 on this Ive been watching CM16 for a while and have mentioned things to other editors about editing habits etc While there are questionable blips I dont think that at this stage there is any need for any form of topic ban etc Furthermore I see no final warning to CM about his work Yes he is blocked at en but so what He has proven to be useful and constructive here so why punish him because of it Now I am an out and out atheist when it comes to religion but I respect CMs views and see no reason that we should punish him because of them  nor do we have any right to do so Yes he may be a bit open and POV pushy about it and the onus is on him to think before he speaks and possibly tone down what could be seen by some as a crusade CM You commented that you could take a wikibreak Id suggest that a few daysweeks may well be a good idea just to let the atmosphere clear a little When you return try to stay away from areas that have been quite heated for you not necessarily permanantly but definitely for a few weeksmonths You say youre not a good content creator but I am sure with a bit of determination and hard work you could get yourself a GA or VGA with the help from other editors Id certainly be willing to help Try to become active in areas that are largely neglected  why not head over to WPDYK WPPVGA or WPPGA and look over the articles that are suggested there giving comments if needed Perhaps help to clerk DYK by reviewing hooks and then keeping the template updated Perhaps head behind the scenes and work on things that are often neglected by others such as categorisation stub sorting etc If you want any help just drop me a line on or off wiki and ill be happy to help you out To finish I just want to re iterate one point before you save an edit check it and think if someone said that to you would you be offended Remember there is a real person on the other end of the screen and they could easily be hurt by what you say Its hard to detect emotions etc in text so try to avoid sarcasm etc Furthermore remember that other people may not share the same views with you Try not to push them upon anyone else and respect other peoples opinions Everyone is entitled to their own and no one has the right to alter those views To be concise just think before saving Regards Goblin 1102 23 April 2009

Id oppose the proposal While I dont believe CM16 should have been allowed to edit Simple after his EN ban to punt him out or restrict him now would serve no real purpose A less in your face userpage would be nice and without userboxes than border in the eyes of some if not myself on homophobic Soup Dish 1255 23 April 2009

I would support either a restriction to article space or a formal warning We keep saying how good an editor he is here etc etc how he has improved from how he was at enwiki But I honesly dont know that he has other that he doesnt sockpuppet anymore which could be only because he isnt banned here so he doesnt need to Djsasso 1357 23 April 2009

Support a restriction or a ban His responses here suggest little knowledge of the problem which in itself is a problem PeterSymonds 1414 23 April 2009

Hello all Ill try to make this brief as I want to create as little as drama as possible I agree with others that something needs to be done as the drama surrounding CM16 has been going on for awhile The user was indef blocked at present and I didnt oppose it I have not seen a single comment that says CM16s mainspace contributions arent good It is widely agreed upon that he has been disruptive andor pushing POV on Simple Talk user talk pages RfAs etc but look at templates such as TemplateWWEPPV None of these wouldve been created without this users efforts I talked to CM16 about this and he agreed Im proposing a six month topic ban where he cannot edit any pages outside the article space This will restrict him from creating drama POV pushing being disruptive etc but will also keep articles updated and accurate TheAE talk 0403 2 May 2009no

OK I have interviewed CM16 on Google talk and thought you people would like to know his thoughts He

Hi Here is a message from CM16 Well my fellow editors this is it all I want to say is I too want whats best for the wiki and I believe strongly that for this wiki it includes me and if you prefer in a topic ban Me and SimonKSK are the only two wrestling editors here and hes not here that often The blocking of me andor the deletion of those articles I believe would damage the wiki Now yall do not care much for wrestling but I know millions of people do and I write them to satisfy them and I enjoy that One person suggested they go to a wrestling news side But the problem there is its just that a News site not an encyclopedia of wrestling facts Now Ill admit Ive done a few things wrong And I fully intend to improve All I need from you all is that chance I know some of you might think Im an evil little boy trying to hurt the wiki but that couldnt be farther from the truth Thats my view and request of this Its up to you Help or hurt the wiki TTYL CM16 I do agree  even though Im not a wrestling fan  that it is important business in the USA and the articles should exist He is one of the only people that have the knowledge and will to do it Yotcmdr talk to the commander 2038 7 May 2009

Following this announcement on the Wikimedia Technical Blog the changes to ExtensionTorBlock has been made live with tighter restrictions In order to counter this problem all wikis now have the IP block exemption group enabled It can be added and removed by administrators If anyone needs it they can request for the flag over here for now until a seperate page has been created Chenzw Talk 0814 4 May 2009

ChristianMan16 was indefinitely blocked A proposal was then made to offer him an unblock with restrictions That was opposed and the discussion closed as ChristianMan16 being blocked for six months How is it possible for a block to be shortened when the consensus was in favour of the initial six month block Soup Dish 0838 8 May 2009

This needs to be reworded CM16 is still indefinitely banned right now It is just that we are allowing the chance to revisit this in 6 months The way it is worded now means that he will be unblocked automatically in 6 months He is community banned indefinitely in 6 months he may request an unblock Thats the way it is It is not a community ban of 6 months as Chenzws wording suggests 

I must say though I see absolutely zero consensus to make it a 6 month ban The 6 month time frame was for his topic ban that was proposed if he was unblocked right now I dont see a single person who suggested lets reduce his indefinite ban to 6 months Either way 1036 8 May 2009 This question is perhaps completely unrelated CM16 is indefinitely blocked so he cannot edit here for the next six months On what basis then should a discussion done in six months give a different result than the discussion we have just had  There will be nothing new except perhaps for some ban evasion or lack thereof In the case the discussion in half a year not give a consensus should CM16 stay blocked  Sorry to ask but I have made bad experiences with long term blocks they are not as effective as many people think  Eptalon 1144 8 May 2009

Hi

Im sure that others are as sick of the Disney Vandal as I am What about an indef semi pp of Jafar Aladin and the like It might help stem this issue Valid anons can always ask for unprotection fr33kman talk 0030 6 May 2009

Is it possible to ban anonymizers like httpwwwanonymizerorg S3CR3T 0226 6 May 2009

Back to the original question I think a 1 year block would be sufficient to stop the Disney vandal without forever semi protecting all Disney related pages I fear that 2 or 3 years from now no one will remember why these pages were blocked and theyll always stay that way I think its unlikely that an anon would ask for a page to be unprotected but theyll probably just leave a note on the talk page asking us to fix whatever mistake they find Too bad they wont be able to be bold EhJJTALK 0255 6 May 2009

A lot of kids who edit will be start editing the fluffy articles Lets be honest kids who havent graduated high school have no business editing a lot of the articles here So protecting all Disney articles may put kids off Im not ideologically opposed to that just pointing it out Majorlys suggestion makes more sense While IPs on EN do make some useful contributions they do less so here Soup Dish 0826 6 May 2009

is a banned user on enwiki if I am correct In accordance with our new tough line on these people what do people think of Thekohser editing here He does not seem to be helping with editing here instead concentrating on picking up mistakes Perhaps enforcing the ban from enwiki here could be a good idea Thoughts Kennedy 1137 1 May 2009

At the time of this post Thekohser has 31 total edits since he joined 4 days ago Of those edits 

I feel that his pattern of edits is not benefiting our project and is in fact wasting our time Unless there is some indication that this user will begin contributing meaningfully to the article space I agree with Kennedys proposal EhJJTALK 1340 1 May 2009

Oppose ban Would be counter productive to the extreme Look Razorflames behaviour on Yahoo Answers was not particularly impressive and while we cant stop editors doing what they want on other sites it does mean we should extend some leeway to Thekohser A ban would be highly productive If you lot stopped goading Greg and took a step back I doubt there would be a problem Soup Dish 1457 1 May 2009
