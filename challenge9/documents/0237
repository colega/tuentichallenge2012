Homosexuality is a sexual orientation A homosexual person is sexually and romantically attracted to people of their own gender Men who are attracted to other men are called gay Women who are attracted to other women can be called gay as well but are usually called lesbians People who are attracted to men and women are called bisexual Together homosexual bisexual and transgender people make up the LGBT community It is difficult to say how many people are homosexual Homosexuality is known to exist in all cultures and countries though some governments deny that homosexuality exists in their countries 

One may say that homosexuality is the term used for people that feel romantically attracted to their own sex but other definitions also exist When one views homosexuality as the term for people that feel attracted to their own sex more people are gay than when one might view homosexuality as only a term for people who do have sexual relationships with their own sex Usually the term is used to view all the people who are attracted to their own sex also the people who did not have a sexual relationship with their own sex Nonetheless the most visible form of homosexuality is the actual relationship Most evidence of homosexuality in ancient cultures comes from drawings of the men in an intimate relationship or sex because its the most obvious 

The word homosexual comes from the Ancient Greek word homo meaning same and the Latin word for gender People in the LGBT community usually say gay instead of homosexual Some people also use the term homophile from Greek  and This term emphasizes romantic interest in the same sex rather than sexual attraction

There are many different words to describe homosexual people Some of these are used to insult homosexual people However the LGBT community sometimes uses these words to describe themselves because the word homosexual can sound too clinical This is done to make the words less hurtful Some words to describe homosexual men are gay and queer Words to describe homosexual women are lesbian and dyke Lesbian is used most often Dyke is used less often and is sometimes used to describe lesbians who are more masculine

When homosexual people keep their sexual orientation a secret they are said to be in the closet Out or out of the closet is a slang term that means a homosexual person is open about his or her sexual orientation This means he or she does not hide the fact that he or she is homosexual Some gay and lesbian people stay in the closet because of fear of what would happen or because they live in a place that is not safe for homosexuals

Sometimes people who are out also say they are proud Out means they are not hiding their sexual orientation Proud means that they are not ashamed of it Proud or Pride has a special meaning in the LGBT community It means they are celebrating and being happy that they are homosexual It is not pride meaning that they have done something to be proud of but pride meaning the opposite of shame Many cities have Pride Parades These used to be protest marches Today they are usually celebrations of the LGBT community They usually occur in June in memory of the Stonewall Riots that happened in New York City in 1969 These riots happened because police harassed and arrested people for being homosexual Stonewall or the Stonewall Riots are sometimes called the start of the LGBT rights movement

The causes of homosexuality and bisexuality are controversial Many religions see homosexual or bisexual behavior as sin Some religious people also see homosexuality and bisexuality as a choice that a person makes Though most religions see homosexual intercourse as the sin not the person who is gay Many religious people believe gays are equal but the sexual aspect is not natural Not all believe the attraction is sinful just the actions in response to the desire

However many modern scientists have theorized that homosexuality is not a choice The causes of homosexuality are not all understood but genetics and the effects of prenatal hormones and environment are sometimes thought to be causes Scientists also show that homosexuality happens not only in humans Most animals often show homosexuality some even for life long periods as is the case with humans 

Many scientists and doctors also agree that no one can change their sexual orientation Doctors used to treat gay people as if they had mental illnesses However homosexuality is no longer called a disease by doctors in many countries There are some religious groups who still try to cure homosexuality This is called reparative therapy In therapies like this one homosexual individuals have tried to change themselves to heterosexual and have even claimed they were changed but most people do not believe it is possible

Reparative Therapy is condemned by many medical and psychiatry groups like the American Psychological Association American Psychiatric Association Royal College of Psychiatrists National Association of Social Workers Royal College of Nursing and the American Academy of Pediatrics These scientific and educated groups agree that sexual orientation cannot change They also agree that gay people can be badly hurt by reparative therapy

Many people believe that it is unfortunate to discuss causes of homosexuality and bisexuality without discussing causes of heterosexuality too Although it is easy to understand why heterosexuality exists that does not explain how the brain develops to produce heterosexual people Heterosexuality homosexuality and bisexuality all have causes and some people believe that to discuss only the causes of homosexuality and bisexuality suggests that there is something wrong with people who have those orientations

Like all people gay people can fall in love and have life long relationships In most countries they cannot legally marry their partners However they still have relationships in the same way as heterosexual people They often call each other partners or life partners instead of spouse husband or wife Instead of having a marriage ceremony they may have a commitment ceremony

Some homosexual people have marriage ceremonies even though governments do not recognize or accept them They may call their partner a spouse wife or husband despite the law

But to them the important part about marriage is not just the name Married people get many benefits from being married Depending on the country these benefits can include paying less taxes getting their spouses insurance inheriting property social security benefits having or adopting children together emigrating to a spouses country being able to make choices for a sick spouse or even being allowed to visit a sick spouse who is in a hospital

Today there are seven countries that allow homosexual people to marry the Netherlands Norway Belgium Spain South Africa Sweden Portugal Iceland Argentina and Canada The Netherlands was first in 2001 Iceland and Argentina were the most recent in 2010 Sometimes these are called Same sex Marriages or Gay marriages The United States has limited same sex marriage it is legal in Connecticut Iowa Massachusetts New Hampshire New York Vermont and the capital Washington DC

Instead of marriage some countries or states offer homosexuals civil unions or domestic partnerships This offers some of the protections and benefits of marriage but not all Civil unions and domestic partnerships are sometimes seen by the LGBT community as being second class They do offer some benefits for gay and lesbian couples but they also suggest that these couples are not as important or valid as heterosexual couples Some people even say this is like the separate but equal rules that were used to segregate people by race in the United States They believe that separate is never equal and homosexuals should not accept being second class citizens

Homosexual sex or gay sex is when people of the same sex have sexual relations with each other whether they are two or more males or two or more females

Many religions say homosexual sex is a sin including Islam Christianity and Judaism However some denominations of these religions especially Christianity Judaism and some eastern religions now accept homosexuality Some religions have always accepted homosexuality such as Wicca

In modern times homosexuality is more accepted in western countries Most western countries have laws that protect homosexuals from violence and discriminationfactdateJuly 2010

In many other countries however homosexuals are not safe from discrimination A homosexual person can be fired from a job because he is gay even if he is a good workerfactdateJuly 2010 Homosexuals can be denied renting a home or being able to eat in a restaurant because of their sexual orientationfactdateJuly 2010 In these countries homosexuals can experience discrimination and violencefactdateJuly 2010 For example Islamic law is used in some places to kill homosexuals or place them in jail In Iran since 1979 some groups believe over 4000 homosexuals have been killed because of their sexual orientation In 2005 after fourteen months of prison and torture two teenage boys were hung in Iran 

In the United Kingdom homosexuality used to be a crime Oscar Wilde the famous Irish writer was imprisoned for it and as a result it destroyed his reputation and career as a wit and playwright Alan Turing the man who helped the Allies in World War II by breaking the Enigma Code used by the Germans was convicted of this crime and ultimately killed himself over the effects of the attempt to cure his homosexuality

Today in the United Kingdom homosexuals are safer Homosexual sex between adults is not a crime Gay and lesbian couples cannot marry but they can have civil partnerships that have some of the rights and benefits of marriage Gay people can be in the military So although the United Kingdom has changed many things homosexuals still do not have full equal rights there

In most of the world homosexuals still do not have the same rights and freedoms that heterosexuals have

Homosexual behaviour has also been seen in animals Homosexual transgender and bisexual behaviour includes sex courtship affection pair bonding and parenting Homosexual behaviour is widespread among animals Bruce Bagemihl did research in 1999 It shows that homosexual behaviour has been observed in close to 1500 species from primates to gut worms and is well documented for 500 of them The sexual behaviour of animals takes many different forms even within the same species The motivations for these behaviours are only partly known mainly because the respecive species has not been fully studied yet According to Bagemihl the animal kingdom does it with much greater sexual diversityincluding homosexual bisexual and nonreproductive sexthan the scientific community and society at large have previously been willing to accept

There are national and international groups or organizations for the LGBT community These organizations are often political They fight for the rights and safety of homosexuals

Some of the more important political organizations are

Dwight David Ike Eisenhower was an American soldier and politician He was known across the world for his help leading the Allied invasions in World War II and he later became the 34th President of the United States

Eisenhower was born into a family which did not have a lot of money He joined the military and he moved up the ranks During World War II he rose his way up the ranks to become a 5 star general He became the Supreme Allied Commander who led Operation Overlord

After World War II ended he was considered a war hero In the 1952 US presidential election the American public begged Eisenhower to run for President Eisenhower joined the Republican Party He chose Richard Nixon as his vice presidential candidate and won the election by beating Adlai Stevenson

He served two terms from 1953 1961

During the beginning of his first term he oversaw a ceasefire during the Korean War He created NASA which began a space race against the Soviet Union Eisenhower believed that the United States should not try to fight wars overseas but instead that United States amount of nuclear weapons should be increased by a lot so it can have an advantage in the Cold War That way the United States was able to keep the Soviet Union in check without spending a lot of money For this reason the US government had balanced budgets during his presidency and did not have to borrow money 

He intimidated the Soviet Union by making them believe that the United States would respond to any act of aggression with the usage of nuclear weapons That policy is called brinkmanship new look and massive retaliation He also authorized planes to spy on the Soviet Union but when a US spy plane accidentally crashed into the Soviet Union near the end of Eisenhowers term it hurt relations between the United States and the Soviet Union

McCarthyism was also an issue during his presidency Eisenhower disliked Joseph McCarthy and tried to bring him down behind the scenes but Eisenhower did not like to make enemies so he did not talk about McCarthy much

Domestically the economy was doing very well and the nation was prosperous Eisenhower supervised the creation of the interstate highway system and created the Department of Health Education and Welfare Eisenhower was a moderate conservative He wanted to continue some New Deal programs such as Social Security but at the same time he wanted the government to be limited At first many criticized him for not doing enough to give civil rights to African Americans but later during his presidency he signed two civil rights acts and sent federal troops to Topeka Kansas to make sure schools were desegregated 

When Eisenhowers presidency ended he was not very popular Over time his reputation slowly improved and historians now generally consider him to be a good president

A camera lens is the part of a camera which is usually made from glass A lens is needed if someone wants to take a picture The lens makes an image by focusing the light on the film In a digital camera the film is replaced with a computer chip

Many cheap cameras only have one lens that people cannot change or take out This is called a fixed lens design More expensive cameras usually have lenses that come off so anyone can take out one lens and put in another Depending on what a person wishes to photograph he or she can use different lenses to make a different kind of picture For example to take a picture of something far away a person might use a telephoto lens There are many kinds of lenses

The study of lenses and how they work is called optics

For camera lens it is most difficult to understand the lens design for large format There is over hundred year effort to provide various ways to get good pictures These lenses some used even before World War II are still usable today Computers now let engineers make better lenses though because they can calculate the way that light goes through the lens and find the best design for each task

A boy is a young male child or male adolescent Little boys still have the body of a child It is not until they reach puberty that their bodies start to mature and they become a man

The word boy was used a long time ago by some people called Anglo Saxons 

The opposite of boy is a girl A girl is a female child who will grow into a woman

The way boys are brought up will be vary a lot between different cultures  Boys are supposed to be tougher than girls It is their job to do work which is physically hard including fighting in the army when they are grown up However peoples attitudes are changing and nowadays many girls like to do the same things as boys In Western cultures boys traditionally wear trousers while girls wear dresses or skirts  However many girls also wear trousers these days like boys especially when dressed informally Boys often have shorter hair than girls although this can vary a lot according to quickly changing fashions

Traditionally boys like rough games and enjoy playing with mechanical things such as toy cars and trains People today have long discussions about whether this is because they are born like that or because that is the way society expects them to behave

The traditional colour for a boy is blue For girls it is pink When a baby is born in a hospital it usually gets a blue or pink tag on its wrist or ankle according to whether it is a boy or a girl

Some names are boys names others are girls names  There are some names which can be for boys and girls

Sir James Paul McCartney is Britains most successful musician and composer and one of the most successful musicians in the world He was a member of the rock band The Beatles and with John Lennon wrote most of the groups songs

McCartney began writing songs before he was sixteen and has written well over two hundred His most famous song is Yesterday recorded by the Beatles in 1965 Since then around 2000 artists have recorded the song Other songs written by McCartney for The Beatles include Cant Buy Me Love Hey Jude Penny Lane Eleanor Rigby and Let It Be

Often Beatles songs would have LennonMcCartney written on the record and it would look like that they had written it together In fact most LennonMcCartney songs were written by only one of them or with one adding only small parts to the others work Each counted on the other to help make their songs better so they agreed to share the credit equally

Since the Beatles had stopped working together in 1971 McCartney started a new band called Wings with his wife Linda Wings also had many hit records including Band On The Run and Mull Of Kintyre McCartney wrote Live and Let Die which became the theme song to a James Bond film with the same title Wings disbanded in 1981

Later McCartney recorded Ebony and Ivory with Stevie Wonder then The Girl is Mine and Say Say Say with Michael Jackson He and Jackson became friends but this ended after Jackson outbid McCartney for ownership of the publishing company which owned most of the Beatless music

McCartney had other hit songs and also wrote and starred in the movie Give My Regards to Broad Street with Linda The theme song from the movie No More Lonely Nights was also a hit but the movie did poorly and McCartneys popularity suffered He had to work hard to prove his talent was still strong He co wrote new songs with Elvis Costello and began touring more often than he had in years

Along with popular music McCartney also began composing classical music including an broken wikt linkoratoriooratorio about Liverpool McCartney was broken wikt linkknightknighted for his contributions to music and to British culture and for his charity work He bought John Lennons former school Quarry Bank which he then turned into a broken wikt linkperforming artsperforming arts school

Lennon started the Beatles in his broken wikt linkhometownhometown of Liverpool with Paul McCartney and George Harrison After Ringo Starr joined the band they started to be very successful People were excited by their music and their live performances always pleased audiences Manager Brian Epstein and record producer George Martin helped the Beatles become the most popular act in entertainment

Lennon played the guitar and later learned to play the piano Most of the songs the Beatles recorded were written by Lennon and McCartney Their songs were always credited as by LennonMcCartney on Beatle records but in fact they usually wrote their songs on their own The two men often helped to make each others songs better so they liked to share writing credit Famous songs written by Lennon for the Beatles are A Hard Days Night Help Strawberry Fields Forever A Day In The Life and many others 

The Beatles grew apart as the members got older Lennon divorced his first wife Cynthia Powell and married Yoko Ono while McCartney married Linda Eastman Each wife had different ideas and encouraged their husbands to depend less on each other Later some fans blamed Yoko and Linda for breaking the Beatles up

Lennon loved his wife so much that he added her surname Ono to his own name since she became Yoko Ono Lennon when she married him He had never liked his broken wikt linkmiddle namemiddle name Winston and wanted to simply change it but British law did not allow this He could add a new name though so he did that He never used the name Winston again unless he had to for legal reasons Otherwise he gave his full name as John Ono Lennon

Lennon and Ono moved to the United States in 1971 and settled in New York City Ono had a daughter Kyoko from an earlier husband Anthony Cox who took her and disappeared It was easier to look for Kyoko and get the laws help to look if they stayed in America Ono and Lennon were also hurt emotionally by the way Ono was treated by many people in England Some insulted Ono and asked Lennon why he was with her On the other hand most of the people they met in America accepted them together

Lennon recorded several albums and singles after the Beatles disbanded The best known one was Imagine He made many records with Yoko Ono On some records they called themselves the Plastic Ono Band Lennon and Ono worked with different musician friends including Ringo Starr Jim Keltner Klaus Voormann Harry Nilsson Eric Clapton and Elton John Lennons solo music was different from his Beatles songs He spoke more directly about his own feelings and sometimes used harsh language or loud sounds This upset a few fans who wished for more Beatles music from him

Lennon and Ono were also campaigners for peace in the world They used Lennons famous name to talk to the media about their beliefs Lennon and Ono were sometimes in trouble with people like politicians who did not like the things they said President Richard Nixons administration even tried to broken wikt linkdeportdeport Lennon because of his political views 

The two things Lennon and Ono wanted most were to live permanently in the United States and to have a child together Their lives were stressful in the early 1970s for several reasons There were the problems with immigrating to the United States and with the search for Kyoko The public were also sometimes negative toward Ono her music and her ideas The couple had several miscarriages caused partly by the stress

Lennon also had business problems because leaving the Beatles was not as simple as quitting an ordinary job The Beatles had signed many contracts They promised to do things in a certain way meet deadlines and work together to be paid as musicians and songwriters Many business deals had to be finished or changed and new deals had to be made to continue their music careers apart This took time and meant making many hard decisions The four former Beatles could not always agree on what to do with the things they owned together It took years to work out what to still own in common what to divide up and what to let go The choices they had to make sometimes hurt their friendship

Lennon and Ono separated for over a year from late 1973 until early 1975 because of the stress in their lives and their relationship Each of them dated another person and they were nearly divorced They spoke nearly every day by telephone however and tried to work things out They decided that they wanted to be together more than anyone else could want them apart and they reunited

When Richard Nixon faced the Watergate crisis in 1974 it became more important than pushing Lennon out of the country The deportation case against him was dropped Lennon won the right to stay in America in 1975 Lennon and Ono also finally had a son Sean Lennon that October Father and son shared the same birthday

Lennon and Ono stopped making music for five years to be able to spend more time together and give Sean as much attention as he needed They lived on Lennons income from the music he already made Ono became Lennons business manager and invested his money in real estate and organic farming Her office was downstairs in the Dakota the apartment building where they lived so they were never far apart Lennon became a full time father to Sean and he was proud to call himself a househusband They also visited Onos family in Japan several times and made other trips

In 1980 Lennon and Ono began to write new music as Sean got old enough to begin school They recorded a new album titled Double Fantasy that year A single from the album Starting Over was a hit and people welcomed Lennon back Even people who had not liked Ono earlier now respected her and more of them began to like her music Lennon and Ono planned to start fresh do a world tour and record more albums

Fans all over the world broken wikt linkmournmourned Lennons death It made them feel that a special part of their lives was gone Many met in New Yorks Central Park near where Lennon and Ono lived to say their goodbyes Some played recordings of Lennons music Politicians and celebrities everywhere were sorry Lennon had died even if they disliked him because his music meant so much to so many people Radio stations in the Soviet Union where rock music was rarely allowed to be played gave an hour over to Beatles recordings

There was no funeral for Lennon but Yoko Ono asked people everywhere to observe ten minutes of silence and prayer for him on Sunday December 14 1980 at 200 PM At two oclock the music playing in Central Park stopped and people all over the world fell silent for ten minutes Other tributes came later including songs by George Harrison Paul McCartney Elton John and Queen

An invention is a new thing that someone has made The computer was an invention when it was first made We say when it was invented New things that are made or created are called inventions The car is an invention that everyone knows

Ideas are also called inventions Writers can invent characters and then invent a story about them Inventions are made by inventors

Over time humans have invented objects which make life easier for themselves Because of this a quote necessity is the mother of invention was written The quote means that a lack of something should inspire someone to create something to fill that empty space However not all people believe that this is true They think that too much of something can lead to an invention

Genocide is the crime of killing many people who are all part of one ethnic group religious group or some sort of similar group and trying to destroy that group Genocide is done usually by a group such as a government or military group not by one person or a small number of people Usually the motivation for genocide is based on political reasons

The word genocide was made up by Raphael Lemkin a Polish Jew in 1944 from the words genos and cide It was first used to the Nazi Holocaust when many groups including Jews and others were killed

Ustashe of Croatia are another example of genocidial horror About a million of Serbs were killed in WWII in Ustashe concentration camps Methods used were disgusting even to German Nazis 

Another example of genocide was when about a million of the Tutsi group of people of Rwanda were killed along with Hutus who were against the genocide in 1994

In 1933 Lemkin made a speech to the Legal Council of the League of Nations conference on international criminal law in Madrid for which he prepared an essay on the Crime of Barbarity as a crime against international law The purpose of the crime which later evolved into the idea of genocide was based mostly on the experience of Assyrians massacred in Iraq on 11 August 1933 The event in Iraq reminded him of earlier similar events of the Armenian Genocide during World War I

Today any genocide is prohibited by the Genocide Convention and actor or inciter of genocide is judged by the International Criminal Court

Yoko Ono is a Japanese born musician and artist She is the widow of John Lennon Before she married Lennon she was married to Toshi Ichiyanagi from 1956 to 1963 and Anthony Cox from 1963 to 1969 She has two children Kyoko Chan Cox and Sean Lennon

Both of her parents came from wealthy families Her father who was a descendant of a former emperor of Japan had been a concert pianist but gave up music to become a banker Ono was tutored privately then sent to exclusive private schools studying classical music and art and also learning English She visited the United States before World War II with her family Her father was on a business trip to America when the war began and was broken wikt linkdetaindetained with many other Japanese in the country He was not able to communicate with his family for many years Onos mother took her her brother and sister away from Tokyo and they stayed in a rural area

After the war ended the family was reunited and moved to New York for her fathers job Ono enrolled in Sarah Lawrence College but quit during her third year She became interested in broken wikt linkavant gardeavant garde art and music and began writing poetry Many of her poems were instructions for creating pieces of art She later published some of these in a book titled Grapefruit Her parents were not happy that Ono chose to make her own way rather than following her familys wishes for her life When she married Toshi Ichiyanagi a young pianist her parents broken wikt linkdisowndisowned her

The marriage did not work out and Ono rented a loft apartment of her own She became friends with local artists in New York including Andy Warhol and a group called Fluxus She hosted small parties and happenings for her artist friends and began to do artwork of her own This brought her some notoriety in time but not fame She remarried to Tony Cox and they had a daughter named Kyoko

Ono went to London with Cox and Kyoko during 1966 to promote her career as an artist John Lennon who was a member of The Beatles went to one of her art shows He enjoyed the broken wikt linksurrealsurreal quality of her work Ono and Lennon became friends and later lovers as each lost interest in their spouses Lennon wanted them to be together as much as possible He broke a rule the Beatles had never to bring a wife or girlfriend to their recording sessions He brought her along anytime he could They were married in March 1969 after they were both divorced

Many Beatles fans blamed Ono for breaking up the band through her influence on Lennon He seemed to many people to have gone crazy since meeting her The truth was Ono simply encouraged Lennon to do things hed already wanted to do but let himself be talked out of doing in the past including quitting the Beatles Ono and Lennon started a new part time group they called the Plastic Ono Band They also tried to have a baby together Ono miscarried several times until their son Sean Lennon was born in 1975 on Lennons 35th birthday Ono was also able to broken wikt linkreconcilereconcile with her family during the 1970s

Ono was Lennons muse inspiring his music and his creative side for the rest of his life The two worked together on both his post Beatles records and Onos wish to also have a music career She was more interested in experimental music than in classical or popular music Onos songs and unique style sounded strange to most listeners It was offensive to many people who thought Lennon should have either stayed with the Beatles or made more music in their style Ono changed her style and began to write and record more pop songs but her music never became popular Years later some younger musicians admitted they had liked Onos music They were inspired by it as Lennon had been

After Lennons death in 1980 Ono recorded several solo albums The first was titled Season of Glass Her later records were praised by some music critics They were even enjoyed by some Lennon fans but the albums never sold well Ono gave up her own musical career and became the caretaker of Lennons estate and his non Beatles work

When Sean Lennon grew up he also became a musician He helped Ono to compile her old recordings and make some new ones She also revived some of her earlier artwork and gave the money made from sales and exhibits to charities Ono recently appeared at the opening of Love a Cirque du Soleil show featuring Beatles music to help promote it

The coast is where land meets the sea 

The coast also means the land next to the sea which can also be called the shore or sea shore However coast is not used to describe where rivers or lakes meet the land  it is only used to describe the sea meeting the land 

If a house is near to the coast we say it is on the coast When we talk about a long part of the coast we call it the coast line Sometimes coast can be part of a place name or the description of a large area For instance the East Coast of the United States describes the all of the Eastern side of the United States that is next to the Atlantic Ocean 

In some countries like England or Australia the people sometimes use the word sea side for the coast

Coasts often have many living things living there and provide habitat for many animals and plants

In the 1990s decades of smoking cigarettes caused Harrison to develop throat cancer He later developed lung cancer which caused his death in 2001 His family issued a last statement from him Everything else can wait but the search for God cannot wait and love one another Even music was not as important to Harrison as his wanting people to learn to get along with each other and to make the world a better place

James Augustine Aloysius Joyce was an Irish writer and poet of the modernist movement He was from Dublin Ireland He wore an eyepatch because of eye damage He could not see well

His books are written in a special style At first he wrote in a way which describes very accurately how life is in the short story collection called Dubliners In his next book called A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man he started a new style It is called stream of consciousness and influenced many other writers in the 20th century

Some books that Joyce wrote are

Joyce met Nora Barnacle in 1904 and they began to have a long relationship until his death in 1941 The couple moved out of Dublin to Zrich in 1904 then to Trieste Paris then back to Zrich They married in 1931 They had a son and a daughter Their daughter had a mental illness later in her life

Joyce became a very famous writer after he published Ulysses He also began to have a lot of problems with his eye and his family But he still completed his last book Finnegans Wake by 1939 

The Andes are a mountain range along the western coast of South America 

They stretch over 7000 km 4400 miles from the south of Argentina and Chile to the north of Colombia They are also found in Peru Bolivia and Ecuador 

The Amazon river system has its sources in the eastern flanks of the Andes

The Andes are the longest exposed mountain range of the world and the second highest after the Himalayas The Andes mountain range is the highest mountain range outside Asia 

Aconcagua the highest peak rises to 6962 m above sea level The top of Mount Chimborazo in the Ecuadorean Andes is the point on the Earths surface most distant from its center Mount Chimborazo is an inactive volcano in Ecuador which last erupted over a thousand years ago

The Andes has three sections 

The northern part has two parallel ranges They are the Cordillera Occidental and the Cordillera Oriental The term cordillera comes from the Spanish word meaning rope 

In Colombia north to the border with Ecuador the Andes split in three parallel ranges western central and eastern 

In the north the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta is an isolated mountain range apart from the Andes chain that runs through Colombia Reaching an altitude of 5700 metres above sea level just 42 km from the Caribbean coast the Sierra Nevada is the worlds highest coastal range 

The eastern range of the northern Cordillera Oriental is the only one which reaches Venezuela 

The Andes range is about convert200kmmi0abbron wide throughout its length except in Bolivia where it is convert640kmmi0abbron wide The islands of the Dutch Caribbean Aruba Bonaire and Curaao which lie in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Venezuela represent the submerged tops of the northern edge of the Andes range

ImageCentral Andes Mountains Salar de Arizaro ArgentinajpgthumbThe high plains of the Andes Mountains also known as the Puna appear in the foreground with a line of young volcanoes facing the much lower Atacama Desert 

Several salt crusted dry lakes occupy the basins between major thrust faults in the Puna Salar de Arizaro is the largest of the dry lakes in this view 

Near image centre the transition between two distinct geological zones the Puna and the Sierras Pampeanas creates a striking landscape contrast The Sierras Pampeanas mountains are lower and have fewer young volcanoes 

The general colour change from reds and browns in the foreground to blues and greens in the upper part of the image reflects the major climatic regions the deserts of the Atacama and Puna versus the grassy plains of central Argentina where rainfall is sufficient for lush prairie grass known locally as the pampas

The Andes are a MesozoicTertiary orogenic belt of mountains along the Pacific Ring of Fire 

The Andes are the result of plate tectonics processes caused by the subduction of oceanic crust beneath the South American continental plate South America like North America has been moving west since the Cretaceous period 

The formation of the modern Andes began with the events of the Triassic and Jurassic when Pangea begun to break up and several rifts developed It was during the Cretaceous period that the Andes began to take their present form by the uplifting faulting and folding of sedimentary and metamorphic rock of the ancient cratons to the east The rise of the Andes has not been constant and different regions have had different degrees of tectonic stress uplift and weathering

The climate in the Andes differs depending on which area the altitude and how close it is to the sea The southern section is rainy and cool The central Andes are dry The northern Andes are normally rainy and warm with an average temperature of convert18CF0lkon in Colombia The climate is known to change very much in rather short distances Rainforests exist just miles away from the snow covered peak Cotopaxi The mountains have a large effect on the temperatures of nearby areas The snow line depends on the location It is at between 4500 and 4800 m in the tropical Ecuadorian Colombian Venezuelan and northern Peruvian Andes going up to 48005200 m in the drier mountains of southern Peru south to northern Chile south to about 30S then going down to convert4500mft 1abbron on Aconcagua at 32S convert2000mft 2abbron at 40S convert500mft 1abbron at 50S and only convert300mft 1abbron in Tierra del Fuego at 55S from 50S many of the bigger glaciers go down to sea level

The Andes of Chile and Argentina can be put in two climatic and glaciological zones the Dry Andes and the Wet Andes

Rainforests used to hold much of the northern Andes but are now mostly diminished especially in the Choc and inter Andean valleys of Colombia As a direct opposite of the humid Andean slopes are the mostly dry Andean slopes in most of western Peru Chile and Argentina Along with many Interandean Valles they are normally ruled by deciduous woodland shrub and xeric vegetation reaching in the slopes near the mostly lifeless Atacama Desert

About 30000 species of vascular plants live in the Andes About half of those are endemic to the region going past the difference of any other hotspot The small tree Cinchona pubescens a source of quinine which is used to treat malaria is found widely in the Andes as far south as Bolivia Other important crops that came from the Andes are tobacco and potatoes The high altitude Polylepis forests and woodlands are found in the Andean places of Colombia Ecuador Peru Bolivia and Chile These trees by locals are called Queua Yagual and other names can be found at altitudes of convert4500mft 1abbron above sea level It is still unclear if the patchy distribution of these forests and woodlands is natural or the result of clearing which began during the Incan time Regardless in modern times the clearance has had a faster pace and the trees are now thought to be highly endangered with some thinking that as little as 10 of the original woodland is still here

The Andes has a lot of wildlife With almost 1000 species of which about 23 are endemic to the region the Andes is the most important region in the world for amphibians Animal diversity in the Andes is high with almost 600 species of mammals more than 1700 species of birds more than 600 species of reptiles and almost 400 species of fish

The Vicua and Guanaco can be found living in the Altiplano while the closely related domesticated Llama and Alpaca are commonly kept by locals as pack animals and for their meat and wool The nocturnal chinchillas two threatened members of the rodent order live in the Andes alpine regions The Andean Condor the largest bird of its kind in the Western Hemisphere lives throughout much of the Andes but mostly in very low numbers Other animals found in the mostly open habitats of the high Andes are the huemul cougar and foxes in the genus Pseudalopex And for birds some species of tinamous are the Andean Goose Giant Coot flamingos Lesser Rhea Andean Flicker Diademed Sandpiper plover miners sierra finches and diuca finches 

A meal is a serving of food eaten by human beings Meals usually include several different types of food such as grains vegetables fruit and in some cases meat Meals have different names by time they are taken or by the type of food that is eaten

In North America and in Europe people usually eat three meals a day The morning meal is called breakfast It usually includes foods made from grain fruit and milk products Many people drink coffee or tea with their breakfast

Around noon people eat their lunch People who are working at jobs are given a break to eat their lunch The lunch meal includes foods such as a sandwich soup vegetables fruit and milk In some countries such as Italy people serve an alcoholic drink with lunch In England some people have a glass of beer with their lunch

In the evening people eat their supper or dinner Dinners are different in different countries Usually dinners include a main course such as roast beef a grain a vegetable and a dessert

In some cases a starter or appetizer is served before the dinner Appetizers are a small serving of food such as olives cheese or bread In many countries people serve an alcoholic drink with dinner such as wine or beer

Leipzig is the biggest city in the state of Saxony When Germany was divided into East and West Germany Leipzig was one of the three biggest industrial cities in the East Germany

Leipzig occupies convert29762km2sqmi1lkonabbron and is still an industrial city 510651 people are living in Leipzig as of 29 February 2008

Its Latin name is Lipsia and the German name Leipzig came from this name Leipzig has a long history Its name was recorded first in 1015 as Leipzig Castle The city was settled in 1165 It was an economic center of Medieval Germany famous with its market

In 1409 Leipzig University was started Theology was its major faculty In 1519 Martin Luther had a discussion in Leipzig against Johann Eck Reformation came to Leipzig in 1539 and the city people became Lutheran

It is famous for St Thomas Church where Johann Sebastian Bach worked as music director from 1723 until his death in 1750

In 1813 near Leipzig the Battle of Leipzig was fought between the French army led by Napoleon Bonaparte and the allied armies of Austria Prussia and Russia

In 1839 the railway between Dresden and Leipzig was opened It was the first long distance railroad in Germany

As a result of industrialization the number of people living in Leipzig grew during the 19th century Before World War II there were about 750000 people in Leipzig

After the war Leipzig belonged to the part of Germany occupied by the Soviet Union and later to East Germany

In 1989 the Monday Demonstrations took place in Leipzig Every monday after a Christian mess in the Nikolaikirche the Leipzig people demonstrate for freedom to travel and democracy These demonstrations became bigger and bigger and reached their peak on October 23 when 320000 people came The demonstrations are one of the things that lead to the end of communist dictatorship in East Germany

Today Leipzig is still known as a city of fairs media and university but is less important than it was before World War II

Before World War II Leipzig was a famous center of commerce and industry Now there are big companies in Leipzig like Porsche BMW Siemens and DHL as well as the Leipzig Airport

With almost 511000 people Leipzig city proper is the 12th biggest city in Germany and the 2nd biggest in what was East Germany smaller than East Berlin and bigger than Dresden Leipzig urban has 567000 people The total population of Leipzig metropolitan area is 1389000 

Leipzig Chemnitz Dresden Halle and Zwickau form an area called the Saxon Triangle which has about 3500000 people 

Leipzig has a university where famous people studied eg Johann Wolfgang Goethe Edvard Grieg Erich Kstner Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Gotthold Ephraim Lessing Angela Merkel Friedrich Nietzsche Robert Schumann and Richard Wagner The Leipzig Hauptbahnhof is the biggest terminal station in Europe It sees about 150000 passengers each day It is 293 meters wide

Evil means something which is morally bad or wicked It is the opposite of good People may say that an action which hurts people or breaks certain rules is evil A person or a group that does evil things may also be called evil

In theology there is a question If there is a God why does God let evil happen Some think that evil proves that there is not a God Others think that God lets evil happen so that people can choose not to do evil

The study of good and evil in philosophy is called ethics Ethics tries to explain why some actions are good and other actions are evil It attempts to give all kinds of answers for how to tell evil from good

A version of the problem of evil perhaps by Epicurus goes as follows 

Another argument goes 

Arguments such as these are about the logical problem of evil They attempt to show that the assumed propositions lead to a logical contradiction and so cannot all be correct 

A common response is that God can exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good Some philosophers accept that arguments such as God allows evil in order to achieve the greater good of free will are logically possible and thus solve the logical problem of evil Since the aim is only to defeat the assertion that God and evil are logically incompatible even a highly implausible instance of Gods coexistence with evil is sufficient for the purpose

Philosophies of science have approached the problem from the angle of empiricism For logical positivism the issue with God is the lack of any independent method of verification In their view this makes the proposition God exists not true or false but meaningless A similar position points to the lack of any way the proposition might be falsified

A butterfly is a type of insect that can fly It belongs in the order Lepidoptera It is closely related to the moth A butterfly has four wings which are covered with tiny scales When a butterfly is not flying its wings are usually folded over its back The wings are patterned and are often brightly coloured There are many different kinds of butterflies The males and females of each kind are often slightly different from each other Butterfly watching is a popular hobby Some people also keep collections of dead butterflies that they have caught 

As with most insects a butterflys life begins as an egg Then it hatches into a larva After some time the larva turns into a chrysalis While it is in the chrysalis it becomes a butterfly The butterfly then hatches out and lays more eggs

Butterflies have three main body parts These parts are the head the thorax and the abdomen The body is protected by the exoskeleton The body is made up of sections known as segments In between the segments there are flexible areas that allow the butterfly to move All three parts of the body are covered in very small scales The scales give the butterfly its color

The head is the first part of the body It has the eyes mouth parts and antennae

The eyes of a butterfly are usually very large The eye is made up of smaller eyes or optical units Eyes that are made up of optical units are called compound eyes A butterfly sees things as a lot of little pictures Each picture is made from one optical unit Butterflies do not see as many colors as humans but they can see ultraviolet light

The mouth of a butterfly does not have jaws It has a kind of mouth that is made to suck liquids This mouth is called a proboscis The proboscis is made up of two hollow tubes The tubes are locked together in the middle When the butterfly is not using its proboscis it is coiled up in the head It can uncoil the proboscis when it wants to feed

The antennae of a butterfly are used for smell and balance The antenna in most butterflies is clubbed at the end In some butterflies there is a hook at the end of the antenna instead of a club

The thorax is the second part of the body It is made up of three segments The legs and wings are connected to the thorax

The legs of a butterfly are made for walking holding onto things and tasting There are three pairs of legs There are four main parts of the leg They are the trochanter the femur the tibia and the foot At the end of each foot there is a pair of claws Butterflies in the family Nymphalidae have very short front legs They keep there front legs close to their bodies This makes it look like they only have two pairs of legs In some species there is a movable body part on the tibia that is used to clean the antennae

A butterfly has two pairs of wings Each wing has hollow tubes called veins The colors and patterns of butterflies are made by tiny scales The scales over lap each other They are connected to the wing If a butterfly is handled the tiny scales can rub off

The abdomen is the third part of the body It is made up of ten segments The abdomen is much softer than the head and the thorax At the end of the abdomen are the reproductive organs In the male there is a pair of claspers They are used to hold on to the female during mating In the female there is a tube made to lay eggs

Butterflies go through complete metamorphosis This means that there are four parts in a butterflys life The first part is the egg The second part is the caterpillar The third part is the chrysalis The fourth part is the adult

A female butterfly will lay her eggs on or near the food plant of the caterpillar The female will choose a place to lay her eggs using smell taste touch and sight Most species will lay just one egg on the food plant Others will lay groups of five to over 100 eggs on the food plant Most species will lay their eggs on the leaves of the food plant Others will lay them on the flowers stems bark or fruit of the food plant

The eggs come in many different shapes and colors They may be round or oval and flattened In some species the egg shell is ribbed The most common colors in butterfly eggs are yellow and green The eggs will turn dark just before hatching Also some butterflies take a day to come out of eggs while others could take months

Butterfly caterpillars can vary in size color and shape They may have spines bristles or soft body extensions All caterpillars have 13 body segments The first three segments make up the thorax The thorax has three pairs of legs These legs are called true legs The other 10 segments make up the abdomen The abdomen has five pairs of soft legs called prolegs The prolegs have tiny hooks at the end of the each foot They are used to hold on to things The hooks are called crochets

A caterpillars skin does not grow As the caterpillar grows inside its skin the skin becomes too tight In order for the caterpillar to grow bigger it sheds its too tight skin After the old skin is shed there is a new larger skin This is known as molting A caterpillar will molt four to five times before turning into a pupa Each part between molts is called an instar

All caterpillars can make silk The silk is made from the salivary glands Silk starts out as a liquid in the salivary glands The caterpillar draws out the silk into a small thread The silk hardens as soon as it is exposed to the air Caterpillars use silk to make nests or cocoons

Most caterpillars feed on leaves of plants or trees Most species of caterpillars will feed only on a small number of certain kinds of plants If the caterpillars food plant is not found it will starve to death

Some species of caterpillars are tended by ants The caterpillars have special glands that make a sweet liquid called honeydew The ants like the honeydew In return for the honeydew the ants protect the caterpillars from predators The caterpillars also have special body parts that make sounds The caterpillar will make sounds with the body parts and call the ants when the caterpillar is being attacked by predators The ants hear the sounds and come to protect the caterpillar

Caterpillars in the subfamily Miletinae eat insects in the order Homoptera This includes aphids mealybugs leafhoppers and treehoppers

Caterpillars in the family Papilionidae have a special organ This organ is called an osmeterium It is a bad smelling gland that is shaped like a snakes tongue It is kept behind the inside of the head When a predator tries to eat the caterpillar the caterpillar will release the osmeterium This scares the predators away

The pupa is formed after the last molt The caterpillar will find a special place to pupate The digestive tract is emptied The caterpillar sheds its skin The pupa is now exposed The caterpillars tissues are broken down and rebuilt into the butterflys tissues

The pupa cannot move It is attached to an object by tiny hooks on the end of the abdomen These hooks make up what is called the cremaster There are many tiny holes on the pupa They allow respiratory gases to move in and out of the pupa

Many pupae are easy for predators to attack Some caterpillars make shelters out of silk and leaves to protect themselves when they become pupae These shelters are called cocoons Most butterfly pupae do not have cocoons to protect themselves Instead the pupae have brown or green colors to camouflage themselves among leaves and branches Pupae that do not have cocoons are called chrysalids or chrysalises

Butterflies are in trouble because of habitat loss Because of the destruction of forests and grasslands some types of butterflies have nowhere to feed and lay eggs To help some people plant a butterfly garden with flowers having lots of nectar for butterflies to feed on Some people also keep plants that butterflies lay eggs on and enjoy watching the caterpillars hatch out and feed on the plant Chemical sprays that are used to keep pests away from garden plants also kill butterflies

Butterflies have many enemies for example birds spiders and frogs Some butterflies like the Monarch butterflies taste horrible so that birds will not eat them

Nazism was a political movement in Germany It started in the 1920s Nazism is a form of fascism A lot of the philosophy of this movement was based on an idea that the Aryan race was better than all others and had the greatest ability to survive According to the racist ideas of Nazism the Jews Slavs and Roma people were called inferior races The Nazis sent millions of Jews Roma and other people to concentration camps where they were killed These killings are now called the Holocaust

The word Nazi is a short for Nationalsozialist in the German language This means National Socialist German Workers Party

Adolf Hitler who wrote Mein Kampf said that all the problems of Germany were the result of Jews plotting against the country He even said that it was Jewish politicians who arranged the Armistice of 1918 and who allowed Germany to agree to pay huge amounts of money and goods On the night of the 27 February 1933 and 28 February 1933 someone set the Reichstag building on fire which was where the German Parliament held their meetings The Nazis blamed the communists Others said the Nazis themselves had done it to come to power On the very same day an emergency law called Reichstagsbrandverordnung was passed The government claimed it was to protect the state With this law most of the civil rights of the Weimar Republic did not count any longer This was used by the Nazis against the other political parties Members of the communist and social democratic parties were put into prison or killed People were threatened and there was a lot of violence The Nazis became the biggest party in the parliament Until 1934 they managed to make all other parties illegal Democracy was replaced with a dictatorship Adolf Hitler became leader of Germany

As leader of Germany Hitler began moving Nazi armies into neighboring countries When Germany attacked Poland World War II started Western countries like France Belgium and the Netherlands were to be treated by Germany as colonies while in Eastern countries such as Poland and the Soviet Union the Nazis planned to wipe out the Slavic peoples so that German settlers could take their land

In the Holocaust millions of Jews as well as Roma people the disabled homosexuals and political opponents from Germany and other countries that the Nazis controlled were sent to concentration camps in Poland and Germany The Nazis killed millions of these people at the concentration camps with poison gas The Nazis also killed millions of people in these groups by forcing them to do slave labor without giving them much food or clothing

In 1945 the Soviet Union took over Berlin after beating the German army in Russia and met the American and British armies who had fought right across Germany after invading Nazi Europe from the west in 1944 The Nazis had lost During the invasion of Berlin Hitler may have shot himself in a bunker with his new wife Eva Braun Other Nazis also killed themselves including Joseph Goebbels just one day after Hitler named him as his successor

After the war the Allied governments such as the United States Britain and Soviet Union held trials for the Nazi leaders These trials were held in Nuremberg in Germany For this reason these trials are called the Nuremberg Trials The Allied leaders accused the Nazi leaders of murdering millions of people of starting wars of conspiracy and belonging to illegal organisations Most Nazi leaders were found guilty by the court and they were sent to jail or executed by hanging

While there has not been a Nazi state since 1945 there are still people who believe in Nazi ideas These people called neo Nazis claim that white people are superior to non whites spread lies about Jews and the Holocaust and tell other people to hate Jewish people and other groups of people Many neo Nazis say that the Holocaust killings never really happened these people are called Holocaust deniers After the war laws were made in Germany and other countries These laws say it is forbidden to say that the Holocaust never really happened Sometimes they also ban questioning the number of people affected by it which is saying that not so many people were killed as most people think

Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve was a German born Russian astronomer He was born in Altona Germany but later lived in Russia He was an expert on double stars and one of the first astronomers to measure stellar parallax

While director of Dorpat Observatory he wrote Stellarum Duplicum et Multiplicum which proved that double stars are not exceptional and that star systems are governed by the laws of gravity Struve added a lot to the study of galactic structure and also engaged in notable geodetic operations such as the triangulation of Livonia and the measurement of an arc of the meridian In 1839 he became director of the new Pulkovo Observatory and was one of the first three astronomers who almost simultaneously obtained an approximate stellar parallax

In 1822 he published the first of many double star catalogues the identifying numbers of which are still used today Struves stars however are now often named in his honor whereas the original catalogue prefix was the Greek letter sigma In 1833 he moved to Russia to set up the Pulkovo Observatory near St Petersburg of which he was director until his retirement in 1862 when his son took over in the post In total Friedrich Struve produced 272 astronomical works and 18 children his great grandson Otto by contrast produced 907 works but zero children

His son Otto Wilhelm von Struve succeeded him as director of the Pulkovo Observatory

Helsinki is the capital city of Finland Helsinki is the largest city in Finland 550000 people live in Helsinki and 1000000 live in the Helsinki metropolitan area

Helsinki is on the coast of the Gulf of Finland When one looks from Helsinki Tallinn is on the opposite side of the sea but it is too far away to see A poetic name for Helsinki is the daughter of the Baltic Sea

In 1550 Swedish king Gustav Vasa commanded people to build a new city and move there His idea was to build a new place to trade which would be more popular than Tallinn The idea did not work well and many people returned from Helsinki to their homes Later Sweden built the fortress Suomenlinna in Helsinki After Russia had taken Finland from Sweden in several wars they started developing Helsinki Helsinki became the capital of autonomous province of Finland When Finland became independent in 1917 Helsinki stayed as the capital city

Helsinki spreads around several bays and over several islands Some famous islands include Seurasaari Lauttasaari and Korkeasaari  which is also the countrys biggest zoo  as well as the fortress island of Suomenlinna

A wife is a married woman Married means that the law says two people are legally joined During the marriage ceremony the wife is called the bride

In countries and times it has been different how many wives a man can have legally In old times there were no limitations in some countries In Christianity a man can have one wife In Islam a man can have up to four wives

There are some names for special kinds of wives For example a queen is a wife of a king 

If a child is born between a man and his wife this child is thought of as a legitimate child In contrast a child between a man and a woman who are not married is called an illegitimate child or a bastard However children born out of wedlock have lost a social stigma in many western countries where common law relationships are becoming much more common

A man whose wife is deceased is called a widower

Catherine Parr was the sixth wife of Henry VIII of England She is often said to have been the only one of Henrys wives who survived but this is not correct Anne of Cleves also survived Henry

Catherine Parr was an English woman and the daughter of Thomas Parr of Kendal a county squire who had distinguished himself in the service of both King Henry VII of England and his son King Henry VIII

At the age of fifteen Catherine married Sir Edward Borough but he died shortly afterwards in 1529 and Catherine became a widow Her second husband Sir John Neville Lord Latimer was a wealthy landowner in Yorkshire and had an estate there called Snape Hall Lord Latimer died in 1542 leaving Catherine as a widow for the second time and without any children

By this time Catherine was in love with Thomas Seymour and was about to marry him but Henry VIII himself took a liking to Catherine as well and no doubt influenced by their long term acquaintance she married Henry instead on July 12 1543 in Hampton Court 

As queen consort Catherine managed to bring Henrys daughters Elizabeth and Mary back to court For Elizabeth in particular Catherine was a much needed mother figure and friend and Elizabeth frequently acknowledged Catherine as her foremost educational mentor 

Catherine was a good wife to Henry but her strong will and outspoken nature led her to debate topics of religion a little too openly for the courts taste and Henrys advisors persuaded him that Catherine was attempting to subvert his religious authority As a result in 1546 Catherine found an arrest warrant for her signed by Henry Catherine managed to comfort the King by saying that she only argued about religion to take his mind off his bad leg leading Henry to spare her life

On January 28 1547 Henry VIII died Not long afterwards Catherine was married to Thomas Seymour and soon became pregnant She gave birth to their daughter Mary at Sudeley Castle on 30 August 1548 but she did not recover from the birth and died soon afterwards on 5 September 1548 She was buried in St Marys Chapel at Sudeley Castle She was the last Queen in Tudor times She got married 4 times

Geologists think that about two million years ago Madagascar was a part of a big landmass that included what is now the continent of Africa but it broke off Madagascar would later break off of the Indian subcontinent

Madagascar is home to many species that were not known about until around 1679 when Dutch explorers went there They do not even exist in Africa They only exist in Madagascar In fact most of the mammals living in Madagascar do not live anywhere else However many of the species in Madagascar are in danger because many of the forests have been cut down A big reason that forests have been cut down is so that land can be used to grow crops such as coffee which is one of the most important crops that is grown in Madagascar

Agriculture is a big part of the economy in Madagascar including the growing of coffee and vanilla Madagascar sells more vanilla than any other country in the world Madagascar also makes money from tourism

People have probably lived in Madagascar for at least 2000 years

France took over the city of Antananarivo in 1895 and added Madagascar as a colony two years later Madagascar became independent from France which meant it became its own country on 26 June 1960 On March 17 2009 President Marc Ravalomanana quit because of pressure from the military Andry Raejolina became the next president

Vincent Willem van Gogh 30 March 1853 29 July 1890 was a Dutch Post Impressionism painter His work had a great influence on Modern art because of its striking colors and emotional power He suffered from anxiety and fits of mental illness When he was 37 he shot himself and died

He was not well known when he was alive and most people did not appreciate his art After he died though he became very famous Today many people think he is one of the greatest painters in the world and an important influence on modern art Van Gogh did not begin painting until he was almost 30 Most of his most famous works were made in his last two years He made more than 2000 artworks with 900 paintings and 1100 drawings and sketches Today many of his piecesportraits landscapes and sunflowersare some of the most famous and costly works of art in the world

When he was a young adult Van Gogh worked for a company of art dealers He traveled between The Hague London and Paris After that he taught in England He then wanted to become a pastor and spread the Gospel and from 1879 he worked as a missionary in a mining place in Belgium He began drawing the people there and in 1885 he painted his first important work The Potato Eaters He usually painted in dark sad colors at this time In March 1886 he moved to Paris and found out about the French Impressionists Later he moved to the south of France and the colors in his art became brighter His special style of art was developed and later fully grown during the time he stayed in Arles in 1888

After he died people have often wondered how much his mental illness affected his painting Many think of his ill health as dramatic but modern critics think that Van Gogh was deeply unhappy because his sickness made his painting slower and less clear

Vincent van Gogh was born in Groot Zundert Holland He was a son of a pastor and was brought up in a religious family Vincent was very emotional and he did not have enough self confidence Between 1860 and 1880 when he finally decided to become an artist van Gogh had had two sad romances He also had worked unsuccessfully in a bookstore as an art salesman and a preacher He remained in Belgium where he had preached to study art The works of his early Dutch period are sad sharp and one of the most famous pictures from here is The Potato Eaters painted in 1885 In that year van Gogh went to Antwerp where he found the works of Rubens and bought a lot of Japanese prints

In 1886 he went to Paris to join his brother Tho who was the manager of Goupils broken wikt linkgallerygallery In Paris van Gogh studied with Cormon He also met Pissarro Monet and Gauguin This helped the colors of his paintings lighten and be painted in short strokes from the paintbrush His nervous temper made him a difficult companion and night long discussions combined with painting all day made him very unhealthy He decided to go south to Arles where he hoped his friends would join him and help find a school of art Gauguin did join him but it did not help Near the end of 1888 Gauguin left Arles Van Gogh followed him with an open razor but was stopped by Gauguin Instead he cut his own ear lobe off After that van Gogh began to get fits of madness and was sent to the asylum in Saint Remy for medical treatment

In May of 1890 he regained his health and went to live in Auvers sur Oise Dr Gachet watched him carefully However two months later at 27 July he tried to commit suicide by shooting himself in the chest He died two days later with Theo at his side who reported his last words as La tristese durera toujours which meant The sadness will last forever in French During his brief career he had only sold one painting Van Goghs finest works were all sold in less than three years Van Goghs mother threw away a lot of his paintings during his life and even after his death But she lived long enough to see him become a world famous painter

The CIA is made up of four groups that each do different things Their goal is to protect the US people 

Many people feel that the CIA does more bad than good Some people feel that the CIA does good by finding out secret information about enemies of the United States American law prohibits the CIA and other agencies from killing foreign leaders In 1992 Saddam Hussein tried to kill former President George HW Bush who used to be Director of the CIA during a visit to Kuwait The assassination plot was not successful In retaliation then President Clinton ordered cruise missiles to be fired at the building of the Iraqi equivalent to the CIA This occurred at night so only the janitors were killed not those who planned the assassination

CIA has many clandestine or secret operations that people not working for the CIA will most likely never find out about Some CIA employees have been killed while working but their identities are so secret that they are represented only by a star not a name at a CIA memorial

The CIA also uses open sources to gather information Analysts read foreign newspapers and watch foreign news broadcasts to learn information which can be pieced together to make a conclusion

The CIA used to report to the President After the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States there was a reorganization so that the CIA along with other intelligence agencies report to a newly created Director

The CIA has been featured in many TV and film productions including but not limited to the American TV show The Agency the American TV mini series The Company Spy Game starring Robert Redford and Brad Pitt Night Flight to Moscow starring Yul Brenner Scorpio starring Burt Lancaster Clear and Present Danger starring Harrison Ford Ice Station Zebra and several James Bond film which featured CIA agent Felix Leiter

A liquid is a form of matter It is settled between solid and gas Liquid has an almost fixed volume but no set shape

Every small force makes a liquid change its shape by flowing Because of that gravity makes liquids always take the shape of the container The molecules that make up the liquid can freely move among themselves

Fluids that flow slowly have a high viscosity Some fluids like tar have such a high viscosity that they may seem solid

It is difficult to compress a liquid If a liquid is cooled down until it is colder than a certain temperature it will become a solid This temperature is called the melting point and is different for every different type of liquid The freezing point of water is around 0C and it becomes ice If a liquid is heated up it becomes a gas The temperature this happens at is called the boiling point The boiling point of water is 100C at this temperature it becomes steam

Examples of liquid are water oils and blood

In a liquid the liquid on the top presses down on the liquid underneath so at the bottom the pressure p is bigger than at the top The equation for working this out is

where z is the depth of the point below the surface and g is how strong gravity is pulling on the liquid is a number that tells us how heavy a set amount of the liquid is We call this the density and it is different for all liquids

Free software is software that anyone may run share and change at any time for any reason The opposite of free software is proprietary software

In 1984 Richard Stallman started the free software movement when he began the GNU project

Free software is very similar but different from open source software

People who like the name free software more say that they like it because they think every human must have the right to

People who like the name open source more say that they like it because the authors of such software allow others to look at the software and change it so the others will then help the authors make the software better

Because of how the name open source is used almost all free software is open source software and almost all open source software is free software

If an author wants to make his computer program free he must allow the people to whom he gives the program as a free program to use it for any reason and purpose on any computer in any place at any time without limits

That does not mean that the author must say I allow you to delete files from the computers of other people without telling them but he must not say I prohibit you from deleting files from the computers of other people without telling them If deleting files from somebodies computer is illegal it will be illegal even if it is prohibited only by law and not by the author of the program

If it is legal but the author has prohibited it nobody can change the program to make a useful program which does that and give it to others

The author must not prohibit even things which are dangerous because if the prohibition is not very very very complex and long it may be used incorrectly For example explosive materials can be used for war but they can also be used to remove a big stone which has fallen on a road Some authors would want to prohibit eating meat or saying bad words or something else If many authors prohibit many different things then a program which is made of the programs of those authors will not be usable

A person can understand how a program works or change the program only if they have the source code of that program It is difficult to read and very difficult to change many of the programs which exist because they are often compiled so only a computer can easily read them Because of that software can be free or open source only if the person who gets a copy can ask for and get the source code without paying more money

If the user has a computer and is allowed to change the program in the computer the computer must work with the changed program if the user has not made a mistake while changing the program The license GNU GPL 3 prohibits making computers which although the user can change the programs in them completely stop working after that only because the program is changed

There are also other things which must be allowed

The word free in free software is about freedom not price People are allowed to sell free software but the person who buys the software may change it or give it away

The name free software in English language is also often used for software a copy of which people can download without paying money and sometimes can give copies to others but not do all the things with it that they can do with the other Free software In this case free means free of charge freedom from paying money This software is called freeware it is almost always proprietary software

Field Marshal Erwin Johannes Eugen Rommel was an officer of the German Army in World War II 

He commanded the German Army in North Africa in a long struggle against the British 8th Army He was finally defeated at El Alamein

Later in the war he commanded the German forces defending the French coast against the Allied re invasion of Europe in Normandy

Rommel was well liked by both the German public and respected by the Allies He was thought to be chivalrous and humane when other Nazi leaders were not His famous Afrikakorps was not accused of any war crimes Soldiers captured by his army were treated well and orders to kill captured Jewish soldiers and civilians were ignored 

Rommel knew of the plan by senior officers to assassinate Hitler in 1944 When it failed all concerned were tortured and executed Hitler offered him the choice of suicide or trial and he committed suicide in 1944 His death was announced as the death of a hero in battle

Rommel was born in Heidenheim Germany 45 kilometers from Ulm in the Kingdom of Wrttemberg which was then part of the German Empire on November 15 1891 He was baptised on 17 November 1891 His father Erwin Rommel was a math teacher and later a secondary school headmaster at Aalen His mother was Helene von Lutz the daughter of a local government official Rommel was the second of four children Karl Gerhard and Helene Rommel wrote that his early years passed very happilyproof

At the age of 14 Rommel and a friend built a full scale glider that was able to fly short distances Young Erwin thought about being an engineer and he showed a talent with technical work however because of his father young Rommel joined the local 124th Wrttemberg Infantry Regiment as an officer cadet in 1910 and shortly after was sent to the Officer Cadet School in Danzig He graduated on 15 November 1911 and was a lieutenant in January 1912

While at Cadet School early in 1911 Erwin Rommel met his future wife 17 year old Lucia Maria Mollin They married on November 27 1916 in Danzig and on December 24 1928 had a son Manfred who would later become the mayor of Stuttgart After having met Lucie some historians think that Rommel also had an affair with a woman called Walburga Stemmer in 1913 and they had a daughter named Gertrud

In World War I Rommel fought in France as well as in Romania and Italy first as a member of the 6th Wrttemberg Infantry Regiment and then in the Wrttemberg Mountain Battalion of the Alpenkorps While serving with that unit he gained a reputation for making quick tactical decisions and taking advantage of enemy confusion He was wounded three times and awarded the Iron Cross First and Second Class Rommel also received Prussias highest medal the Pour le Mrite after fighting in the mountains of west Slovenia Battles of the Isonzo Soca front The award came as a result of the Battle of Longarone and the capture of Mount Matajur Slovenia and its defenders numbering 150 Italian officers 9000 men and 81 pieces of artillery His battalion used gas during the battles of the Isonzo and also played a key role in the victory of the Central Powers over the Italian army at the Battle of Caporetto While fighting at Isonzo Rommel was taken prisoner by the Italians He escaped and because he spoke Italian he was back to the German lines within two weeks Later when the German and Italian armies were allied during the Second World War Rommel realised that their lack of success in battle was due to poor leadership and equipment which when fixed easily made them equal to German forces

Rommel was a commander of the Fhrerbegleithauptquartier during the Poland campaign often moving up close to the front in the Fhrersonderzug and seeing much of Hitler After the Polish defeat Rommel returned to Berlin to organize the Fhrers victory parade taking part himself as a member of Hitlers entourage During the Polish campaign Rommel was asked to help of one of his wifes relatives a Polish priest who had been arrested When Rommel asked the Gestapo for information the Gestapo found no information about the mans existence

Rommel asked Hitler for command of a panzer division On 6 February 1940 three months before the invasion of France Rommel was given command of the 7th Panzer Division for Fall Gelb the invasion of France and the Low Countries Some other Nazi officers did not agree with his promotion Rommels initial request for command had been rejected by the Chief of Army Personnel who cited his lack of previous experience with armoured units and his extensive prior experience in an Alpine unit made him a more suitable candidate to assume command of a mountain division that had recent need to fill its commanding officer postsfnIrving1977p39 Rommel had however emphasized the use of mobile infantry and recognized the great usefulness of armoured forces in the Poland campaign He set about learning and developing the techniques of armoured warfare with great enthusiasm The decision to place him in command of an armoured division was borne out to be an excellent one In May 1940 his 7th Panzer Division became known as the Ghost Division because its rapid advances and fast paced attacks often placed them so far forward that they were frequently out of communication with the rest of the German army

Rommels reward for his success was to be promoted and appointed commander of the 5th Light Division and of the 15Panzer Division which as the Deutsches Afrikakorps were sent to Libya in early 1941 in Operation Sonnenblume to aid the Italian troops which had suffered a heavy defeat from British Commonwealth forces in Operation Compass It was in Africa where Rommel achieved his greatest fame as a commander

Rommel was well known not only by the German people but also by his enemies Stories of his chivalry and tactical ability earned him the respect of many opponents including Claude Auchinleck Winston Churchill George S Patton and Bernard Montgomery Rommel was also respectful of his enemies Hitler considered Rommel among his favorite generals

The Afrika Korps was never accused of any war crimes and Rommel himself referred to the fighting in North Africa as Krieg ohne Hass war without hate Numerous examples exist of this such as his refusal to carry out an order from Hitler to execute Jewish prisoners During Rommels time in France Hitler ordered him to deport the Jews in France Rommel did not Several times he wrote letters protesting the treatment of the Jews When British Major Geoffrey Keyes was killed during a failed commando raid to kill or capture Rommel behind German lines Rommel ordered him buried with full military honours Also during the construction of the Atlantic Wall Rommel directed that French workers were not to be used as slaves but were to be paid for their labour

Rommel was not one of the group who planned the attempt on Hitlers life Actually he was not in favour of assassinating Hitler Rommel believed an assassination attempt could spark civil war in Germany and Austria and Hitler would have become a martyr for a lasting cause Instead Rommel insisted that Hitler be arrested and brought to trial for his crimes Later though Rommel made up his mind to support the plot

After the failed bomb attack of 20 July 1944 many conspirators were arrested Rommel was fairly perturbed at this development It did not take long for Rommels involvement to come to light 

Under Gestapo torture one of that group revealed the names of several higher army officers who were consulted beforehand Rommel was one of those

Even more damningly Carl Goerdeler the main civilian leader of the Resistance wrote on several letters and other documents that Rommel was a potential supporter and an acceptable military leader to be placed in a position of responsibility should their coup succeed Nazi party officials in France reported that Rommel extensively and scornfully criticised Nazi incompetence and crimes That sealed his fate

The release of the film The Desert Fox The Story of Rommel helped his reputation as one of the most widely known and well regarded leaders in the German Army

Fermentation is when a cell uses sugar for energy without using oxygen at the same time Yeast is an organism that ferments When yeast ferments sugar the yeast eats sugar and makes alcohol Other cells make vinegar or lactic acid when they ferment sugar

When yeast ferments it breaks down the glucose into ethanol and carbon dioxide

A flower is a part of a plant Flowers are also called the bloom or blossom of a plant It sometimes has a stem a thin pipe to support the flower Flowers have petals The flower contains the part that produces seeds

Flowers are the reproductive structure of flowering plants which are plants of the division Magnoliophyta also called the Angiosperms

In many plants a flower is its most colourful part We say the plant flowers is flowering or is in flower when this colourful part begins to grow bigger and open out There are many different kinds of flowers in different areas in the world Even in the coldest places for example the Arctic flowers can grow during a few months

In botany flowers are the key evolutionary advance made by flowering plants To investigate the structure of a flower it must be dissected examined under a binocular microscope and its structure summarised by a floral diagram or a floral formula Then its family can be identified with the aid of a flora which is a book designed to help you identify plants

Flowers contain the reproductive organs of a plant Some flowers are dependent upon the wind to move pollen between flowers of the same species Many others rely on insects or birds to move pollen The role of flowers is to produce seeds or fruit Fruits and seeds are a means of dispersal Plants do not move but wind animals and birds spread the plants across the landscape

Flowers are modified leaves possessed only by the group known as the angiosperms which are relatively late to appear in the fossil record 

The flowering plants have long been assumed to have evolved from within the gymnosperms but gymnosperms form a clade which is distinct from the angiosperms The two clades diverging some 300 million years ago

Since the ovules are protected by carpels and integuments it takes something special for fertilisation to happen Angiosperms have pollen grains comprising just three cells One cell is responsible for drilling down through the integuments and creating a passage for the two sperm cells to flow down The megagametophyte has just seven cells of these one fuses with a sperm cell forming the nucleus of the egg itself and another other joins with the other sperm and dedicates itself to forming a nutrient rich endosperm The other cells take auxiliary roles This process of double fertilisation is unique and common to all angiosperms

Flowers and flowering plants first appear in the fossil record of 130 million years ago in the Lower Cretaceous

Flowers have long been admired and used by humans Most people think that flowers are beautiful Many people also love flowers for their fragrances People enjoy seeing flowers growing in gardens People also enjoy growing flowers in their backyards outside their homes People often wear flowers on their clothes or give flowers as a gift during special occasions holidays or rituals such as the birth of a new baby at weddings at funerals People often buy flowers from businesses called florists

Some parents name their girl children after a flower Some common flower names are Rose Lily Daisy Holly Hyacinth Jasmine Blossom

People also eat some types of flowers Flower vegetables include broccoli cauliflower and artichoke The most expensive spice saffron comes from the crocus flower Other flower spices are cloves and capers Hops flowers are used to flavor beer Dandelion flowers are often made into wine 

Honey is flower nectar that has been collected and processed by bees Honey is often named for the type of flower that the bees are using Some people put flowers from nasturtiums chrysanthemums or carnations in their food Flowers can also be made into tea Dried flowers such as chrysanthemum rose jasmine are used to make tea

Flowers were used to signal meanings in the time when social meetings between men and women was difficult Lilies make people think of life Red roses make people think of love beauty and passion In Britain Australia and Canada poppies are worn on Memorial Day as a mark of respect for those who served and died in wars Daisies make people think of children and innocence

A square kilometre is based on the SI unit of measurement of area the square metre It is the area inside a square that has each side equal to 1 kilometre This way of talking about area is often used to say how much land there is on a farm or in a city for example

One square kilometre is just less than 039 square miles

A judge is a man or woman who is in control of a court of law

The way that people can become judges and what they have to do in court depends on each country In some countries judges must work with the law for a number of years before they can sit as a judge in a broken wikt linkcourtroomcourtroom In some countries especially the United States there might be a jury in the courtroom that decides if someone is guilty or not guilty of breaking a law A jury can also decide if someone must pay money to someone else and how much they have to pay If there is a jury the judge has the job of making sure the person taken to court is treated in a fair way

In other countries for example in many countries in Europe the judge makes the decision of whether or not a person is guilty

Some courts will have more than one judge for example three judges For important decisions about the laws of a country countries may have a supreme court or high court with many judges in it In the United States judges on a supreme court are called justices and are lead by a chief justice

In many countries judges wear special clothes while being in court Oftentimes this is a black broken wikt linkroberobe or broken wikt linkcloakcloak Supreme or high court judges often wear a kind of red cloak Judges in some countries also wear a special long wig They also used to put a piece of black material on their head when they sentenced a person to die

A person is guilty of doing something if they have done something really bad If a person has broken a law by stealing for example they are guilty of breaking the law or according to Colly OBrien can be considered guilty as charged and should be taken to the dock immediately 

People also say they feel guilty if they think they have been unfair or done something wrong This is often called having a guilty conscience

The opposite of guilty is innocent or not guilty 

Length is a property of a thing that can be measured One of the methods of measurement is either using a ruler or a Geometric Square We generally measure the length of small shapes but we have made a range of sizes so you can either have an easy to go degree of accuracy or an close to exact measurement in millimeters or even more accurate ways of saying that length the more longer the object seems the lesser the degree of accuracy we tend to measure it The length of something is the distance between two ends of the thing Short means of small length Long means of much length Short and long are opposites Length is usually the longer side of measurement

Length is also a property of time An amount of time has a length

John sits down at one oclock or 1h John waits until three oclock or 3h John stands up at three oclock or 3h John was sitting for 2 hours The length of time John was sitting was two hours

The weight of an object is the measure of the intensity of the force imposed on this object by the local gravitational field Weight should not be confused with the related but quite different concept of mass

In common language or in the absence of other information the weight of something is typically understood to be the value measured at or near the Earths surface For small objects on Earth this force is directed towards the center of mass of the planet For larger objects such as the Moon orbiting around the Earth the force is directed towards the barycenter or center of mass of the combined system

The unit of weight in the International System of Units is the Newton which is represented by the symbol N

Other units have been in use in the past but have been abandoned such as the dyne or the kilogram force which is the force exerted on a kg of matter by a standard Earth A mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 981 N at sea level

The weight of an object or of an amount of matter is typically measured with an instrument such as a spring scale that provides a reading on the amount of another force required to balance the gravitational pull on the object of interest

The weighing scale is a device that compares the weights of two masses in the same gravitational field it determines whether one mass is heavier or lighter than the other If one disposes of a series of reference masses one can determine the mass of any object by adding those of the reference masses needed to balance the scale

Weight is not an intrinsic property of matter because the local gravitational field that generates the force called weight is variable in space and time

Truth is what is real A thing is true if it is a fact The English word truth is from Old English trew trow trw Middle English trewe Aristotle said To say of what is that it is not or of what is not that it is is false while to say of what is that it is and of what is not that it is not is true

Truth is a noun and the corresponding adverb and adjective is true

For example it is a truth that a dog is an animal It is untrue that a dog is a plant

Something untrue is false A half truth is something true mixed with something false or where something is partly true but you do not tell the whole story

If the things you say are true then you are speaking the truth or speaking truly Saying something that is untrue can be called a lie if the person who is saying it knows it is untrue A person who says something untrue is often called a liar

True is also one of the two basic values of logic The other such value is usually called false

Aristotle was the first to put logic into a formal framework His version is called propositional logic Other forms of logic use types of mathematics or logical notations Boolean algebra is about things being true and false

The relationship between verbal claims and external reality is handled by epistemology and the philosophy of science

Sublimation is the process by which a solid transforms into a gas without passing through the liquid stage At normal atmospheric pressure only some compounds like dry ice can go through this process Most objects need low pressure to go through sublimation There is low pressure in space

Snow may look like it disappears on a cold sunny day but this is not sublimation because it forms a thin layer of liquid water first

A better example is CO2 which changes from a solid to a gas without being a liquid

Also diamond graphite iodine ammonium chloride and aluminium chloride sublime rather than melt at atmospheric pressure

Henry VII was born in 1457 to Edmund Tudor and Margaret Beaufort His father died two months before he was born leaving his 13 year old mother as his only parent After Henrys birth he spent a lot of time with his uncle Jasper Tudor Jasper took Henry to France where he spent most of his youth Henry had a claim to the throne of England but it was not a very good one and he had to wait a long time for a chance to take the throne In 1483 a new king came to the throne in England called Richard III King Richard was not popular with everyone because it was thought that he had stolen the throne from his young nephews and had killed them This gave Henry the chance he had been waiting for With help from the French he raised an army They landed at Dale in Pembrokeshire close to where Henry had been born so he was able to gather more supporters on the way The Wars of the Roses was a series of civil wars fought over the throne of England between supporters of the House of Lancaster and supporters of the House of York Both houses were branches of the Plantagenet royal house tracing their descent from King Edward III              

The main reason for the war was that King Edward III had many sons as shown in the family tree below His oldest son who is known by the nickname The Black Prince died first and the throne passed to the Black Princes son Richard who became King Richard II of England in 1377 at the age of only ten He grew up to be a weak and unpopular king and one of his actions was to send his cousin Henry into exile Henry later returned while Richard was away in Ireland and took over the country When Richard returned Henry tricked him into giving himself up Richard was put in prison where he died and Henry became King Henry IV of England

Although Henry IV reigned until his death and was followed by his son King Henry V the next king in line King Henry VI was only a baby While he was still growing up the most powerful men in the kingdom started quarrelling over how to run the country and some of them raised an army to try to take the throne Henry VI and his family fought back and the war between his supporters and their enemies lasted for many years finally coming to an end when King Henry VII of England came to the throne in 1485

On 22 August 1485 Henrys army defeated Richard IIIs army at the Battle of Bosworth When Richard III died in this battle Henry VII became king There were other people who had a claim on the throne and Henry did his best to stop them from taking it from him either by executing them putting them in prison or trying to make friends of them as he did with the Earl of Lincoln Another step he took was to marry Elizabeth of York the niece of King Richard III who would herself have been the heir to the throne if she had not been a girl

There were also people who pretended to be long lost members of the royal family so that they could try to take the throne One of these was a little boy called Lambert Simnel who looked very like Edward Earl of Warwick The real Earl of Warwick was Henrys prisoner but this did not stop other people from believing that Lambert was him The Earl of Lincoln rebelled against King Henry and raised an army to make Lambert king thinking that he himself could rule the country There was a battle and the Earl of Lincoln was killed Lambert Simnel was captured but because he was only a child Henry spared his life and he became a royal servant

Henry married Elizabeth of York and by this action put an end to the Wars of the Roses They had six children but only four survived infancy

After Henry VII died in 1509 his son became king as Henry VIII Henry VII was buried in Westminster Abbey He was succeeded by his son Henry VIII on 21 April 1509

The word was made during the Irish Land War It comes from the name of Captain Charles Boycott Boycott was in charge of looking after the land of a landlord in County Mayo Ireland In 1880 the tenants wanted their rent lowered Boycott refused and threw them out of the land they had rented The Irish Land League then proposed that instead of becoming violent everyone in the community should stop doing business with Captain Boycott The captain was soon isolated No one helped him with the harvest no one worked in his stables or his house Local businessmen no longer traded with him the postman no longer delivered his post 

To get his harvest done he had to hire 50 people from other counties the counties Cavan and Monaghan They were escorted to and from their work by 1000 policemen Of course this cost far more than what the harvest was worth 

In 1881 the word came into general use

King Arthur was a legendary king in the mythology of Great Britain He lived in Camelot and owned a mythical sword which people called Excalibur

Some think King Arthur lived in some time from the end of 5th century to the early 6th century He might have been a king or a leader of Britons If he existed he was almost certainly not a king Later his story grew with more stories like the magic man Merlin or the horseman with sword Sir Lancelot No one knows whether he is a real person or not Some say he is a mythical person like Hercules and some say he is a real person with a miraculous story

His father was Uther Pendragon but when Arthur was born his mother Lady Igraine died followed shortly by his father Arthur was sent to live with a knight when he was still an infant When he grew up he found a sword stuck in a stone He was told that whoever could pull it out was the true king So he pulled it out and became king

When he was older he married Lady Guinevere They lived very happily together until one of King Arthurs best knights Sir Lancelot slept with Lady Guinevere King Arthur was very angry but in the end forgave both of them Lancelot apologized for his behaviour and decided to leave the kingdom as he thought himself not worthy of King Arthurs favour Guinevere although she was allowed to stay decided to leave as well to another part of the kingdom

Later on King Arthurs sword Excalibur was stolen and used by a traitor a person who betrays named Mordred They fought and Mordred was able to make King Arthur bleed but King Arthur hit Mordred and killed him in the end Finally King Arthur died from losing too much blood and one of his horse riders threw Excalibur into the lake where it came from

John Johnny Appleseed Chapman is an American folk hero He was a Christian missionary and pioneer His nickname came from the fact that he planted apple trees throughout the Midwest of America Many people consider him an early conservationist or tree hugger He wandered the country usually barefoot and with a cooking pot on his head for most of his adult life planting apple trees teaching the Bible telling stories and befriending Native Americans wild animals and other settlers Many stories have been told about him and his journeys as well as art books and later movies which makes him a folk hero He was born in Leominster Massachusetts and is buried in Johnny Appleseed Park in Fort Wayne Indiana

John Chapman is said to have been in the Wilkes Barre region some time in the 1790s practicing his profession as a nurseryman but just when he embraced the Swedenborgian faith and began his missionary activities we cannot be sure though it is probable that it was before he ever reached western Pennsylvania There are some early accounts of John speaking of his own activities as a Bible missionary on the Potomac when he was a young man and Johnny was seen for two or three consecutive years along the banks of the Potomac in eastern Virginia picking the seeds from the pomace of the cider mills in the late 1790sThe apple seeds that Johnny obtained were free as the cider mills wanted there to be more apple trees planted to improve their business

At the time of his death Johnny Appleseed left an estate of more than 1200 acres of nurseries and he left these to his sister He additionally had four plots located in Allen County Indiana which was a nursery that included 15000 trees 

Records show that John Chapman appeared on Licking Creek in what is now Licking County Ohio in 1800 when he was twenty six years old He had probably come up the Muskingum River to plant near the Refugee Tract which would soon fill up with settlers when Congress actually got around to granting the lands In April 1798 the Continental Congress had ratified resolutions to donate public lands for the benefit of those who had left Canada and Nova Scotia to fight against the British in the Revolutionary War The lands were actually set apart in 1801 and patents issued in 1802 Grants of land ranging from 160 acres to 2240 acres were awarded according to the exertions of the patentee in the War Johnny with true Yankee enterprise went ahead and planted his nurseries before the refugees arrived Licking County then a part of Fairfield contained only three white families By the time families were ready to settle the area Johnnys tracts of land were ready for market

A Compact Disc is a type of optical disc It is flat and round and is used to store digital data It is used to store music and other sounds The sounds on the CD are played using a compact disc player It was developed by Phillips and Sony

Later Compact Discs were made that could be used to put computer files on in the same way as audio compact discs These are called CD ROMs The computer reads the disc using a CD ROM drive Another use is to store MPEG videos cheaply these CDs are called VCDs and are especially popular in Asia For example in Indonesia they are used instead of the more expensive DVD

The diameter of a normal CD is 120 mm The middle hole in a CD is about the size of a five cent coin The person who decided the size was Dutch and used the size of an old Dutch coin called a dubbeltje or dime A CD usually holds a maximum of 74 80 minutes of audio or 650 700 megabytes of data

Some CDs are smaller they are 80mm in diameter They can hold about 30 of the capacity of a normal disc

On 29 February 1944 Wojtya was knocked down by a German truck He expected to be badly treated but the German officers sent him to a hospital He spent two weeks there with head and shoulder injuries It was at this time that he decided that he must become a priest When he came out of hospital the young Polish men were being sent to Germany for training He escaped to the house of the Archbishop and hid there till after the war On the night of 17 January 1945 the Germans left the city The priests and teacher and students went back to the seminary where there was a big clean up to be done Wojtya volunteered to clean out the lavatories

During his lifetime he learned many foreign languages He spoke Polish as his native language and learned Latin and Ancient Greek in school On the day that he officially became Pope he spoke to people in Italian English German French Spanish Czech and Portuguese He also spoke a little Lithuanian Hungarian Russian and Ukrainian

John Paul II beatified many people This means that the Pope gave these people the title of Blessed One example is the painter Fra Angelico who lived in the 1400s After studying his life and teaching it was decided that he should officially be called the Blessed Fra Angelico John Paul II gave more people the title of Blessed than any other pope in history He also made many saints

In 1984 John Paul II started World Youth Day which was first held in Rome and attended by about 300000 people Since then it has been held in a different country every year It encourages young people to be faithful to God and to live together in peace Many millions of people have attended

The first pope who traveled a lot was Pope Paul VI Like him John Paul II liked to travel While he was pope he made 105 trips visiting 117 countries In total he travelled more than 11 million km Wherever he went he attracted large crowds All these travels were paid by the money of the countries he visited and not by the Vatican

One of John Paul IIs earliest official visits was to his home country of Poland in June 1979 There he was always surrounded by happy cheering crowds The Pope wanted to bring freedom and human rights to his country His visit encouraged Poles to oppose the communism and in 1980 the Solidarity movement was born On later trips to Poland he made his message of support stronger The Soviet Union had controlled Eastern Europe for many years In 1989 Poland was the first country to begin to break free from the Soviet Union

John Paul II went to places where other popes before him had already been such as the United States or The Holy Land He also went to many countries that no pope had ever visited before He was the first reigning pope to travel to the United Kingdom where he met Queen Elizabeth II the Supreme Governor of the Church of England

In 1982 the Pope made a visit to Japan and in 1984 to South Korea and Puerto Rico He was the first pope to visit Cuba During his visit in January 1998 he sharply criticized Cuba for not allowing people to freely express their religion He also criticised the United States embargo against Cuba In 2000 he became the first modern Catholic pope to visit Egypt and met with the Coptic Pope and the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria He was the first Catholic Pope to visit and pray in an Islamic mosque in Damascus Syria in 2001 He visited Umayyad Mosque where John the Baptist is believed to be buried

In 1988 he made a trip to Lesotho to beatify Joseph Gerrad On 15 January 1995 during the 10th World Youth Day he offered Mass to an estimated crowd of between four and eight million in Luneta Park Manila Philippines This is considered to be the largest single event in Christian history

After the attacks on 11 September 2001 even though people were worried about his safety the Pope traveled to Kazakhstan and spoke to large audiences including many Muslims He also went to Armenia to participate in the celebration of the 1700 years of Christianity He said Mass in local languages during some visits including Kiswahili in Nairobi Kenya in 1995 and in an Indonesian language in East Timor

During his trips the Pope always showed his devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary He visited many shrines consecrated to her notably Knock in Ireland Liche Stary in Poland Ftima in Portugal Guadalupe in Mexico and Lourdes in France

On 13 May 1981 the Pope was shot twice in the abdomen by a Muslim fanatic Mehmet Ali Aca The pope was gravely injuredHe barely survived the assassination attempt and had to be treated in hospital for 20 days The pope later visited Aca in prison He had forgiven him already Exactly one year later he traveled to Fatima to thank Mary Mother of God for saving his life

On this trip there was a second attempt to his life A follower of the French archbishop Marcel Lefebvre tried to hurt the Pope with a bayonet He was overpowered by the bodyguards of the Pope Lefevbre and his followers were against the decisions of the Second Vatican Council After this the Pope often travelled in a bullet proof trailer known as the popemobile 

John Paul died on Saturday on the eve of the Divine Mercy Holiday 2 April 2005 The official time of death on his death certificate was 937 pm but a few sources reported 933 pm The death certificate stated that when the Pope died he had Parkinsons disease with serious breathing difficulties The Pope had tracheotomy surgery in mid February but it did not help and he lost lots of weight He also had an enlarged prostate urinary infection and other problems The cause of death were that his kidneys failed causing blood poisoning and infection brought by septic shock John Paul II spoke his final words pozwlcie mi odej do domu Ojca to his aides and fell into a coma about four hours later

The Popes medical team used heart monitoring machinery for more than 20 minutes so his real and true time of death was around 915 PM Vatican time As tradition demands his name was called three times When there was no reply his papal ring was broken which meant the end of John Paul IIs papacy

Many people claimed to have been specially blessed by the reign of Pope John Paul II Many people thought he should be given the title Blessed This usually takes at least five years On 13 May 2005 Pope Benedict XVI cut short the usual 5 year wait for the beatification process to begin The only other time that this has happened was for Mother Theresa who was made Blessed Mother Theresa by John Paul II It was announced on 14 January 2011 that John Paul II will be beatified on 1 May 2011 According to the Vatican Pope John Paul IIs remains will be moved from the grotto beneath St Peters Basilica where he is presently buried to a marble stone monument in Pier Paolo Cristofaris Chapel of St Sebastian which is where Blessed Pope Innocent XI is currently buried Blessed Pope Innocents remains will likely be moved This more prominent location next to the Chapel of the Pieta the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament and statues of Popes Pius XI and Pius XII will increase the number of pilgrims capable of viewing his memorial It will be a great joy for us when he is officially beatified but as far as we are concerned he is already a Saint Stanisaw Dziwisz 189

Once John Paul becomes a saint it has been suggested that 22 May should be the official John Paul II Day on Church Calendar of the Saints 22 May is 50 days after the death of the Pope 18 May 2 July have also been suggested as his official saint day on the churchs calendar 18 May is already Saint Pope John Is Day

John Paul II was generally against communism He was also a critic of capitalism that was not controlled and he did not want peoples basic rights to be oppressed by world governments He was against abortion and contraception in general As head of the largest Christian group John Paul II taught a conservative theological view of human sexuality On the subject he wrote 130 topics called the Theology of the Body He was against homosexuality and in favour of people starting families as one husband and one wife On April 30 2000 John Paul instituted a Divine Mercy Holiday according to the teachings of Saint Faustyna Kowalska and on that day she was also proclaimed a Saint of the Catholic Church The Feast of the Mercy of God is continuously growing worldwide John Paul is also remembered for his devotion to the Consecrated Holy Communion the Holy Body and Blood of Christ

During John Pauls time as pope the church was involved in a large number of claims about child sexual abuse by priests There are many people who believe that the Church and therefore the Pope knew about these claims and tried to cover them up For example in 1996 the Irish bishops decided that priests suspected of child abuse must be reported to the police The Vatican sent a letter to the bishops that they were not to report such cases The letter was from future Pope Benedict XVI  who John Paul II had asked to handle such cases John Paul II is also claimed to have got a cardinal to send a thank you letter to a French bishop who had refused to report a priest to the police In 2001 John Paul II sent out a special letter saying that the abuse of children by priests was a very serious crime and should be strictly punished Some Catholics want the process for making John Paul II a saint stopped until there is an investigation into his role in keeping secret information about bad priests

Nuclear fission is when an atom splits apart into smaller atoms It gives off a lot of energy and is used in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors This process was discovered in December 1938 by the German nuclear chemist Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann in Berlin 

Certain types of the elements including uranium and plutonium can be made to fission While all atoms are small atoms of uranium and plutonium are very large and heavy compared to most atoms At their center is a very heavy ball called a nucleus which is made of protons and neutrons If a very large nucleus is hit by a neutron it will sometimes become unstable and break into two pieces When the nucleus breaks apart it releases a lot of energy and it also causes some more neutrons to be released If those neutrons then hit other atoms they will make the other atoms split This can happen again and again This is called a nuclear chain reaction and it can release huge amounts of energy very quickly The amount of energy released by a nuclear chain reaction is measured in kilotons One kiloton is the same as the explosive force of one thousand tons of TNT

In a nuclear bomb this must happen very quickly to make a very big explosion In a nuclear reactor this must happen very slowly to create heat In a reactor the heat created by the uranium or plutonium atoms when they fission boils water into steam This can be used to power a generator to create electricity

A meteor is what you see when a space rock falls to Earth It is often known as a shooting star or falling star and can be a bright light in the night sky though most are faint If it hits the ground it is then called a meteorite and it will leave a hole in the ground called a crater Meteoroids may range in size from large pieces of rock to tiny dust particles floating in space that did not form planets Once the meteoroids enter Earths atmosphere and begin to heat up and break apart they are known as meteors Meteors are distinct from comets or asteroids but some especially those associated with showers are dust particles that were ejected from comets

There are several types of meteorites including stony carbonaceous chondrites and iron nickel Stony meteorites are named because they are largely made up of stone like mineral material carbonaceous chondrites have a high carbon content and iron nickel meteorites are mostly iron often with significant nickel as well

Meteorite strikes may have played a part in several of the mass extinctions and so indirectly on the course of evolution see KT extinction event List of extinction events Chicxulub crater

Bamboo is a name for more than one thousand species of giant grasses There are about 91 different genera All bamboos have wood like stems Bamboo mainly grows in Africa America and in Asia but can easily grow in Europe

Bamboo grows in clumps and can be up to 40 metres David Farrelly in his book The Book of Bamboo says that bamboo has been measured to grow 121 meter in a 24 hour period Most bamboos will grow more like 3 cm to 5 cma day though

Almost all species of bamboo have hollow stems divided into nodes or joints The stem can be up to 30 cm in diameter Each of the node has one side bud Not all of those buds develop into branches but some do This makes bamboo one of the few grasses that have a branch structure Bamboo rarely flowers Some species only flower once and then die off The distance of two joints in a bamboo is the basis of a traditional Japanese unit of measurement shaku

Bamboo is used to make lots of things and is a construction material The stems of larger trees are used to build houses bridges and other things that have to be constructed such as boat and wickerwork It can be used for scaffolding Bamboo is an easy construction material that is not too expensive

Bamboo shoots can also be used as human food Bamboo shoots are usually cooked before being eaten Most temperate bamboos can be eaten without cooking if they are not too bitter As some may contain cyanogens cooking is better The only Phyllostachys known to have potentially toxic concentrations of cyanogens is Ph heterocycla pubescens

The Trojan War was one of the greatest wars in the history of Ancient Greece It probably happened between the Trojans and the Achaeans It is mostly known through the Iliad an epic poem written by the Ancient Greek poet Homer

The site of ancient Troy has been found across the Aegean Sea on Asia Minor The war may have taken place in the 12th century BC 

The origins of the war started at the wedding of King Peleus and the nereid Thetis They had invited almost all the gods to their wedding But they did not invite Eris goddess of strife She was angry and she threw a golden apple among the guests on which was written To the Fairest The goddesses Hera Athena and Aphrodite caught the apple at the same time and fought over who was the most beautiful Because they could not end the fight by themselves they went to Zeus the king of the gods Zeus chose Paris to decide and give the apple to who he wanted Each of the three goddesses offered Paris gifts so he would choose her Hera offered Paris all of Asia Athena offered him wisdom Then Aphrodite offered him the love of the most beautiful woman Paris gave the apple to Aphrodite Of course Aphrodite had not thought about the fact that the most beautiful woman Helen Queen of Sparta already had a husband But Aphrodite had her son Eros shoot Helen with a golden arrow and fall in love with Paris Then the pair left for Troy Menelaus Helens husband declared war on Troy to retrieve his queen This began the Trojan war Achilles was one of the great heroes of the war the other being Hector

The war went on for ten years Some famous people were Achilles Paris and Hector The Greeks won by building a big wooden horse This became named the Trojan Horse Some Greek people hid inside the horse and the rest put the horse on the shore and left in their boats The Trojans saw the horse and thought that the Greeks had surrendered They thought that the horse was a present They dragged the horse into Troy and celebrated their victory When night fell the Greeks hiding inside the horse opened the city gates and set fire to the houses The Greeks who had left in their boats had just pretended to leave to trick the Trojans They had actually just hidden behind islands They returned and won the war The trick was thought up by Odysseus King of the small island of Ithaca

The war probably did happen but in the telling the events were exaggerated and mythic elements put in These changes fit the needs of oral poetry In the mid 19th century the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann discovered the ruins of a city which he identified as Troy 

Some Hittite and Egyptian texts also talk about the war They say that a confederation of 22 cities went to war

These are stories books movies etc that are about the Trojan War or tell parts of its story

In 1968 Baader and his girlfriend Gudrun Ensslin were convicted of the setting fire to a department store in Frankfurt am Main

They were arrested and sent to jail but Baader escaped He was caught in April 1970 but in May 1970 he was allowed to go a library outside the prison

Journalist Ulrike Meinhof and two other women were allowed to join him They let a masked man into the library who fired shots at a 64 year old librarian Baader the three women and the masked man fled through a window and the group soon became known as the Baader Meinhof Gang

Baader and others then spent some time in a Palestinian military training camp in Jordan before being thrown out Back in Germany Baader robbed banks and bombed buildings from 1970 to 1972 On 1 June 1972 he and fellow RAF members Jan Carl Raspe and Holger Meins were caught after a gunfight in Frankfurt

Meins died during a hunger strike in Stammheim Prison in 1974 This was when philosopher Jean Paul Sartre visited Baader He described Baader as incredibly stupid and an assholeSartre par lui mme 1976

From 1975 to 1977 there was a long and expensive trial in a specially fortified building on the grounds of Stuttgarts Stammheim prison Their jailers said Baader and the others kept their cells as dirty and disgusting as possible in stop searches for things that might be smuggled in at this time lawyers and defendants were not separated by panes of glass during unsupervised meetings

Ulrike Meinhof was found dead in her cell at Stuttgart Stammheim on 9 May 1976 hanging from the ceiling Members of the Red Army Faction and others claimed that she was killed by the German government The so called second generation of the RAF committed several kidnappings and killings in a campaign in support of the prisoners The three remaining defendants were convicted in April 1977 of several murders attempted murders and of forming a terrorist organization and were sentenced to life imprisonment

Hitlers Children The story of the Baader Meinhof Terrorist Gang by Jillian Becker

Meher Baba was a spiritual teacher who lived in India Babas real birth name was Merwan Irani and his parents names were Sheriar and Shireen Irani His family lived in India but they were of Persian descent Today Persia is called Iran They were not Hindus or Muslims like most Indians at that time but were of the Zoroastrian religion

Baba had a normal childhood and liked poetry and sports especially cricket When Baba was thirteen years old he started a boys club with his best school friends called The Cosmopolitan Club The boys in the club kept up on the news practiced public speaking at their clubhouse and raised money to give to the poor As Baba got older he worked for his father in his fathers tavern where he served a cheap kind of wine called toddy made from the sap of palm trees 

Baba lived in Pune India where he graduated from St Vincents High School and attended Deccan College In 1913 when Baba was nineteen he was coming home from college riding a bicycle A very old Muslim woman named Hazrat Babajan who was sitting under a Neem tree called for him to come over to her and she kissed him on the forehead He then went home Baba later said that he became so dazed after this kiss that he could barely find his way home and that when Babajan kissed him he realized God within himself He was so dazed that he had to stay in bed for several weeks A year later Baba met a Hindu holy man named Upasni Maharaj Baba went to live with Upasni in the village of Sakori He learned from Upasni and obeyed Upasnis orders 

Baba stayed with Upasni for seven years until he was twenty seven years old Then Upasni told some of his followers that from then on Baba would be their spiritual guide Baba eventually took these new followers to Ahmednagar to a place now called Meherabad There he gave lessons in spirituality worked with the poor and started a free boarding school Gradually other people started to follow Meher Baba

For most of his life Baba did not speak He started his silence in 1925 He communicated by pointing to letters painted on an alphabet board at first and later used his own form of sign language He kept silent until his death in 1969 Some people called him The Silent Master and there is a book by that title

Meher Baba traveled around the world many times He visited many countries He spent several months in England Australia and the United States Many thousands of people came to see him Some of them became his followers 

In 1954 when Baba was sixty years old he said to others that he was the Avatar In the ancient language of Sanskrit the word Avatar means one who has come down from God Baba said that the Avatar is born on Earth every 700 1400 years and comes to help others find God Meher Baba said that in the past the Avatar had been on Earth as Zoroaster Rama Krishna Buddha Jesus and Muhammad

Meher Babas most famous quote is Dont Worry Be Happy partly because it appeared in a popular song by Bobby McFerrin Others know of him because of the song Baba OReilly written by Pete Townshend who is a follower of his and named the song partly after Baba 

He wrote two important books In Discourses Meher Baba wrote about how to live a good life how to meditate and how to love God In God Speaks Meher Baba wrote about how the soul seeks God over many lifetimes He said Real happiness lies in making others happy He showed his followers that the best path is to love God at all times by loving your fellow man 

He also said he had not come to start a new religion  that it was better to truly follow ones own religion Because of this he has followers who are Zoroastrians Christians Jews Hindus Muslims Sufis Buddhists and Sikhs There are also atheists and agnostics who do not necessarily believe in God but who are attracted purely to his simple philosophy of leading an honest and loving life

Electrical engineers develop different things that use electricity in a helpful way They fix or design new and better ways of using devices that use electricity

The first universities in the world taught philosophy and then science With more learning they had to start teaching new parts of these sciences When humans made industry we needed to study mathematics physics and chemistry to help support it When electricity was used more they had to make a new branch called electrical engineering Big subjects in electrical engineering are power generation automation and control semiconductors and information technology These change in different countries Since then electrical engineering has allowed us to study new forms of engineering such as electronic engineering and software engineering

The Star Trek franchise is a multi billion dollar industry It has influenced many things in real life

Star Trek has a large following of fans who are very enthusiastic about the show They are usually called Trekkies The word was first used by Arthur W Saha when he saw people wearing fake Vulcan ears at a convention in 1967 Some fans like to be known as Trekkers instead

Two documentaries have been made about them called Trekkies and Trekkies 2

In 1976 NASA made a prototype space shuttle It was first going to be called Constitution but Star Trek fans wrote letters to NASA asking for it to be called Enterprise instead Enterprise was used for flight tests although it was never sent into space It is now displayed at the Smithsonian Institution

The movie Galaxy Quest is a Star Trek parody which means it was made to be like Star Trek in a funny way 

There have been parodies on television in the cartoons Futurama The Simpsons and Family Guy

The video games company Blizzard Entertainment puts references to Star Trek in many of its games like Starcraft and World of Warcraft

Usually episodes of Star Trek are trying to tell a moral story 

Often they ask philosophical and moral questions like in the episode Tuvix in Voyager In the story a transporter accident puts two characters Tuvok and Neelix into one body This makes a new person Tuvix who has his own personality The crew then have to decide between killing Tuvix by separating him back into Tuvok and Neelix or killing Tuvok and Neelix by letting Tuvix live In the end Captain Janeway decides to save Tuvok and Neelix but the Doctor disagrees

They also sometimes are telling a story to reflect what is happening in the real world One example is the episode A Private Little War in The Original Series This is said to be like the Vietnam War In the episode Captain Kirk has to decide if he should give guns to innocent people so they can defend themselves or let the Klingons destroy them It asks if you can fight evil without doing evil yourself

The moral points of all the Star Trek franchises often focus on what is called The Prime Directive the first law of the Federation which states that advanced civilizations should not interfere with more primitive ones so the natural developing process of the society is not changed This often presents a moral dilemma such as a ships crew being endangered because a primitive society misunderstands the nature of the more advanced civilization Also a common plot element is a conflict between the Prime Directive and what would appear to be the more ethical option of meddling to save a species from destruction

A tunnel is an underground passage Some tunnels are used for cars and others are used for trains Sometimes a tunnel is used for movement of ships Some tunnels are built for communication cables and some are built for electricity cables Other tunnels are built for animals

Tunnels are dug in different kinds of grounds from soft sand to hard rock The way of digging is chosen by the type of ground There are two additional ways of digging quarry and cut and cover In quarry the tunnel path is drilled in a horizontal way This system requires a deep tunnel thats built in a firm rock In the cut and cover system a tunnel is dug in the ground and afterwards a roof is built above the tunnel This system fits tunnels that are close to the ground like road tunnels and infrastructure

Building tunnels is a large civil engineering project that could cost very high sums of money The planning and building of a long tunnel may take many years

The Channel Tunnel between France and England is one of the longest tunnels in the world It is 50 kilometers long The longest tunnel in the world the Gotthard Base Tunnel is being dug in Switzerland

The Salvation Army is a Protestant Christian organization It was founded by William and Catherine Booth in the East End of London England in 1865 It was called the Christian Mission to start with but in 1878 the name was changed The Booths came from a Methodist tradition but today the teachings of the movement are mainstream Protestant They focus on preaching and on helping those in need They also actively help in disaster relief 

The Salvation Army operates in over 100 countries today Its members devote themselves to teaching Christian morals helping those in need like the homeless the sick the poor and others It operates facilities like shelters broken wikt linkthrift storethrift stores orphanages broken wikt linkfundraiserfundraisers and a broken wikt linkbrass bandbrass band and offers Sunday church services It is one of the largest charitable organisations in the world which means that it relies on people to give it money to use

An orphanage is an institution that takes in and cares for orphans It can also mean state of being an orphan This is when a child is an orphan

The London Underground is a system of electric trains operating in London United Kingdom It is the oldest underground railway in the world It started running in 1863 as Metropolitan Railway After the opening the system was copied in many other cities for example New York and Madrid Even though it is called the Underground about half of it is above the ground The Tube is a slang name for the London Underground because the tunnels for some of the lines are round tubes running through the ground The Underground has got 274 stations and over 408 km of track Some lines and stations were also closed after a time for example Aldwych From 2006 2007 over 1 billion passengers used the underground 

Underground train systems in other cities may be called metros or subways Subway is used in Britain to refer to underground walkways

The Metropolitan Line was the first part of the Underground to be made It was opened in 1863 It then ran between Paddington and Farringdon It took 40000 passengers per day Later it was made longer The District Line was built by a different company In 1884 the Circle Line was finished All these lines used steam engines at first

In 1890 a line using electric trains was opened It was much deeper below ground than the other lines Now it is part of the Northern Line More lines like this were opened People liked them so in 1905 the lines that used steam engines were changed to use electric trains

Because the different lines were run by different companies changing lines was difficult Between 1900 and 1902 Charles Yerkes bought most of the companies and formed a company named Underground Electric Railways of London Company Ltd short UERL

In 1933 a company was formed of all the bus tram and underground companies called London Passenger Transport Board It planned to make the network longer but the Second World War stopped this In the war some Underground stations were used as shelters against bombs

After the war more passengers used the underground Because of that they built the Victoria Line which took over many passengers The Piccadilly Line was built farther to Heathrow Airport in 1977 The Jubilee Line was opened in 1979 In 1999 the Jubilee Line was built longer to Stratford

The system uses two kinds of trains a big one and a small one The big ones are used for the rectangular tunnels the small ones for the round tunnels The underground uses trains built between 1960 and 1996

The Undergrounds trains usually drive to 270 stations

14 Stations are outside of London

Here is a list of the London Underground lines

The Underground uses zones to collect fares Zone 1 is the most central with a boundary just beyond the Circle Line and Zone 6 is the outermost and includes London Heathrow Airport Stations on the Metropolitan Line outside London are in special Zones A to D

There are ticket offices some open only in the rush hour and ticket machines which can be used at any time Some machines take coins only other touch screen machines take coins and English notes and usually give change These machines also take credit and debit cards some newer machines accept cards only

The following tickets are available from London Underground and TfL ticket offices to use on the Underground

There is also the Oyster Card a plastic card which stores credit which the owner uses to pay for Underground travel The user must charge their card at a ticket machine then touch the card on the yellow readers to pay for their journey Since its introduction in 2002 it has become very popular with regular travellers as the prices are much cheaper if you use an Oyster card

When most of the stations in the London Underground system were built disabled and wheelchair access was not considered While many above ground stations have only a few steps to the platform nearly all Underground stations have some of the systemss 410 escalators and 112 lifts Newer stations include disabled access and many older stations install disabled access when they are refurbished or rebuilt Since 2004 maps inside the trains show which stations have step free access from street level Transport for London plan to have a network of over 100 fully accessible stations by 2020 which means that 75 of Tube journeys can be made with step free access

The escalators in the London Underground system are some of the longest in Europe They run 20 hours a day 364 days a year and are used by 13000 people per hour with 95 of them running at one time

There have been relatively few accidents in the Undergrounds history Most happen if people accidentally fall onto the tracks In some stations there are pits in the middle of the track to stop people being injured if they fall onto the track Newly rebuilt parts of the system especially on the Jubilee line have platform doors These doors only open when a train stops and prevent people falling or jumping onto the tracks

In recent years refurbished and rebuilt parts of the Underground especially the Jubilee Line have had sliding platform doors installed to prevent people falling off the platform onto the tracks and discourageprevent suicides

In the 30s 70s and 90s the Underground was bombed many times by the IRA and for this reason there have been no wastebins in or around stations until very recently when clear plastic sacks were introduced in some parts of the system On 7th July 2005 there were three attacks by radical Islamic terrorists on two Circle Line trains and on one Piccadilly Line

Smoking is not allowed in any part of the underground This ban happened after a fire in Kings Cross Station in 1987

A new station is being built on the Piccadilly Line for the new Terminal 5 of Heathrow Airport The new part is called the PiccEx It has two platform station two sidings where trains can be put a ventilation shaft and two escape shafts Building of the two tunnels the ventilation shaft one escape shaft and parts of T5 station have been finished and tracks are being laid The junction between PiccEx and the Heathrow Loop is being built This work required that the tunnel between Terminal 4 and Terminals 123 could not be used until 17 September 2006 The extension opened in 2008

There are plans to extend the East London Line to the north and the southShoreditch station was closed in June 2006 and the line north of Whitechapel will run on the old Broad Street viaduct to Dalston and along the North London Line to Highbury Islington for a interchange with the Victoria Line To the south two branches are planned using railway lines that are already built The first will run to West Croydon the second to Clapham Junction 

The new stations north of Whitechapel will be

The East London Line will become a more important line and when the extension is open it will be run as part of the London Overground

The commuters of London often complain about the Underground Even newspapers especially the Evening Standard often criticises the system 

Usually the complaints are about delays overcrowding and the fares Sometimes even strikes happen among London Underground Staff

London Underground fares are now the most expensive of any rail system around the world including the luxorious Orient Express and they continue to rise at very high levels Concern has also been raised over the huge difference between oyster card fares and cash fares with the criticism that the high cash fares will discourage tourists and day visitors to London from travelling around the City

Because the underground is a very old system engineering work is often needed and often causes delays There can be other reasons as well for example signal failures or other breakdowns Customers can claim a refund if their tube journey is delayed for more than 15 minutes due to problems within the control of Transport For London 

Because many more commuters use the underground than planned overcrowding often happens This can cause stress and frustration with the underground system among commuters According to a report by MPs commuters face a daily trauma and are often forced to travel in intolerable conditions

Because so many passengers travel on the London Underground network every day strikes or industrial actions on the Underground network have a very high impact on Londons traffic and can impact on Londons economy London Underground and the rail unions claim to be under high pressure from the working public private businesses and government departments

Strike actions on the London Underground occur for a number of reasons including health and safety working conditions and pay levels There were several such strikes in the late 1970s

Democracy Now is a radio and TV program that has is entirely paid for through donations from listeners viewers and foundations and does not accept advertisers corporate underwriting or government funding It is one of the biggest independent news organizations in the United States

The Socialist Party is a Socialist political party active in England and Wales and part of the Committee for a Workers International They publish a weekly newspaper entitled The Socialist and a monthly Socialism Today As an organisation it has evolved from the Militant Tendency who in the early 1980s started to be expelled from the Labour Party for organising a mass campaign against the Poll Tax

There was a debate with the Militant Tendency as to whether or not to cease working within the Labour Party and the majority of the group decided to do so although a minority around Ted Grant broke away to form Socialist Appeal This debate ran alongside a parallel debate on the future of Scottish politics The result was that the experiment of operating as an open party was first undertaken in Scotland under the name of Scottish Militant Labour This initiative would eventually lead to the foundation of the Scottish Socialist Alliance The majority of Scottish members after forming the Scottish Socialist Party left the CWI in early 2001 as they moved away from traditional Trotskyist politics

For a while the party was known as Militant Labour In 1997 the group changed its name to the Socialist Party but the ownership of this name has been contested by the much older Socialist Party of Great Britain As a result the new party is frequently known as The Socialist Party of England and Wales In elections it has had to use the name Socialist Alternative They were one of the founders of the local Socialist Alliance groups but they left in 2001

Since ending their tenure in the Socialist Alliance the Socialist Party has run candidates in elections as Socialist Alternative Following the UK local elections 2006 it has three councillors in Coventry one in Stoke two in Lewisham South London and one in Huddersfield In February 2005 the Socialist Party announced plans to contest the 2005 parliamentary elections as part of a new electoral alliance called the Socialist Green Unity Coalition Several former components of the Socialist Alliance that did not join Respect also joined the SGUC

The Socialist Party is a smaller organisation than the Militant of the 1980s but has influence in some trade unions In 2005 23 Socialist Party members are elected members of trade union national executive committees Under the leadership of Peter Taaffe their policies have remained close to the Trotskyist mainstream Their demand for the nationalisation of the one hundred and fifty top British companies and their longstanding practice of running in elections has led some critics to label them as reformists though the party insists that their method is based on Trotskys Transitional Programme

The Socialist Party is affiliated to the Committee for a Workers International and is indeed the largest of its forty members The party participates also in the broader European Anticapitalist Left

In November 2005 at its annual Socialism event the Socialist Party formally launched the Campaign for a New Workers Party with the aim of persuading individuals campaigners and trade unions to help set up and back a new broad left alternative to New Labour that would fight for working class people The National Union of Rail Maritime and Transport Workers held a conference in January 2006 to address what it calls The crisis in working class representation in which Dave Nellist was invited to speak Most of the speakers were in favour of a broad left alternative to New Labour The remaining speakers such as MP John McDonnell wished it well 

 Socialist Teachers are a group of members of the Socialist Party in the National Union of Teachers 

It is associated with CNWP teachers and its members work with other socialists and trade union activists in the STA and CDFU

Socialist Party teacher Martin Powell Davies stood for the general secretary of the NUT in 2004 and polled 6482 first preference votes

The National Union of Teachers is the largest teachers union in the United Kingdom It has a policy of campaigning on educational issues as well as the conditions of service of its members

Socialist Party is the name of several different socialist political parties around the world These are parties who believe everyone should be equal and have the same access to products produced These include

In some cases those parties are more social democrat than socialist

Synesthesia or synaesthesia is a condition where the brain mixes up the senses People who have synesthesia are called synesthetes 

Synesthesia is usually inherited but exactly how people inherit it is unknown 

Synesthesia is sometimes reported by people using psychedelic drugs after a stroke or during an epileptic seizure It is also reported to be a result of blindness or deafness Synesthesia that comes from events unrelated to genes is called adventitious synesthesia This synesthesia results from some drugs or a stroke but not blindness or deafness It involves sound being linked to vision or touch being linked to hearing

Synesthesia was investigated a lot in the 19th and early 20th centuries but in the middle of the 20th century it was less studied Only recently has it been studied again in much detail

Some musicians and composers have a form of synesthesia that allows them to see music as colors or shapes This is called chromethesia Mozart is said to have had this form of synesthesia He said that the key of D major had a warm orangey sound to it while B flat minor was blackish A major was a rainbow of colors to him This may explain why he wrote some of his music using different colors for different music notes and why much of his music is in major keys

Another composer who had color hearing was the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin In 1907 he talked with another famous composer Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov who had synesthesia and they both found that some musical notes made them think of certain colors Scriabin worked with a man named Alexander Mozer who made a color organ

The same type of synesthesia may have different effects on different people

Synesthetes often say that they did not know their experiences were unusual until they found out that other people did not have them Others report feeling as if they had been keeping a secret their entire lives Most synesthetes consider their experiences a gifta hidden sense Most synesthetes find out in their childhood that they have synethesia Some learn to apply it in daily life and work For example they might use their gift to memorize names and telephone numbers or do mental arithmetic Many people with synesthesia use their experiences to help them be more creative for example in making drawings and music

More than 60 types of synesthesia have been reported but only a small number have been studied by scientists Some common types of synthesia include

A moose is a mammal of the deer family A male moose is called a bull a female moose is called a cow and a young moose is called a calf A group of moose is called a herd The plural of moose is moose

Moose are about 3 meters long and about 2 meters 65 feet tall Males usually weigh about 500 kilograms 1100 pounds and females weigh about 400 kilograms 880 pounds The moose has a fur coat colored between reddish brown and blackish brown In winter their fur becomes a grayish color Moose have a flap of skin hanging from their throats which is called a bell Male moose have large antlers These antlers fall off before winter In the spring the antlers grow back again Female moose do not have antlers

The moose lives across North America to northern Europe to Siberia In Europe they live in Finland Sweden Norway and the Baltic countries In north America they live in Canada Alaska and little bit USA In 2008 they have been re introduced to Scottish Highlands from Scandinavia  

Moose live in northern Europe Asia and in North America Moose usually live in areas with lakes marshes and swampsThey also live in moutains like Alaska and Canada

Finland in 2008 there were about 264000 moose in Finland

Moose are active during the day They live alone but in winter they sometimes form small groups Moose eat grass leaves twigs willow birch and maple shoots and water plants After a pregnancy of 8 months the female gives birth to 1 or 2 babies Females begin to have babies when they are 2 or 3 years old Young moose stay with their mother for a year after one year they leave and live alone Moose usually become 15 years old but they can become up to 27 years old A mother moose will aggressively protect her young Their enemies are bears and wolves who hunt moose calves

Moose have been hunted by humans for a very long time since the Stone Age

Because of their dark coloured fur Moose are sometimes hit by cars since they are hard to see when they are crossing roads at night In some countries like Canada Finland and Sweden they have a moose sign and have fences around motorways

Stanley Kubrick was an American movie director Kubrick is thought to be one of the great directors of the 20th century

He was born in New York City but he has lived most of his life in Britain His films are respected for their great amount of detail and symbolism Many of his films were very controversial when they were first shown For example the sex and violence in his film A Clockwork Orange was very disturbing to many people who saw it when it was released in 1973 The reaction to the film in the United Kingdom became so great that Stanley Kubrick stopped showing the film there for over 25 years Other famous movies that Kubrick made include Dr Strangelove or How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb 2001 A Space Odyssey and The Shining Stanley Kubrick died from a heart attack on March 7th 1999

Kubrick was born in New York City and lived there during his youth Stanley was a poor student in school but his father who was a doctor taught Stanley how to play chess and gave him a camera Kubrick finished high school in 1946 and could not get into a college This was because of his poor grades in school and because colleges were full with many American soldiers who returned from World War II that same year During this time Kubrick played games of chess with people for money He was a good chess player and won many games He used the money he won from playing chess to buy food and photography equipment Kubrick got a job at a magazine in New York City that was called Look Magazine Kubrick also enjoyed watching films and thought that he could make better films than the films that were being made at the time He first made two small documentaries One of them was about a boxer and was called Day of the Fight The other documentary was about a religious man and was called Flying Padre He then made two full length films that made other people interested in his work The first feature film was called Fear and Desire and the other was called Killers Kiss His third feature film called The Killing was a success The success of The Killing allowed Stanley to work on a bigger film called Paths of Glory that was about World War I and was made with the famous actor Kirk Douglas At this time Kubrick became well known in the film industry and had started to create his own style

After Stanley Kubrick completed Paths of Glory he tried working on a big Hollywood movie called Spartacus in 1960 about a gladiator who fights Rome The film made a lot of money and was a success but Kubrick did not enjoy working on it He did not enjoy working on it because of problems he had with the other people working on the film who controlled it Kubrick desired to have a lot of control in making his films and after making Spartacus he only worked on films that he had full control over

In the 1962 Kubrick moved to United Kingdom to make his next film Lolita He liked the United Kingdom very much and decided to live there for the rest of his life The film Lolita was the first film that Kubrick made that created a lot of controversy The film was based upon a book by the Russian author Vladimir Nabokov that was also very controversial at the time The film shows the relationship between a very young woman and an older man This is a forbidden topic in the United States and most of the world

For the film Lolita Kubrick hired the talented and famous actor Peter Sellers Kubrick respected Peters acting and asked him to act as 3 different characters in Kubricks next film Dr Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb which was released in 1963 Dr Strangelove was a comedy but it was about very serious topics These are called black comedies The film was about the Cold War and was very controversial but also very successful The film had a large cultural influence and created some images that became very famous in the years to follow The most famous image from the film was of an American pilot sitting on a nuclear bomb as it fell to earth from an airplane

Kubricks success with Dr Strangelove convinced the film studios that he was talented and that he could be trusted to make good popular films Kubrick entered into a positive relationship with the film studio Warner Brothers Warner Brothers gave him almost full artistic control on all of the films he was to make in the future A director being given so much control is rare Such directors are called auteurs

Kubrick took five years to develop and plan his next film It was a science fiction film called 2001 A Space Odyssey and it was released in 1968 Kubrick based the movie on a short story called the The Sentinel that was written by the science fiction author Arthur C Clarke Kubrick worked with Arthur C Clarke to make the film The film used many new ideas and techniques and had special effects that no other movie at the time had The great special effects used in the film won Kubrick his first and only Oscar award 2001 was made during the end of the 1960s and was very popular with members of the Hippie Counterculture This was because of the films strange and dream like visuals When the film was released it was both loved and hated by many film critics Many of the film critics who did not like the movie when they saw it in 1968 have changed their opinions Some of them have written a second positive review of the film many years later

His next film was one of his most famous and also his most controversial The film was titled A Clockwork Orange and was released in 1971 The film was darker than 2001 and was originally released with an X motion picture rating in the US The film was based on a novel of the same title by the author Anthony Burgess The novel and film are about a criminal who is given a new and experimental cure for his violent nature The story asks questions about how society defines morality The film had an amount of sex and violence that was not often seen in big Hollywood films at the time The controversy of the film increased when other people copied some of the acts that were committed by the characters in the film Kubrick and his family received violent threats from people called death threats These threats were serious enough that Kubrick took the film out of theaters in Britain The film was not shown again in Britain until the year 2000 after Kubricks death

Kubricks next film was to going to be about Napoleon but he canceled it after another similar film was released before his own Kubrick worked very hard researching and learning about Napoleon and about the world at that time Kubrick chose to make another movie set in that time that was titled Barry Lyndon The film was based a book by William Makepeace Thackeray and was about an 18th century gambler named Barry Lyndon The film was not as well liked as his previous films but like 2001 A Space Odyssey it convinced people over time

After Barry Lyndon Kubrick made films at a much slower rate than before He only made three more films in the next twenty five years He was still very popular and respected Each of the films he released became an event that many people waited for and celebrated

The Shining was Kubricks next movie It was based on the book of the same name by the American author Stephen King and was released in 1980 It was a horror film and starred Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall The film was one of Kubricks most mainstream films and was very popular It was different from the other horror films at the time and the catch phrase Heres Johnny was made very popular after Jack Nicholsons character said it during an important scene in the film The author of the book Stephen King hated the movie and did not like that Kubrick changed many things from the book King made his own version a TV mini series in 1997 which was much more like the book

Full Metal Jacket was Kubricks next film and was released in 1987 It was one of several films that were made in the 1980s that were about the Vietnam War The film was most famous for its drill instructor character played by R Lee Ermey who was very cruel to his soldiers After the film was released the United States Armed Forces changed some of its rules about how their drill instructors should behave

Eyes Wide Shut was Kubricks last film and was released in 1999 He completed editing the film just before his death in March The film starred Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman who were married to each other in real life at the time It was based on the novel Traumnovelle by the Austrian writer Arthur Schnitzler The film took over 16 consecutive months to complete and was released in July of 1999 According to R Lee Ermey of Full Metal Jacket Fame Kubrick revealed to him that he was rather disappointed with his work Kubrick supposedly went further saying that both Kidman and Cruise had their way with him Apparently a reference to a clashing of large Hollywood personas to Kubricks more reserved demeanor

Just a few days after completing the editing of Eyes Wide Shut Kubrick died from a heart attack

In the year 2001 the American film director Steven Spielberg filmed AI Artificial Intelligence AI was a film that Stanley Kubrick had worked on before Eyes Wide Shut but did not film Steven Spielberg based his film on Kubricks plans The film received a poor response from audiences and did not make as much money as expected The film was thought to be more Spielbergs film than Kubricks film

The Kyoto Protocol is a plan created by the United Nations for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that tries to reduce the effects of climate change such as global warming The plan says that countries that adopt the Kyoto Protocol have to try to reduce how much carbon dioxide they release into the air

The full name of the Kyoto Protocol is the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change It is called the Kyoto Protocol because it was made in Kyoto Japan The Kyoto Protocol was officially put into full force on February 16 2005 On February 16 Russia began to follow the Kyoto Protocol and it was decided to be put into full force As of February 2009 183 countries have agreed to follow the Kyoto Protocol who make up for more than 55 of the greenhouse gases released into our atmosphere

There are still 29 countries which have not yet adopted it Croatia and Kazakhstan have signed the treaty but have not ratified it The United States of America has signed it but said that they will not ratify it Australia has only recently ratified the Kyoto Protocol under the previous Prime Minister Kevin Rudd Both of these countries have said that the fact that China and India are using exceptions to the treaty in the name of industrialization is unfair and that they will not ratify because of this although it is believed that the US and Australia are protecting their economic interests by not ratifying The countries leaders say that changing their use of greenhouse gases will make their people lose jobs The twenty four other countries have neither signed nor ratified the treaty

To ratify is to adopt an important document or treaty that affects an entire country For example if a country decided to begin putting something like the Kyoto Protocol into force then they have just ratified it To have something ratified it must usually be agreed to be good and must go through a process

In science a physical constant is a number that does not change This is different from a mathematical constant which is not based on a real measurement

There are many physical constants in science Some famous ones are the speed of light Plancks constant the gravitational constant and Avogadros number

Some scientists think that physical constants may decrease as the universe gets older There has been no evidence to support this yet

Constants that do not have units are called fundamental physical constants

Some believe that if the physical constants were different there would be no life in the universe They say that the universe seems to be fine tuned for intelligent life

A movie director is a person who helps lead the making of a movie They take care of the artistic things in the movie They give instructions to the actors and direct the people that work on the movie

Directors give many of their responsibilities to other members of their movie making team For example the person who is responsible for the lighting is told by the director what style of lighting he wants and he then creates the lighting for him It is common for movie directors to work closely with a movie producer Movie producers are people who control the non artistic side of movie making For example they control all the money that is used for making the movie

The amount of control a director has in creating their movie is different for each director It is most common for directors to have some control while the rest of the movie making is controlled by the movie studio and by the people who pay for the movie This was very common for American movies made in the 1930s to 1950s During those years the studios used many different directors for making a single movie There are a small number of directors who are given complete control over making their movie For example Stanley Kubrick Glen Tennis Federico Fellini and Alfred Hitchcock or Tim BurtonfactdateJuly 2010 are all movie directors who had a great amount of control in making their movie

Jack Nicholson is an American actor film director producer and writer He started out as a writer and part time actor He became a star in 1969 when he landed a small part in the movie Easy Rider His other movies include Five Easy Pieces Carnal Knowledge Tommy One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest The Shining Terms of Endearment Batman Mars Attacks As Good as it Gets About Schmidt and Anger Management He has won three Oscars for As Good as it Gets One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest and Terms of Endearment He is one of the most notable fans of the Los Angeles Lakers

Autism is a life changing disorder characterized by a profound withdrawal from contact with people repetitive behavior and fear of change in the environment The emotional disorder is impacting the brains ability to receive and process information People who have autism find it difficult to act in a way that other people think is normal They find it difficult to talk to other people to look at other people and often do not like being touched by other people A person who has autism seems to be turned inwards They may talk only to themselves rock themselves backwards and forwards and laugh at their own thoughts They do not like any type of change and may find it very difficult to learn a new behavior like using a toilet or going to school 

Autism is caused by the way that the brain develops both before and after a baby is born Autism is a spectrum disorder This means that some people who have autism are only mildly affected These people may go to regular schools go to work and have partners and families Mild autism is called Asperger Syndrome or High functioning Autism Some people are more badly affected These people may be able to take care of most of their own needs at home like dressing and getting food but not be able to have a regular job or travel alone A person who has severe autism may need to be cared for all their life 

Autism seems to run in families Parents with an Autistic Spectrum Disorder often have children with Asperger Syndrome or with more severe Autism Sometimes people who have autism are broken wikt linkextraordinarilyextraordinarily broken wikt linkgiftedgifted or broken wikt linktalentedtalented These people are said to have savant syndrome They are often very good at just one thing in particular like mathematics playing the piano or remembering football scores 

About 1 2 people of every 1000 have autism

A normal baby without autism will usually look at people talking look at other peoples faces smile and be interested in other people Autistic babies though may like objects more than faces and other people They may look for a second at a face but quickly turn They may not smile or may just smile at what they are interested in

Autistic children may usually like to be by themselves without other people around They may not be interested in making friends They may also not react normally to hugging and other signs of love by their parents This does not mean that they do not love their parents they just do not know how to say it

They may also not see other peoples feelings for example they might not see much difference between whether a parent is smiling or being sad They may laugh and cry at the wrong times

An autistic child might not try to talk point or otherwise try to get a message across by 1 year of age Some do not understand their language at all Some autistic people do not speak Many are not good at talking with other people

Some autistic people spend a lot of time doing the same thing over and over again or be interested in unusual things some might spend a lot of time waving their arms around walking on their toes or putting things in order An autistic person might spend a huge amount of time putting toys in lines or patterns and may get angry if someone bumps something out of place

Some do not want any change and will do exactly the same things every day without changesuch as what they eat when they eat getting dressed brushing their teeth or going to schooland may even get upset if any change takes place to this They may also be interested in strange things and may spend all of their time learning about their interest

Autism was first named in 1943 Leo Kanner did a study of 11 children and found unusual things about them He called it early infantile autism Around the same time another doctor Hans Asperger did another study on nearly the same thing His discovery is now called Asperger syndrome while Leo Kanners discovery is called autistic disorder childhood autism infantile autism or simply autism

Italian is a language spoken by about 70 million people mostly people from Italy from which it gets its name It is the official language in Italy San Marino Vatican City Switzerland and in some cities of Slovenia and Croatia It is also used in some parts of Monaco Malta Albania Dodecaneso Eritrea Libya Ethiopia Somalia Tunisia Slovenia Croatia and some other places

It is mostly derived from Latin with some words from Greek Etruscan and elsewhere It is called an inflected language  that means that the meaning of words can be changed by changing their endings Italian nouns are either masculine or feminine

Most singular masculine nouns end in o and most plural masculine nouns end in i

Most singular feminine nouns end in a and most plural feminine nouns end in e

So

The ending of verbs are quite complicated because they depend upon the tense of the verb and on the person of the verb Because of that the personal pronoun is not compulsory

So

There are very many of these endings to learn  it is a difficult part of Italian But pronunciation is simple  there are just a few rules to learn and hardly any difficult sounds

Many Italian words have entered the English language Pizza spaghetti and ravioli are just some of the food words that we use Many technical words in music are Italian such as forte and allegro Many musical instrument names are also Italian such as cello and tuba From the darker side of Italian life we get Mafia and broken wikt linkvendettavendetta But Bravo for Italian  its a good language to learn

The RMS Titanic was a British passenger ship It was built by Harland and Wolff ship builders in Belfast for the White Star Line company 

Before it sailed many people thought it would be almost impossible for it to sink

At 1140 PM on 14 April 1912 during Titanics maiden voyage it hit an iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean The iceberg broke the Titanics hull letting water come into the ship The Titanic sank two hours and forty minutes later at 220 AM on 15 April

As it sank the Titanic split in two It killed more than 1500 people Only about 705 people survived It was one of the worst shipwrecks that was not during a war 

One reason why so many people died was because the ship did not have enough lifeboats Women and children were allowed on the lifeboats first and passengers who sailed in first class were allowed on before other passengers 

Another reason so few people survived was that the radio was off on the ship closest to the Titanic and the crew did not hear about the accident

The last survivor of the Titanic disaster to die was a lady named Millvina Dean She was the youngest passenger on board as she was then a baby of only nine weeks old She died in Ashhurst Hampshire England on 21 May 2009 aged 97

The Titanic disaster changed shipping laws It included requiring all ships to carry enough lifeboats for everyone on the ship and for ships to have someone at the radio all the time 

The wreck was discovered by a French and American team led by Robert Ballard and Jean Louis Michel on 1 September 1985 at 102 in the morning 

The story of the sinking has been made into several movies The most popular film version is a 1997 film starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio called Titanic It won 11 Academy Awards tying Ben Hur for the record for the most Academy Awards won by one movie Other movie versions of the story include the 1958 film A Night to Remember the 1953 film Titanic and the 1980 film Raise the Titanic

Steel is a mixture of several metals but most of it is iron Steel is harder and stronger than iron Steels are often iron alloys with between 002 and 17 percent carbon by weight alloys with higher carbon than this are known as cast iron Steel is different from wrought iron that has little or no carbon There are some newer steels in which carbon is replaced with other alloying materials 

Steel has a long history People in India and Sri Lanka were making steel by hand more than 1500 years ago It was very expensive and was often used to make swords and knives In the Middle Ages steel could be made only in small amounts since the processes were slow and took a long time

In the time since there have been many changes to the way steel is made In about the year 1610 steel started to be made in England and the way it was made got better and cheaper over the next 100 years Cheap steel was a help in the start of the Industrial Revolution in England and in Europe The first industrial process for making cheap steel was Bessemer process followed by Siemens Martin open hearth process Today the most common way of making steel is the basic oxygen steelmaking It uses a large turnip shaped vessel called converter Liquid raw iron called pig iron is poured in and some scrap metal is added in to balance the heat Oxygen is then blown in the iron It will burn off any remaining carbon and other impurities Then enough carbon is added in the batch to make the carbon contents as wanted The liquid steel is then tapped off It can be either cast into molds or rolled into sheets slabs beams and other so called long products such as railway tracks 

Today steel is made in huge buildings called steel mills and is most often made by machines It is a very cheap metal today and is used to make many things Steel is used to making buildings and bridges and all kinds of machines Almost all ships and cars are today made from steel When a steel object is no more usable or it is broken beyond repair it is called scrap The scrap can be melted down and re shaped into new object Steel is recyclable material that is the same steel can be used and re used

Steel is a metal alloy which includes iron and often some carbon 

Every material is made up of atoms which are very small parts Some atoms hold together quite well which is what makes some solid materials hard Something made of pure iron is softer than steel because the atoms can slip over one another If other atoms like carbon are added they are different from iron atoms and stop the iron atoms from sliding apart so easily This makes the metal stronger and harder 

Changing the amount of carbon added to steel will change those things that are interesting and useful about the metal These are called the properties of the steel Some properties are

Steel with more carbon is harder and stronger than pure iron but it also breaks more easily

These are a few of the many types of steel

There are a huge number of things that people make from steel It is one of the most common and useful metals A lot of items made from iron in the past are now made of steel Some of them are

The Luftwaffe is the name for the air force of Germany 

This was the name for the air force of Germany during the Third Reich when Adolf Hitler was in power and was also the name for the air force during the era of the Cold War when Germany was divided into two East Germany and West Germany This meant that the Luftwaffe was the air force of West Germany between 1955 and 1990 In 1990 these two countries became one country again so the Luftwaffe has been the air force of the united Germany since 1990 Luftwaffe means Air force in English

Germany first had aeroplanes in its army in 1910 four years before the start of World War I in 1914 At that time aeroplanes had no guns They were being used for reconnaissance duties that is they would fly over the battlefield to see what the enemy was doing and fly back so that the pilots could tell their generals what they knew The generals would then use that information Before aeroplanes came along balloons had been used 

During World War I Germany used a few kinds of aeroplane to fight its war such as fighters bombers and reconnaissance aeroplanes but the fighter aeroplanes became very famous because of its brave pilots The most famous German pilot of World War I was Manfred von Richthofen also known as The Red Baron 

Germany also used airships called Zeppelins They were named after Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin who had built the first airships in 1900 but he had wanted them to carry cargo and passengers not bombs He died in 1917 but people still use his name when they remember the German airships of World War I

In November 1918 the Allies or the Allied forces won the war and Germany had to sign the Treaty of Versailles It was told that it could not have any military aeroplanes at all because it was blamed for starting the war in 1914 Germany therefore had to destroy all its military aeroplanes as a punishment so until 1933 it had no air force at all

For many years Germany pretended to have no army pilots because the German army generals did not like the idea of not having any aeroplanes At first pilots would pretend to be training to become airline pilots but this was not much use because they really needed to fly fighters and bombers The Treaty of Versailles did not allow Germany to have them so Germany had to ask for help from Russia its former enemy 

In 1924 German army pilots started to fly Russian fighters and bombers at a secret training school near the Russian city of Lipetsk These pilots would then become the first ones to fly for the new German air force the Luftwaffe when Hitler said that it now existed The training school closed in 1933

In 1935 Adolf Hitler finally told the world that Germany had a new air force even if the Treaty of Versailles forbade Germany from having one Hitler therefore was defying the Allies who had won World War I but they did not do anything about this because many people still remembered the war in 1914 1918 They were frightened by the idea of war and did not want another one 

The Spanish Civil War of 1936 1939 gave the Germans the opportunity to test its new aircraft pilots and weapons in battle Hitler sent many aeroplanes and pilots over to Spain because he wanted to support a man called Franco who wanted to get rid of the Spanish government Amongst the aeroplanes were fighters called the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and dive bombers called the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka

The world now remembers one mission that the German air force carried out during the war German bombers attacked the city of Guernica in the Basque region of northeast Spain and many civilians died in the attack Many governments and people around the world were horrified by the attack The artist Pablo Picasso painted a painting called Guernica that has become very famous People see the painting as a symbol of the horror of war A copy of the painting hangs in the United Nations building in New York

The German air force was the strongest in the world when World War II broke out in September 1939 It supported the army on the ground and the aircraft were very effective at defeating all opposition since the German armed forces the Wehrmacht had practised a very new and very fast way to defeat the armies of enemies This was called Blitzkrieg or Lightning War The French and the British were prepared for a trench war It was impossible to fight back

Within a year Germany had conquered Poland Denmark Norway Luxembourg Belgium and France Britain supported the countries attacked by Germany but found herself on her own by June 1940 when Germany had conquered most of western Europe

As the war went on things began to go badly wrong for the Luftwaffe The leadership of the Luftwaffe began to become quite bad as generals were arguing about what the air force should be doing and blaming each other when the Luftwaffe was unable to stop the British from attacking German aircraft factories and other industrial targets in large numbers during the night since they had lost many planes when attacking them by day Not only that but Germany was suffering a shortage of materials needed to build the aeroplanes Things got worse for the Germans when the USA joined the war in December 1941 because the Americans brought thousands of bombers to the United Kingdom and they attacked Germany from there

Soon hundreds of American and British bombers were attacking Germany every single day both by day and by night 

Germany could not hope to win the war on the ground Since Russia was so huge the government set up factories hundreds of miles away from the fighting in order to build aeroplanes tanks guns and other weapons for the Russian Army This meant that the Russians would eventually start to push the Germans back west especially after they defeated the Germans in great battles near the city of Kursk and in the city of Stalingrad itself The Germans had failed to conquer the city of Leningrad too 

On January 1 1945 the Luftwaffe launched a desperate plan called operation Bodenplatte a dawn air attack aimed at multiple Allied air bases in Belgium Holland Over 800 German aircraft were rounded up with many veteran pilots retired from combat duty pressesd back into service 

The plan cost more than it was worth with over 280 German planes lost and 213 irreplaceble pilots killed or captured As with the fog of war over 100 German planes were shot down by their own ground fire who were not in on the plan

Germany became famous as the country which flew the first jet aeroplanes In 1944 the Luftwaffe started to use the worlds first jet fighter plane the Messerschmitt Me 262 even if the engines sometimes did not work properly Once again the shortage of the materials needed to build the plane as well as the continuing bombing of Germany meant that not as many Me 262s were built as Germany would have liked Even so Germany also built and flew the worlds first jet bomber the Arado Ar 234 the worlds first fighter plane powered by a rocket the Messerschmitt Me 163 the worlds first cruise missile the V 1 and the worlds first ballistic missile the V 2

After the war the allies were quite impressed with Germanys technical know how gleaned all they could from the vast array of Luftwaffe aircraft strewn across Germany

Once again the Allies prohibited Germany from having an air force The Russians were in the eastern half of Germany and this half became East Germany The British French and Americans were in the western half and this half became West Germany These became countries in their own right and East Germany became a Russian puppet state In case a new war started with Russia and East Germany as enemies the Western Allies finally allowed West Germany to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation an organization of western countries which wanted there to be peace throughout the world NATO allowed West Germany to have an air force because the country was right next to East Germany 

Germany used military aircraft in war for the first time since 1945 when they supported British aircraft in the war in Kosovo in 1999 but many people still believed that Germany should never again go to war because of what had happened in the two world wars

This article is a simplified version based on the one about the Luftwaffe in the English Wikipedia A list of books about the Luftwaffe and about military aviation in general is there

A mathematical equation is a formula containing an equals sign with a mathematical expression on each side of it The equals sign says that both sides are exactly the same

There are two kinds of mathematical equations

The second kind is often used to solve problems in which you have to know the value of some variables For example if 2x 8 x 8 2 4

The second kind of equation is used in algebra For example to solve the equation 2x 8 by finding x you would follow an algebraic rule Then you can work out that x 4

The word vegetable can also be used to mean plants in general such as when people say Animal Vegetable or Mineral

However in an Asian context vegetable may mean any plant produce apart from grain and nuts that is consumed cooked while only the fruits consumed raw are considered as fruits in that sense For example a pumpkin is therefore considered a vegetable while a melon qualifies as a fruit

An engine or motor is a machine used to change energy into movement that can be used The energy can be in any form Common forms of energy used in engines are electricity chemical or heat When a chemical is used to produce energy it is known as fuel

Early kinds of engine used heat that was outside of the engine itself to heat up a gas to a high pressure This was usually steam and the engines are called steam engines The steam was piped to the engine where it pushed on pistons to bring about motion These engines were commonly used in old factories boats and trains

Most cars use a chemical engine that burns fuel inside it This is called an internal combustion engine There are many different types of internal combustion engine They can be grouped by fuel cycle and configuration

Common fuel types for internal combustion engines are petrol diesel autogas and alcohol There are many other types of fuels

There are 3 different types of cycle 2 stroke engine cylinders produce power once every turn of the engine 4 stroke engines cylinders make power once every two turns of the engine 6 stroke engines cylinders make power twice in every six turns of the engine 

There are lots of different configurations of piston engines Lots have cylinders with pistons in them and a crankshaft Any number of cylinders can be used but 1 2 3 4 6 8 10 and 12 are common The cylinders can be arranged in many ways in a straight line at an angle to each other or in a circle

A Rotary engine has no cylinders and uses a triangle shaped rotor spinning in an oval housing which mimics the movement of a piston 

Hot gas can also be made to push a turbine around rather like the way the wind turns a windmill The first turbines used jets of steam Later fuel was burnt and the hot gasses drove the turbine Jet engines used in aircraft are a kind of turbine engine

A rocket causes movement by shooting jets of gas very fast out of a nozzle The gas may have been stored under pressure or be a chemical fuel that burns to make a very hot gas Although they are very simple rockets are the most powerful engines we know how to make They will work in space where there is nothing to push against

Electric motors do not use a fuel The energy is supplied to them by electricity carried along a pair of wires The energy may come from a fuel being burnt somewhere else a long way off The electricity is used to make powerful magnets inside the motor switch on and off at the right time to turn the shaft of the motor

Steam is the name given to water when it is a gas Steam is a form of water vapour Steam is sometimes seen as a string of cloudy translucent mist But that is only the result of the steam condensing on the surface of dust in the air which means the steam that you touch would not be very hot The steam that is really 100 degrees Celsius is invisible 

When the pressure of the atmosphere is 1013 mbar water will boil at 100 degrees Celsius

100 degrees Celsius is the same temperature as 212 degrees Fahrenheit 80 degrees Raumur and 37315 Kelvin

In the German reunification the GDR joined West Germany by ratifying its constitution in 1990 The East German districts were reorganised into the Lnder and joined West Germany after which the GDR ceased to exist

Even though the western and the eastern part joined back together in 1990 people from former West Germany still call people from East Germany Ossi This comes from the German word Osten which means East Ossi is not always meant kindly

Workers began to build the Tower Bridge in April 1886 and the bridge was opened in 30 June 1894 When they finished building the bridge Tower Bridge was the largest bascule bridge yet built Bascule is the French word for a see saw The bascules are the surfaces raised to allow tall ships to pass through this happens about 900 times per year The bridges deck can be raised to 83o from the horizontal Tower Bridge is the worlds most famous and recognisable bascule bridge so the bridge is one of Londons most famous sights

The City of London Corporation held a competition for the design in 1876 Over 50 designs were entered and in 1884 Horace Jones and John Wolfe Barrys design was chosen The bridge is 800 feet in length with two towers each 213 feet high built on piers The central span of 200 feet between the towers is split into two equal bascules or leaves which can be raised to an angle of 83o to allow river traffic to pass The bascules weighing over 1100 tons each are counterbalanced to minimize the force required and allow raising in five minutes The bascules are raised by huge hydraulic pumps which were first powered by steam engines In 1976 these were replaced by oil and electricity The bridge is made from more than 11000 tons of steel and covered with Cornish granite and Portland stone HI

The two side spans are suspension bridges each convert270ftm0 long with the suspension rods anchored both at the abutments and through rods contained within the bridges upper walkways The pedestrian walkways are convert143ftm0 above the river at high tide These walkways allow people to still cross the river even when the bridge is raised They were closed in 1910 because not enough people used them but were reopened in 1982

A variable is a special type of amount or quantity which can change its value They are often used in programming computers or in mathematical equations

A number such as 5 or 200 cannot change its value For example if a person stands 5 feet away from a building the distance variable compared to the building does not change over time 5 feet is called a fixed amount which is the opposite of a variable amount

But if a person walks away from the building the distance variable compared to the building is increasing So it does not have the same value and we can not use the same number for it as the distance might be 1 foot now but 2 feet a second later In mathematics a variable is usually given a letter such as x or y

In some equations variables are used to show numbers that are unknown Using a type of math called algebra one can find the value of the variable

In computer science a variable does not have to be a numberit may be a string value or a date or an amount of money or even an object such as a picture

Salvador Allende Gossens was a physician senator minister of health and the President of Chile from November 3 1970 until his death on September 11 1973

Allende was born on June 26 1908 in the port city of Valparaiso Chile to a well to do family Like many Chileans Allende had a mestizo racial background his father Salvador Allende a lawyer was of Basque background and his mother Laura Gossens had a Belgian Jewish background

In 1918 his father sent Allende to study at the Instituto Nacional in Santiago He then did his compulsory military service and entered the University of Chile to study medicine Allende was a gifted friendly and popular student a great debater and public speaker and quickly becomes a student leader and vice president of the FECH As an undergraduate student Allende requested to his parents to let him earn his own livelihood and he started to work as a paramedic in the ambulance services and as an assistant in pathology He graduated with a medical degree in 1933

He was one of the founders of the Socialist Party of Chile and in 1938 became a minister of health He was a senator from 1945 until 1969 and was President of the Chilean Senate from 1966 until 1969

Allende first ran for the presidency in the 1952 elections but failed Determined to succeed he tried again in 1958 and then in 1964 In both instances he failed again Allende would tour Chile from Iquique to Magallanes for example one end to the other speaking to peasants in the south and miners in the north and held rallies in the big cities Allende found it hard to win an election because of the successful scare campaigns launched by opposing parties many financed by large multi national corporations and powerful national institutions such as private banks and schools

Finally and to the surprise of many working people  who had voted for him in previous elections and felt he would never win  in 1970 he won and became the President of Chile

Allende always ran for election on the same socialist platform proposing the same resolutions focusing on the persistent inequality in the country and the underdevelopment which Allende saw as being rooted in the lack of control the Chilean people had over their natural resources and vital industries

Allende promised that he would nationalize vital industries and then create an advanced public health system and educational system that would be free and accessible to all During the cold war many people feared that Chile would fall under the influence of the USSR and after the 1960s under the influence of Cuba

Allendes speeches were said to be very radical and Allendes vision for Chile seemed completely different to the Chile that most people were familiar with For example Allende was said to be an atheist and Marxist He was a non practicing Catholic This was considered odd in a country that was very catholic held traditional family values and in which people were taught that political freedoms was more important than solving problems such as extreme poverty or economic inequality

Allende also wanted revolutionary change ie he wanted deep changes to Chilean society very quickly such forms of changes have been said to have tended to cause great divisions in society between those who oppose the changes and those who support the drastic changes Through history such situations tend to end up resolved violently For example civil war or military coup

As a result many Chileans especially professionals like University professors doctors and business people left the countrythis had a negative effect on Allendes reforms Eg Allende increased health services and places at Universities for the underprivileged while many professors specialists and doctors were leaving the country

However Allende was unique in that he did all he could to prevent this sort of violence calling his revolution a peaceful one within democracy or calling it the Chilean road to socialism In 1973 Allendes enemies accused him of preparing a secret war and that his supporters were hoarding stocks of illegal weapons that were being sent from communist Cuba To prove that this was not true Allende allowed the Chilean Army to enforce a weapons controls law that allowed the Chilean military to search and comb for any illegal weapons anywhere in the country The Chilean army confirmed that after thoroughly searching for such weapons throughout the country they had found no significant stocks as the opposition was claiming This ended up creating more support for Allende and allowed Allende to begin to focus on the upcoming election

Allende came to power with a socialist plan His vision for Chile was one in which the countrys resources and wealth would be owned by Chileans and distributed more democratically Allende started his program by nationalizing major industries Such as Chiles copper mines but these mines were not owned by Chileans but by very powerful US business people

This created a serious problem with the US government who saw Allendes nationalisation as an attack on US interest and a threat to US money investments in South America

The American Central Intelligence Agency was said to be involved in the overthrowing of his government Allende was a socialist Many of his reforms and programs revolved around socialism He created universal health care for all made education better and took a stronger level of control within the economy He died in 1973 His death has been disputed for years some feel that he took his own life by committing suicide but others feel that he was murdered by Augusto Pinochets militia Pinochet would then become the ruler of Chile

Allende was replaced by those who bombed him out of his post as president The new ruling Junta justified their coup claiming that Chile could no longer tolerate the cancer of Marxism The Pinochet regime claimed Allende had violated the Chilean Constitutionstrange considering that Pinochet ended up writing a completely new one

Also after the coup many rumors and myths emerged about Allendes death and life Many of these myths attempted to discredit the character of Allende ie make him appear as a coward weak or cruel person

Authority is the ability of a person or an organization to conduct a certain lifestyle for another person or a group Authority is known as one of the basis of society and stands against cooperation Adopting lifestyle patterns as a result of authority is called obedience and authority as a concept includes most leadership cases

Although authority is usually described as a human description theres also reference for authorities which are not human such as godly authorities and traditional authorities

Authority exists by virtue of a certain social power This power might be materialistic or fictitious The power exists because of the possible use of sanction An action who harms a person whos not obeying the authority or threatening it in order to conduct a social power

Authority may exists in a direct way by virtue of an actual power which is called forcing or by legitimization that the subject gives to the authority In most cases both types exist

Only a few authorities are based on physical power most of them are based on an organizational authority system In this way the authoritys ability to act depends on her existence

For example the authority of a state leader takes part when theres some sort of a police that punishes individuals that do not obey him The policeman are subordinated to the leader and his rules because theire also under the police threat If all citizens of the state choose to denay the leader and his rules the authority will be lost but the very fact that the authority semi exists allowes it to be full 

Obedience as said is the sign that means authority is being enforced While obedience is the law disobedience and crime are violation and resistance to the authority 

Theoretically violation of the authority drags with it a sanction thats given by the authority owner The severity of the sanction and the threat it presents are based on the particular social situation on the balance of power on the local norms and so on

Many people criticize people in authority and some even criticize the existence of authority Anarchism is a philosophy that opposes all forms of authority

A translator reads something written in one language and speaks it or writes it in another language For example they could read a book in French and then translate it into English See translation for more information In order to convert meanings from one language into another one translators must be able to know deeply about the target culture so that they are effective in conveying the original meaning of the source text or material As a result translators do not only convert words what makes it deeper than a science but an art Translation is a complex activity mainly because to interact and to communicate between languages require more than fluency in the source and the target languages but flexibility between them in an effective way for a specific audience or special readers It is a sort of occupation and career that is mainly based on research and great skills for languages

Birth control or contraception is a way to allow a man and woman to have sexual intercourse while reducing the chance that it will cause a pregnancy Some of the contraceptives available can also protect a person from sexually transmitted diseases

When people practice contraception to prevent STDs and pregnancy sometimes it is called safe sex

Birth control is also sometimes called family planning This is because it means that people have babies and make their families when they plan for it This means that babies and families do not happen by accident

Birth control lets a man and woman have intercourse but makes pregnancy less likely 

People may use birth control for several reasons Perhaps a man and woman wish to have only a few children so they will have enough money to give those children good food clothes and education More children might mean less for each child so the parents use birth control to limit the number of children they have Or maybe a man and woman do not want any children at all in order to focus on their own lives jobs or each other Other couples may use birth control to make sure that they do not have too many children in too short a time an idea that is called spacing their children This may help them take better care of their children Still another reason is that a young couple may not be able to afford having a baby until they are older and have more money or better jobs This may be especially true of younger people who are still in school and probably not married By using birth control the couple can grow closer and strengthen their relationship by having sexual intercourse frequently so that when they are ready to have a baby their relationship is strong and stable But in all of these cases the man and woman want to have sex to be close to feel good with each other and to make their relationship stronger Contraception lets them have intercourse while greatly reducing the chances of a pregnancy

Birth control may be used by married couples or by couples who live together but are not married or by a man and woman who are engaged or by a couple who are merely boyfriend and girlfriend or even by single people who are not in a relationship at all but who may have casual sex with others

There are many types of birth control Some of these have been done for a long time but many of them were only discovered in the last eighty years Each type of birth control has advantages and disadvantages

Another word for a type of contraception is a method

A barrier is something that stands between two things So barrier methods stand between the sperm and the ovum Some barrier methods help prevent many sexually transmitted diseases

Some barrier methods only protect a small amount against STDs

Barrier methods can be easy to use and have few side effects Some of them can be bought without a doctors prescription But sometimes they can be messy or interfere with the pleasure and sensation of sex

These can only be used by women Doctors are trying to find a way to use hormonal methods for men Hormonal methods change the womans reproductive cycle in different ways so that it is safe for her man to ejaculate inside her

Implants and injections are very good for younger women or women who cannot take a pill every day

Hormonal birth control tends to be extremely effective if it is used in the right way Many hormonal birth control methods also make womens menses shorter and with less bleeding which most women like And unlike barrier methods hormonal methods do not interfere with sex When a woman is using hormonal birth control she and her man are usually not even aware of it during intercourse which seems and feels very natural For all of these reasons hormonal methods are very popular 

But all hormonal birth control methods have some risks for side effects They can make a very small increase in the risk of blood clots in the lungs strokes heart attacks and breast cancer Most of these risk are small Also hormonal methods do not prevent STDs

This is where an object is put in the womans uterus This object is called an intrauterine device or IUD

There are 2 types of IUD The copper IUD or IUD with hormones implanted on it The hormonal IUD has better protection against pregnancy but does cost more

IUDs are the most common birth control method used in the world They have many good things about them

The worst part about IUDs is that they have to be put in by a doctor There is some risk of infection of the uterus after the IUD is put in but this is only for 1 2 months after

IUDs can also be used as a day after method to prevent pregnancy after the woman and man already had sex

IUDs do not prevent STDs

This is when a man or woman has surgery to make them not able to make babies

Men can get a vasectomy This is a small surgery where the tube that carries sperm from the testicles is cut

Women can get tubal surgeries These are ways that the fallopian tubes are cut or clipped so that eggs cannot go down them to the uterus

Sterilization is extremely effective and they allow a man and woman to have intercourse that seems and feels very natural But sterilization does involve surgery which can cost more than other types of contraception and can be unpleasant and unlike other methods it is very hard to reverse if a couple changes their minds and want to have children later

Other surgeries will make a woman sterile These are not done only for contraception but they are done for other reasons 

These have been used for a very long time They were used before modern medicine Some of them were used before scientists even discovered how reproduction happens

Many methods can reduce the risk of STDs but only abstinence is 100 effective

This means a man and a woman practice abstinence when the woman is fertile When the woman is not fertile she will not get pregnant when she has sex

This is when a woman is breastfeeding There are certain rules the woman can use to know if she is not fertile Chances that this method will fail are about 10

Induced abortion is when a doctor gives a pregnant woman a medicine or does a surgery to stop the pregnancy Some people do not call abortion a kind of contraception This is because contraception means preventing pregnancy but abortion is stopping a pregnancy that has already started

Abortion is not a good birth control method If a woman does not want to get pregnant other methods are more safe and inexpensive So many doctors who do abortions for women help women find a better way to not get pregnant the next time

Some religions do not like contraception Some of them teach that contraception is a sin

Religions ideas about contraception

Religious beliefs that contraception is a sin also keep people from doing safe sex Some groups who are opposed to this belief say it is dangerous in places where there is a lot of HIV and AIDS because condoms make people much less likely to get HIV but at the same times many feel that they can practice extra marital sex since they are safe from HIVAIDS

These may be unsimple

A role playing game is a game in which one plays the role of one or several characters either verbally in a computer or video game or alone Often the characters gain experience during the game which makes them stronger

Role Playing Game used to be the name for pre computer games In this type of RPG players assume the role of a fantasy character and play in a made up world that most of the time is controlled by a Dungeon Master The DM is a person that tells the games story to the players tells them where they are in the game world and plays the part of all the Non Player Characters and monsters that the players meet 

The DM will also give quests or tasks for the characters to complete Characters usually have special skills that limit their actions such as strength or speed and as the character completes the quests he or she is awarded experience with which he or she can go up to higher levels 

Most RPGs use dice rolls when a player tries to do something hard in the game This means that there is luck in the game as well as skill

A short example

 DM You enter a small room It is wet and mouldy You hear water dripping from somewhere You see a small shaking pile of gray jelly in the middle of the room

Player I touch the pile with the tip of my sword

DM Roll a 20 sided die

DM Critical miss The jelly moves up your sword and chokes you You are dead 

Good DMs balance challenges and rewards giving the players the chance to recover from mistakes but at the same time providing consequences for the players actions

There are also computer and videogame RPGs where the player controls one or more characters A good example is the Final Fantasy series of games Just like the pre computer RPGs the characters in the games level up when they get EXP They also usually contain a main quest which cannot be completed without completing smaller side quests These computer RPGs are easier to play because they only need one person but they also lack the freedom of the older games where new quests can be made up whenever you want MMORPGs are computer games where many players meet online in one large game world and go on quests together Some examples of these games are World of Warcraft Everquest or Runescape

Text Based RPGs are not too different from Traditional RPGs generally based on the Dungeons and Dragons game However some Text Based RPGs are not for combat but are for socializing and meeting others With many Text Based RPGs you need a client a program to send what you say to the server which can be located in another country Many clients are basic and display text in one colour but there are others that use colours enhancing the readability of the content See MU for more details

In LARP the people play their characters themselves much like a play They act out the things their character does dress like their character and often talk in the way their character would

Irrigation is when people add water to plants to help them grow when there is not enough rain Irrigation water can be pumped from rivers natural lakes or lakes created by dams from wells or allowed to flow to the fields by the force of gravity along pipes or open canals

Irrigation water can be applied to the plants from above by sprinklers that throw water out under pressure or from watering cans In sprinkler irrigation water is moved through pipes to sprinklers scattered around and within the field Center pivot irrigation is a type of sprinkler irrigation In drip irrigation water is brought to the plants via pipes having small holes or special emitters spaced along the pipe Surface methods allow water to flow onto the soil surface from canals or pipes Traditional methods allow water to flow over the entire surface of the field but drip irrigation allows water to be directed to the roots of each individual plant and much less water is lost by infiltration to the ground 

Sub surface irrigation raises the water table artificially so that it can be accessed by the roots of the crop and less water is lost to evaporation

Irrigation can increase the crop yield or make it possible for a crop to grow in a dry period The technology is usually expensive and care should be taken to ensure that the benefits from increased crop yields are not exceeded by the installation and operating costs of the irrigation scheme

Irrigation causes a subsequent rise in watertables which raises saline water to the surface This saline water can accumulate to the extent where the salinity is too high for aquatic life and vegetation to survive in

War Communism was introduced for many reasons However the most important ones were that 

It was bad for the Russian economy because the government took away extra grain produced by the peasants This was known as grain requisitioning Peasants were not allowed to sell their extra food so they stopped producing more than they needed to eat Because of this Russia ended up with millions of people who did not have any food and starved

Hydroelectricity is electricity that is made by the movement of water It is usually made with dams that block a river or collect water that is pumped there When the water is let go the huge pressure behind the dam forces the water down shafts that lead to a turbine this causes the turbine to turn and electricity is produced It is a form of renewable energy and reduces pollution

The way the electricity is produced does not harm the environment as much as fossil fuels like oil or coal Hydroelectricity is very powerful safe and produces no waste Hydroelectricity can be made very quickly This makes it useful for times when demand for electricity is high Water that has been stored in a dam can be let go when needed so the energy needed can be made quickly Also hydroelectricity can not run out as long as there is a good water supply Once the dam is built the electricity is free no waste or pollution produced and electricity can be generated constantly also there is then a lot of extra energy to save and use

The building of large dams to hold the water can damage the environment In 1983 Australian government stopped the Tasmanian state government from building a dam on the Gordon River in Tasmania after a huge public protest The dam would have flooded the beautiful Franklin River The Three Gorges Dam in China will be the worlds largest hydroelectricity project The dam has flooded a huge area meaning that 12 million people have had to be moved Scientists are concerned about many problems with the dam such as pollution silt and the danger of the dam wall breaking

The mind is the part of a person that thinks reasons perceives wills and feels Certain religions say that the mind is separate from the body and is called a soul Others believe that the mind is just a different way of describing certain parts of the human brain

Many people argue about what makes up the mind Some say that only reason and memory are part of the mind because they are conscious In this view the emotions like love hate fear and joy are different from the mind Some people with this view say the emotions are part of the heart Others argue that our rational and emotional states cannot be separated and should all be part of what we call the mind

People often use mind to mean the same as thought the way we talk to ourselves inside our heads This is where the sayings make up our minds change our minds and of two minds come from One of the important things of the mind in this sense is that it is private No one else can know our mind

The original meaning of the Old English gemynd was memory This explains the sayings call to mind come to mind keep in mind to have mind of and so on Old English had other words to express what we call mind today such as broken wikt linkhygehyge mind spirit The word mind gradually grew to mean all conscious thought over the 14th and 15th centuries

Thought is when we absorb what happens around us so that we can deal with it effectively according to our plans and desires Thinking is using information like forming concepts problem solving reasoning and making choices

Memory is when we store information in our minds and can later recall it

Imagination is the ability to invent worlds inside the mind complete or not The mind makes these by drawing on experience in the shared world

Consciousness is knowing that we exist and the world exists and being able to understand what happens around us

Just like the body a mind can be healthy The measure of this is called mental health According to the World Health Organization there is not one way to measure mental health in all people because there are many things in our surroundings that might make what is mentally healthier different from one person to another In general most experts agree that mental health and mental illness are not opposites In other words not having a mental illness does not mean you are in good mental health

One way to think about mental health is by looking at how well a person lives Signs of mental health include feeling capable and happy being able to handle normal levels of stress making and keeping friends and leading an independent life and being able to recover from difficult situations

Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind and how it is linked to the body The main problem is how the mind is related to the body but there are also questions about the nature of the mind that do not talk about its relation to the physical body

Dualism and monism are the two main ways people try to solve the mind body problem Dualism is when people believe that that mind and body are in some way separate from each other It can be traced back to Plato Aristotle and the Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy but it was most precisely formulated by Ren Descartes in the 17th century 

Monism is the belief that mind and body are not physiologically and ontologically distinct kinds of entities This view was first seen in Western philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th century BC and was later held by the 17th century rationalist Baruch Spinoza According to Spinozas dual aspect theory mind and body are two parts of a larger being Idealists think that the mind is all that exists and that the outside world is actually made up by the mind Physicalists think that everything can be expressed by what is physical Neutral monists believe that everything can be either mental or physical depending how you see it For example a red spot on a wall is physical because it is an actual thing depending on the physical wall but it is mental because our brain responds to the colour The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been different kinds of physicalism these positions include behaviorism the type identity theory anomalous monism and functionalism

Psychology is the study of the way we think feel and act It involves the scientific study of processes such as perception cognition feelings personality as well as things around us that might affect the way we think From this study psychologists try to form rules for why we act the way we do Psychology also includes using this knowledge to help solve problems of everyday life and treat mental health problems

Social psychology is the study of how we think feel and act in groups of other people Most people who study social psychology are either psychologists or sociologists

Reality is a noun referring to anything that is real An event that has actually happened or a noun that really exists is said to have reality Something close to reality is realistic meaning it looks real but it is animated or inorganic

Television programs that are not scripted are called Reality TV

Descartes is a foundation of western schools

In this view real is an object of objective reality

Objective reality is defined by supporters of Descartes view such as scientists and many other western belief schools such as western mass media

In this view real is what is agreed on by a group of persons

In Example

Generally a person will agree a thing is fact if they know or have past experience with the thing

Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley was an author best known for writing the novel Frankenstein She was in her teens when she wrote the book that is now a classic

Mary Shelley was born on August 30 1797 in London England She was the second daughter in her family Her parents were Mary Wollstonecraft a feminist and William Godwin a philosopher Her mother died in childbirth Her father was quick to marry again Mary got a great education something most girls did not have at the time

During May of 1816 Mary and her future husband Percy Bysshe Shelley traveled to Lake Geneva to spend summer near the famous poet Lord Byron In terms of English literature it was a great summer Percy began work on Hymn To Intellectual Beauty and Mont Blanc At the same time Mary was inspired to write her classic work

One evening the group of young writers decided to have a contest telling horror stories Another guest Dr John Polidori came up with The Vampyre later a strong influence on Bram Stokers Dracula Other guests told scary stories but Mary could not think of one But that night she dreamt of the story she had wanted to tell She wrote it down and in time her story would be published as Frankenstein and it became more successful than any of the other writings produced that summer

Mary had a number of different sources for her work one was the Promethean myth from Ovid The influence of John Miltons Paradise Lost is also clearly seen in the novel Also both Shelleys had read William Beckfords Vathek

Mary and Percy were both vegetarians and strong advocates for animal rights One can see references to vegetarianism in her writing For example in her novel Frankenstein the monster was a vegetarian

Returning to England in September of 1816 Mary and Shelley were stunned by two family suicides in quick succession First in November Marys older half sister Fanny Imlay left the Godwin home and took her own life at a distant inn Only weeks later Shelleys first wife drowned herself in Londons Hyde Park Discarded and pregnant she had not welcomed Shelleys invitation to join Mary and himself in their new household

Shortly after Harriets death Shelley and Mary were married now with Godwins blessing Their attempts to gain custody of Shelleys two children by Harriet failed but their writing careers enjoyed more success when in the spring of 1817 Mary finished Frankenstein

Mary had two sons and a daughter The daughter died in infancy and the elder son when he was two

Mary Shelley died of brain cancer on February 1 1851 in London and was buried at St Peters Churchyard in Bournemouth in the English county of Dorset

Three films have shown Mary Shelley and the basic idea of the Frankenstein story in 1816 Gothic directed by Ken Russell Haunted Summer directed by Ivan Passer and Remando al viento directed by Gonzalo Surez

Mandela was born in the Transkei region of South Africa He was one of thirteen children After his father died when Nelson was 9 years old he lived with the local regent who sent him to school Nelson Mandela was the first member of his family to go to a school where his teacher Miss Mdingane gave him the English name Nelson After he left Fort Hare University in 1941 he went to Johannesburg 

In 1944 Mandela helped start the African National Congress Youth League He was soon a leader in the group The government saw him as a threat to their policy of apartheid and they made it very hard for him to keep leading He was put in jail for this in 1962 In 1990 he was let out of prison after 27 years He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 together with former President Frederik Willem de Klerk Nelson Mandela was the president of South Africa from 10 May 1994 until 1999 He was considered one of South Africas greatest leaders of all time and is respected around the world

He wanted to free South Africa without violence but when the government started killing and hurting protesters he started Umkhonto we Sizwe with Walter Sisulu and other people in the African National Congress He admires Mahatma Gandhi and follows many of his teachings 

Mandela is considered a hero in South Africa and in most of the world because he helped end apartheid He also helped racial equality begin in South Africa

When he won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 he said We stand here today as nothing more than a representative of the millions of our people who dared to rise up against a social system whose very essence is war violence racism oppression repression and the impoverishment of an entire people 

Don Quixote is a novel by Miguel de Cervantes The book published in two parts is considered to be the first modern novel It was first written in Spanish and soon afterwards was translated to English by Thomas Shelton

It is about Alonso Quijana a rich middle aged man Quijana having read many tales about chivalry and knights goes crazy and believes that he is a knight named Don Quixote He rides around the country with his squire Sancho having adventures He believes his adventures are real but everyone else laughs at him

One of the most famous stories in the book is Don Quixotes fight with the windmills He sees some windmills and thinks they are giants When he rides to fight with them he is knocked off his horse Sancho tells him they are only windmills but Don Quixote does not believe him He is sure a magician changed the giants into windmills to hurt him

For living creatures a swim or swimming is a way of moving in water Swimming is an activity that can be both useful and recreational Its primary uses are bathing cooling fishing recreation exercise and sport

Swimming has been known amongst humans since prehistoric times the earliest record of swimming dates back to Stone Age from around 7000 years ago Competitive swimming started in Europe around 1800 and was part of the first modern 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens though not in a form comparable to the contemporary events It was not until 1908 that regulations were implemented by the International Swimming Federation to produce competitive swimming

Archimedes was a Greek scientist He was an inventor an astronomer and a mathematician He was born in the town of Syracuse in Sicily in what is now Italy He was very famous during his life and he may be one of the most clever people who have ever lived He is now said to be one of the most important scientists and the greatest mathematician of the ancient world 

His father was Phidias an astronomer and he may have been in the family of a king of Syracuse Syracuse was a rich Greek city on the sea shore in Sicily When Archimedes was about ten years old he left Syracuse to study in Alexandria in Egypt in the school of Euclid who was a famous mathematician Not much is known about the personal life of Archimedes for example whether he was married or if he had children

There are many stories told about Archimedes Some of them may be true but many of them may be untrue or only partly true 

The best known saying of Archimedes was that if he was given a long enough lever and a place to stand he could move the world This is meant to show the power of the lever The lever is perhaps the simplest machine and can help a person to do more work than they would otherwise be able to do Archimedes was not the first person to use a lever but he did write about how it worked and what could be done to make it work better

Another Archimedes story is that King Hiero II thought his crown was not pure gold Archimedes proved that the crown was made from gold mixed with silver The value of gold was more than that of silver so the king was deceived Archimedes was in a bath and thought about what happens when an item is put into water He found out that different things with the same weight move out different amounts of water This is called water displacement and the different metals have different density When he had this idea he jumped out of the bath and ran with no clothes on through the streets of the town shouting Eureka  which means I have found it

Archimedes is also well known for being the first person to understand statics which is a part of the study of physics and is to do with loads that do not move for example in buildings or bridges He also understood and wrote about what happens when things float in liquids which is called buoyancy He discovered that is found out how many things work and wrote down the new rules and laws that he found 

Archimedes principle that the weight of water displaced by an object equals the amount of buoyancy it gets has practical uses It can be used to measure the density of an object and hence whether or not it is made of gold It is said the King of Syracuse offered a reward to whomever could do that and that it was won by Archimedes

Archimedes is also famous as an inventor because he made new tools and machines For example he made a machine to lift water that could be used by farmers to bring water to their crops This is still called the Archimedes Screw 

Archimedes probably also invented a machine to measure distance an odometer A cart was built with wheels that turned four hundred times in one mile A pin on the wheel would hit a 400 tooth gear so it turned once for every mile This gear would then make a small stone fall into a cup At the end of a journey one could count the number of stones in the cup to find the distance

Archimedes also made a machine by which one person could pull a large ship with just one rope This was the compound pulley This is an important machine even today as it helps people in everyday life although the versions we now use are much more complicated They still have the same integral structure though

He also invented or made many machines used in war for example he made better catapults This was during the Punic Wars which were between Rome in what is now Italy and the city of Carthage in what is now North Africa For many years he helped stop the Roman army from attacking Syracuse his city One war machine was called the claw of Archimedes or the iron hand It was used to defend the city from attacks by ships Ancient writers said that it was a kind of crane with a hook that lifted ships out of the water and caused their destruction 

Another story about Archimedes is that he burned Roman ships from far away using many mirrors and the light from the sun This is perhaps possible but it is perhaps more likely that this was done with flaming missiles from a catapult

After many years the Roman army took the city of Syracuse One of the soldiers killed Archimedes who was then an old man The soldiers had perhaps been told to catch Archimedes alive so it may have been a mistake The story is that Archimedes was killed while drawing a mathematical diagram in the sand He was so busy with his drawing that he did not see the soldier behind him His famous last words were Dont disturb my circles

Archimedes is thought to be so important as a mathematician that scientists have honoured him

Radio is a way to send electromagnetic signals over a long distance to deliver information from one place to another A machine that sends radio signals is called a transmitter while a machine that picks up the signals is called a receiver When radio signals are sent out to many receivers at the same time it is called a broadcast

Television also uses radio signals to send pictures and sound Radio signals can start engines moving so that gates open on their own from a distance Radio signals can be used to lock and unlock the doors in a car from a distance

Sound can be sent by radio either through Frequency Modulation or Amplitude Modulation

Many people believe that an Italian man named Guglielmo Marconi invented radio because he was the first person to send radio waves Howeverengineer Nikola Tesla made the first practical radio that sent audio signals

Radio was first created as a way to send messages between two people but it is now used to listen to music news and Entertainers This is known as talk radio Radio shows were used before there were TV programs In the 1930s the US President started sending a message about the country every week to the American people Companies that make and send radio programming are called radio stations These are sometimes run by governments and sometimes by private companies who make money by sending advertisements during the programme Other radio stations are run independent and supported by local communities These are called community radio stations In the early days manufacturing companies would pay to send complete programmes by radio These were often plays or dramas Because companies who made soap often paid for plays and dramas these were called soap operas

Radio can still be used to send messages between people Talking to someone with a radio is different than talk radio Citizens band radio amateur radio use radio Policemen firemen and other people who help in times of trouble use radio to communicate It is like a mobile phone but the distance two people can talk between is shorter and both people must have a radio which can send messages There is no cost when someone buys the machine so it is used when often sending messages often between two places like a policeman and his office

Television waves and radio waves have lower frequencies and longer wavelengths than microwaves They are used to transmit television and radio programmes Television uses higher frequencies than radio

A radio programme receiver does not need to be directly in view of the transmitter to receive programme signals For low frequency radio waves diffraction can allow them to be received behind hills although repeater stations are often used to improve the quality of the signals 

The lowest frequency radio waves are also reflected from an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere called the Ionosphere This means that they can reach receivers that are not in the line of sight because of the curvature of the Earths surface

Vandalism is a crime that is done by destroying or damaging the property of another A person that does this is called a vandal This can include graffiti and website damage This is usually illegal

The name vandal is from the Vandals a tribe that attacked and damaged the city of Rome in the 455 CE

Websites can also be vandalised A perfect example of website vandalism is Wikipedia As Wikipedia is powered by wiki software this makes it easier for vandals to do vandalism since pages can be changed by everyone This usually gives people who are doing good edits a problem

However not all vandalism is bad Some vandalism is to let people see their talent of art The vandals do not have enough money to buy an art gallery and therefore using public property to allow people to admire their talent

Monopoly is a board game played by two to eight players It is played on a board with spaces In the original version the spaces were named after streets These streets are actual streets in Atlantic City in New Jersey in the United States In the British original version they are named after streets in London Like many board games each person has his own game token that he moves on the board If heshe passes the go space heshe collects 200 There is also a pair of dice and play money A person wins by having the most money at the end of the game

The banker is in charge of the bank The bank has the money Title Deed cards and the houses and hotels The bank gives a player 200 every time he passes go collecting money when a player buys land houses or hotels handing out the Deed cards when the land is bought and loaning money when a player mortgages their land The bank also collects fines loans and interest and taxes

The object of the game is to own as much land and be the richest person The rules are similar not matter what edition you own

Prior to the start of the game if the players agree if you land on Go you collect twice the amount receiving 400 instead of 200 Also free parking could start with an amount of players choice and added to when players pay Community Chest and Chance cards and if you land on Free Parking you receive all the money in the middle of the board

There are many editions of monopoly IUOpoly features locations of the Indiana University campus The game board has been altered to reflect many college campuses across America Milton Bradley has also produced boards to symbolize the decades of popular culture in America For example The 1970sopoly has spaces depicting the fashion of the time Players can purchase bell bottom blue jeans instead of street property

PlayStation 2 has a Monopoly game that allows players all the fun without the math practice since it is electonically calculated throughout the game Options are available to play on a science fiction fantasy board the traditional board or a prehistoric board The tokens represent the era chosen as well as the spaces on the board For instance in the scifi game one of the board spaces is a black hole 

There are many versions of Monopoly such as Star Wars Monopoly and Create your own opoly

Chromolithography was invented by Engelmann and son who were granted a patent in 1837 After that it was a matter of time before it reached full commercial development 

Because of its low production costs over the 50 years after the American Civil War millions of chromolithographs were printed and were sold for under 10 Louis Prang a Bostonian produced fine art subjects such as still lifes landscapes and classical subjects Nevertheless it was only after the Jules Chret posters in 1847 that the potential of this technical process for creation of artistic posters was realized

ImageCheret Jules  Les Saxoleinejpg Chrets style gradually evolved from the complex Victorian decorative graphics into a simpler compositional design in which large central figures were prominent in the motif with simplified backgrounds and large surfaces of vivid colour Hand lettered titles were used in harmony with the design

There are different costs with a printer Printers that are more expensive to buy will usually be less expensive in the consumables Therefore laser printers are often more expensive to buy than inkjet printers but are not expensive to use over a long period of time Inkjet printers on the other hand have a higher cost of consumables because the ink tanks they use are more expensive than the toner for a laser printer Laser printers that can print in color are usually more expensive than those that only print in black and white Other options like being able to print on both sides of a sheet of paper to automatically sort the output or to staple the output will also make a printer more expensive

The Great Wall of China is a very old stone wall in China which was built to protect the north of the empire of China from enemy attacks It is the longest structure humans have ever built stretching approximately 6400 kilometres long The wall begins at Shanhai Pass and ends in Lop Nur 

The Great Wall stands 5 people wide and 20 people high

Several walls referred to as the Great Wall of China have been built The first was built in the 5th century BC The most famous wall was built between 220200 BC by the first Emperor of Imperial China Qin Shi Huang Little of this wall remains It was much farther north than the current wall The current wall was built during the Ming Dynasty 

The First Emperor of China started the Qin Dynasty The Xiongnu tribes in the north of China were his enemies Because the land in some parts of China is easy to cross Qin Shi Huang began building the Great Wall to make it more difficult for the Xiongnu to invade China Many peole died

Other dynasties in China worked more on the wall and made it longer The Han Sui Northern and Jin Dynasties all repaired rebuilt or expanded the Great Wall During the Ming Dynasty major rebuilding work took place where sections of the Wall were built with bricks and stone instead of earth

Builders used materials nearby so some parts of the wall were made out of mud straw and twigs Thousands of workers lost their lives from giant falling stones exhaustion disease animal attacks and starvation The workers who lost their lives were buried in the Great Wall

The Amazon River is a river that flows in tropical forests of South America mainly Brazil It flows to the Atlantic Ocean This river is the biggest by the amount of water it carries It moves more water than the next eight rivers by amount put together The Amazon has the largest drainage basin in the world It accounts for about one fifth of the worlds total river flow During the wet season parts of the Amazon exceed convert120mikm in width Because of its size it is sometimes called The River Sea It is the worlds largest river system even though it is not the worlds longest river system The worlds longest river is the Nile River 

It is one of the longest rivers in the world There have been different studies that have tried to measure its exact length As the studies have come up with different numbers it is therefore difficult to give an exact number Also during the rainy season the length of the river changes Several studies from Brazil Spain and Chile say it is the longest river in the world longer than the Nile The Nile has a length of 6571 km The Amazon may have a length of 6937 kilometres about 140 km longer than the Nile The Spanish daily newspaper El Pas gives its length at 6850 kilometres This would make it about 40 kilometres longer than the Nile In 2007 scientists from Peru and Brazil calculated a length of 6800 km

A study done in 1969 says that the Amazon has a length of 6448 km This was measured from a part of the River Apurimac Until the 1970s it was thought that the Maran River was the source of the Amazon In 2001 an expedition found that Nevado Mismi was in fact the source of the Amazon Another document of the Geographic society of Lima gives the length of the Amazon at over 7000 km

The source of the Amazon is in the Andes Mountains of western South America It flows east from there to the Atlantic Ocean Most of the huge river and its many tributaries are in the country of Brazil There are many places on the Amazon where a person on one side of the river cannot see the other side The Brazilians call the Amazon the River Sea The Amazon is navigable from the ocean to Peru Ocean ships can travel on the Amazon all the way across Brazil and most of South America to the city of Iquitos in Peru

One characteristic of the Amazon river is the Brazo Casiquiare a water connection to the Orinoco river that connects the two basins

The estuary of the Amazon is about convert330kmmi0abbroff wide The width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo do Norte to Punto Patijoca Generally the outlet of the Para River is included It is convert60kmmi0abbron wide and forms the estuary of the Tocantins The estuary also includes the island of Maraj which lies in the mouth of the Amazon This means that the Amazon is wider at its mouth than the entire length of the Thames in England

Along the coastline near Cabo do Norte there are many islands partially covered with water There are also sandbanks The tides of the Atlantic generate a wave that reaches into the Amazon river This wave goes along the coast for about convert160kmmi0abbroff The phenomenon of this wave generated by the tides is called tidal bore Locally it is known as pororoca The pororoca occurs where the water is less than convert7mft0abbron deep It starts with a loud noise and advances at a speed of 1525 kmh The bore is the reason the Amazon does not have a delta The ocean rapidly carries away the large amount of silt brought by the Amazon This makes it impossible for a delta to grow past the shoreline It also has a very large tide that can reach convert6mft0abbroff The place has become popular for river surfing

A phenomenon that is very similar occurs at the mouth of the Orinoco

No bridges have been built over the Amazon This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge For most of its length engineers could build a bridge across the river easily For most of its course the river flows through tropical rainforest there are very few roads and cities Most of the time the crossing can be done by a ferry there is no need to build a bridge 

The river and its tributaries for the most part flow through the Rainforest Most cities lie on the banks of the river The river is the main route of traffic in the region The biggest city on the river is Manaus which is also the capital of the Brazillian State of Amazonas Many native peoples live in the Amazon such as the Urarina who live in Peru

Big ocean ships can get up the river until Manaus which is almost 1500 kilometers from its mouth Smaller ocean ships of 3000 tons and 79 m draft can reach as far as Iquitos in Peru 3700 km from the sea Smaller riverboats can reach 780 km higher as far as Actual Point Beyond that small boats frequently go up to the Pogo Ode Escherichias just above Actual Point

Pixar is a very popular animation studio which is well known for its extremely advanced CGI productions It has been a partner of Disney for many years and now is owned by the company The company began life as a division of George Lucas Lucasfilm in early 1979 It was bought for 10 million in 1986 by Steve Jobs who is now its chairman and CEO

Finding Nemo is a DisneyPixar animated movie which first showed in 2003 It has the voices of Albert Brooks Alexander Gould and Ellen DeGeneres as fish The film was directed by Andrew Stanton and co directed by Lee Unkrich

The movie is about Nemo a clownfish who gets lost in the ocean around Australia His father Marlin and Marlins new friend Dory spend the entire movie looking for him Nemo is eventually found

The movie won an Oscar in 2004 for Best Animated Film

Fibonacci full name Leonardo Pisano Bigollo was an Italian mathematician and among the most distinctive mathematicians in the Western world of the Middle Ages

His nickname Fibonacci was taken from his father whose name was BonaccifactdateJuly 2010 Fibonacci means son of Bonacci His mother was Alessandra Larracocci who died when Fibonacci was 9 years oldfactdateJuly 2010 He also had a sister named DanicafactdateJuly 2010 He is considered the Father of Mathematicswho

Fibbonacci is best known for the list of numbers called the Fibonacci Sequence The list never stops but it starts this way

In this list a person can find the next number by adding the last two numbers together

This series is also interesting because the ratio of two adjacent numbers in the series approaches the golden ratio or Phi as the numbers get bigger

The NHL began in 1917 Some of the owners in the National Hockey Association had problems with owner Edward Livingstone so they got rid of him by creating a new league There were five teams in 1917

They played 22 games a year The Wanderers had to stop playing in the first year because their arena burned down Over the years some teams died out and others were created the Boston Bruins New York Americans Montreal Maroons Pittsburgh Pirates New York Rangers Chicago Black Hawks and Detroit Cougars

Some teams folded during the Great Depression so by 1942 there were only six teams

There were only these six teams for 25 years so they became known as the original six

By the 1940s they were playing 50 games a year but this increased slowly to 80 games by the 1970s In 1967 the league increased to 12 teams By 1979 it had 21 teams and today it has 30 Some of the teams that no longer exist are the Oakland Seals Minnesota North Stars Winnipeg Jets Kansas City Scouts Hartford Whalers Quebec Nordiques and Atlanta Thrashers

Today they play 82 games a year plus four rounds of playoffs The players make a lot of money Because they could make so much money many Europeans came over to North Amercia to play in the NHL Today almost all the worlds best hockey players are in the NHL

Isaac Asimov was born in Russia to a Jewish family He was taken to the United States when he was three and learnt English and Yiddish as his native languages He wrote many books People know about Isaac Asimov because of his science fiction books and his science books for non scientists

Asimovs most famous books were the Foundation Series He also wrote the Galactic Empire and the Robot Series He also wrote mystery fantasy and non fiction books He wrote or edited over 500 books and about 90000 letters Other subjects he wrote about were history the Bible literature and sexuality

Asimov made a list of 15 of his science fiction books which he advised should be read in this order

Numbers 15 are Robot books 68 are Galactic Empire books 915 are Foundation books

Evolution is a scientific theory used by biologists It explains how animals and plants changed over a long time and how they have come to be the way they are 

The Earth has been around for a very long time By doing research on the layers of rock we can find out about its past That kind of research is called historical geology 

We know that living things have changed over time because we can see their remains in the rocks These remains are called fossils So we know that the animals and plants of today are different from those of long ago And the further we go back the more different the fossils are How has this come about Evolution has taken place That evolution has taken place is a fact because it is overwhelmingly supported by many lines of evidence At the same time evolutionary questions are still being actively researched by biologists

The theory of evolution is the basis of modern biology Nothing in biology makes sense without it

The evidence for evolution is presented in a number of books Some of the reasons are discussed in this section 

The realization that some rocks contain fossils was a landmark in natural history There are three parts to this story

The evolution of the horse family is a good example of the way that evolution works The oldest fossil of a horse is about 52 million years old It was a small animal with five toes on the front feet and four on the hind feet At that time there were more forests in the world than today This horse lived in woodland eating leaves nuts and fruit with its simple teeth It was only about as big as a fox 

About 30 million years ago the world started to become cooler and drier Forests shrank grassland expanded and horses changed They ate grass they grew larger and they ran faster because they had to escape faster predators Because grass wears teeth out horses with longer lasting teeth had an advantage 

For most of this long period of time there were a number of horse types Now however only one genus exists the modern horse Equus It has teeth which grow all its life hooves on single toes great long legs for running and the animal is big and strong enough to survive in the open plain Horses lived in western Canada until 12000 years ago but all horses in North America became extinct about 11000 years ago The causes of this extinction are not yet clear Climate change and over hunting by humans are suggested

So scientists can see that changes have happened They have happened slowly over a long time How these changes have come about is explained by the theory of evolution

This is a topic which fascinated both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace When new species occur usually by the splitting of older species this takes place in one place in the world Once it is established a new species may spread to some places and not others

Australasia has been separated from other continents for many millions of years In the main part of the continent Australia 83 of mammals 89 of reptiles 90 of fish and insects and 93 of amphibians are endemic Its native mammals are mostly marsupials like kangaroos bandicoots and quolls By contrast marsupials are today totally absent from Africa and form a small portion of the mammalian fauna of South America where opossums shrew opossums and the monito del monte occur 

The only living representatives of primitive egg laying mammals are the echidnas and the platypus They are only found in Australasia which includes Tasmania New Guinea and Kangaroo Island These monotremes are totally absent in the rest of the world On the other hand Australia is missing many groups of placental mammals that are common on other continents although it does have indigenous bats and rodents which arrived later

The evolutionary story is that placental mammals evolved in Eurasia and wiped out the marsupials and monotremes wherever they spread Australasia they never got to until more recently That is the simple reason why Australia has most of the worlds marsupials and all the worlds monotremes

In about convert6500sqmikm2abbron the Hawaiian Islands have the most diverse collection of Drosophila flies in the world living from rainforests to mountain meadows About 800 Hawaiian drosophilid species are known

Genetic evidence shows that all the native drosophilid species in Hawaiokinai have descended from a single ancestral species that colonized the islands about 20 million years ago The subsequent adaptive radiation was spurred by a lack of competition and a wide variety of vacant niches Although it would be possible for a single pregnant female to colonise an island it is more likely to have been a group from the same species

The combination of continental drift and evolution can explain what is found in the fossil record Glossopteris is an extinct species of seed fern plants from the Permian period on the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana 

Glossopteris fossils are found in Permian strata in southeast South America southeast Africa all of Madagascar northern India all of Australia all of New Zealand and scattered on the southern and northern edges of Antarctica 

During the Permian these continents were connected as Gondwana This is known from magnetic striping in the rocks other fossil distributions and glacial scratches pointing away from the temperate climate of the South Pole during the Permianp103

When biologists look at living things they see that animals and plants belong to groups which have something in common Charles Darwin explained that this followed naturally if we admit the common parentage of allied forms together with their modification through variation and natural selectionp402p456

For example all insects are related They share a basic body plan whose development is controlled by master regulatory genes They have six legs they have hard parts on the outside of the body they have eyes formed of many separate chambers and so on Biologists explain this with evolution All insects are the descendants of a group of animals who lived a long time ago They still keep the basic plan but the details change They look different now because they changed in different ways this is evolution

It was Darwin who first suggested that all life on Earth had a single origin and from that beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolvedp490 Evidence from molecular biology in recent years has supported the idea that all life is related by common descent

Strong evidence for common descent comes from vestigial structuresp397 The useless wings of flightless beetles are sealed under fused wing covers This can be simply explained by their descent from ancestral beetles which had wings that workedp49 

Rudimentary body parts those that are smaller and simpler in structure than corresponding parts in ancestral species are called vestigial organs Those organs are functional in the ancestral species but are now either nonfunctional or re adapted to a new function Examples are the pelvic girdles of whales halteres of flies wings of flightless birds and the leaves of some xerophytes and parasitic plants 

However vestigial structures may have their original function replaced with another For example the halteres in flies help balance the insect while in flight and the wings of ostriches are used in mating rituals and in aggressive display The ear ossicles in mammals are former bones of the lower jaw

In 1893 Robert Wiedersheim published a book on human anatomy and its relevance to mans evolutionary history This book contained a list of 86 human organs that he considered vestigial This list included examples such as the appendix and the 3rd molar teeth

The strong grip of a baby is another example It is a vestigial reflex a remnant of the past when pre human babies clung to their mothers hair as the mothers swung through the trees This is borne out by the babies feet which curl up when it is sitting down All primates except modern man have thick body hair to which an infant can cling unlike modern humans The grasp reflex allows the mother to escape danger by climbing a tree using both hands and feet

Vestigial organs often have some selection against them The original organs took resources sometimes huge resources If they no longer have a function reducing their size improves fitness And there is direct evidence of selection Some cave crustacea reproduce more successfully with smaller eyes than do those with larger eyes This may be because the nervous tissue dealing with sight now becomes available to handle other sensory inputp310

From the eighteenth century it was known that embryos of different species were much more similar than the adults In particular some parts of embryos reflect their evolutionary past For example the embryos of land vertebrates develop gill slits like fish embryos Of course this is only a temporary stage which gives rise to many structures in the neck of reptiles birds and mammals The proto gill slits are part of a complicated system of development that is why they persisted

Another example are the embryonic teeth of baleen whales They are later lost The baleen filter is developed from different tissue called keratin Early fossil baleen whales did actually have teeth as well as the baleen

A good example is the barnacle It took many centuries before natural historians discovered that barnacles were crustacea Their adults look so unlike other crustacea but their larvae are very similar to those of other crustacea

Charles Darwin lived in a world where animal husbandry and domesticated crops were vitally important In both cases farmers selected for breeding individuals with special properties and prevented the breeding of individuals with less desirable characteristics The eighteenth and early nineteenth century saw a growth in scientific agriculture and artificial breeding was part of this

Darwin discussed artificial selection as a model for natural selection in the 1859 first edition of his work On the Origin of Species in Chapter IV Natural selection 

Nikolai Vavilov showed that rye originally a weed came to be a crop plant by unintentional selection Rye is a tougher plant than wheat it survives in harsher conditions Having become a crop like the wheat rye was able to become a crop plant in harsh areas such as hills and mountains

There is no real difference in the genetic processes underlying artificial and natural selection and the concept of artificial selection was used by Charles Darwin as an illustration of the wider process of natural selection There are practical differences Experimental studies of artificial selection show that the rate of evolution in selection experiments is at least two orders of magnitude greater than any rate seen in nature or the fossil recordp157

Some have thought that artificial selection could not produce new species It now seems that it can

New species have been created by domesticated animal husbandry but the details are not known or not clear For example domestic sheep were created by hybridisation and no longer produce viable offspring with Ovis orientalis one species from which they are descended Domestic cattle on the other hand can be considered the same species as several varieties of wild ox gaur yak etc as they readily produce fertile offspring with them

The best documented new species came from laboratory experiments in the late 1980s William Rice and GW Salt bred fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster using a maze with three different choices of habitat such as lightdark and wetdry Each generation was put into the maze and the groups of flies that came out of two of the eight exits were set apart to breed with each other in their respective groups 

After thirty five generations the two groups and their offspring were isolated reproductively because of their strong habitat preferences they mated only within the areas they preferred and so did not mate with flies that preferred the other areas

Diane Dodd was also able to show how reproductive isolation can develop from mating preferences in Drosophila pseudoobscura fruit flies after only eight generations using different food types starch and maltose

Dodds experiment has been easy for many others to replicate including with other kinds of fruit flies and foods

Some biologists say that evolution has happened when a trait that is caused by genetics becomes more or less common in a group of organisms Others call it evolution when new species appear 

Changes can happen quickly in the smaller simpler organisms For example many bacteria that cause disease can no longer be killed with some of the antibiotic medicines These medicines have only been in use about eighty years and at first worked extremely well The bacteria have evolved so that they are no longer affected by antibiotics anymore The drugs killed off all the bacteria except a few which had some resistance These few resistant bacteria produced the next generation

The Colorado beetle is famous for its ability to resist pesticides Over the last 50 years it has become resistant to 52 chemical compounds used in insecticides including cyanide This is natural selection speeded up by the artificial conditions However not every population is resistant to every chemical The populations only become resistant to chemicals used in their area

Although there were a number of natural historians in the 18th century who had some idea of evolution the first well formed ideas came in the 19th century Three biologists are most important

Jean Baptiste de Lamarck a French biologist claimed that animals changed according to natural laws He said that animals could pass on traits they had acquired during their lifetime to their offspring using inheritance Today his theory is known as Lamarckism Its main purpose is to explain adaptations by natural means He proposed a tendency for organisms to become more complex moving up a ladder of progress plus use and disuse 

Lamarcks idea was that a giraffes neck grew longer because it tried to reach higher up This idea failed because it cannot be reconciled with heredity Mendel made his discoveries about half a century after Lamarcks work

Charles Darwin wrote his On the Origin of Species in 1859 In this book he put forward much evidence that evolution had occurred He also proposed natural selection as the way evolution had taken place But Darwin did not understand about genetics and how traits were actually passed on He could not accurately explain what made children look like their parents

Nevertheless Darwins explanation of evolution was fundamentally correct In contrast to Lamarck Darwins idea was that the giraffes neck became longer because those with longer necks survived betterp1778 These survivors passed their genes on and in time the whole race got longer necks

An Austrian monk called Gregor Mendel bred plants In the mid 19th century he discovered how traits were passed on from one generation to the next 

He used peas for his experiments some peas have white flowers and others have red ones Some peas have green seeds and others have yellow seeds Mendel used artificial pollination to breed the peas His results are discussed further in Mendelian inheritance Darwin thought that the inheritance from both parents blended together Mendel proved that the genes from the two parents stay separate and may be passed on unchanged to later generations

Mendel published his results in a journal that was not well known and his discoveries were overlooked Around 1900 his work was rediscovered Genes are bits of information made of DNA which work like a set of instructions A set of genes are in every living cell Together genes organise the way an egg develops into an adult With mammals and many other living things a copy of each gene comes from the father and another copy from the mother Some living organisms including some plants only have one parent so get all their genes from them These genes produce the genetic differences which evolution acts on

Darwins On the Origin of Species has two themes the evidence for evolution and his ideas on how evolution took place This section deals with the second issue

The first two chapters of the Origin deal with variation in domesticated plants and animals and variation in nature 

All living things show variation Every population which has been studied shows that animal and plants vary as much as humans dop90 This is a great fact of nature and without it evolution would not occur Darwin said that just as man selects what he wants in his farm animals so in nature the variations allow natural selection to work

The features of an individual are influenced by two things heredity and environment First development is controlled by genes inherited from the parents Second living brings its own influences Some things are entirely inherited others partly and some not inherited at all

The colour of eyes is entirely inherited they are a genetic trait Height or weight is only partly inherited and the language is not at all inherited Just to be clear the fact that humans can speak is inherited but what language is spoken depends on where a person lives and what they are taught Another example a person inherits a brain of somewhat variable capacity What happens after birth depends on many things such as home environment education and other experiences When a person is adult their brain is what their inheritance and life experience have made it

Evolution only concerns the traits which can be inherited wholly or partly The hereditary traits are passed on from one generation to the next through the genes A persons genes contain all the traits which they inherit from their parents The accidents of life are not passed on Also of course each person lives a somewhat different life that increases the differences

Organisms in any population vary in reproductive successp81 From the point of view of evolution reproductive success means the total number of offspring which live to breed and leave offspring themselves

Variation can only affect future generations if it is inherited Because of the work of Gregor Mendel we know that much variation is inherited Mendels factors are now called genes Research has shown that almost every individual in a sexually reproducing species is genetically uniquep204

Genetic variation is increased by gene mutations DNA does not always reproduce exactly Rare changes occur and these changes can be inherited Many changes in DNA cause faults some are neutral or even advantageous This gives rise to genetic variation which is the seed corn of evolution Sexual reproduction by the crossing over of chromosomes during meiosis spreads variation through the population Other events like natural selection and drift reduce variation So a population in the wild always has variation but the details are always changingp90

Evolution mainly works by natural selection What does this mean Animals and plants which are best suited to their environment will on average survive better There is a struggle for existence Those who survive will produce the next generation Their genes will be passed on and the genes of those who did not reproduce will not This is the basic mechanism which changes a population and causes evolution

Natural selection explains why living organisms change over time to have the anatomy the functions and behaviour that they have It works like this

There are now many cases where natural selection has been proved to occur in wild populations Almost every case investigated of camouflage mimicry and polymorphism has shown strong effects of selection

The force of selection can be much stronger than was thought by the early population geneticists The resistance to pesticides has grown quickly Resistance to warfarin in Norway rats grew rapidly because those that survived made up more and more of the population Research showed that in the absence of warfarin the resistant homozygote was at a 54 disadvantage to the normal wild type homozygotep182 This great disadvantage was quickly overcome by the selection for warfarin resistance

Mammals normally cannot drink milk as adults but humans are an exception Milk is digested by the enzyme lactase which switches off as mammals stop taking milk from their mothers The human ability to drink milk during adult life is supported by a lactase mutation which prevents this switch off Human populations have a high proportion of this mutation wherever milk is important in the diet The spread of this milk tolerance is promoted by natural selection because it helps people survive where milk is available Genetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations causing lactase persistence only reached high levels in human populations in the last ten thousand years Therefore lactase persistence is often cited as an example of recent human evolution As lactase persistence is genetic but animal husbandry a cultural trait this is geneculture coevolution

Adaptation is one of the basic phenomena of biology Through the process of adaptation an organism becomes better suited to its habitat 

Adaptation is one of the two main processes that explain the diverse species we see in biology The other is speciation A favourite example used today to study the interplay of adaptation and speciation is the evolution of cichlid fish in African rivers and lakes

When people speak about adaptation they often mean something which helps an animal or plant survive One of the most widespread adaptations in animals is the evolution of the eye Another example is the adaptation of horses teeth to grinding grass Camouflage is another adaptation so is mimicry The better adapted animals are the most likely to survive and to reproduce successfully

An internal parasite is a good example it has a very simple bodily structure but still the organism is highly adapted to its particular environment From this we see that adaptation is not just a matter of visible traits in such parasites critical adaptations take place in the life cycle which is often quite complex 

Not all features of an organism are adaptationsp251 Adaptations tend to reflect the past life of a species If a species has recently changed its life style a once valuable adaptation may become useless and eventually become a dwindling vestige 

Adaptations are never perfect There are always tradeoffs between the various functions and structures in a body It is the organism as a whole which lives and reproduces therefore it is the complete set of adaptations which gets passed on to future generations

In populations there are forces which add variation to the population and forces which remove it Genetic drift is the name given to random changes which remove variation from a population Genetic drift gets rid of variation at the rate of 1 where N population sizep29 It is therefore a very weak evolutionary force in large populationsp55

Genetic drift explains how random chance can affect evolution in surprisingly big ways but only when populations are quite small Overall its action is to make the individuals more similar to each other and hence more vulnerable to disease or to chance events in their environment 

How species form is a major part of evolutionary biology Darwin interpreted evolution as being about speciation That is why he called his famous book On the Origin of Species

Darwin thought most species arose directly from pre existing species This is called anagenesis new species by older species changing Now we think most species arise by previous species splitting cladogenesis

Two groups that start the same can also become very different if they live in different places When a species gets split into two geographical regions a process starts Each adapts to its own situation After a while individuals from one group can no longer reproduce with the other group Two good species have evolved from one 

A German explorer Moritz Wagner during his three years in Algeria in the 1830s studied flightless beetles Each species is confined to a stretch of the north coast between rivers which descend from the Atlas mountains to the Mediterranean As soon as one crosses a river a different but closely related species appears He wrote later

This was an early account of the importance of geographical separation Another biologist who thought geographical separation was critical was Ernst Mayr

One example of natural speciation is the three spined stickleback a sea fish that after the last ice age invaded freshwater and set up colonies in isolated lakes and streams Over about 10000 generations the sticklebacks show great differences including variations in fins changes in the number or size of their bony plates variable jaw structure and color differences

The wombats of Australia fall into two main groups Common wombats and Hairy nosed wombats The two types look very similar apart from the hairiness of their noses However they are adapted to different environments Common wombats live in forested areas and eat mostly green food with lots of moisture They often feed in the daytime Hairy nosed wombats live on hot dry plains where they eat dry grass with very little water or goodness in it Their metabolic system is slow and they sleep most of the day underground

When two groups that started the same become different enough then they become two different species Part of the theory of evolution is that all living things started off the same but then split off into different groups over billions of years

This was an important movement in evolutionary biology which started in the 1930s and finished in the 1950s It has been updated regularly ever since The synthesis explains how the ideas of Charles Darwin fit with the discoveries of Gregor Mendel who found out how we inherit our genes The modern synthesis brought Darwins idea up to date It bridged the gap between different types of biologists geneticists naturalists and palaeontologists

When the theory of evolution was developed it was not clear that natural selection and genetics worked together But Ronald Fisher showed that natural selection would work to change species Sewall Wright explained genetic drift in 1931

Co evolution is where the existence of one species is tightly bound up with the life of one or more other species

New or improved adaptations which occur in one species are often followed by the appearance and spread of related features in the other species The life and death of living things is intimately connected not just with the physical environment but with the life of other species 

These relationships may continue for millions of years as it has in the pollination of flowering plants by insects The gut contents wing structures and mouthparts of fossilized beetles and flies suggest that they acted as early pollinators The association between beetles and angiosperms during the Lower Cretaceous period led to parallel radiations of angiosperms and insects into the late Cretaceous The evolution of nectaries in Upper Cretaceous flowers signals the beginning of the mutualism between hymenoptera and angiosperms

Charles Darwin was the first to use this metaphor in biology The evolutionary tree shows the relationships among various biological groups It includes data from DNA RNA and protein analysis Tree of life work is a product of traditional comparative anatomy and modern molecular evolution and molecular clock research 

The major figure in this work is Carl Woese who defined the Archaea the third domain of life Below is a simplified version of present day understanding 

Macroevolution the study of changes above the species level and how they take place The basic data for such a study are fossils and the reconstruction of ancient environments Some subjects whose study falls within the realm of macroevolution

It is a term of convenience for most biologists it does not suggest any change in the process of evolutionp87 For some palaeontologists what they see in the fossil record cannot be explained just by the gradualist evolutionary synthesis They are in the minority

Altruism the willingness of some to sacrifice themselves for others is widespread in social animals As explained above the next generation can only come from those who survive and reproduce Some biologists have thought that this meant altruism could not evolve by the normal process of selection Instead a process called group selection was proposed Group selection refers to the idea that alleles can become fixed or spread in a population because of the benefits they bestow on groups regardless of the alleles effect on the fitness of individuals within that group

For several decades critiques cast serious doubt on group selection as a major mechanism of evolution

In simple cases it can be seen at once that traditional selection suffices For example if one sibling sacrifices itself for three siblings the genetic disposition for the act will be increased This is because siblings share on average 50 of their genetic inheritance and the sacrificial act has led to greater representation of the genes in the next generation 

Altruism is now generally seen as emerging from standard selection The warning note from Ernst Mayr and the work of William Hamilton are both important to this discussion

At first sexual reproduction might seem to be at a disadvantage compared with asexual reproduction In order to be advantageous sexual reproduction has to overcome a two fold disadvantage plus the difficulty of finding a mate Why then is sex so nearly universal among eukaryotes This is one of the oldest questions in biology

The answer has been given since Darwins time because the sexual populations adapt better to changing circumstances A recent laboratory experiment suggests this is indeed the correct explanation

In the main experiment nematode worms were divided into two groups One group was entirely outcrossing the other was entirely selfing The groups were subjected to a rugged terrain and repeatedly subjected to a mutagen After 50 generations the selfing population showed a substantial decline in fitness whereas the outcrossing population showed no decline This is one of a number of studies that show sexuality to have real advantages over non sexual types of reproduction

An important activity is artificial selection for domestication This is when people choose which animals to breed from based on their traits Humans have used this for thousands of years to domesticate plants and animals 

More recently it has become possible to use genetic engineering New techniques such as gene targeting are now available The purpose of this is to insert new genes or knock out old genes from the genome of a plant or animal A number of Nobel Prizes have already been awarded for this work

However the real purpose of studying evolution is to explain and help our understanding of biology After all it is the first good explanation of how living things came to be the way they are That is a big achievement The practical things come mostly from genetics the science started by Gregor Mendel and from molecular and cell biology

In 2010 the journal Nature selected 15 topics as Evolution gems These were

The idea that all life evolved had been proposed before Charles Darwin published On the Origin of species Even today some people still discuss the concept of evolution and what it means to them their philosophy and their religion Evolution does seem to explain some things about about our human nature People also talk about the social implications of evolution 

In order to fit in the idea of evolution with their religious views people have come up with ideas like guided evolution or theistic evolution They say that evolution is real but is being guided in some way 

There are many different concepts of theistic evolution Many creationists believe that the creation myth found in their religion goes against the idea of evolution As Darwin realised the most controversial part of the evolutionary thought is what it means for human origins 

In some countries especially in the United States there is tension between people who accept the idea of evolution and those who do not accept it The debate is mostly about whether evolution should be taught in schools and in what way this should be done

Other fields like cosmology and earth science also do not match with the original writings of many religious texts These ideas were once also fiercely opposed Death for heresy was threatened to those who wrote against the idea that the Earth was the centre of the universe Giordano Bruno was burnt at the stake by the Holy Inquisition for teaching that the Earth moved around the Sun

Evolutionary biology is a more recent idea Certain religious groups oppose the idea of evolution more than other religious groups do For instance the Roman Catholic Church now has the following position on evolution Pope Pius XII said in his encyclical Humani Generis published in the 1950s

Pope John Paul II updated this position in 1996 He said that Evolution was more than a hypothesis

The Anglican Communion also does not oppose the scientific account of evolution

Many of those who accepted evolution were not much interested in biology They were interested in using the theory to support their own ideas on society

Some people have tried to use evolution to support racism People wanting to justify racism claimed that certain groups such as black people were inferior In nature some animals do survive better than others and it does lead to animals better adapted to their circumstances With humans groups from different parts of the world all evolution can say is that each group is probably well suited to its original situation Evolution makes no judgements about better or worse It does not say that any human group is superior to any other

The idea of eugenics was rather different Two things had been noticed as far back as the 18th century One was the great success of farmers in breeding cattle and crop plants They did this by selecting which animals or plants would produce the next generation The other observation was that lower class people had more children than upper class people If the higher classes were there on merit then their lack of children was the exact reverse of what should be happening Faster breeding in the lower classes would lead to the society getting worse

The idea to improve the human species by selective breeding is called eugenics The name was proposed by Francis Galton a bright scientist who meant to do good He said that the human stock should be improved by selective breeding policies This would mean that those who were considered good stock would receive a reward if they reproduced However other people suggested that those considered bad stock would need to undergo compulsory sterilization prenatal testing and birth control The German Nazi government used eugenics as a cover for their extreme racial policies with dreadful results 

The problem with Galtons idea is how to decide which features to select There are so many different skills people could have you could not agree who was good stock and who was bad stock There was rather more agreement on who should not be breeding Several countries passed laws for the compulsory sterilisation of unwelcome groups Most of these laws were passed between 1900 and 1940 After World War II disgust at what the Nazis had done squashed any more attempts at eugenics

Another example of using ideas about evolution to support social action is Social Darwinism Social Darwinism is a term given to the ideas of the 19th century social philosopher Herbert Spencer Spencer believed the survival of the fittest could and should be applied to commerce and human societies as a whole 

Again some people used these ideas to claim that racism and ruthless economic policies were justified Today most biologists and philosophers say that the theory of evolution should not be applied to social policy

Some people disagree with the idea of evolution They disagree with it for a number of reasons Most often these reasons are influenced by or based on their religious beliefs People who do not agree with evolution usually believe in creationism or intelligent design

Despite this evolution is one of the most successful theories in science People have discovered it to be useful for different kinds of research None of the other suggestions explain things such as fossil records as well So for almost all scientists evolution is not in doubt

These books are mostly about the evidence for evolution

These books cover most evolutionary topics

 Urshalim Al Quds nickname        The Holy City

Jerusalem is the international city where both Israelis and Palestinians live and largest city of Israel It is also one of the oldest cities in the world that people have lived in continuously 

It is important to many major religions Jews consider Jerusalem a holy city because it was their religious and political center during Biblical times and the place where the Temple of God stood Christians consider Jerusalem holy because many events in the life of Jesus Christ took place there Muslims believe that the Prophet Muhammad rose to heaven from there

Jerusalem is about 40 miles east of the Mediterranean Sea It is a hilly city with many valleys around it

Jerusalem is a very old city It has great importance for three religions Judaism Christianity and Islam The Bible says King David the second king of the Israel took this city from pagans and settled his palace there King Solomon Davids son and the next king built the Temple in Jerusalem Later as capital of Judah Jerusalem was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar II the king of Babylon The Palace of King David and the Temple of Solomon were burned and the Jews were captured and taken to Babylon Seventy years later the Persian King Cyrus allowed them to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the Temple 

Later the area was occupied by Romans King Herod the Great who ruled for the Roman Emperor made the Temple larger to try and win Jewish favor The Temple was famous for its greatness and beauty Jesus Christ died in Jerusalem around AD 33 In AD 70 the Jews rebelled against the Romans but the Romans destroyed the city and the Temple Jewish people who lived in Jerusalem were caught and became slaves The Romans renamed Jerusalem with a Latin name Since then the Temple has not been rebuilt and only a part of its wall remains until today

After the Roman Empire was split into two the Byzantine Empire ruled Jerusalem Later Muslims took over the city from them The Muslims believed Muhammad went to heaven from Jerusalem

Later the Pope in Rome sent the Crusaders from Western Europe to try and take it back They succeeded for a while but eventually the city fell again to the Saracens Until the 20th century Jerusalem was a part of the Ottoman Empire There were some Jews in Jerusalem all along even though they were ruled by other people

The New City of Jerusalem is the part outside the old stone walls People started building the new city in the 1800s Mishkenot Shaannanim Mea Shearim and the Bukharan Quarter are some of the first neighborhoods in the new city

In 1949 at the end of the first Arab Israeli War Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan Israel controlled the western part of the city Jordan controlled the eastern section including the Old City a walled section of Jerusalem dating from Biblical times Israel took control of the entire city during the Six Day War in 1967 Jerusalem today is claimed by both the Palestinians and the Israelis as their capital And United Nation do not admit the declaration of Israel claiming that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel according to international law

Jerusalem has a central place in the worship doctrine and daily practice of Judaism Christianity and Islam The citys large number of synagogues churches mosques and other religious institutions reflects the significance of the city for all three faiths Each religious community supervises its own holy sites 

According to Jewish tradition Jerusalem is where God told the patriarch Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac to Him The Jews built the Temple the center of Jewish worship in ancient times at the site of Abrahams sacrifice on the Temple Mount in the Old City Two buildings one after the other the First Temple and the Second Temple stood at the site The First Temple housed the Ark of the Covenant a sacred box holding the tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments 

The Western Wall is a part of the Second Temple and Judaisms most sacred shrine It is a stone wall that streghthened the western side of the Temple Mount in ancient times The wall is sometimes called the Wailing Wall because of the sad prayers Jewish people said there to mourn the destroyed Temple 

Other sites in the city that are sacred to the Jews include King Davids tomb on Mount Zion and the Jewish Cemetery and the Tombs of the Prophets on the Mount of Olives a hill just east of the Old City Many sites associated with Biblical figures are sacred to Christians too 

Christian Many monasteries convents shrines and religious seminaries in Jerusalem mark events in the life of Jesus Christ and in the formation of the Christian Church Jesus taught in Jerusalem and performed numerous miracles there The Last Supper supposedly took place in a room known as the Cenacle on Mount Zion The Church of the Holy Sepulcher in the Old City is said to be the place of Jesuss Crucifixion as well as His burial and Resurrection Several Christian sects own the church which was originally built by Constantine the Great then rebuilt and dedicated by the Crusaders in 1149 CE The building stands at the end of the Via Dolorosa believed to be the path over which Jesus carried His cross to Calvary Jesus was last seen by His followers on the Mount of Olives before He went up to heaven All of these sites attract many religious pilgrims each year 

Jerusalem is Islams third holiest city after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia According to Muslim tradition the Prophet Muhammad originally selected Jerusalem as the qibla the direction Muslims should face during prayer However he later told his followers to face Mecca instead of Jerusalem when praying Muhammad is said to have gone up to heaven from a stone now covered by a golden domed shrine called the Dome of the Rock The Dome of the Rock and an ancient mosque called Al Aqsa Mosque are among the holiest sites in Islam They are the main buildings on the Temple Mount which Muslims call Haram al Sharif

Jerusalems architecture is a mixture of old and new The Old City contains architectural examples from each major period in the citys history Many ancient historical sites and places of worship stand near modern shopping centers and industrial zones Architecture from the late 1800s and early 1900s shows European influences Usefulness rather than style characterizes new apartment buildings constructed by the government as housing for immigrants Many buildings old and new have matching exteriors because all construction is required to be faced with a cream colored limestone called Jerusalem stone produced by nearby quarries

A long time ago Cornish was the only language spoken in Cornwall but more and more people began to speak English instead of Cornish In 1550 when the prayer book was written in English instead of Latin the Cornish people got angry and there was a rebellion Because many Cornish speakers died and because they would now hear the Bible in English the language was used less and less 

By 1800 there were only a few people who could speak Cornish and no one spoke it to each other any more Some people say that a woman called Dolly Pentreath was the last person who could speak Cornish This is not quite true but she was one of the last people to use it instead of English 

Some people learned about Cornish by travelling around talking to people who could still speak it and by reading old plays and books Some people wanted to learn the language and speak it so in 1904 a learned man called Henry Jenner wrote a book to help people After this some people began to learn the language and speak it again

No one knows how many Cornish speakers there are now People think there are probably about 3000 to 5000 people who speak Cornish Some young people have grown up speaking it Many other people in Cornwall know a few sentences or words in Cornish In a hundred years the Cornish language has grown from almost no speakers to many thousands which is very exciting for many people

There are now many new books films and songs in Cornish The Bible has now been translated into Cornish There is an event called the open Gorseth where there is a story and poetry competition Sometimes Cornish is used in churches

There used to be a problem with Cornish in that there were three different dictionaries with different spellings and people did not agree about how to write the words or how to say them This was confusing for people when they have not been speaking long so in 2008 people who used the different types of Cornish came together and agreed on a new standard form of Cornish to be used everywhere

Here are some words in Cornish

Welsh could mean many different things

Closed source is a type of computer program source code development With closed source software the source code is not shared with the public for anyone to look at or make changes to Closed source is the opposite of open source 

Most companies who sell their software for money make it closed source to make it harder for people to change it or copy it for free

Even some people and companies who give their software for free do not show the source code because they think it looks bad or that somebody will change the authors names to their own without making the program better Some programs called freeware are given away for free but they are not the same as free software that anyone can do whatever they want with

A USB flash drive is a small device that stores information and files from a computer Flash drives are an easy way of moving data between different computers or devices to be read or edited Flash drives are connected to a computer using a USB port which can be found on many devices Flash drives take their name from the flash memory used to hold files Flash memory is a type of memory that does not need any moving parts unlike a CD or Floppy disk

The capacity of flash drives starts at few megabytes In April 2010 the ones that could hold most data could hold about 256 gigabytes

Other common names for a flash drive include memory stick keydrive pendrive thumbdrive and jumpdrive or simply USB

USB flash drives have some advantages over other portable storage devices They are much smaller than floppy disks and can hold much more data They do not have moving parts so they should be more reliable

Flash drives are used to store any type of data file or to move data from one computer to another

Administrators or people who manage the computer systems sometimes use flash drives Sometimes flash drives are also used to run a computer virus scanner or to restart a computer system that broke or was damaged or lost The drives have a lot of storage space and it is often easier to carry a flash drive than to carry a number of CD ROMs

Some types of flash drive also allow you to install computer programs These applications can then be run on any computer without the need for installing them Very often they have been changed so that they use computer memory to hold temporary information for example

Police in the cyber division can use flash drives to take evidence or proof

Most computers today permit booting from a USB drive allowing the launch of an operating system from a bootable flash drive Such a configuration is known as a Live USB

Many companies make small solid state digital audio players These are actually flash drives that can make sound Examples include the Creative MuVo and the iPod shuffle Some of these players are real USB flash drives as well as music players Others just play music

Many of the smallest players are powered by a permanently fitted rechargeable battery The battery can be charged from the USB interface

Digital audio files can be moved from one computer to another like any other file and played on a compatible Media player In addition many home Hi Fi and car stereos are now equipped with a USB port This allows a USB flash drive containing media files in a variety of formats to be played directly on devices which support the format

Artists have sold or given away USB flash drives with the first instance believed to be in 2004 when the German band WIZO released the Stick EP only as a USB drive In addition to five high quality MP3s it also included a video pictures lyrics and guitar tablature 

Subsequently artists including Kanye West Nine Inch Nails and Ayumi Hamasaki have released music and promotional material on USB flash drives

In the arcade game In the Groove and In The Groove 2 flash drives are used to transfer high scores screenshots dance edits and combos throughout sessions In later versions players can also store custom songs and play them on any machine on which this feature is enabled While use of flash drives is common the drive must be Linux compatible causing problems for some players

In the arcade games Pump it Up NX2 and Pump it Up NX Absolute a special produced flash drive is used as a save file for unlocked songs as well as progressing in the WorldMax and Brain Shower sections of the game

In the arcade game Dance Dance Revolution X a special USB flash drive was made by Konami letting players link the Sony PlayStation 2 version

Flash drives are very cheap to produce So they are sometimes used to promote a product At most technical trade fairs many exhibitors will promote their products by giving away free drives 

In other situations they may be sold at less than wholesale price or included as a bonus with another product

Usually such drives will be stamped with a companys logo as a form of advertising 

The drive may be blank drive or already have documents or software loaded on to it These are called preloaded drives 

Some preloaded drives are read only but most can be used as a normal flash drive

The large memory size of newer flash drives means that they are increasingly being used for short term backup of data For example one retail till system uses a Flash drive to record details of all of the sales for that day The drive is used as a backup medium At the close of business each night the drive is inserted and a database backup is saved to the drive The drive is removed at night and taken offsite

This photograph shows both sides of the printed circuit board inside a typical flash drive The flash drive in this photograph is a 64 MB USB 20 device with its plastic case removed 

One end of the device is fitted with a single type A USB connector Inside the plastic casing is a small highly cost engineered printed circuit board Mounted on this board is some simple power circuitry and a small number of surface mounted integrated circuits Typically one of these ICs provides an interface to the USB port another drives the onboard memory and the other is the flash memory

Most computers support USB

Flash drives are quite broken wikt linkrobustrobust They are not damaged by scratches and dust This makes them a good choice to move data from one place to another 

Some flash drives can keep the data even if they are put in water Some data may even survive the washing machine but this is not a designed feature and people should not rely on it Leaving the flash drive out to dry completely before allowing current to run through it has been known to result in a working drive with no future problems

Channel Fives Gadget Show cooked a flash drive with propane froze it with dry ice submerged it in various acidic liquids ran over it with a jeep and fired it against a wall with a mortar A company specializing in recovering lost data from computer drives then managed to recover all the data on the drive All data on the other removable storage devices tested using optical or magnetic technologies were destroyed

Flash drives are available in large sizes Currently at the start of 2010 the largest size publicly available is 256 gigabytes This will increase as the technology gets better

Flash drives use little power compared to hard drives and have no moving parts They are small and easy to carry

Most modern operating systems can use a flash drive without the need to install special software To most operating systems the flash drive looks like a hard drive The operating system can use any file system Some computers can start from a flash drive

Flash memory has a limited life Data can only be written to and read from a device a few thousand times People should keep this in mind when they use a flash drive to run application software or an operating system To address this as well as space limitations some developers have produced special versions of operating systems or commonplace applications designed to run from flash drives

Flash drives are small and are easily lost or left behind This can cause problems of data security

Flash drives can hold a large amount of information and they are used worldwide Many users store information on them that is personal or that should be protected For this reason more and more flash drives offer biometrics or encryption to control the access to this data Users can install passwords on to their flash drives so that when a user tries to open it the computer prompts the user to enter a password before they can begin using the device There are a number of free and open source programs which can be used to encrypt data including TrueCrypt pgpdisk and FreeOTFE These programs have proved useful in securing data on flash drives

The ostrich is a large flightless bird that lives in Africa They are the largest living bird species and have the biggest eggs of all living birds Ostriches do not fly but can run faster than any other bird 

They are ratites a useful grouping of medium to large flightless birds Ostriches have the biggest eyes of all land animals

Ostriches have long legs and a long neck but they have a small head Male ostriches have black feathers and female ostriches have gray and brown feathers Both males and females have white feathers on their wings and tails Male ostriches can be 18  27 meters 6  9 feet tall while female ostriches are 17  2 meters 55  65 ft tall They can run with a speed of about 65 kilometers per hour40 miles per hour

Ostriches now only live in Africa They live in open grassland called savannas in the Sahel and in parts of East Africa and south west Africa Some ostriches live in areas of the Sahara desert There used to be ostriches in Middle East in the 20th century and further back also in Asia Humans hunted and ate the ostriches They are now extinct in those area

Ostriches mainly eat plant matter but they also eats insects The plant matter consists of seeds shrubs grass fruits and flowers while the insects they eat including locusts Ostriches do not have teeth and so cannot grind food as mammals do Instead they swallow pebbles An adult ostrich carries about 1 kilogram of stones in its gizzard a special sac just before the stomach The pebbles grind the food and help its digestion When eating their gullet is filled with food After that the food is passed down their esophagus in the form of a ball called a bolus The bolus may be as much as 210 ml Ostriches can live without drinking for several days

Ostriches normally spend the winter months in pairs or alone During breeding season and sometimes during extreme rainless periods Ostriches live in nomadic groups of five to 50 birds that often travel together with other grazing animals such as zebras or antelopes 

With their acute eyesight and hearing Ostriches can sense predators such as lions from far away When being pursued by a predator they have been known to reach speeds in excess of Convert70kmh and can maintain a steady speed of Convert50kmh which makes the Ostrich the worlds fastest two legged animal When lying down and hiding from predators the birds lay their heads and necks flat on the ground making them appear as a mound of earth from a distance This even works for the males as they hold their wings and tail low so that the heat haze of the hot dry air that often occurs in their habitat aids in making them appear as a nondescript dark lump

Ostriches can tolerate a wide range of temperatures In much of their habitat temperatures vary as much as Convert40C changesigfig2 between night and day Their temperature control mechanism relies on action by the bird which uses its wings to cover the naked skin of the upper legs and flanks to conserve heat or leaves these areas bare to release heat

Ostriches become sexually mature when they are 2 to 4 years old females mature about six months earlier than males The mating process differs in different regions Territorial males hiss and use other sounds to claim mating rights over a harem of two to seven hens 

Fights usually last just minutes but they can easily cause death through slamming their heads into opponents The successful male will then be allowed to breed with all the females in an area but will only form a pair bond with the dominant female

The females lay their fertilized eggs in a single communal nest a simple pit convert30to60cmin deep and convert3mft wide scraped in the ground by the male The dominant female lays her eggs first and when it is time to cover them for incubation she discards extra eggs from the weaker females leaving about 20 in most cases 

Ostrich eggs are the largest of all eggs though they are actually the smallest eggs relative to the size of the adult bird on average they are convert15cmin long convert13cmin wide and weigh convert14kglb over 20 times the weight of a chicken egg The eggs are incubated by the females by day and by the males by night This uses the colouration of the two sexes to escape detection of the nest as the drab female blends in with the sand while the black male is nearly undetectable in the night The incubation period is 35 to 45 days 

Males and females cooperate in rearing chicks The male defends the hatchlings and teaches them to feed The survival rate is low for the hatchlings with an average of one per nest surviving to adulthood 

When threatened the ostrich will either hide itself by lying flat against the ground or will run away If cornered it can attack with a kick from its powerful legs Common predators of nests and young ostriches include jackals various birds of prey mongoose and vultures Animals that prey on ostriches of all ages include cheetahs lions leopards african dogs and spotted hyena Ostriches can often outrun their predators in a pursuit and can even outpace cheetahs over long distances However they may sometimes fight fiercely against predators especially when chicks are being defended They have sometimes killed lions in such fights

There is no no doubt that the ratites are not a monophyletic group because they are not descended from a single ancestor That means the taxonomy of the group is going to change and they will not all be placed in the Order Struthioniformes as they have been However as ornothologists have not yet agreed on a new classification for the time being the useful term ratites is still used

Ostriches are likely to be placed alone in the order Struthioniformes They have a number of peculiarities which suggest a separate evolution from the rest of the ratites They lack a gallbladder They have three stomachs and the caecum is convert71cminabron long Unlike all other living birds the Ostrich secretes uric acid separately from faeces Unlike all other birds who store the uric acid and faeces together and excrete them together ostriches store the faeces at the end of their rectum They also have unique pubic bones that are fused to hold their gut Unlike most birds the males have a penis which is retractable and convert8incmabron long Their palate differs from other ratites

Ostriches are farmed in several countries They used to be prized for their feathers but are now farmed for their meat and eggs Their skin can also be used to make leather

When threatened Ostriches run away but they can cause serious injury and death with kicks from their powerful legs Their legs can only kick forward 

Ostriches reared entirely by humans may not direct their courtship behaviour at other Ostriches but toward their human keepers Ostriches live 30 to 40 years on average

It is sometimes said that ostriches will hide their heads in the ground when they are scared but this is not true

In some countries people race each other on the back of Ostriches The practice is common in Africa and is relatively unusual elsewhere The Ostriches are ridden in the same way as horses with special saddles reins and bits However they are harder to manage than horses

Most sharks are predators meaning they hunt and eat fish marine mammals and other sea creatures but the largest shark eats krill like whales This is the whale shark the largest fish in the world Some common kinds of shark include the hammerhead shark the great white shark the tiger shark and the mako

Many sharks are now endangered but some are still hunted for food or sport fishing

Sharks come in many different shapes and sizes but most are long and thin with powerful jaws Their teeth are constantly replaced throughout their lives Sharks eat so violently they often break a few teeth so new teeth grow continuously in a groove just inside the mouth and move forward from inside the mouth on conveyor belts formed by the skin in which they are attached to In its lifetime a shark can lose and regrow as many as 30000 teeth

Even with all those teeth though sharks can not chew So they bite their broken wikt linkpreyprey and jerk it around so they can pull of a chunk to swallow The chunks of food that a shark swallows ends up in its stomach where they are digested This is pretty slow however so a meal might take several days to digest This is why a shark does not eat every day

Sharks have different shaped teeth depending on what they eat For instance some sharks have sharp pointy teeth while bottom dwelling sharks have cone shaped teeth for crushing shells Because there are so many different kinds of sharks and because each kind has its own kind of special teeth many people enjoy collecting shark teeth Shark teeth collectors can guess how large a shark was by measuring the shark tooth First they measure the length of the tooth in inches Every inch of tooth equals 10ft of shark length so if a shark tooth is 2 inches long the tooth came from a shark that was 20 ft longEven more terrifying is that some of the megalodon teeth are 6 inches long so that indicates a shark 60 feet

Sharks have skin covered in millions of tiny teeth like scales that point to the tail If you rub along a shark towards the tail it would feel smooth but if you rub the other way it would be rough Sharks teeth are 20 times as big as human teeth and they can grow back several times if they are lost

Most sharks have an excellent sense of smell which they use to find prey Their two very sensitive nostrils can detect blood from miles away Sometimes a shark can have lots of tiny holes all over the sharks snout especially between the eye and the tip of the snout which are nerve receptors called the ampullae of Lorenzini p23 They can sense electricity in the water They need to sense electricity because every animal in the water gives off electricity Every time an animals heart beats or it moves tiny currents of electricity are made These tiny electric currents make signals that travel through water and get sensed In fact sharks use this sense even more than they use their sight when they catch their prey

Because sharks have skeletons made of cartilage they do not fossilize easily Thats because cartilage is softer than bone and falls apart before fossilizing However teeth are harder and if that is not enough they are shed throughout a sharks lifetime Therefore shark teeth are one of the most common fossils

Sharks existed for at least two hundred million years before the dinosaurs The earliest shark fossils were scales so could it be that the earliest sharks were toothless We are not sure Early sharks did not look like sharks of today For example the upper snout of modern sharks is longer than the lower jaw But in early sharks they were the same length 

The first modern looking sharks appeared in the Age of Dinosaurs Sharks back then were preyed upon by giant sea reptiles

Just a few million years ago a giant shark called Megalodon swam in the seas It was 18 meters long twice as long as the closely related great white shark and it ate whales Luckily for us Megalodon died out 16 million years ago

Most sharks are broken wikt linkovoviviparousovoviviparous This means shark eggs usually develop and broken wikt linkhatchhatch inside the females body As a result sharks are born fully developed and can even swim and catch prey as soon as they are born A female shark is pregnant for a short time it will only take two months for a shark to develop and come out from its mother

Some shark pups attack and eat the other pups growing inside the mother so a few of these baby predators do not make it to their birthdays

Not all sharks give birth to live young Some sharks will lay egg cases which are often called mermaids purses They come in lots of shapes and sizes depending on the kind of shark that laid them The baby shark develops inside the egg case and when it is fully developed the egg case splits and the shark swims out Most egg cases are rectangular and others are spiral shaped

Some good ways to be less noticeable to sharks are

Vultures are large birds of prey that usually feed on carrion Vultures use their large wings to soar in the air for many miles without having to flap Vultures are also called buzzards

Vultures from the Old World are not related to the vultures of the New World They look quite similar though Both have heads and necks with no feathers 

Old World vultures are related to eagles and hawks and use sight to find their food New World vultures are related to storks and use their sense of smell to find their food Vultures symbolize death in literature

King Vultures use rocks to open eggs they pick up a rock with there beak and simply drop or throw they rock onto the egg and breaks it

New World vultures is a name which is used for a number of species in the Americas The best known of these are probably the Andean Condor and the Black Vulture

Eagles are large birds of prey that are related to hawks falcons and Old World vultures Eagles hunt during the day and have very good eyesight

The bald eagle is a large eagle from North America that is identified by its bright white head and tail It is the national bird of the United States and usually eats fish 

The golden eagle is found over most of the world and it usually eats small mammals 

Sometimes eagle can just mean any large hawk as a group eagles are not closely related to one another 

The largest eagle that has ever lived is Haasts Eagle It is the only eagle in the world ever to have been top predator of its ecosystem Though it is now extinct it resided in New Zealand

Falcons are small birds of prey and are related to hawks and eagles They usually have pointed wings and long tails Most falcons eat small mammals that they hunt using eyesight although some species hunt other birds which they take in flight Like hawks most falcons have dark gray or brown backs and wings with white undersides The Peregrine falcon is found over most of the world and is famous for hunting birds by diving down on them at 320 kmh It was nearly wiped out in North America by the use of pesticides but has since made a recovery

The Iliad is the oldest surviving work of Greek literature Originally an oral epic poem meaning it used to be said not read it was written down in the 8th century BC It is an epic or very long poem made up of 24 chapters written in hexameters It is probably based on a real event the attack on Troy by the Mycenaeans The poem includes early Greek myths and legends Today we say that Homer is the author though some may not agree

The story takes place in the Trojan War It talks about the confrontations of the warrior Achilles and King Agamemnon The story itself covers only a few weeks at the end of the war but it also talks about many of the Greek myths about the war It tells the story from the wrath of Achilles to the death and funeral of Hector and the siege of Troy

Together with its sequel the Odyssey it is one of the two major Greek epic poems Traditionally both are attributed to Homer

Some important characters in the Iliad are Achilles Odysseus Agamemnon Menelaus Priam Hector Paris and Helen

The poem starts with the god Apollo having sent a plague to the Greeks because they captured the daughter of one of his priests Agamemnon is forced to give her back but also takes away Briseis from her owner Achilles Achilles is angry and refuses to fight But when his friend Patroclus is killed by Hector he starts to fight again and kills Hector in a duel Later Hectors father Priam comes in secret to Achilles to take back his favorite sons body to give it a proper funeral which Achilles allows him to do The poem ends with the funeral of Hector

According to the WHO a drug is a substance that can change how a living organism works Food is usually not seen as a drug even though some foods may have such properties Most of the time drugs are taken to treat a disease or other medical condition An example for such drugs may be Aspirin or Paracetamol These are usually given to treat fever as well as certain infections If such drugs are taken over a longer time they are usually prescribed by a doctor Other drugs are taken for fun because of the effect they have Some of these drugs taken for fun are better accepted by society than others Having or taking certain drugs may be illegal in certain countries 

Drugs that are taken to treat a disease or condition are usually called therapeutic drugs that are taken for fun are called recreational drugs 

Drugs may have other effects than those wanted Such effects are generally known as side effects

Drugs act differently in different amounts It is therefore important to take the right amount The amount of the drug taken is called a dose Aspirin is often prescribed against fever or as an analgesic One of the side effects of Aspirin is that it makes the blood thinner For this reason it can also be used to prevent strokes or heart attacks  in a much lower dose than the one used to treat fever though 

Taking too much of a drug can cause sickness or even death When a doctor says how much of a drug to take only that amount should be taken It is very important to keep taking the drug until the doctor says to stop because someone can feel better but still be sick When a doctor says what drug to take how much of it and for how long it is called a prescription Drugs may cause addiction Some drugs are illegal because they are very addictive These drugs are really expensive too

Recreational drugs can sometimes be bad for someones health even if they make them feel good Alcohol can also be dangerous if the person drinking it drives a vehicle after drinking This is called drunk driving Many countries make this against the law Common recreational drugs include

Certain recreational drugs also have uses as a therapeutic drug Heroin can be used as an analgesic and methamphetamine is used to treat narcolepsy or ADHD Recreational drugs can be dangerous certain countries have made it illegal to have or take them outside a medical context Most of the time this is because they can be addictive or that they are very dangerous when combined with other drugs That way Cannabis based products are legal in the Netherlands but illegal in many other countries

Alcohol and Nicotine are legal almost everywhere but there are a lot of taxes on the sale of these In other words they are expensive to buy Being expensive to buy because of taxes has two benefits one is that the taxes collected from the sale of the drugs goes into helping to pay for assistance the drug user may experience later A smoker for example may develop cancer later in life and need treatment at a place that is granted a certain amount of tax money from the government to keep it operating Another benefit to the taxing of legal drugs is that the high price may stop people from beginning the habit in the first place which will help them avoid the negative medical or addictive side effects of the drug In some cases not everyone is allowed to buy these drugs unless they are a minimal age to do so The age at which someone is allowed to buy a legal drug is most often decided by the government of a country state or province and is usually the age where a person is considered by the law to be an adult Some of the most common ages this happens is at 18 19 or 21 years of age

On his journey home after the Trojan War Odysseus lands on the island of the Cyclops Polyphemus The Cyclopes were a race of rough uncivilized one eyed giants Odysseus and his men come to the cave where Polyphemus lives and then they go inside at the sight of sheep cheese and milk But when Polyphemus comes back he stops them from escaping his cave by blocking the entrance with a boulder Then he rips apart and eats some of Odysseus men Odysseus wants to use his sword to kill Polyphemus but he knows only the Cyclops is strong enough to move the boulder blocking the exit to the cave Odysseus a clever hero then thinks of a plan to get away He tells Polyphemus that his name is Nobody and gives him wine to drink Drunk Polyphemus falls asleep Odysseus and his men find a wooden pole heat it red hot in the fire and poke it into Polyphemus only eye blinding him When Polyphemus cries out in agony the other Cyclopes on the island answer his cry From outside his cave they asked him who is killing him Polyphemus replied with Nobody is killing me so the other Cyclopes left him The next morning Polyphemus lets his sheep out of the cave but touches their backs to make sure none of Odysseus men are escaping on them Odysseus and his men hold themselves on the underside of the sheep so they can get out When Odysseus was on his ship again he called out to Polyphemus and told him his real name Polyphemus was very angry and threw a giant rock at them nearly hitting the ship Then as revenge he prayed to his father Poseidon that Odysseus would never make it home to Ithaca and if he was fated to make it home Odysseus would lose all of his men his ship and find trouble at home The latter prayer became the plot line of the Odyssey

Odysseus and his ship have to pass the Sirens island The Sirens were always singing very beautifully so sailors would try to go to them but their ships would get destroyed and they would die Odysseus tells his men to put wax in their ears so they will not hear the song of the sirens He also tells his men to bind him to the ships mast so he cannot go to the sirens when he hears their song His men can then look at Odysseus and see when he cannot hear the sirens anymore because he is calm again Then they can take the wax out of their ears and free Odysseus

After escaping from the sea and the death of his men Odysseus comes to the island Ogygia On this island lives the nymph Calypso and Odysseus stayed with her for seven years But then the god Hermes came and told her that the gods said that she had to let Odysseus go Calypso promised Odysseus immortality if he stayed but he wanted to go back to his wife Penelope So Odysseus built a raft and left her

After a storm Odysseus comes to the island of the Phaeacians There he is found by the kings daughter Nausica Nausica brings him to the palace of her father King Alkinoos During his time there Odysseus tell the story of his journey After this Alkinoos gives Odysseus a ship and sends him home to Ithaca

The fermentation gives the kimchi a pickle like quality and generally soggy or limp kimchi is not good

The most common variety of kimchi is made from cabbage radish garlic red pepper salt and sugar The cabbage is soaked in salt water for a few hours Coarse rock salt is then rubbed in between the leaves of the cabbage Red peppers are also rubbed in and most kimchi has a lot of pepper in it

The radish is usually cut into long thin strips and added to the mix A little sugar is added to help the fermentation process along much in the same way beer is made

The amounts of each ingredient vary between the type of kimchi you are making and the personal taste of the maker Most kimchi has a special taste with shrimp or fish

A vacuum tube is an electronic device used in many older model radios television sets and amplifiers

John Ambrose Fleming invented the first vacuum tube the diode in 1904 Lee De Forest created the audion in 1906 and used in the first telephone amplifiers

Vacuum tubes produce a lot of heat as they have a filament like a light bulb and being made of glass they are fragile and can break Vacuum tubes were used in the first computers like the ENIAC which demanded lots of maintenance because of the heat produced

For this reason when the transistor was invented in the 1960s most manufacturers of radios television sets and amplifiers began using transistors instead of vacuum tubes Transistors were also much smaller worked on lower voltages used much less power were much less likely to be damaged by being dropped and had extremely long life Eventually they were also much cheaper than glass valves

In the 2000s vacuum tube devices are rarely used in common electronic equipment The most common use is likely to be the cathode ray tube used for the picture display in television receivers though these are rapidly being replaced by non vacuum tube types such as liquid crystal and plasma displays

There are still a few applications that use vacuum tubes

Skagerrak is a sea in the northern part of Europe between Norway and Denmark Skagerrak is a part of the North Sea To the east is Kattegat

Close to the Norwegian coast is a deep trench the rest of the sea is shallow Oil and gas are produced from rigs in the Skagerrak

Kattegat is a sea in the northern part of Europe between the Danish peninsula Jutland the Danish island Zealand and the western coast of Sweden

To the north west is Skagerrak Kattegat is connected to the Baltic Sea through the Danish Straits and Belts

The Baltic Sea is a sea in northern Europe between Scandinavia Finland Russia the Baltic countries Poland and Germany

Many big rivers in the surrounding countries drain into the Baltic Sea The Baltic Sea is connected to the ocean through the narrow and shallow Danish straits and belts For this reason the water has a low content of salt so the northern parts of the sea freeze over in the winter The ice can carry cars and roads are established every winter between the islands in the archipelagos between Sweden and Finland

For several thousand years the Baltic Sea has connected the countries at her shores For that reason you will find many cultural similarities in these countries And since most of these countries are European this sea is also considered European 

Scandinavia is a group of countries in northern Europe that includes Norway Sweden and Denmark Scandinavia is more useful as a linguistic term rather than geographic however because it also refers to the area where Scandinavian languages are spoken The Scandinavian languages are closely related and many Scandinavians are able to understand some of the other languages though with difficulty

The Scandinavian Peninsula is a large peninsula reaching west from northern Europe over the north side of the Baltic Sea Norway Sweden and some of Finland are on the peninsula also known as Fennoscandia Denmark not Finland however is regarded as part of Scandinavia This is because Danish is a Scandinavian language but Finnish is not

The term Nordic countries is sometimes used as a more correct geographical term but the Nordic countries include Norway Sweden Denmark Finland and Iceland These five countries coordinate political and cultural activities through the Nordic Council Denmark Sweden and Finland are also members of the European Union but only Finland uses the euro while the other Nordic countries still use their own currency each called krone or krona Norway and Iceland which are not members of the EU are members of NATO Only Denmark is a member of both the EU and NATO

The Scandinavian Peninsula is sparsely populated and covered with large forests of pine birch and spruce The western and northern parts are mountainous the Scandinavian mountains are some of the oldest in the world The tallest mountain is Galdhpiggen in Norway Denmark is the smallest of the Scandinavian countries It is more densely populated and most of the land is farmland Sweden is the largest of the Scandinavian countries It has the most lakes and the landscape ranges from plains in the south to mountains in the west to tundra in the north The far north of Scandinavia and Finland is called Lapland where the Sami people live Some of them still herd reindeer as they have for centuries but the Sami mostly live in a modernised society equal to that of other Scandinavians

The best known stereotypes of Scandinavian people relate to the Vikings of the Middle Ages The Vikings from Sweden are best known as traders traveling as far as what we now know as Ukraine and starting trade routes to bring goods from the Middle East to Scandinavia The Vikings from Norway are best known as explorers crossing the North Atlantic in their longships and settling Iceland and Greenland The Norwegian explorers even reached the east coast of what we now call Canada where they set up a colony but it only lasted a few years The Vikings from Denmark however left the biggest mark on the English The Danish raiders attacked England repeatedly and brutally demanding payment that came to be called Danegeld and making the priests and bishops of churches along the eastern coast England say and write down the famous prayer deliver us O Lord from the wrath of the Norsemen But the modern stereotypes of the Vikings actually were invented much later in the 19th century when Richard Wagner and other people of the Romantic period invented descriptions of ancient Germanic culture in the opera and the other arts often showing Vikings wearing furs and winged or horned helmets and drinking from large horns

The normal meaning of the name Scandinavia is Denmark Norway and Sweden as those three countries are on or near the Scandinavia peninsula However Finland and Iceland are sometimes also thought of as part of Scandinavia The people of Scandinavia do not consider Finland and Iceland to be Scandinavian countries but part of what they call the Nordic countries

Marriage is a union between two people It is like a contract Sometimes people also call this matrimony The fact of being married is called wedlock Very often people celebrate that they are getting married The ceremony is usually called a wedding

Some countries and religious communities also permit the union of two partners of the same sex This is generally known as same sex marriage In the Netherlands the marriage law was changed to allow such unions called Marriage Other countries that allow them sometimes have a different name for them

Usually there is also a spiritual part of marriage In addition to the civil act there is sometimes a religious one If both partners are Christians they may marry in a church for example There are certain restrictions on who can marry or be married those closely related like brothers and sisters usually cannot marry This is usually to prevent problems for the children Those marrying also have to be of a certain age to be able to marry If that age is not specified it is usually the age of consent 

There are many reasons why men and women marry but they usually include one or more of the following

In Western cultures a wedding ceremony usually consists of the couple exchanging vows and rings following which the couple kiss There is often a party afterward called a reception During the reception the couple often cut a cake and have their first dance together The man getting married is called the bridegroom and the woman getting married is called the bride Within Western cultures the bride usually wears a white dress because white symbolizes purity and sometimes wears a thin piece of white cloth called a veil The groom lifts the veil before or after the vows are taken

Often after the wedding the newlywed couple will take a vacation which is called a honeymoon

Marriage usually leads to rights and obligations to those married these may include

Marriage is also about sexual intercourse being unable to have sex being unwilling to have sex or having sex outside the marriage may be a reason to undo the marriage

In Indian culture marriage is considered to be holy and divine and is a union of Goddess Laxmi and God Narayan

In 1883 a young Belgian called Sylvain de Jong settled in Antwerp Belgium He started a bicycle factory over there By the end of that century he started producing motorbikes and after a while cars as well In 1903 he grounded the NV Minerva Motors in Berchem A certain Charles S Rolls was Minerva dealer in England The small 1 cylinder Minervette was there with its 105 Pound the cheapest car 

In the years after the fame of the cars was rising enormous Most important market for the constructor remained however England that took the biggest part of the production followed by the Netherlands and France From 1908 Minerva got a worldwide Knight licence The Knight motor was a motor without valves developed by Charles Y Knight in the United States These motors were extremely silent The company did well in several car racing competitions in Europe After worldwar I during which Sylvain de Jong and his engineers headed to Amsterdam where they kept on developing parts they returned to start up the production of luxury cars The constructors star rose in the United States as well American filmstars politicians and industrials liked them cars as well The car had the same qualities as the Rolls Royce but was a little cheaper With the economical crisis in the 30s the company went bankrupt in 1936 The remains were taken over by another Belgian constructor named Imperia Imperia putted the name Minerva on their cars for export to England and France and for the trucks 

After worldwar II the company produced Land Rovers under licence for the Belgian army Production of these 4Wheel Drives stopped in 1953 The company struggled for survival and made some Land Rover like cars till 1956 But than the constructor diappeared completely Nowadays are still several Minervas all over the world in a driveable condition

Raffles Institution is a highly regarded secondary school in Singapore Only boys can go to this school It has been performing well in studies and sports It was founded in 1823 as Singapore Institution by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles the founder of modern Singapore It is the school with the longest history in Singapore Its name was changed to Raffles Institution in 1868 It has two sections Raffles Institution and Raffles Institution Junior College The current principal of Raffles Institution is Lim Lai Cheng Koh Chin Nguang was the Headmaster before her and left the school at the end of 2008

Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles founded Raffles Institution on 5 June 1823 making it the school with the longest history in Singapore Raffles Institution was along Bras Basah Road at first where Raffles City is now The school moved to Grange Road in 1973 and then moved to its current location at Bishan in 1990 The Grange Road campus is now the MOE Teachers Network

RIs school song was written in by E W Jesudason RIs headmaster from 1963 to 1966 These are its lyrics

When Stamford Raffles held the torch

That cast Promethean Flame

We faced the challenge of the day

To give our school a name

The eagle eye and gryphon strength

They led us to the fore

To reign supreme in evry sphere

The sons of Singapore

Come heed the call Rafflesians all

And let our hearts be stirring

Well do our best whateer the test

And keep our colours flying

Let comradeship and fervent hope

With one voice make us pray

Auspicium Melioris Aevi

With God to guide the way

Although the anthem refers to Prometheus and God the school is secular The inclusion of Prometheus is due to the literary allusion to passing the torch signifying the importance of education while God in this context is a historical legacy of the schools British roots The current recording of the anthem is in the key of G Major

RIs crest came from Sir Stamford Raffles familys crest

The gryphon  the purple headed animal at the top of the crest  means stability and success The lower half of the gryphon that looks like a lion means that RI is in Singapore since Singapore also has a Lion symbolFactdateMay 2009 The eagle on the shield has two heads One looks at the past and one looks at the future It can also be said that one looks at the East and one looks at the West

The schools motto on the banner below the shield  Auspicium Melioris Aevi  is Latin and mistranslated by the school as Hope for a Better Age

RI has won many awards from the Ministry of Education RI has also won the School Excellence Award the best award from MOE

Secondary 1 students attend a camp in January when they come into RI The camp is 3 days long Some Secondary 4 students accompany them There is an activity during the camp when Secondary 1 students have to take off their shirts and blindfold themselves They form a line and walk up and down staircases in the school After the camp the Secondary 1 students are given the RI badge Then they are RI students

Secondary 3 students attend a camp in January too They go to Pulau Ubin for 5 days When they come back they can wear long pants

RI is 12 hectares big There are six blocks in RI

The Administrative Block was the most important building in RI People divide it into two  Administrative Block One and Administrative Block Two In between the two parts there are Lecture Theatres

There is the General Office and Staff Rooms There are also circular areas for people to study and a big circular area called the Main Atrium for people to assemble at There is also the ORA Office and Heritage Center There are also lecture theaters

The Administrative Block is next to the Senior Block the Science Block the Junior Block the CCA Block and a bus stop The Administrative Block was renovated in 2007

The Science Hub has many Science labs They are in Administrative Block One and also the Science Block

There are normal labs for Science lessons and special labs for people to do researchTh The HODScience office is also in the Science Hub

The Science Hub was finished in October 2008 A ceremony was held to celebrate this

The Humanities Hub contains classrooms for History Geography and Literature There will also be two circular theaters for people to speak or perform It was temporarily open to the public on 23 May 2009

RI has three lectures theaters an AV Theatrette and a Band Room Sometimes people have classes in the three lecture theaters and the AV Theatrette instead of their classroom while sometimes teachers meet in these theaters The Military Band uses the Band Room for practice

RI has many infocomm facilities Infocomm is about computers There are four computer labs one Internet Lab for people to see how the Internet works one Robotics Lab and one Macintosh Lab which has special computers

The Junior Block was built in 1997 There are four floors There are

The Junior Block has a retractable roof which means the roof can be opened

The ArtSpace was formerly called the Design Centre It comprises various facilities The first floor houses the art galleries classrooms jamming studio music keyboard laboratory a Macintosh Lab a drawing studio and a ceramics studio The gymnasium comprising training areas for gymnastics table tennis and judo occupies the second floor while lock ups for the Uniformed Groups and the Guitar Ensemble are located on third level The roof of the ArtSpace houses the schools mini weather station

An archipelago is a chain or group of islands The word archipelago means chief sea from Greek arkhon and pelagos

Archipelagos are usually found in the open sea less commonly a big land mass may neighbor them an example being Scotland which has more than 700 islands surrounding the mainland Archipelagoes are often volcanic forming along mid ocean ridges or hotspots but there are many other processes involved in their construction including erosion deposition and land elevation

The four biggest countries that are mainly archipelagos are Japan the Philippines the United Kingdom and Indonesia 

The biggest archipelago in the world by size is in Northern Canada the Canadian Arctic Archipelago which is in the Arctic Ocean

The Baltic States are three countries in northern Europe surrounding the Baltic Sea

Topography means the description of shape

When you talk of the topography of the land you refer to the landscape features like valleys hills and mountains rivers and lakes or the coastline Everything that describes the form of the landscape is part of the topography

Bornholm is a small rocky island in the Baltic Sea Bornholm is a Danish island

The island is a popular holiday resort for Scandinavians Germans and Poles Many yachters come here in the summer

Budapest is the capital city of Hungary It was made as such in 1873 In that year three towns on the River Danube namely Buda buda and Pest were united The city has a population of about 17 million people Its highest place is Jnos Hill

The main sights in Budapest are the Castle Hill the Parliament House and St Stephens Basilica Budapest is also known for the ruins of Aquincum the capital city of the Roman Province of Pannonia The city has a great atmosphere with nice cafes spas and the traditional Hungarian hospitality

Santa Monica is a beach town in California It is next to Los Angeles California USA

It was made a city in 1886 In 2000 there were 88050 people living there 

It is famous for the Santa Monica Pier that has many fun rides 

Kuwait is a small country in the Middle East

It has a small and rich economy It has about 96 billion barrels of crude oil reserves Crude oil reserves are the oil that is still under the ground and has not yet been cleaned up Kuwait has 10 of all of the oil reserves in the world The country makes a lot of money by selling oil This money is almost half of all the money the country makes The oil money is also 95 of the money made by selling things to different countries Also the oil money is 80 of the money the government makes Kuwait is now talking with oil companies of other countries to make oil fields in the northern part of the country 

Kuwaits weather makes farming hard Instead of farming the country catches fish and buys food from other countries About 75 of the countrys water to drink has to be distilled or purchased from other countries

In 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait This started the first Gulf War

Kuwaits official religion is Islam although 15 of its population are Christian or Hindu Arabic is mostly spoken in Kuwait but English is widespread among Kuwaitis Kuwait is one of the few nations that has education for every age

Below is information about the people of Kuwait

Herbert Buckingham Khaury better known as Tiny Tim was an American singer and musician He became popular in the late 1960s due to his appearances on television and songs played on ukulele with a falsetto voice His most famous song was Tiptoe Through the Tulips His best remembered television appearances were on Laugh In and The Tonight Show His first wedding took place on The Tonight Show in 1969 at host Johnny Carsons suggestion

Not just a performer he was also an expert broken wikt linkmusicologymusicologist who studied American music from the earliest days of the United States and performed many historic songs in his act Over time he used his falsetto voice less and performed most songs in his natural baritone voice

When his popularity as a broken wikt linkpop starpop star lessened he performed in small nightclubs and other places as he had earlier During the 1980s he toured with a circus and appeared in a movie as a circus performer who turned to crime In the 1990s he recorded new music and joined comedian Pat Paulsen in his latest mock campaign to become President of the United States as Paulsens broken wikt linkrunning materunning mate

Married three times his last wife was a former fan who met him when she made a documentary about his life and career One of his later supporters was radio talk show host Howard Stern Tiny Tim died in 1996 after suffering a heart attack during a performance

The kelvin is the SI unit of temperature It is named in honour of the physicist William Thomson the first Lord Kelvin

The Kelvin scale is defined by a specific relationship between the pressure of a gas and the temperature This says that the pressure of the gas is directly proportional to the temperature in Kelvin This means that Kelvin is an absolute temperature scale and scientists use this scale more than any other

The kelvin is a base SI unit of measurement defined as the fraction 127316 of the temperature of the triple point of water which is the temperature at which water in solid liquid and gaseous state coexist in equilibrium

The temperature of the triple point of water is a hundredth of a degree Celsius above the freezing point or 001 C The coldest possible temperature is called absolute zero and is equal to 27315 degrees Celsius or zero kelvin By writing temperatures in kelvins one does not need to use negative numbers

The absolute temperature scale was designed so that a change in temperature of 1 kelvin is equal to a change of 1 degree Celsius This means that it is easy to convert a temperature from degrees Celsius to kelvin

It is important to notice that the name of this unit is simply kelvin not degree Kelvin In English it undergoes normal plural inflection as kelvins In scientific discourse it is simply referred to as kelvin ie 200 kelvin

Tourism can mean when people travel for fun and also the industry that helps these people

People who travel for fun are called tourists Places that a lot of people visit are called resorts

There are a lot of reasons why people travel for fun

The tourism industry has many different parts Some of these are

Tourism can bring damage to the local area Litter scuba diving deforestation are a real problem for popular places such as St Lucia Hawaii and other exotic places Scuba diving can cause damage to coral reefs which are home to 100s of species of sea animals

Tourism can damage the local culture certain local traditions are being put aside for tourists

Berkshire is also named Royal Berkshire

The towns below are not part of Berkshire now but were in the past

Buckinghamshire is a county in central England near the south and London The county town is named Aylesbury

Locations marked with a are a part of the cerimonal county of Buckinghamshire but are governed by the Borough of Milton Keynes

A computer monitor is an electronic device that shows pictures A monitor is usually used to see programs on a computer The main difference between a monitor and a television is that a monitor does not have a television tuner to change channels A monitor may be used to watch television if it is connected to a device that has a television tuner Some models of monitor can be used as a television and some televisions are used with computers A monitor has a better display resolution than a television to make it easier to see smaller letters and graphics on

There are two main types of monitors

In geometry the diameter of a circle is its measurement from one side directly to the opposite side The diameter is twice the radius

1904 was a leap year starting on Friday of the Gregorian calendar

Unknown dates 

The Commonwealth of Dominica is an island nation in the Caribbean Sea It is between the French speaking territories of Guadeloupe and Martinique The island measures 751 km in area Roseau is its capital Portsmouth is another main town Almost seventy thousand people live on the island

The currency of the island is the East Caribbean dollar

The islands name comes from the Latin for Sunday Dies Dominica It is not to be confused with the Spanish speaking Dominican Republic in the Greater Antilles

Because of the lush beauty and untouched splendor it boasts it is nicknamed the Nature Island of the Caribbean

The President of Dominica is Nicholas Liverpool its prime minister is Roosevelt Skerrit

Dominica was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1493 In 1763 it became a territory of the United Kingdom from which its independence was received on 3 November 1978

In August 1979 Hurricane David the most powerful storm to hit the island wiped out its entire infrastructure

In 1980 Dame Eugenia Charles became its prime minister the first female government leader in the West Indies

On 21 November 2004 the island was hit by its most destructive earthquake in history Portsmouth and the northern area were deeply affected

Dominica is most famously depicted in Jean Rhys classic prequel to Jane Eyre Wide Sargasso Sea

  

Playing cards is the name for the 54 cards used in a lot of games like poker bridge blackjack and solitaire

There are 52 basic cards in a deck These cards have a suit and a number There are 4 suits and 13 ranks in each suit There are also two Jokers that do not have a suit or a rank

spades hearts diamonds clubs In many countries different suit signs may be used In central Europe there are cards with the suit signs of acorns leaves hearts and bells In Italy and Latin America there are playing cards with the suits of clubs swords cups and coins and Aces

Signs for Traditional People

Spades Hearts Diamonds Clubs

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Jack Queen King Ace In most games the ace is the highest value but in some games it is the lowest

Jacks Queens and Kings are called Face Cards because the cards have pictures of their names The King of Hearts is also called the Suicide King because he is sometimes pictured holding a knife in his head Originally the king had an axe and over the years the head of the axe was dropped from the picture What was left looks like a sword thus making the king look like he is stabbing himself in the head Many other cards have nicknames too 2 cards are also known as deuces 3 cards as treys Aces as bullets Kings as cowboys The king of diamonds is also known as the man with the axe The one eyed jacks are the jack of hearts and the jack of spades

For many games the Jokers are removed from the deck making the total number of cards in the deck 52 Sometimes the deck is reduced to 40 36 or 32 cards for playing some games like belote sheepshead or euchre The tarot deck with 78 cards is also a deck of playing cards Although it is common to use the tarot for fortune telling people in many European countries also play card games with tarot cards People have also used standard playing cards for fortune telling

An emperor is a male who rules an empire An emperor usually comes to power when one of his parents dies In some countries people elected a new emperor from candidates 

The wife of an emperor is called an empress A woman who comes to power in an empire is also called an empress

The only emperor in the world today is the ruler of Japan In history many countries had emperors at different times including China Rome Germany Ethiopia Turkey India France and Russia

Fresno is the closest major city to Yosemite National Park Fresno has a major airport called Fresno Yosemite International Airport that has many flights by many airlines everyday It was the first airport to use the new security systems made after the September 11 2001 attacks

Astrophysics is the study of how stars and planets work and how we can learn about them Astrophysicists use physics to explain what astronomers find and see

Astrophysics is also the study of how the Universe started and how it is changing with time This part of astrophysics is called cosmology

A long time ago during the time of the Ancient Greeks people thought that the way things worked in the sky was different from the way things worked on Earth They also thought that they could not study how things in the sky worked This was because they could not do experiments with things in the sky but they could do experiments with things that are on the surface of the Earth

When people realized that by looking at the sky they were able to work out how the planets moved the science of astrophysics was born The first people to write books on how they thought the planets moved were Nicolaus Copernicus Galileo and Johannes Kepler

Sir Isaac Newton realized that the same rules of mechanics that he had found on the surface of the Earth also could be used to predict how the planets moved He said As above so below By this he meant that we can study how things work on this planet to find out how things work in space

Later scientists found that by looking at the light from stars they were able to work out what they were made from This process is called spectroscopy

There are two main types of astrophysics observational astrophysics and theoretical astrophysics

Observational astrophysics is like astronomy Like astronomers observational astrophysicists use telescopes to study the Universe but observational astrophysicists study the physics of what they see to explain the Universe

Theoretical astrophysicists use information from astronomers and tools such as computers to explain how the Universe works Cosmology is a type of theoretical astrophysics

Word order is a part of grammar It has to do with the order words are in a sentence The word order is often different between languages For example in English people say I only play tennis sometimes In German they would say Ich spiele nur manchmal Tennis which if they translate only the words says I play only sometimes tennis In Norwegian that same sentence would be Jeg spiller bare tennis noen ganger directly translated to I play only tennis some times in English In Portuguese this sentence could be Eu s jogo tnis algumas vezes translating each word to English I only play tennis some times Or even in Portuguese people can change the word order to Eu jogo tnis s algumas vezes but they cannot say Eu jogo s tnis algumas vezes because this means I play only tennis sometimes

In English a simple sentence with a verb subject and an object is written in a Subject Verb Object word order For example in the sentence Robert opens the door Robert is the subject opens is the verb and door is the object In other languages sentences like this can be in different orders For example in Latin that sentence could be written Robert ianuam aperit literally Robert the door opens It could even be written aperit ianuam Robert Languages that let you choose how to order the words often have a grammatical case system In that sentence ianuam is the accusative case of ianua Accusative case means that the noun is the object of the sentence Robert is in the nominative case which means that it is the subject of the sentence In English changing the word order to The door opens Robert will change the meaning of the sentence In Latin however Robert ianuam aperit and ianuam Robert aperit mean the same thing because ianuam is in the accusative case so it is the object and Robert is the subject Changing the cases of the words however to Robertem ianua aperit will change the meaning of the sentence  ianua is now in the nominative case so it is the subject and Robert is now the object

George Herbert Walker Bush was President of the United States between 1989 and 1993 He was born in Milton Massachusetts He was the son of Republican Senator Prescott Bush He worked for Zapata Oil in Texas and was a politician in Texas running for the Senate in 1964 but losing to Ralph Yarborough and later again in 1970 though losing again to Lloyd Bentsen He later served as a House Representative He also was Republican Party Chairman and attempted the vice presidency after Nixon resigned and Ford took office but lost to Nelson Rockefeller in 1974 

During World War II he was a crewman on a TBM Avenger He had survived many crashes and sunk a Japanese ship He later became a diplomat and head of the CIA 

He is the father of George W Bush another president and Jeb Bush the former governor of Florida He has two other sons His wife is Barbara Bush Because he has the same first and last names as his son he is often called George H W Bush or George Bush Sr Some people call him 41 or Bush 41 because he was the 41st President

After being Ronald Reagans vice president George HW Bush was elected president in 1988 While he was President the Cold War ended and the Soviet Union fell apart

When Saddam Hussein invaded its Kuwait in order to steal their supplies of oil George HW Bush lead the United States and many other countries to protect Kuwait The conflict was called the Gulf War He also invaded Panama to remove its dictator Manuel Noreiga who was guilty of drug trafficking

At home George HW Bush also signed in important laws such as The Americans With Disabilities Act However the country suffered from a recession Before he became President Bush had promised that he would not raise taxes but after the recession caused the debt to grow he broke his promise and agreed to raise taxes This was embarrassing and many people believe this was why he lost the presidential election of 1992 to Bill Clinton

Ohio is one of the 50 states in the United States Its capital is Columbus Columbus also is the largest city in Ohio

Other large cities in Ohio are Cleveland Cincinnati Dayton Akron Toledo and Youngstown

Some famous people from Ohio include Wilbur and Orville Wright author Sherwood Anderson and actress Katie Holmes There have also been seven American presidents from Ohio Ulysses S Grant Rutherford Hayes James Garfield Benjamin Harrison William McKinley William Howard Taft and Warren G Harding

Greek can mean

The word relativity usually means two things in physics

In the Physics of Aristotle heavy objects fall faster than objects that are not heavy The natural science of Aristotle was most popular in Western thought for 2000 years

Galileo proved that all objects fall with the same acceleration Therefore the longer an object moves with constant acceleration the faster its final velocity is Also if different objects each having a different mass are dropped from rest at the same height they will all hit the ground at the same velocity regardless of the mass The experimental discoveries of Galileo and the Laws of Motion developed mathematically by Newton gave birth to modern science

The principle of relativity of Galileo says Is impossible by mechanical means to say whether we move or stay at rest If two trains are moving at the same speed in the same direction then a passenger in either car will not be able to notice that either train is moving However if the passenger takes a fixed frame of reference a fixed point like the earth he will then be able to notice the motion of either train Another thing if one stands on the earth one will not be able to see that it is moving

This principle is just taken from observation If for example we are travelling by plane at constant speed we can walk through the inside of the airplane noticing nothing special

From a practical point of view this means that Newtons laws of motion are valid in all inertial systems which means those at rest or those moving with constant speed relative to one considered at rest This is the law of inertia a body at rest continues at rest and a body in motion continues in motion in a straight line unless influenced by an external force A Galilean coordinate system is one where the law of inertia is valid The laws of mechanics of Galileo and Newton are valid in a Galilean coordinate system If K is a Galilean coordinate system then every other system K is a Galileian coordinate system if it lies at rest or moves according to the law of inertia relative to K Relative to K the mechanical laws of Galileo and Newton are as valid as they are relative to K 

In other words if a mass m is at rest or is moving with constant acceleration in a straight line relative to a Galilean coordinate system K then it will also be at rest or moving with constant acceleration in a straight line relative to a second coordinate system K provided the law of inertia is valid in system K 

Therefore if we want to observe an effect in a moving system at constant speed we can apply the Newton laws directly If the moving system speeds up then we will have to introduce imaginary forces to compensate this effect 

These fictitious forces are called centrifugal force and coriolis force 

Newtons Laws of Motion are mechanically accurate for speeds that are slow compared with the velocity of light For speeds that approach the speed of light it is necessary to apply the discoveries of Einsteins Special Theory of Relativity 

In order to describe what happens mechanically in the universe physicists use mass length and time In the Physics of Galileo and Newton these quantities remain the same throughout the universe 

With Einsteins Special Theory of Relativity all this changed

Special relativity was developed and explained by Albert Einstein in 1905 because he thought the older physics was not good enough The MichelsonMorley experiment had shown this 

Einstein believed that these physics theories gave unspoken preference to one group of observers over another group of observers Galileo had established the principle of relativity according to which physics phenomena must look the same to all observers and no observer can be said to have the right way to look at the things studied by physics 

Suppose you are moving toward something that is moving toward you If you measure its speed it will seem to be moving faster than if you were not moving Now suppose you are moving away from something that is moving toward you If you measure its speed again it will seem to be moving more slowly This is the idea of relative speed

Before Einstein scientists were trying to measure the relative speed of light They were doing this by measuring the speed of starlight reaching the Earth They expected that if the Earth were moving toward a star the light from that star should seem faster than if the Earth were moving away from that star

They noticed that no matter who performed the experiments where they were performed or what starlight they used the measured speed of light in a vacuum was always the same

Einstein said this happens because there is something unexpected about distance and time He thought that as the Earth moves through space our clocks slow down Any clock used to measure the speed of light is off by exactly the right amount to make light seem to be moving at its regular speed Mentally constructing a light clock allow us to see exactly how to explain this remarkable fact

Also Einstein said that as the Earth moves through space our measuring devices change length So any measuring device used to measure the speed of light is off by exactly the right amount to make the starlight seem to be moving at its regular speed

Other scientists before Einstein had written about light seeming to go the same speed no matter how it was observed The idea that made Einsteins relativity so revolutionary is that light does not just seem to go the same speed it is always going the same speed no matter how an observer is moving

The mathematical basis of special relativity are the Lorentz Transformations which mathematically describe the views of space and time for two observers who are moving with respect to each other but are not experiencing acceleration 

Let there be an observer K who describes when events occur with a time coordinate t and who describes where events occur with spatial coordinates x y and z  This is mathematically defining the first observer whose point of view will be our first reference

Let us specify that the time of an event is given by the time that it is observed minus the time that it took for the observation to reach us 

This is mathematically defining what any time means for any observer

let there be another observer K who is 

where x axis is coincident with the x axis and with the y and z axes  always being parallel to the y and z axes 

and 

The need for special relativity arose from Maxwells equations of electromagnetism which were published in 1865 It was later found that they call for electromagnetic waves to move at a constant speed 

To have James Clerk Maxwells Equations be consistent with both astronomical observationsnote11 and Newtonian physicsnote22 Maxwell proposed in 1877 that light travels through an ether which is everywhere in the universe

In 1887 the famous Michelson Morley experiment tried to detect the ether wind generated by the movement of the Earthnote33 The persistent null results of this experiment puzzled physicists and called the ether theory into question

In 1895 Lorentz and Fitzgerald noted that the null result of the Michelson Morley experiment could be explained by the ether wind contracting the experiment in the direction of motion of the ether This effect is called the Lorentz contraction and is a consequence of special relativity

In 1899 Lorentz first published the Lorentz Equations Although this was not the first time they had been published this was the first time that they were used as an explanation of the Michelson Morley experiments null result since the Lorentz contraction is a result of them

In 1900 Poincar gave a famous speech in which he considered the possibility that some new physics was needed to explain the Michelson Morley experiment

In 1904 Lorentz showed that electrical and magnetic fields can be modified into each other through the Lorentz transformations

In 1905 Einstein published his article introducing special relativity On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies in Annalen der Physik In this article he presented the postulates of relativity derived the Lorentz transformations from them and also showed how the Lorentz Transformations affect electric and magnetic fields

Later in 1905 Einstein published another article presenting E mc2

In 1908 Max Planck endorsed Einsteins theory and named it relativity In that same year Minkowski gave a famous speech on Space and Time in which he showed that relativity is self consistent and further developed the theory These events forced the physics community to take relativity seriously Relativity came to be more and more accepted after that

In 1912 Einstein and Lorentz were nominated for the Nobel prize in physics due to their pioneering work on relativity Unfortunately relativity remained so controversial then and for a long time after that that a Nobel prize was never awarded for it

A wombat is a marsupial which forms the family Vombatidae It lives in the Australian eucalyptus forests There are two genera with three living wombat species the Common Wombat and the Hairy nosed Wombats

It is a medium sized animal that makes a burrow by digging holes in the ground Wombats are usually around a metre long when they are fully grown It is a kind of animal known as a marsupial because it has a pouch on its belly that holds its young although it faces back instead of forward like most marsupials Having the pouch face backwards prevents dirt from building up in the pouch and hitting the offspring in the face when digging When its young are born they spend some time growing in their mothers pouch before going into the world Wombats are herbivores They eat plants roots and grasses They are nocturnal which means they sleep in the day and come out at night Some wombats have thick brown fur and very small ears They can weigh from 20 to 35 kilograms

Wombats are commonly known and recognised by their waste products They are the only known mammals that excrete faeces in cubic shape This enables people to easily know when wombat habitats are nearby and also simply what the wombat may have eaten by examining the faeces thoroughly

Turkeys are a family of bird They are something like a chicken but much bigger Wild turkeys live in forests in North America and Central America In the United States people traditionally eat turkey on the holiday of Thanksgiving

The family Meleagrididae has one genus in it Meleagris This genus has two species

When people from Europe first saw turkeys in the Americas they thought the birds were a type of guinea fowl This bird had been brought to central Europe from the country of Turkey The name of that country stuck as the name of the bird See Happy Meleagris Gollopavo Day

Its original name was Byzantion in the Greek language known as Byzantium in the Latin language Byzantium was originally settled as a colony by Greeks from Megara in 667 BC and named after their king Byzas In 196 AD Byzantium was damaged by the Romans then rebuilt by the Roman Emperor Septimius Severus Constantine the Great thought this city was in nice location and in 330 moved the capital of the Empire from Rome to there as New Roma renaming the city Constantinople after his name 

When the Roman Empire was later divided into two the East Roman Empire was known as the Byzantine Empire and had its capital in Constantinople Although it was captured by Crusaders for a time it continued as one of political cultural religious and economical centers of Europe until it finally fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 

After the Ottoman Empire ended the Republic of Turkey was started with its capital at Ankara

The Clyde is a river in Scotland It has its source in South Lanarkshire and flows through Glasgow before opening up into the Firth of Clyde

Electric charge is a basic property of electrons protons and other subatomic particles Electrons are negatively charged while protons are positively charged Things that are negatively charged and things that are positively charged pull on each other This makes electrons and protons stick together to form atoms Things that have the same charge push each other away This is called the Law of Charges It was discovered by Charles Augustin de Coulomb The law that describes how strongly charges pull and push on each other is called Coulombs Law

Things that have equal numbers of electrons and protons are neutral Things that have more electrons than protons are negatively charged while things with fewer electrons than protons are positively charged Things with the same charge repel each other Things that have different charges attract each other If possible the one with too many electrons will give enough electrons to match the number of protons in the one that has too many protons for its load of electrons If there are just enough electrons to match the extra protons then the two things will not attract each other anymore When electrons from a place where there are too many to a place where there are too few that transfer makes an electrical current 

When a person shuffles his feet on a carpet and then touches a brass doorknow he or she may get an electrical shock If there are enough extra electrons then the force with which those electrons push each other away may be enough to make some of the electrons jump across a gap between the person and the doorknob The length of the spark is a measure of voltage or electrical pressure The number of electrons that move from one place to another per unit of time measured as amperage or rate of electron flow

If a person gets a positive or negative charge it may make the persons hairs stand up because the charges in each hair push it away from the others

Electric charge felt when one gets a shock from a doorknob or other object usually is between 25 thousand and 30 thousand volts However the amperage involved is incredibly low so the flow of electrons through the persons body can not cause physical harm On the other hand when clouds accumulate electrical charges they have even higher voltages and the amperage can be very high That means that electrons can jump from a cloud to the earth and if those electrons go through a person then that person will be burned and may die

Let a piece of glass and a piece of resinneither of which exhibits any electrical propertiesbe rubbed together and left with the rubbed surfaces in contact They will still exhibit no electrical properties Let them be separated They will now attract each other

If a second piece of glass is rubbed with a second piece of resin and if the pieces be then separated and suspended in the neighborhood of the former pieces of glass and resin it may be observed

1 that the two pieces of glass repel each other

2 that each piece of glass attracts each piece of resin

3 that the two pieces of resin repel each other

These phenomena of attraction and repulsion are called Electrical phenomena and the bodies which exhibit them are said to be electrified or to be charged with electricity

Besides being electrified by friction bodies may be electrified in many other ways

When two substances are rubbed together and an electrical charge is produced one of them will give electrons to the other The reason is that the atoms in the two substances have unequal power to attract electrons So the one that is more able to attract electrons will rob electrons from the one that has a lower attractive force In one pair of substances rubbed together the one made of glass may either give or take electrons What happens depends on the nature of the other member of that pair

If a body electrified in any manner whatever behaves as the glass does when rubbed with resin that is if it repels the glass and attract the resin the body is said to be vitreously electrified and if it attracts the glass and repels the resin it is said to be resinously electrified All electrified bodies are found to be either vitreously or resinously electrifiedproof

It is the established practice of men of science to call the vitreous electrification positive and the resinous electrification negative The exactly opposite properties of the two kinds of electrification justify us in indicating them by opposite signs but the application of the positive sign to one rather than to the other kind must considered as a matter of arbitrary convention just as it is a matter of convention in mathematical diagrams to reckon positive distance towards the right hand

No force either of attraction or of repulsion can be observed between an electrified body and a body not electrified

The above experiment is described by James Clerk Maxwell in his magnum opus A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism

The Silversword plant grows only at high elevations on the Island of Maui in Hawaii

The silversword is a noticeable round shaped rosette plant with rigid succulent leaves densely covered by silver hairs When a plant flowers at the end of its life it produces a spectacular flowering stalk 05 20 m tall typically with hundreds of maroon sunflowerlike flower heads This plant receives more attention from visitors to Haleakala National Park than any other plant or animal because of its striking appearance and restricted distribution

The strikingly beautiful Haleakala silversword has always aroused the curiosity of human visitors to Haleakala Volcano In pre park days plants were often removed by travelers to Haleakala Volcano as proof that the party had reached the summit a practice that eventually seriously affected the silversword population Browsing by feral goats and domestic cattle was also a significant factor in the silversword decline but it was not a species preferred by these animals By the 1920s silversword numbers were so depleted that the Maui Chamber of Commerce sent a petition to Washington DC requesting that a serious effort be made to save the species

Mr Pacman is a pop music band from Colorado that uses sounds from old video games to create its music Mr Pacman has recorded 2 CDs made 4 music videos

Hip hop is a type of music that started in the 1970s in Jamaican American African American and Latino American communities in big cities of the United States Hip hop uses a style of singing called rapping Rapping is a style of singing in which a singer chants or says words with a rhythm and rhymes The lyrics of hip hop songs are often about the life of urban people in the big cities Some hip hop song lyrics are about gangs violence and illegal drugs Hip hop music also uses musical styles from pop music such as disco and reggae The rap and hip hop music industry has become one of the most successful music genres 

Hip hop as a culture involves the music as well as a style of dressing called urban clothes a dancing style called breakdancing or B Boying and graffiti a street art in which people paint pictures or words on walls In the 2000s hip hop music and hip hop culture are very popular in the United States and Canada Hip hop musicians usually use nicknames Many of the popular hip hop musicians from the 2000s use nicknames such as Snoop Dogg Jay Z Eminem Lil Wayne and 50 Cent

Rapping as a form of singing is a mix between singing and talking The words are spoken with rhythm and in the text there are rhymes The beat in the background is a simple loop that is sometimes made by the rapper themself or sometimes copied from a sample CD The simple loop carries out through the entire song usually except for the chorus It developed in the ethnic minority urban areas as an American form of Jamaican toasting

Run DMC and The Sugarhill Gang were very popular in the 1980s When rappers began to use violent language and gestures it became a very popular music genre for gangsters This kind of music was called gangsta rap Gangsta rap often has lyrics which are about guns drug dealing and life as a thug on the street This genre of music was very popular from the 1980s on and is still produced today

The well known people who made rap music include Tupac Shakur Snoop Doggy Dogg Notorious BIG Eminem and Sean P Diddy Combs In the 1990s there was a rivalry between the two big record labels Death Row Records and Bad Boy Records The rappers Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG were murdered Later the two record labels stopped the rivalry Because most of the rappers who rapped for Death Row Records were from the West Coast of the US and most of the rappers who rapped for Bad Boy Records were from the East Coast this rivalry was called the West Coast East Coast beef

The fastest rapper according to Guinness World Records is Ricky Brown from the United States On January 15 2005 he rapped 723 syllables in 5127 seconds from his track No Clue

Currently some of the most famous rappers worldwide are 50 Cent Eminem Jay Z Nas Snoop Dogg and Timbaland Rap is produced in almost every nation of the world 

People with color blindness cannot tell the difference between certain colors or they may not see colors at all Color blindness is the name for a number of medical conditions and doctors sometimes call color blindness color vision deficiency 

Most color blindness is heritable usually as simple Mendelian inheritance More rarely it may be the result of damage to the eyes nerves or the brain it can also happen because the affected person was exposed to certain chemicals Most color blindness is permanent but some conditions can also lead to temporary color blindness During certain kinds of migraine some people are unable to tell the difference between certain colors As of 2009 there is no treatment or cure for permanent color blindness

There are far more males who are color blind than there are females Between five and eight percent of males but less than one percent of females are color blind 

Color blindness is usually thought of as a disability However people who are color blind have an advantage they are sometimes better at seeing through some types of camouflage 

The English chemist John Dalton published the first scientific article about color blindness in 1798 after he found out that he suffered from color blindness himself The article was called Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours Because of this the condition is sometimes called daltonism As of 2009 the word daltonism is used for only one type of color blindness called deuteranopia

In order to understand color blindness it is necessary to explain how humans can tell the difference between colors There are three steps

How the human eye sees colors Inside the human eye is a part called the retina The retina receives the images that the eye sees and sends them to the brain The retina has two types of cells Rod cells and Cone cells They work in different types of light 

Parts of the thalamus and the visual cortex in the brain are involved in seeing also seeing colors Color blindness can therefore also result if these areas of the brain the optic nerve or the retina have been damaged These types of color blindness usually result from an accident and are not inherited Inherited forms of color blindness affect the retina only 

That way it is possible that only a part of the visual field is affected by color blindness but in the rest there is no color blindness 

Some types of color blindness but not inherited color blindness can be cured

There are several different problems that can cause color blindness 

This condition is very rare People who suffer from it can only see in black gray and white can perceive only differences in brightness and do not see color This is called monochromacy

There are two main types of total color blindness

There are two kinds of red green color blindness protanopia or deuteranopia Deuteranopia is the most common form of color blindness between five and ten percent of males suffer from it Those affected have trouble telling the difference between red and green As seen by protanopes red is darkened Most often this is because they lack the receptors for long or medium length light waves or because these receptors have changed their sensitivity

Blue yellow color blindness means that those affected cannot tell the difference between blue and yellow It is different from the other types of color blindness because it is not linked to sex It affects both sexes equally It occurs because those affected lack receptors for short wavelengths or because these receptor changed their sensitivity

Sometimes people do not have problems seeing color but their brain has trouble telling the color and interprets it wrong It is also possible that only certain parts of the eye have color blindness people may become color blind because of other diseases but after the disease goes away see normally again This seems to be the case with certain forms of migraine

Males have one X and one Y chromosome females have two X chromosomes Many of the genes involved in making color vision work are on the X chromosome they are sex linked For this reason men are more often affected by color blindness than women 

The color blind gene allows non color blind people see the difference between red and green The gene is located on the X chromosome This means that a male will be color blind if the single X he inherits from his mother contains the color blind version of the color blind gene A female will inherit color blindness only if she inherits two X chromosomes containing defective color gene alleles In other words a female needs to inherit color blind genes from both parents in order to be color blind

Special tests have been developed These usually have an image with dots of different colors People will then see different images Those with certain types of color blindness will see different numbers from those not affected by color blindness 

Because many young children have not learned numbers yet other tests have been developed They use symbols like a square a circle or a car instead of numbers

A color code is when there is much information in the color of certain item Such codes cannot be understood easily by those who are color blind For this reason color should not be used alone to give information Good graphic design avoids using color coding or color differences alone to give information This does not only help color blind people but also normally sighted people

Cascading Style Sheets can be used on web pages They allow to give a different color scheme for color blind people Certain color scheme generators help graphic designers see color schemes as eight types of color blind people see them  

Color blindness is very sensitive to changes in material A red green color blind person may be unable to see the difference between colors on a map printed on paper The same map on a computer screen or television may appear normally In addition some color blind people find it easier to tell the difference between colors on artificial materials such as plastic or in acrylic paints than on natural materials such as paper or wood Thirdly for some color blind people color can only be broken wikt linkdistinguishdistinguished if there is enough color thin lines might appear black but a thicker line of the same color can be seen in the correct color

In certain cases when it is important to understand information very quickly the visual system may drop the colors and only work in shades of gray This is important to know when designing the interfaces for objects that need to be used in an emergency situation like emergency brakes or emergency phones 

Because color blind people may not see the difference between colors such as red and green some countries such as Romania have refused to give them driving licenses In Romania people have started to change the laws so that color blind people will also be able to drive legally

In the United Kingdom electricity wires in houses used to be red black and green They were changed to brown blue and greenyellow to help color blind people see the difference between the live and earth wires

Sopron is a city of Hungary near the western border of Hungary with Austria at the foot of the Alps 60 km from Vienna and 220 km from Budapest The people of this city are famous for their loyalty to their country and their hometown A famous monument is Gate of Faith which is the symbol of the peoples faith to Hungary in 1921

At the time of the Roman Empire there was a city here called Scarbantia The main square of Sopron is in the same place as the forum of Roman times

After this the city was probably deserted When the Hungarians arrived in the area it was in ruins In the 9th11th centuries Hungarians strengthened the old Roman city walls and built a castle The town got its Hungarian name of Sopron from a steward of the castle named Suprun By 1153 it was an important town

In 1273 King Otakar II of Bohemia took over the castle and took the children of Soprons noble families as hostage But the people of the city opened the gates when the army of King Ladislaus IV of Hungary arrived The King Ladislaus made Sopron a free royal town

In 1528 Hungary was invaded by Ottoman Turks who destroyed many parts of the city but did not take it over Many people from other towns fled to Sopron for safety

In 1676 most of the ancient buildings in the city were destroyed by a fire When they were replaced they were in a new style called Baroque Many of the Baroque buildings are standing today 

Sopron was an important town in the Austro Hungarian Empire In the early 1900s it became part of Austria But the townspeople were not happy with this and in December 1921 they voted that the city should be part of Hungary Since that day the city has been called Civitas Fidelissima A holiday is held every year to celebrate

In World War II Sopron suffered badly It was bombed several times There were many Jewish people living in Sopron before the war The Nazis and their Hungarian allies sent the Jews of Sopron to death camps and killed nearly all of them as well as other people who disagreed with Nazi ideas 

The Soviet Red Army captured the city on April 1 1945 Sopron as part of Hungary was ruled by a Socialist government At this time many factories were built around Sopron The Socialist government took away a lot of the freedom that people had In August 1989 in Sopron there was a big protest against the Socialist government which was called the Pan European Picnic While this was happening more than 200 people who lived in East Germany escaped to the West This was the beginning of a big change for all the Socialist countries of Europe People who had not been allowed to travel or live in other countries were finally allowed to be free

Hungary is now part of the European Union Sopron now has trade with other countries most importantly Austria There are many German speaking people who live in Sopron so most street signs are written in both Hungarian and German

The city of Sopron shows signs of its long history in its buildings There are still walls and foundations from the Ancient Roman times and also building from the Middle Ages The medieval Kescke Church was where coronations and parliament took place There is also a very old Jewish synagogue 

Many old buildings whose architecture are from the 1600s and 1700s and are in the Baroque style which often has a lot of decoration Storn House is one of the most well known buildings because of its elegant Baroque architecture its connection with King Matthias and its interesting collection There is also a famous statue of the Holy Trinity from this time the Vrkerlet is part of the city built where the ancient moat was The inner row of houses follow the line of the castle wall Vrkerlet has a famous Maria Statue The Town Hall built in 1896 and the Ursuline Church is an important building in the Gothic Revival style 

Sopron is popular as a holiday place because it is set in beautiful countryside where people like to walk in the hills enjoying the pure air the forests and mountain springs There are many hiking paths and look out towers Near to Sopron is Lake Fert The Lverek is a beautiful hilly area south of the city with forests of spruce oaks and chestnut trees The flowers that bloom there include Lily of the Valley and cyclamens

Sopron is a wine producing region that is one of the few in Hungary to make both red and white wines The grapes grown here include Kkfrankos for red wine and Traminer for white wine In climate it is similar to the Burgenland wine region nearby in Austria and several winemakers make wine in both countries

MFC Sopron is a football team based in Sopron 

Sumo is a sport from Japan where heavy men try to push one another out of a ring or onto the ground Most of the time the bigger sumo wrestler wins To get heavier sumo wrestlers eat a special food that helps them gain weight

Sumo wrestlers need to be fat because the fatter they are the harder it is to defeat them The sumo wrestler who weighs the most named Konishiki weighs about 264 kg

Stellar evolution is the study of how a star changes over time Stars can change very much between when they are first created and when they run out of energy Because stars can produce light and heat for millions or billions of years scientists study stellar evolution by studying many different stars in different stages of their life

The stages in a stars life are nebula main sequence star red giant and either white dwarf followed by black dwarf neutron star or black hole

A star starts its life as a cloud of dust and gas called a nebula This is pulled together by gravity which causes it to heat up It also starts to spin and to look like a ball When it gets hot enough it starts to release energy through nuclear fusion changing hydrogen to helium This makes it shine very brightly and become what astronomers think of as a main sequence star It may stay a main sequence star looking about the same for billions of years

Sooner or later almost all of the hydrogen at the center has changed to helium This causes the nuclear reaction in the middle of the star to stop and the center will start to get smaller due to the stars gravity The layer of the star just outside the center will begin to change hydrogen to helium releasing energy 

The outer layers of the star will get much much bigger The star will make much more light sometimes as much as ten thousand times as much as it did at first Since the surface of the star will get bigger this energy will be spread out over a much larger area Because of this the temperature of the surface will go down and the color will change to red or orange It will become a red giant It can swallow up any planets that orbit around it

Later the red giant that was left over from a star like ours stops burning A cloud of gas is given off and a smaller star called a white dwarf is left behind After a really long time the white dwarf cools down into a black dwarf

But when a big red giant explodes the explosion is a lot larger and is called a supernova Instead of a white dwarf it leaves behind a much smaller much denser ball called a neutron star A neutron star is created because the force of gravity is so strong that the atoms left behind would not have any electrons orbiting the nucleus of the atoms A teaspoon of that matter might weigh as much as the entire Earth

A much bigger red giant leaves behind a black hole A black hole is created because gravity is so strong that even the protons and neutrons collapse in on themselves Even light can no longer escape a black hole Since there is nothing we know of stronger than the force that holds atomic nuclei together some physicists think that a black hole collapses all the way down to a mathematical point called a singularity

Genetics is a discipline of biology It is the science of heredity and variation of traits in living organisms and the study of genes In the laboratory genetics proceeds by mating carefully selected organisms and analysing their offspring More informally genetics is the study of how parents pass some of their characteristics to their children It is an important part of biology and gives the basic rules on which evolution acts

The fact that living things inherit traits from their parents has been known since prehistoric times and used to improve crop plants and animals through selective breeding However the modern science of genetics which seeks to understand the process of inheritance only began with the work of Gregor Mendel in the mid nineteenth century Although he did not know the physical basis for heredity Mendel observed that organisms inherit traits via discrete units of inheritance which are now called genes

Living things are made of millions of tiny self contained components called cells Inside of each cell are long and complex molecules called DNA DNA stores information that tells the cells how to create that living thing Parts of this information that tell how to make one small part or characteristic of the living thing red hair or blue eyes or a tendency to be tall are known as genes

Every cell in the same living thing has the same DNA but only some of it is used in each cell For instance some genes that tell how to make parts of the liver are switched off in the brain What genes are used can also change over time For instance a lot of genes are used by a child early in pregnancy that are not used later

A living thing has two copies of each gene one from its mother and one from its father There can be multiple types of each gene which give different instructions one version might cause a person to have blue eyes another might cause them to have brown These different versions are known as alleles of the gene

Since a living thing has two copies of each gene it can have two different alleles of it at the same time Often one allele will be dominant meaning that the living thing looks and acts as if it had only that one allele The unexpressed allele is called recessive In other cases you end up with something in between the two possibilities In that case the two alleles are called co dominant

Most of the characteristics that you can see in a living thing have multiple genes that influence them And many genes have multiple effects on the body because their function will not have the same effect in each tissue The multiple effects of a single gene is called pleiotropism The whole set of genes is called the genotype and the total effect of genes on the body is called the phenotype These are key terms in genetics

We know that man started breeding domestic animals from early times probably before the invention of agriculture We do not know when heredity was first appreciated as a scientific problem The Greeks and most obviously Aristotle studied living things and proposed ideas about reproduction and heredity 

Probably the most important idea before Mendel was that of Charles Darwin whose idea of pangenesis had two parts The first that persistent hereditary units were passed on from one generation to another was quite right The second was his idea that they were replenished by gemmules from the somatic tissues This was entirely wrong and plays no part in science today Darwin was right about one thing whatever happens in evolution must happen by means of heredity and so an accurate science of genetics is fundamental to the theory of evolution This mating between genetics and evolution took many years to organise It resulted in the Modern evolutionary synthesis

The basic rules of genetics were first discovered by a monk named Gregor Mendel in around 1865 For thousands of years people had already studied how traits are inherited from parents to their children However Mendels work was different because he designed his experiments very carefully 

In his experiments Mendel studied how traits were passed on in pea plants He started his crosses with plants that bred true and counted characters that were eitheror in nature He bred large numbers of plants and expressed his results numerically He used test crosses to reveal the presence and proportion of recessive characters 

Mendel explained the results of his experiment using two scientific laws

Mendels laws helped explain the results he observed in his pea plants Later geneticists discovered that his laws were also true for other living things even humans Mendels findings from his work on the garden pea plants helped to establish the field of genetics His contributions were not limited to the basic rules that he discovered Mendels care towards controlling experiment conditions along with his attention to his numerical results set a standard for future experiments Over the years scientists have changed and improved Mendels ideas However the science of genetics would not be possible today without the early work of Gregor Mendel

In the years between Mendels work and 1900 the foundations of cytology the study of cells was developed The facts discovered about the nucleus and cell division were essential for Mendels work to be properly understood

At this point discoveries in cytology merged with the rediscovered ideas of Mendel to make a fusion called cytogenetics which has continued to the present day

During the 1890s several biologists began doing experiments on breeding and soon Mendels results were duplicated even before his papers were read Carl Correns and Hugo de Vries were the main rediscovers of Mendels writings and laws Both acknowledged Mendels priority although it is probable that de Vries did not understand his own results until after reading Mendel Though Erich von Tschermak was originally also credited with rediscovery this is no longer accepted because he did not understand Mendels laws Though de Vries later lost interest in Mendelism other biologists built genetics into a science 

Mendels results were replicated and genetic linkage soon worked out William Bateson perhaps did the most in the early days to publicise Mendels theory The word genetics and other terminology originated with Bateson 

Mendels experimental results have later been the object of some debate Fisher analyzed the results of the F2 ratio and found them to be implausibly close to the exact ratio of 3 to 1 It is sometimes suggested that Mendel may have censored his results and that his seven traits each occur on a separate chromosome pair an extremely unlikely occurrence if they were chosen at random In fact the genes Mendel studied occurred in only four linkage groups and only one gene pair is close enough to show deviation from independent assortment this is not a pair that Mendel studied

During the process of DNA replication errors sometimes occur These errors called mutations can have an effect on the phenotype of an organism In turn that usually has an effect on the organisms fitness its ability to live and reproduce successfully 

Error rates are usually very low1 error in every 10100 million basesdue to the proofreading ability of DNA polymerases Error rates are a thousandfold higher in many viruses Because they rely on DNA and RNA polymerases which lack proofreading ability they get higher mutation rates 

Processes that increase the rate of changes in DNA are called mutagenic Mutagenic chemicals increase errors in DNA replication often by interfering with the structure of base pairing while UV radiation induces mutations by causing damage to the DNA structure Chemical damage to DNA occurs naturally as well and cells use DNA repair mechanisms to repair mismatches and breaks in DNAnevertheless the repair sometimes fails to return the DNA to its original sequence

In organisms which use chromosomal crossovers to exchange DNA and recombine genes errors in alignment during meiosis can also cause mutations Errors in crossover are especially likely when similar sequences cause partner chromosomes to adopt a mistaken alignment this makes some regions in genomes more prone to mutating in this way These errors create large structural changes in DNA sequenceduplications inversions or deletions of entire regions or the accidental exchanging of whole parts between different chromosomes

Developed by Reginald Punnett Punnett squares are used by biologists to determine the probability of offspring to having a particular genotype

If B represents the allele for having black hair and b represents the allele for having white hair the offspring of two Bb parents would have a 25 probability of having two white hair alleles 50 of having one of each and 25 of having only black hair alleles

Geneticists use pedigree charts to record traits of people in a family Using these charts geneticists can study how a trait is inherited from person to person 

Geneticists can also use pedigree charts to predict how traits will be passed to future children in a family For instance genetic counselors are professionals who work with families who might be affected by genetic diseases As part of their job they create pedigree charts for the family which can be used to study how the disease might be inherited

Since human beings are not bred experimentally human genetics must be studied by other means One way is by twin studies Identical twins are natural clones They carry the same genes they may be used to investigate how much heredity contributes to individual people Studies with twins have been quite interesting If we make a list of characteristic traits we find that they vary in how much they owe to heredity For example

The way the studies are done is like this Take a group of identical twins and a group of fraternal twins Measure them for various traits Do a statistical analysis This tells you to what extent the trait is inherited Those traits which are partly inherited will be significantly more similar in identical twins Studies like this may be carried further by comparing identical twins brought up together with identical twins brought up in different circumstances That gives a handle on how much circumstances can alter the outcomes of genetically identical people

The person who first did twin studies was Francis Galton Darwins half cousin who was a founder of statistics His method was to trace twins through their life history making many kinds of measurement Unfortunately though he knew about mono and dizygotic twins he did not appreciate the real genetic difference Twin studies of the modern kind did not appear until the 1920s

The genetics of bacteria archaea and viruses is a major field or research Bacterial mostly divide by asexual cell division but do have a kind of sex by horizontal gene transfer Bacterial conjugation transduction and transformation are their methods In addition the complete DNA sequence of many bacteria archaea and viruses is now known

Although many bacteria were given generic and specific names like Staphylococcus aureus the whole idea of a species is rather meaningless for an organism which does not have sexes and crossing over of chromosomes Instead these organisms have strains and that is how they are identified in the laboratory

Supply is the amount that is available of something based on a price In economics the Law of supply and demand will decide the price at which something will be bought and sold

Demand is how much is bought of something based on a price It indicates how much it is needed or wanted In economics the Law of supply and demand will decide the price at which something will be bought and sold

Sometimes the demand does not change much no matter what the price is One example is when people are addicted to illegal drugs These people need to get their drugs they will pay any price they can afford

A transaction is where something is bought sold or traded

A bank transaction is when money is taken out of or put into a bank

The Encyclopdia Britannica is a very big famous encyclopaedia It is written in English and is published by Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc a private company It was originally only printed on paper but recently it has expanded to have digital or computer versions as well The encyclopedia is split into many books The articles in the books are arranged in alphabetical order There have been versions of it that are for children as well It is the largest printed encyclopedia and the second largest encyclopedia The largest is Wikipedia Many people consider it to be the best encyclopedia because it is accurate and has lots of detail 

The Encyclopedia was once very small the first edition in 1768 only had 3 books Slowly it became bigger The latest edition the 15th edition now has 29 books in it plus 2 indexes It includes an extra book called Propaedia to classify knowledge The 29 books and made up of a Macropaedia and a Micropaedia The Macropdia is a larger one with more detailed articles that can be as long as 300 pages made up of 17 books while the Micropdia is the smaller one with shorter articles that are usually less than 750 words The Micropdia is used for fast checking but if you want more detailed information you have to use the Macropdia Each book is very big more than 1000 pages per book There are books of the year Every year a book is published about that year 

The articles in the Britannica are for educated adults not for children and written by about 100 full time editors and over 4000 expert contributors Many people think it is the best encyclopedia factdateApril 2009 but Wikipedia is still more popular being free to use The Britannica is the oldest English language encyclopaedia now It was first published between 1768 and 1771 in Edinburgh Scotland and grew very popular with its third edition in 1801 comprising of 21 books

The size of the Britannica is almost the same over the past 70 years with about 40 million words on half a million topics The encyclopedia was once owned by the British It is now owned by the USA but still written in British English Over time the encyclopedia has had difficulties trying to earn money which almost every encyclopedia is facing

The Britannica has been owned by many different people including Scottish publisher A C Black Horace Everett Hooper Sears Roebuck and William Benton Encyclopdia Britannica Inc is owned by Jacqui Safra a Swiss billionaire and actor Information technology has become better recently and more electronic encyclopedias such as Microsoft Encarta and Wikipedia have made people not want to buy encyclopedias in print anymore So that it still can survive Encyclopdia Britannica Inc has kept on telling people that the Britannica is good and accurate made the encyclopedia cheaper and made electronic versions on CD ROM DVD and the World Wide Web Since the early 1930s the company has also promoted spin off reference works

There are 15 official editions of the encyclopedia with some extensions to the 3rd and 5th editions Actually you can say that the 10th edition was only an extension to the 9th edition and the 12th and 13th editions were extensions to the 11th edition The 15th edition was reorganised in 1985 and the updated current version is the 15th edition

Through the encyclopedias history the Britannica wanted to be an excellent reference book and to provide learning materials for those who want to study In 1974 the 15th edition had a third wish to put together all that everyone knows The history of the Britannica can be divided into five main eras or lengths of time

In the first era the Britannica was controlled by the people who first wrote it Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell and by their friends and relations such as Thomas Bonar George Gleig and Archibald Constable The Britannica was first published between 1768 and 1771 in Edinburgh a city in Scotland called the Encyclopdia Britannica or A dictionary of arts and sciences compiled upon a new plan It was written to replace the French Encyclopedie Its logo which is the floral emblem of Scotland shows that the Britannica was a Scottish business The encyclopedia being created is one of the most famous events that happened in the time when Scotland started inventing many things or The Enlightenment In this era the Britannica started as three book set written by one young editorWilliam SmellieSlowly the Britannica changed in the first era to a 20 book set written by many people Although a few other encyclopaedias had been fighting with the Britannica such as Reess Cyclopaedia and Coleridges Encyclopaedia Metropolitana these encyclopedias either went bankrupt or were not finished because the people writing them argued When the first era was almost over the Britannica had many people helping to write it all having different types of skills The encyclopedia managed to get so many people by inviting their friends to help

In the second era the Britannica was owned by the Edinburgh company A C Black Although some of the people who helped write the Britannica helped because they were friends of the most important editors many other people wanted to help the Britannica because it was becoming very successful These people came from many other countries and some of them were very famous for the things they wrote about An index of all the articles was written to add to the 7th edition of the encyclopedia and they continued to make an index until 1974 The first English chief editor was Thomas Spencer Baynes who led the making of the famous 9th edition which is also called the Scholars Edition The 9th edition is considered to be the Britannica most meant for students ever written However at the end of the 19th century the 9th edition was already too old and the Britannica had many financial problems

In the third era the Britannica was owned by American people who started to advertise a lot to earn more money The American owners also slowly made the Britannicas articles simpler making them less for students only but for everyone The 11th edition is said by many people to be the best edition of the encyclopedia Its owner Horace Hooper worked extremely hard to make the 11th edition perfect When Hooper had financial problems the Britannica was managed by Sears Roebuck for about 18 years In 1932 the vice president of Sears Elkan Harrison Powell owned the Britannica In 1936 he started to continuously revise the encyclopedia often in which every article is checked at least two times every ten years This was a big difference from before when the articles were not changed until they wrote a new edition about every 25 years with some articles used again without revising them in the ext edition He also quickly made some educational products which made the encyclopedia even more well known by everyone In 1943 William Benton managed the Britannica until his death in 1973 Benton also set up the Benton Foundation which managed the Britannica until 1996 In 1968 near the end of this era the Britannica celebrated its 200 year anniversary

Since 1985 the Britannica has had four parts the Micropdia the Macropdia the Propdia and a two book index The Britannicas articles are found in the Micropdia and Macropdia which contain 12 and 17 books respectively each book having about one thousand pages The 2007 Macropdia has 699 detailed articles which can be as short as 2 pages and as long as 310 pages and having references and named writers The 2007 Micropdia has about 65000 articles and about 97 contain less than 750 words no references and no named contributors The Micropdia articles are supposed to be for quick fact checking and to help in finding more information in the Macropdia The Macropdia articles are supposed to be well written articles on their subjects and articles of information where you cannot find anywhere else The longest article is on the United States and came from putting the articles on the individual states together

Information can be found in the Britannica by following the notes telling where people can find more information in the Micropdia and Macropdia but there are very little of this with about only one of this every page So readers are asked to try to use the indexes or the Propdia which organises what is in the Britannicas by topic

The use of the Propdia is its Outline of Knowledge which wants to organise all of everything people know The Outline is thought through by the Britannicas editors to decide which articles should be included in the Micropdia and Macropdia The Outline is also intended to be a study guide and to tell a student who wants to learn a topic in depth what articles to use However libraries say that very few people use it and reviewers recommend the encyclopedias to not print it anymore The Propdia also has diagrams printed on transparent paper of big topics and a section which lists the people working together to make the encyclopedia

Altogether the Micropdia and Macropdia have about 40 million words and 24000 pictures The index has 2350 pages which lists all the 228274 topics written about in the Britannica The Britannica uses the British spellings and not American spellings For example it uses colour centre and encyclopaedia However this rule is not always followed for example defense and not defence The other spellings of the word is sometimes shown with a link for example Color see Colour

Since 1936 the articles of the Britannica have been revised often with about 10 of the articles brought to be re written each year One Britannica website says that 46 of the articles were revised in the past three years but another Britannica web site says only 35 of the articles were revised

The way the articles are arranged in the Micropdia and Macropdia is very accurate Non English letters are ignored and articles with numbers such as War of 1812 are arranged as if the number had been written out If the articles have the same names articles about persons go first then by places then by things People with the same names are arranged first alphabetically by country and then by their time Similarly places that have the same names are arranged by alphabet by the country they are in

There are a few smaller versions of the Britannica encyclopedias The Britannica Concise Encyclopdia written in one book has 28000 shorter articles Comptons by Britannica published in 2007 with the old Comptons Encyclopedia in it is written for teenagers who are 1017 years old and has 26 books and 11000 pages in it A Childrens Britannica was published by the company in 1960 this was edited by John Armitage and written for His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales the writers were almost all British  Other books are My First Britannica written for children who are six to twelve years old and the Britannica Discovery Library written for children who are three to six years old Since 1938 Encyclopdia Britannica Inc has published a Book of the Year every year with information about the past years events which is written online since the 1994 edition The company also publishes a few books on special topics such as Shakespeare The Essential Guide to the Life and Works of the Bard

The Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite 2006 DVD contains over 55 million words and over 100000 articles It includes 73645 Britannica articles with the other articles from the Britannica Student Encyclopdia the Britannica Elementary Encyclopdia and the Britannica Book of the Years plus a few old articles from old editions of the encyclopaedia The whole DVD also includes other bonus tools including maps videos sound clips animations and web links It also has study tools and a dictionary and thesaurus from Merriam Webster

Encyclopdia Britannica Online is a web site with more than 120000 articles and is updated often It has features updates and links to news reports from The New York Times and the BBC every day People need to pay to use the website Special discounts are given to schools colleges and libraries since these big groups of people are important in Britannicas business Articles can be read online for free but only the first few sentences can be seen Beginning in early 2007 the Britannica let people read the articles for free if they are linked to another website since these links let the articles appear more often and easily in search engines

On 20 February 2007 Encyclopdia Britannica Inc said that it was working with mobile phone search company AskMeNow to make an encyclopedia in phones Users can send a question by text message and AskMeNow will search Britannicas 28000 article encyclopedia to answer the user 

An idea to use a wiki Britannica was announced on the June 3 2008 A lot of people will be involved with the Britannica staff editing important parts 

A pipeline is a long tube that is used to transport liquids or gases over long distances Pipelines are made of metal While the transport of liquids and gases is common some pipelines are used to transport coal or iron ore which are mixed with mud Such pipelines are sometimes called slurry pipelines Even though a pipeline is very expensive to build it often is a more economical form of transport that the transport by road 

Many stadiums use a central tank for beer Each bar is served by a pipeline from the central tank

Even though mail and other goods can also be delivered that way the system is generally not referred to as pipeline In this case capsules are used These are propelled by air

An avocado is a berry fruit It has dark green bumpy or smooth skin depending on the variety The flesh of an avocado is light green in color near the skin and light yellow near the core It has a creamy rich texture

Avocado trees come from Central America and Mexico They can grow in many places as long as it is not too cold

Avocadoes have much more fat than most other fruit but most is fat that is healthy to eat Avocados have lots of potassium B vitamins and vitamin E and K

The Mexican food called guacamole is made of avocadoes Many other foods are also made from avocado

Avocado is poisonous to animals Many animals will get very sick or die if they eat avocado

Ice hockey is a sport that is played by two teams on ice The players wear ice skates on their feet and can travel at very high speeds They hold hockey sticks which they use to push or pass a puck around the ice The players score by shooting the puck into a net the goaltenders try to stop them Six players on each team play at once but a whole team has over 20 players When a player breaks a rule a referee calls a penalty and the player has to sit in a penalty box While the player sits in the penalty box his team has to play without him and will have fewer players on the ice until the penalty is over

Ice hockey is very well known and well liked in Canada Russia Sweden Finland the Czech Republic the United States Latvia and Slovakia Most of the best players in the world play in the National Hockey League which has 30 teams in the United States and Canada They try to win the Stanley Cup at the end of the year Another popular hockey league is the Kontinental Hockey League which has teams in Russia Kazakhstan Latvia and Belarus In North America women play in the Canadian Womens Hockey League and the Western Womens Hockey League In North America and Europe mens hockey is much more popular than womens hockey Hockey is played by both men and women at the Olympic games and at world championships Ice hockey began in Canada in the 19th century In 2010 the Canadian mens and womens ice hockey teams both won gold medals in Vancouver British Columbia

A song is a piece of music which contains words

Songs can be made in many ways Some people form bands which write and record songs to make money from it Other songs are folk songs which are songs created by people long ago and have been sung as tradition in many countries Some people also make parodies of songs which is usually changing the words of the song but keeping the tune Parodies are usually made to make fun of a song or its writersinger

The word song is often used to describe any piece of music even one without words or lyrics The proper word for a piece of music without words is instrumental

Magnesium is a chemical element with the symbol Mg atomic number 12 and common oxidation state 2 It is an alkaline earth metal and the eighth most abundant element in the Earths crust where it constitutes about 2 by mass and ninth in the known universe as a whole This preponderance of magnesium is related to the fact that it is easily built up in supernova stars from a sequential addition of three helium nuclei to carbon Magnesium ions high solubility in water helps ensure that it is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater

Magnesium is the 11th most abundant element by mass in the human body Its ions are essential to all living cells The ions play a major role in manipulating important biological polyphosphate compounds like ATP DNA and RNA Hundreds of enzymes thus require magnesium ions to function Magnesium is also the metallic ion at the center of chlorophyll and is thus a common additive to fertilizers Magnesium ions are sour to the taste and in low concentrations help to impart a natural tartness to fresh mineral waters

The free element is not found naturally on Earth as it is highly reactive The free metal burns with a characteristic brilliant white light making it a useful ingredient in flares The metal is now mainly obtained by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine

Commercially the chief use for the metal is as an alloying agent to make aluminium magnesium alloys sometimes called magnalium or magnelium Since magnesium is less dense than aluminium these alloys are prized for their relative lightness and strength

Magnesium compounds are used medicinally as common laxatives antacids and in a number of situations where stabilization of abnormal nerve excitation and blood vessel spasm is required

Magnesium is used in electronic devices including mobile phones laptop computers cameras and other electronic components Magnesiums low weight good mechanical and electrical properties are good for these uses

Magnesium reacted with an alkyl halide gives a Gringard reagent which is a very useful tool for preparing alcohols

Magnesium is also used in incindiary bombs which are bombs that blow up and spread fire everywhere

Dan Brown is an American author His best known book is The Da Vinci Code

Dan Brown lives in the United States His father was a math teacher Before Dan Brown wrote books he was an English teacher Dan Browns wife Blythe is an artist Sometimes she is known to help him with his books

Dan Brown also likes to write about codes and secrets Sometimes he writes about real secrets but he mostly writes fiction 

Hollywood director Ron Howard made a movie about one of Browns books Tom Hanks is the movies star actor It was released in theaters in May 2006

Browns next book was supposed to be called The Solomon Key but then the name was changed to The Lost Symbol When the book The Da Vinci Code came out in the United States there were some puzzles hidden in the art of the book cover Brown said that the answers to those puzzles give hints about what would be in his next book Two of the puzzles are about a famous sculpture called Kryptos which is in the middle of the CIA Headquarters building in Washington DC

In 1962 Johnny Carson took over and stayed until 1992 with announcer Ed McMahon as co host Carson and McMahon retired from The Tonight Show in 1992 when Jay Leno became host Leno left the show in 2009 and Conan OBrien became host from June 2009 to January 2010 before leaving due to controversy with The Tonight Shows timeslot Jay Leno became the host of the show again on March 1 2010

In late 2009 NBC said that they would be moving the Jay Leno Show to 1135 PM the time usually slotted for The Tonight Show The Jay Leno Show would be 30 minutes long The Tonight Show would be moved to 1205 AM but would still be a full hour long NBC did this because Jay Leno and Conan OBrien were not getting enough viewers and they believed that moving The Jay Leno Show to late night would increase their prime time viewers

After being told this Conan OBrien said that he would be leaving The Tonight Show He said that he believed that moving the show to 1205 would ruin it and that it would be unfair to Late Night which would have been moved to 105 AM The deal was made that OBrien would receive 33 million and that his staff of almost 200 people would receive 12 million Conan OBriens last show aired on January 22 2010

January 17 is the 17th day in the Gregorian calendar There are 348 days in the year left after January 17

Antoni Grabowski was a Polish chemical engineer and an early supporter of the Esperanto movement The books and poems that he changed into Esperanto from other languages helped to make Esperanto more well known and used

Grabowski was born on June 11 1857 in Nowe Dobre near Chemno in Poland Soon after his birth his family moved from Nowe Dobre to Toru Grabowskis parents did not have a lot of money so Grabowski started to work before leaving high school He wanted to learn a lot though so he got himself ready to take a test to get into grammar school He passed the test

He went to the Nicolaus Copernicus school in Toru At that place he was shown to be smarter than other people that were as old as him He was put in a higher class twice In 1879 his family got more money so Grabowski started to learn philosophy and natural science at the University of Breslau in Wrocaw

After he was done with school he started to work as a chemical engineer After that job he started to work as a manager of a factory

At that time he made many new ideas about chemicals and things that helped with those ideas He became famous among people in Europe because of that He also had the job of making new words in the Polish language for technical things In 1906 he wrote a book Sownik chemiczny The book helped other people to learn the words he had made

At his school Grabowski started to want to know more about language Because of that he joined the Slavic Literary Society a group that wanted to learn about the Slavic language Grabowski did not only want to learn about this language He learned a lot of other languages

In 1887 Grabowski read the book Lingvo internacia Antaparolo kaj plena lernolibro This book was written by LL Zamenhof a person who wanted to make an easy language that everyone could learn This language was called Esperanto Grabowski liked this language a lot He learned it then went to Warsaw to see Zamenhof They spoke to each other in Esperanto

Grabowski thought that books and writing were important to languages He thought that this was much more true with Esperanto Esperanto was getting used more so it needed this So in 1888 Grabowski started to rewrite books into Esperanto from other languages

In the early 1890s Grabowski thought that Esperanto was being used by less people than before He thought that this was because Esperanto needed to be remade in a different way In 1894 though he said that Esperanto was good like it was at first He said that all the time after that too

Grabowski was the leader of the Warsaw Esperanto Society and the Polish Esperanto society for a long time In 1908 he became the director of the Grammar Section of the Esperanto Academy He taught people a lot about Esperanto

From that year until 1914 he made classes for schools about Esperanto He wrote something showing that Esperanto was good for learning other languages People did not know this at that time

World War I made his family have to leave Poland They went to Russia and he was left in Warsaw While he was there he rewrote from Polish one of the most important things that have been changed into Esperanto This was the Polish poem Pan Tadeusz by Adam Mickiewicz

A vessel is a ship or boat The word is also used as a technical term sometimes to talk about containers for holding liquids like a Bronze Age drinking vessel or to describe the tubes carrying liquids in animals or plants like blood vessels or xylem vessels

Fire is a chemical reaction that gives off light and heat It is one of the most familiar examples of the chemical process of oxidationfactdateApril 2009

Fire is very hot It should never be touched for it may burn anything that gets too close If touched with human skin the skin may blister which can take some time to heal If a fire occurs you should cover your mouth with a cold cloth because if you breathe in too much smoke you can faint

Fire can be very useful if it is treated carefully It has always been very important for people to be able to make fire because people need its heat on cold days or its light in darkness or its heat for cooking

If fire is not treated carefully it can be very dangerous A fire that got out of control once destroyed 17400 kman area the size of New York City in the United StatesfactdateApril 2009 Forests can burn down if fires are not controlled Every year large areas of forests are destroyed because of fire particularly in Europe This usually happens in summer Firefighters are people with special training to stop fires or to keep a fire under control 

Fire needs three things to burn oxygen fuel and heat Fuels can be wood tinder coal or any other substance that will easily oxidize Once a fire is burning it creates its own heat which allows the fire to keep burning on its own for some time

A fire can be stopped in three different ways by removing any of the three things it needs to burn

However some fires cannot be smothered such as magnesium flames They can burn in CO2 nitrogen and some other elemental compounds

Fires are usually combustion reactions that take carbon hydrogen and oxygenfactdateApril 2009 The products are very commonly water and carbon dioxide although there are other examples that avoid this generalization such as burning magnesium in air which makes magnesium oxide Fires can occur in many ways and there are many types of fire which if not treated correctly can cause total devastation There are wood fires gas fires metal fires and more

Wood fires can usually be put out with water used to absorb the heat but metal fires are too hot for water to absorb enough heat to put out the fire If water is used to extinguish a metal fire the water will simply evaporate For metal fires sand can be used to cover the fire and choke it off from obtaining oxygen A fire extinguisher can put out most fires

In Europe in the 16th century there was a big change in the Christian religion All over Europe hundreds of thousands of people left the Catholic church to form Protestant churches

The Five solas describe what these Protestant leaders believed

The words Sola Scriptura Solus Christus Sola Gratia Sola Fide and Soli Deo Gloria are not English words They are words written in Latin

Gran Persson was the Prime minister of Sweden between 1996 and 2006 He was the leader of the Social Democratic political party but quit in March 2007 He was replaced by Mona Sahlin as leader of the party the partys first woman to do so

Jane Fonda is an American actress and political activist She is the daughter of Henry Fonda who was an actor She is the sister of Peter Fonda and aunt of Bridget Fonda  both of whom are actors She has won two Academy Awards for her acting

A doctor is someone who practices medicine to treat illnesses and injuries

Doctors go to medical school to be trained They typically hold a college degree in medicine Doctors once made house calls to treat patients at home but now mostly see patients in their offices or in hospitals Doctors may also work for schools companies sports teams or the military Doctors are often assisted by nurses or other staff

Doctors treat patients by diagnosing them or figuring out what is wrong When doctors diagnose a patient they begin by asking questions about the patients symptoms such as fever headache or stomach ache They may ask other questions about things like past illnesses or family members who have been sick They will then examine the patient often looking at different parts of the body and listening to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope Sometimes they may need to collect blood use an x ray machine or use other tools to look for things they cannot see when examining the patient Usually when they have gathered enough information a doctor can make a diagnosis and then prescribe a treatment Often they prescribe drugs

Some doctors specialize in a certain kind of medicine These doctors are called specialists They may only treat injuries to a certain part of the body or only treat patients who have certain diseases For example there are doctors who specialize in diseases of the stomach or intestines Other doctors are general practitioners or family practitioners This means that they do a little bit of everything They try to deal with as much of a patients health problems as they can without sending them to a specialist A doctor who performs surgery is called a surgeon 

Other kinds of doctors specialize in treating eyes They are called eye doctors or optometrists They give people glasses or contact lenses Doctors who specialize in treating feet are called podiatrists They often give people medicine for feet such as creams These doctors are usually found working in their own offices as opposed to other offices

The main idea of the series is the opposite of what is the normal Hollywood idea about horror In traditional Hollywood horror stories the young blonde girl is always the weakest character She is always the one that needs to be saved She is often the first one to die In Buffy Whedon changed that He changed that girl into the person with all the power He changed her into the hero Many of the monsters and storylines on the series are symbols of real life problems faced by teenagers As Whedon has said Highschool is a horror movie

Buffy the Vampire Slayer was first shown on March 10 1997 on the WB network It was a very important part of the Warner Bros television network in its early years After five seasons the series left the WB and went to the United Paramount Network for its last two seasons In the United Kingdom the entire series was shown on Sky One and BBC2 The BBC showed the series at two different times A family friendly version with violence and bad language cut out was shown early in the evening and an unedited version was shown later at night Sky One did something similar It showed an edited version in the afternoon and the uncut version in prime time From the fourth season onwards the BBC showed the series in anamorphic 169 widescreen format but Whedon said that Buffy was never supposed to be watched this way

The Slayer or Chosen One is a girl who kills vampires She had superhuman strength and speed She also heals very fast It is her destiny to fight evil demons mainly vampires When the Slayer dies a new girl is chosen That girl gets all of the powers of the Slayer Potentials are trained from an early age by a Watcher In this series Buffy Summers Kendra Young and Faith Lehane were the main slayers

The main character was Buffy Summers She was played by Sarah Michelle Gellar Buffy was an ordinary high school student in the fictional city of Sunnydale California except for being a vampire slayer Buffys Watcher was a British man named Giles With the help of Giles and her friends Xander and Willow Buffy fought a different monster every episode

Buffy and her friends went to school at Sunnydale High School They appear normal to their families while killing vampires and monsters at night 

Not all vampires were evil in the series One vampire was named Angel He was given his soul back by a gypsy curse The curse would make him lose his soul and become evil again if he became really happy He and Buffy fell in love The curse took his soul away when they had sexual intercourse for the first time This caused Angel to become evil When Angel got back his soul he knew that he and Buffy could not be together because he might lose it again Angel left Sunnydale and went to Los Angeles The television series Angel tells the story of what happened to him after he left

Buffy Anne Summers is the Slayer one in a long line of young women chosen to fight evil She is blonde and beautiful and she is a normal cheerleading girl at the start of the movie Being the Slayer gave her increased strength endurance agility and healing She also had greater intuition and some ability of clairvoyance usually in the form of dreams that tell the future She was born January 19 1981 and grew up in Los Angeles California Buffy died two times in the normal series There have also been magical times that she died in but these periods of time were stopped and do not affect normal times The first time she died she drowned and was brought back to life with CPR The second time magic was used to bring her back to life

Rupert Ripper Giles is Buffys Watcher He was an Englishman He was Buffys second Watcher Her first watcher was killed in the movie version of the story but this fact is not talked about in the series Unlike most slayers it was not known that Buffy was a potential slayer at an early age When she was chosen the Watchers council sent a watcher to help her When he died the Council sent Giles to Sunnydale to become her watcher In the past Giles used magic and had a lot of knowledge about demons and vampires 

Willow Rosenberg was Buffys schoolmate and best friend She was very smart and good with computers During the series she learned more and more about magic She found out that she is very good at magic and became a powerful witch While in highschool she had a boyfriend named Oz who was a guitarist in a local band called Dingoes Ate My Baby and he was also a werewolf After Oz left in college Willow fell in love with another witch Tara Maclay When Tara was killed Willow tried to destroy the world but Xander stopped her Later on at the end of season seven she developed a relationship with a potential slayer named Kennedy

Alexander Lavelle Xander Harris was another good friend of Buffy During season 4 Xander becomes romantically involved with an ex vengeance demon Anya whom he later became engaged to but left during the wedding in the episode Hells Bells It was said many times during the series that Xander was the person in the group who had no special powers at all but still fought as much as everyone else and in season 7 Xander is named the Seer because he sees everything that is going on because hes never actually in the spotlight just next to it Xander was often the character the writers used for comic moments Xander was a major character in the series and saved the world at the end of Season 6 by telling her he loved her repeatedly accessing the human love inside of her evil persona created by Tara Maclays death

Dawn Summers was a magical energy that was turned into a person and Buffys sister At first Dawn had the special ability to open the way to a hell dimension After Buffys death closed that way Dawns only special abilities was being very good with languages and a very fast learner She could have made a very good Watcher

Anya Christina Emmanuella Jenkins or Anyanka or Aud was an 1100 year old vengeance demon She was born with the name Aud somewhere in Scandinavia during the 9th century She became a vengeance demon after casting a magic spell on her lover Olaf The spell turned him into a troll Anya spent the next 1100 years as Anyanka As a vengeance demon she would use magic to give a wish to a woman who had been treated wrong by a man Anyaka lost her powers during a wish she cast for Cordelia Chase When the wish was ended Anyanka was trapped in the human body of 17 year old Anya Anya and Xander got together after graduation and later were engaged But Xander left her at the wedding realising he was not ready to get married but still loved her She then got her vengeance powers back from DHoffryn but later lost them again after she realized how unfulfilling maiming human men was

Angel was an Irish vampire first named Liam He was born in 1727 in Galway Ireland After being turned into a vampire in 1753 he spent the next 145 year creating terror as Angelus In 1898 he killed the daughter of gypsies As punishment the Gypsies returned Angelus human soul to him This caused him to have to feel all the pain he had caused Angel went to the United States and lived on the streets He stopped killing people to drink their blood because with a soul he knew it was wrong He lived a very poor life drinking the blood of rats until a messenger from the Powers That Be took him to California to show him Buffy He fell in love with her and changed his life so he could help her Buffy fell in love with Angel but he turned evil after she gave him one true moment of happiness Then he turned into Angelus and when he was finally changed back Buffy stabbed him in order to once again save the world by closing acaphla

Cordelia Cordy Chase went to Sunnydale High with Buffy She was a cheerleader who only thought of herself She would help Buffy every now and then but most often was the one that needed help During her senior year of high school all the money Cordelias parents had was taken away by the government because Cordys dad had not fully paid his familys taxes Cordy had to get a job at a dress store to pay for a dress for her senior prom

Although Cordelia started off as a self involved character she grew throughout the first three seasons learning to love others After Season 3 of Buffy Cordelia moves away to LA to become an actress After having little luck she meets Angel and they work together in the detective business Angel Investigations Cordelias character grows even further throughout Angel as well and by Season 45 of Angel she seems to be a completely different person

Spike or William the Bloody was an English vampire He was born in London around 1853 He was turned into a vampire in 1880 by Drusilla a pretty vampire created by Angelus He spent the next 20 years with Angelus Drusilla and Darla as they killed throughout Europe and Asia After Angelus got his soul back and left Spike and Drusilla continued for 100 years before going to Sunnydale to try and find him Later Spike fell in love with Buffy He fought a demon and got his soul back and helped save the world in the last episode He was sent by the amulet he wore to Angel

Faith Lehane was a vampire slayer Buffys first death caused Kendra Young to be chosen as the Slayer When Kendra died Faith was chosen Faith is in many ways the opposite of Buffy While Buffy had family and friends for support Faith was alone Faith tried to fight evil but later chose to be evil instead In the end Faith learns from her mistakes and helps Buffy in her fight

Daniel Oz Osborne was a musician and werewolf He was Willows first boyfriend For three nights each month Oz would change shape If he was not put into a cage or locked up he would roam Sunnydale from the time the sun set until it came up again in the morning Being a werewolf gave him increased strength endurance and healing As a werewolf his mind was similar to an animal and not a human

Riley Finn was a member of a secret part of American military During the day he was a helper to a professor at Sunnydale University At night he lead a military team that hunted and captured demons He had increased strength and endurance but he was not as strong as Buffy He gave Buffy an ultimatum and at the last minute she decided on him But when she got to his helicopter they had already taken off and he did not see her When he comes back in a later episode Buffy finds out that he is married

Joss Whedon uses several themes throughout his works These are often found in the writing done for Buffy

Vampires are monsters in legends and stories The first vampire stories were told in Eastern Europe but much of how modern people see vampires was created by Bram Stoker in the famous novel Dracula Few people believe that vampires are real but they are still very popular in movies television and books

Vampires were once people but have a supernatural curse Some vampires must drink blood to survive They do this by biting people or animals on the neck with their two long fangs People who are killed by having their blood drank by vampires may also become vampires Others can live off the life energy of people In many stories vampires can change into other animals usually bats though also wolves cats or rats

Depending on the story vampires may have some or all of these characteristics

Dracula is the most famous vampire in fiction and several movies have been made about him There is also a popular series of books by Anne Rice about vampires The television show Buffy the Vampire Slayer featured a young girl who fought vampires but also befriended good ones The series Twilight by Stephenie Meyer is also about vampires The movie The Lost Boys was about a band of vampires in modern California Among many other stories shows and movies about vampires

In stories garlic is often used for keeping vampires away A branch of wild rose and hawthorn plant are said to hurt vampires and in Europe putting mustard seeds on the roof of a house was said to keep them away Though this is not traditional mirrors have been used to make vampires stay away Not all vampires in stories have this quality was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula

Some neurolgists believe that rabies might lie at the base of the myth

The problem with this is that rabid people especially in advanced stages of the disease will live for about ten days at best This does not account for them getting out of ditches and graves over weeks or months

Another explanation was given by other people The disease might be porphyria rather than rabies Porphyria is a genetic condition that leads to differences when the body makes blood Some parts of the blood can not be made in sufficient quantities 

Psychological disorders can contribute to vampiric behavior As well as the fact that drinking blood has always been believed to give you the strength of the one you drink from That belief stems all the way back to ancient civilizations

There are people in the real world who like to dress and behave like a vampire Some of them may also drink blood

Finally there is the vampire bat

Degree generally means to have a level in something

The word degree can mean

A degree is a document that a student receives when they graduate from a school to show that they completed all their classes This is also called a diploma

Before college high schools are usually the only schools that give out actual degrees or diplomas to graduating students Some middle schools have also started to do this to make students feel like they have accomplished more

Academic degrees are degrees that are given out by places of higher education such as universities and colleges In many English speaking countries these degrees are shown by letters which the person is allowed to put after their name eg John Smith BA A bachelors degree is usually the degree received at the end of a course While the student is studying for a degree he or she is an undergraduate When he graduates he is a graduate He may continue with his studies and receive a Masters Degree or do some original work and write a thesis to get a Doctors degree

Examples of degrees

High school is a kind of school a place where people go to learn skills for future jobs Most people go to high school right after middle school Most finish high school but some people stop in the middle or choose to finish high school later 

In the United States a high school is a school that students go to usually for grades 9 through 12 from the ages of 14 to 18 It is also the last school that the law requires the student to go to However students with behavioral issues that are too much for the school to handle are not required to attend This is called expulsion Some people may choose to take some tests called GED as another way to finish high school

In the United Kingdom the last school that the law requires the student to go to is called a secondary school

There are public high schools and private high schools in the United States and the United Kingdom and many other countries

A public school can means different things in different countries

In the United States and Canada public schools are schools that are paid for by the government They are open to all students who live nearby without any charge They are usually paid for through property taxes that are applied to everyone who owns buildings in the area around the school

Public schools started in the United States in the 1800s Every US state now has free public schools

Some people think that public schools in the United States are doing a bad job of educating students One solution has been to give vouchers to parents that help them send their children to private schools Critics say this takes money away that could go to improving public schools

In the United Kingdom most Commonwealth counties and some other English speaking counties public schools are the same They are called public because they accept students from anywhere  not just people living nearby in the school area Some special schools offer boarders this is where students can sleep and live at school during the week or for the whole school term

Seoul is the biggest city of the Republic of Korea and its capital Its official name is Seoul Special City It is in the middle of Korea It has a population of 10 millions which is about 15 of the Korean population and 17 of Korea peninsula and covers an area of 610 km that is only 06 of South Korea It is the 6th most populated city in the world and 7th most crowded Seoul is the center of politics economy culture transportation and education for South Korea 

Seoul is in the middle of the Korean Peninsula Han River is a major river in South Korea and the fourth longest river on the Korean peninsula This river across Central of Seoul

Seoul hosted the 1986 Asian Games and the 1988 Olympic Games It also hosted the 2007 World Schools Debate Championships

Seoul is thought to be the capital of Baekje Kingdom from 18 BC At that time the name of the city was Wiryeseong Wiryeseong is thought to be Songpa gu Seoul During Silla Period Hanju was name of Seoul During Goryeo Period the name of Seoul was Namgyeong which means the south capital There was a palace of Goryeo Dynasty Hanyang was name of Seoul in late Goryeo Period After establishment of Joseon Dynasty the name of Seoul was Hanseong and Hanseong became the capital of Joseon Kingdom From 1910 to 1945 when Korea was under Japanese rule the name of Seoul was Gyeongseong Since South Korea was started in 1948 it has been the capital except for a short time during the Korean War Seoul became a special city in 1948 April 19th Revolution and June Revolution was took place in Seoul

A welfare state is where the government has a duty to provide some level of basic support for its citizens including Social Security 

For example school is free and it is a duty of state to heal ill people The state may give money to people who do not have as much as most other people The state may also give homes to people who do not have them To make this happen there may have to be taxes and usually rich people have to pay most taxes The taxes vary however to ensure that the less rich people can afford to pay them For example in the UK poorer people have to pay a smaller part of their income as income tax than the rich There are also taxes put on things that people do not have to pay if they do not do certain things such as buying as much This is called VAT which typically deducts 15 so that there is no fixed amount of tax to pay A Welfare State could also be paid for if the government borrows money from people mainly by selling bonds 

The most known welfare states are Nordic countries The United Kingdom Canada and France are some other examples of welfare states

Athlete tracks have appeared on the following compilation CDs

Organic chemistry is the study of chemical compounds that contain carbon Carbon has the ability to form a chemical bond with a wide variety of chemical elements and other carbon atoms This allows a nearly unlimited number of combinations The subject of carbon compounds is called organic chemistry because almost all organisms or living things are made up of water and carbon compounds Organic chemistry largely involves the synthesis or formation of organic products by chemical reaction using different reactants and reagents the substances used up during a reaction Several different areas of chemistry expand on the concepts and principles of organic chemistry including biochemistry microbiology and medicine

The term organic originates from Jons Jacob Berzelius a nineteenth century Swedish scientist who used the term to refer to substances present in living systems During Berzelius time the vital force theory was popular This theory stated that a life force was needed to produce the organic compounds found in living things The vital force theory began losing support after an 1828 experiment conducted by Friedrich Whler His work showed that urea an organic compound could be created from ammonium cyanate an inorganic compound

The study of hydrocarbons is a very large part of organic chemistry Hydrocarbons are molecules containing only the elements carbon and hydrogen in the form of chains Hydrocarbons can be classified into two categories based on the presence of a benzene ring a circular type of hydrocarbon Aliphatic hydrocarbons do not contain a benzene ring and aromatic hydrocarbons do

A reaction mechanism is a series of smaller reactions that form an overall reaction Substitutions and elimination reactions are very important in the study of organic chemistry mechanisms

A unimolecular substitution mechanism occurs in steps First an atom called the leaving group breaks away from a molecule leaving the molecule with a positive electric charge This intermediate is called a carbocation Second a nucleophile forms a chemical bond with the carbocation If the nucleophile has a neutral charge a third step is required The third step uses a reagent to remove the positive charge The shorthand symbol for unimolecular substitution is SN1

In a bimolecular substitution a nucleophile which is a reagent that forms a chemical bond replaces another atom attached to a molecule The original atom is called the leaving group because it leaves the molecule The bonding of the nucleophile and the departure of the leaving group are concerted and happen at the same time instead of one at a time The shorthand symbol for a bimolecular substitution is SN2

The first step of a unimolecular elimination reaction is an atom the leaving group breaks away from a molecule The loss of this atom forms an intermediate carbocation Then a basic reagent attacks a hydrogen atom and forces a double bond The reagent in an elimination reaction is a base These are the same steps as in a bimolecular elimination but they are not concerted and occur one at a time The shorthand symbol for unimolecular elimination is E1

The reagent in an elimination reaction is a base The base takes a proton from the leaving group forcing electrons to form a double chemical bond and break the bond to the leaving group Like bimolecular substitution this is a concerted step The shorthand symbol for bimolecular elimination is E2

Stereochemistry is the study of molecules in space It looks into the arrangement of atoms inside of molecules in space relative to one another and how they will interact Molecules that have the same chemical make up but are arranged differently are called isomers Famous chemist Louis Pasteur was an early researcher of stereochemistry

A central part of the study of sterochemistry is chirality Put simply chirality looks at the symmetry in chemical molecules If an object cannot be superimposed onto its mirror image then it is a chiral object If it can it is called achiral

Spectroscopy is the study of the interactions between light energy and matter We are able to see colors because of energy absorption by organic and inorganic compounds When a plant undergoes photosynthesis it traps energy from the sun and this is an example of an interaction between energy and organic compounds 

Spectroscopy is used to identify organic molecules in unknown compounds There are many types of spectroscopy but most important to organic chemistry are infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy

A proton is part of an atom They are found in the nucleus of an atom along with neutrons The periodic table groups atoms according to how many protons they have A single atom of hydrogen is made up of an electron moving around a proton Most of the mass of this atom is in the proton which is almost 2000 times heavier than the electron Protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of every other kind of atom In any one element the number of protons is always the same An atoms atomic number is equal to the number of protons in that atom 

Protons are made of quarks A proton is believed to be made up of 3 quarks two up quarks and one down quark One down quark has a charge of 13 and two up quarks have a charge of 23 each This adds to a charge of 1 A proton has a very small mass The mass of the proton is about one atomic mass unit The mass of the neutron is also about one atomic mass unit The size of a proton is determined by the vibration of the quarks that are in it and these quarks effectively form a cloud This means that a proton is not so much a hard ball as an area that contains quarks

March 16 is the 75th day of the year in the Gregorian calendar There are 290 days remaining

Clint Eastwood is an American movie actor director and producer He was born in San Francisco California on May 31 1930 He has appeared in many movies since the 1950s most famous being the Dollars Trilogy of Spaghetti Westerns Dirty Harry Any Which Way You Can and other similar movies He also won critical acclaim as a director with the movies Unforgiven Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil Space Cowboys Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby He lives with his family in Carmel by the Sea California He was the mayor of Carmel by the Sea for two years starting in 1986

Spaghetti Westerns were a name given to low budget Western films which were made by Italian movie companies in the 1960s They were different from the American western movies usually filmed in Italian had limited budgets filmed on location in Spain and Italy with minimal sets and many close ups and artistic shots Perhaps the most well known of these films is The Man with No Name trilogy A Fistful of Dollars For a Few Dollars More and The Good the Bad and the Ugly All three of these films were directed by Sergio Leone featured music by Ennio Morricone and starred American actor Clint Eastwood as the main character

Disneyland Park is a theme park in Anaheim California United States It is the first Disneyland It was opened on July 17 1955 by Walt Disney the man who invented Mickey Mouse It is one of the most popular theme parks in the world Disneyland Park celebrated its golden or 50th anniversary on July 17 2005 

In 2001 the area around the park expanded into a resort with three hotels a shopping and dining area called Downtown Disney and a second theme park Disneys California Adventure The area is now called Disneyland Resort

Walt Disney worked very hard to run his movie studio He liked to spend weekends with his two daughters The family liked going to carnivals and fairs Mr Disney wanted to build a place that had all of the fun of the traveling fairs where parents and children could ride together That is how Mr Disney got the idea for Disneyland In 1953 Mr Disney talked to people at Stanford University He asked them to find a place that would be a good place to build his park The Stanford people recommended an orange grove for sale in Anaheim a farming area south of Los Angeles Mr Disneys friends thought the idea was a crazy one He was sure that his dream would be a good one After selling land that he loved very much in Palm Springs to help pay for the park the building of Disneyland began in 1954 He also used a weekly television show called Disneyland to make people want to see his park In only one year Disneyland Park was open 

When Disneyland Park opened on July 17 1955 the opening was shown on television as it happened Mr Disney asked three of his Hollywood friends to help him Art Linkletter Robert Cummings and Ronald Reagan Many things went wrong that day 11000 people were invited to the private event but nearly 30000 came The streets were still fresh and many people had their shoes stuck in it They stepped out of their shoes Even the running water was a problem Mr Disney had to choose between drinking water and water for flushing toilets Mr Disney chose the toilets Disneyland may have had problems when it opened but it was not long before it became a success Visitor number one million came to Disneyland less than two years later 

Sunday July 17 2005 was the fiftieth anniversary of the opening day Many people waited to enter the park that morning Some people spent the night waiting in Disneys California Adventure A ceremony was held that morning with very important people speaking to the audience Art Linkletter who was part of the first television show was the first to speak The day was also Mr Linkletters 93rd birthday Michael Eisner and Robert Iger the top men at the Disney company each gave speeches California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger gave a speech as did Walt Disneys daughter Diane Disney Miller The ceremony was shown on giant television screens placed in the park and were played over the televisions during the day At 445 that afternoon the exact time the Walt Disney had given his speech on the opening day his speech was played over speakers all over Disneyland

Bigfoot also called Sasquatch is a rarely seen Primate that some people say lives in remote areas of Canada and the United States Even though many people claim to have seen a Bigfoot or seen their tracks no one has ever captured one or found a dead body For this reason some people do not believe in Bigfoot Some also believe Bigfoot is a dangerous monster because of some scary stories told about them Most people who study Bigfoot however agree that the species is probably gentle and intelligent just like humans

Bigfoot is said to be very tall from 7 to 9 feet and covered in brown black red or sometimes even white fur or hair They are said to have very big feet about 13 inches long which is why they are named Bigfoot

Bigfoots are mostly seen in the forests of the Pacific Northwest but sometimes people see them in the Great Lakes area the Midwest or even in swamps in the Southern United States

It is thought that Bigfoot may be related to the Yeti of the Himalayas

The name Sasquatch comes from the Halkomelem language a Central Salish language in the Salish language family Stories of this type of creature are known among a number of First Nations groups in south western British Columbia

Sometimes people who see a Bigfoot are able to take a picture or a film of it The most famous of these is the Patterson Gimlin Film It was named this because the last names of the men who took the film were Patterson and Gimlin In the film a large ape like creature can be seen walking from a lake to a forest Because this is the best film so far of a creature that may be a Bigfoot scientists argue about it a lot Some think that the creature is a real Bigfoot while others think that it is just a person in a gorilla costume Because of this people have done experiments with men in gorilla costumes who try to move like the creature in the film So far none has been able to move just like it This is why there are so many big foot hoaxes He can also be mistaken for a grizzly bearThe evidence obtained from the movie is startling though many have questioned about it Some experts belive if the film is played slightly faster it could have been a man wearing a rubber costume however aspects of the footage are amazing For example biotechnology scientists have said that for Bigfoot to walk upright it would nedd an extended heel The creature in the film too has an extended heel

People do not have to cross a busy road to get from one grid square to the next one because the roads go over bridges and people can cross safely under them The paths that go under the roads and between the houses are called Redways because they are red in color Only people on bicycles and people walking are allowed to use them Cars lorries and motorbikes are not allowed to go on them So people could cycle all the way across the city and never have to go on a busy road

In about 1980 an artist thought it would be very funny to make some cows out of concrete and put them in a field People from Milton Keynes thought that this was a strange thing to do because they can see real cows nearby People who are not from Milton Keynes decided that it must mean that everywhere is covered in concrete and that we would forget what a cow looks like But we know that we have loads and loads of green space and thousands of trees bushes flowers We have birds and small animals There is actually more wild life in the city than there is outside it So we just laugh and think  silly people they believed the artists joke

The Biological model of sex is different from love because it is more like hunger or thirst Helen Fisher an expert in the topic of love divides love into three stages lust attraction and attachment Lust makes people like each other romantic attraction encourages people to focus on mating and attachment helps people tolerate the spouse

Lust is the passionate sexual desire that promotes mating This usually lasts only a few weeks or months Attraction is more for one person specially Recent studies in neuroscience say that as people fall in love the brain releases chemicals including dopamine These chemicals make people less hungry and sleepy and also adds an intense feeling of excitement Research shows that this stage normally lasts from one and a half to three years

Since these lust and attraction stages are both described as temporary a third stage might describe long term love Attachment can be used to describe the bonding period that helps keep spouse and spouse together for many years Attachment occurs in the longer term

Love has consequences for health and well being Joyful activities such as love activate areas in the brain responsible for emotion attention motivation and memory and it may further lead to stress reduction

With the invention of printing in 1440 and particularly the development of the lithographic process invented by a Czech named Alois Senefelder in 1798 in Austria creation of posters became feasible Although handmade posters existed before they were mainly used for government announcements William Caxton who in 1477 started a printing company in England produced the first printed poster

In 1870 the advertising poster emerged

ImageAdele Bloch Bauer I Gustav Klimt01jpg The works of Gustav Klimt an Austrian painter are a clear example of the influence of graphic design on painting This portrait of Adele Bloch Bauer exhibits many of the influences of graphic design 

After the Second World War with the emergence of new color printing technology and particularly appearance of computers the art of posters underwent a new revolutionary phase People can create color posters on their laptop computers and create color prints at a very low cost Unfortunately the high cost of sophisticated printing processes can only be afforded mostly by government entities and large corporations With the emergence of the internet the role of posters in conveying information has greatly diminished However some artists still use chromolithography in order to create works of art in the form of print In this regard the difference between painting and print has been narrowed considerably The following files show some of the post WWII posters httpenwikipediaorgwikiFilePlakattervjpg httpdewikipediaorgwikiDateiSchneideschablonejpg httpenwikipediaorgwikiFile27CompositionNo127lithographbyTetsuoOchikubo1960jpg

Pictures movies and writing about sex are sometimes called pornography Pornography is a picture movie or writing that is created to make people get sexually excited 

Works of art movies or writing that show sex can be called by several different names Pictures or movies showing naked people might be called erotica or might be pornography depending on the way the naked person is shown Works of art movies and writing about loving people acting in a sexual manner to each other are often called erotica rather than pornography It also depends on the judgment of the person who is looking at the picture 

In the law of most countries showing naked people is not called pornography unless the people are doing something that is sexual In the law of many countries many types of pornography are legal Some types of pornography are believed to harmful or disrespectful to the people taking part or to the people who watch or read it Harmful pornography is called obscene Most countries have laws against these types of pornography One type of pornography that is against the law in most countries is child pornography Some people have moral or religious views which are against the making and use of pornography 

Pornography can be shown in different ways Some ways include photos drawings paintings animations and films Live shows are usually not considered pornography Pornography is made to entertain adults Many people are involved in making selling or showing pornography Those people who are shown in pornographic pictures or movies are called pornographic actors or porn stars 

The word pornography comes from the Greek words meaning prostitute and writing The word was first used for stories that were written about sex 

The word pornography is now used for photographs and other pictures movies and writing that are about sex In pornography sex is the most important thing It is also called porn or porno for short 

There are different ideas about what is and what is not pornography Diana Russell a psychologist says that there is a difference between pornography and erotica The word erotica is often used for pictures movies or stories that focus on the beauty of sexuality There is not often a clear difference between erotica and pornography The dispute over what is or is not pornography can even go to the courts

Some people believe that anything that shows a naked body is a type of pornography The laws of the United States and many other countries do not support this There can be all sorts of reasons for showing a naked or partly undressed body Some of these reasons include art work or a medical diagram

There are different kinds of pornography The term soft porn is sometimes used for pictures that show people who may or may not be naked but who are posed in a sexy manner Pictures of women like this are sometimes called cheesecake and pictures of men are called Beefcake Pornographic pictures or movies which show people having sex are sometimes called hard porn

Another type of pornography is child pornography In the law of most countries people are children until they reach a particular age Any film or photo that show a person who is a child being used for a sexual act is considered pornography and is illegal There are laws to protect children against people who use or exploit them in this way

Businesses have been making pornography for many years Until the 1970s businesses making pornography were small because there were many laws against it In the 1970s pornographic magazines such as Penthouse became a huge and successful business Pornography films also become popular at this time In the 1980s the creation of the video cassette recorder caused a rise in the pornography business A number of companies began making pornographic videotapes in the United States In the 1990s as more people began using the Internet businesses began selling pornographic pictures on the Internet In the 2000s the increased speed of computers allowed pornography companies to sell porn videos over the Internet The pornography brand Mitchell Gaffney was the first wesbite that contrained such items 

There are many different kinds of businesses that make and sell pornography There are magazines such as Playboy and Hustler Movie companies such as Vivid Video hire pornography actors and produce videos There are also thousands of Web sites that make and sell porn Businesses that make pornography call themselves adult entertainment businesses

In many countries it is a serious crime to make pornographic photographs of children This is called child porn In the United States there are laws that say that anyone who takes pornographic photos must keep records that prove the ages of the people in the pictures are over 18

In many countries such as India Indonesia Iran and Pakistan making or owning pornography is a crime However in some cultures such as Western European nations and the US making or owning pornography is legal It is legal as long as all of the people in the pornography are older than a certain age It must also be sold to people above a certain age Often this age is 18 years The Netherlands have very liberal laws about pornography Many cities or towns have rules about where pornographic videos or magazines can be sold and on how these videos or magazines can be displayed For example some towns in Canada require pornographic video packages to be kept out of sight of children

Since the 1970s many womens groups and feminist writers have criticized pornography especially hardcore pornography Womens groups and feminist writers have argued that hardcore pornography shows women in degrading or humiliating positions Some psychologists who have talked with many people who are in jail for violent sex crimes believe that pornography that shows violent sex often makes people less caring about the feelings of other people This might make them more likely to commit rape and other sex crimes Many pedophiles who sexually assault children also have collections of child pornography 

Pornography is often criticised by religious people and churches who believe that it is unholy Many parents do not wish their children to see pornography Special computer programs can be installed on computers to block access to some websites including websites that have pornography 

In the novel Nineteen Eighty Four by George Orwell pornography is described as a tool that is secretly pushed by some evil governments The governments believe it is a force that makes the public less likely to rebel or even to care about injustice

Many countries have laws against child pornography These laws say that children may not be involved in making pornography There are problems however With the Internet it can be very hard to say if a person involved in pornography is really a child or if they are an adult pretending to be one Also organized crime makes money from trafficking human beings often girls and women who are trafficked are forced into prostitution They are sometimes also forced to make pornography

Nudity means nakedness A nude person is a naked person This means that the person is not wearing clothes Nudity is when a person or people have no clothes on 

The word nudity can also be used when only part of a persons body is uncovered It is used particularly if the persons genitals can be seen even if other parts of the body are covered 

Nudity can also mean that a person is wearing less clothing that other people would expect This type of nudity is related to culture People of different cultures wear different amounts of clothing and keep different parts of the body covered 

The word nude is often used in art A nude figure is a figure without clothes on The nude figure might be a live person who is posing for an artist A painting or sculpture that shows a nude figure is often just called a nude

What societies think about nudity 

There are several things that affect how people and societies feel about nudity 

In most cultures it is normal to keep parts of the body covered The feeling that a person has about covering their body is called modesty Modesty is different in different cultures Often people feel shame if their body is not covered to match their cultures idea of modesty  The amount of clothing needed to take away the feeling of shame is different for each culture With some indigenous peoples like the Yanomami a piece of string is enough to make that feeling go away 

In some cultures people nearly always keep their bodies covered In these cultures nudity is only normal when a person is alone for example dressing or bathing In other cultures it is quite normal for people to be naked together for example when dressing or swimming In still other cultures particularly indigenous ones people wear very few clothes and complete nudity is normal 

Even with people from the same culture different people can have different feelings about nudity Some people in Western culture do not mind if a family member sees them naked in the bath Other people from the same culture would be uncomfortable if anyone saw them naked in the bath Some women in a Western culture are happy to wear a bikini Other women feel naked in a bikini and always wear a one piece swimsuit

Rules 

Many societies have rules or laws about nudity and where they allow it For example in some societies the law allows nudity on a beach but does not allow nudity in a public street The same sort of laws can also allow people to be partly naked in some places but not in others for example women might be allowed to have naked breasts on the beach but not in a shopping centre When a woman uncovers her breasts on the beach this is called toplessness This is allowed in many parts of Europe and Australia In many other countries it is not allowed 

The rules about dress and nudity may be set by a government or by a church or some other organisation For example in some Christian churches a woman must cover her shoulders and a man must not have bare legs Another example is in many schools a man must wear a jacket over his shirt and a woman must wear a dress that has sleeves Another example is that some hotels that are near beaches will not serve customers who are dressed only in swimsuits 

Some countries have very strict laws about whether a person can be nude in public and what parts of the body can be shown In many countries if a person breaks these laws they can be charged with indecency For example if a man took his trousers off near a school so that the children would see him he would be charged with indecency The reason why a person is nude affects whether the law says that their nudity is indecent

Functional nudity 

Functional nudity is when a person is nude for a reason Even where nudity is generally not allowed functional nudity often is 

An example of this is when a person at the beach changes from a wet swimsuit to their dry clothes Often the person who is changing can use a towel so that other people do not see their nudity and do not become embarrassed or angry

Another type of functional nudity happens when a woman is breastfeeding in public A woman who would not usually show her breasts because of modesty might be quite happy to show her breast while she is feeding a baby

Sex segregation 

In some countries functional nudity is usual for people of different genders in some places An example is in a mixed gender public sauna In many cultures functional nudity is usual in front of people of the same sex Places where functional nudity happens such as public toilets or changing rooms are usually separated by gender There is one for men and another one for women In many cultures it is usual for people of the same sex to undress or take a shower in a public change room In some cultures such as Japan open showers and open urinals in mens toilets are not allowed

Western culture 

Among people of Western culture around the world there are several influences on the way societies feel about nudity In European society it is not usual for older children or adults to be completely nude in public In most European societies when people swim in public they cover their genitals and women also cover their breasts In most European societies change rooms and toilets are separated for men and women 

Countries in Southern Europe where the Catholic Church is very important as well as English speaking countries which have been affected by Puritanism usually have a lower tolerance towards nudity in public Countries in Central Europe and Scandinavia care less about public nudity 

Naturism is a cultural and political movement Followers of this movement think that nudity should get a higher value both in the private as well as the public context It is also a lifestyle based on personal family andor social nudity

Naturists reject current standards of modesty These discourage people from being naked alone in the family or at social occasions they say They want to create a social environment where people feel comfortable in the company of nude people and do not fear being seen nude either just by other nudists or also by the general public

The singer Janet Jackson was the cause of a scandal during the Super Bowl in 2004 She was performing during the half time break when her robe moved Her left breast could be seen for a few seconds Today this is known as the Wardrobe Malfunction or Nipplegate by the media the latter being a comparison to the Watergate scandal 

The Royal Academy of Arts runs some museums in London and elsewhere In 2008 they did an advertisement so that more people would visit their museums In this advertisement they showed a picture of a naked woman This painting was done by Lucas Cranach the Elder in the 15th century It is called Venus The picture was printed on ads in the London Underground It caused protests in London Because of the protests Transport for London refused to allow the ads to be used in the Underground On December 7 2008 the Internet Watch Foundation put the Wikipedia article on Virgin Killer on their blacklist This meant that most Internet users in Great Britain could no longer access the article The foundation did this because they believed the original album cover could be child pornography The cover is pictured on the Wikipedia article It shows a naked ten year old girl in a sexual pose with her breasts shown

There are different traditions about nudity in Africa Some of Africa south of the Sahara is similar to how they were after Colonialism In certain Togolese tribal areas it is common for big families to not wear any clothes at all for certain festivities Others do not wear any clothes below the waist This makes it possible for young men to see women and girls whom they may marry Stick fighting tournaments are very popular places to do this

Other people like the Bantu do not like public nudity at all A newspaper in Botswana once printed a photograph showing how a thief was punished He was flogged on his bare buttocks Many people did not like this The problem was not the flogging but the newspaper showing the picture

The Ugandan Kavirondo tribes are a mix of Bantu and Nilotic immigrants Traditionally they went mostly naked Over time the men began wearing clothing similar to men in western culture

Among many Muslim people a woman is thought to be not properly dressed unless her legs arms and hair are completely covered In some Arabic countries women wear a garment called a Burqa The burqa fully covers the woman and has only a slit for her eyes to see If a woman does not wear this garment when she goes out but shows her face hair and arms she is thought to be naked Not wearing the burqa brings shame on herself and family

Nudity in art 

There are different levels of nudity Societies have different moral values for these levels One such level in English is called full frontal nudity This usually is a pose where the nude person faces the viewer In this pose there are no things covering parts of the body Many societies see this as very bad The image below called Truth shows this pose 

Most movies try not to show this type of nudity This is often done by putting an object somewhere This object will hide the pubic area of the naked actor or actress This kind of nudity can also be seen in the picture Woman Bathing above 

Since the very early ages nudity has been a subject of the arts One of the earliest works of art known is the Venus of Willendorf It is a statuette of a nude woman The face of the woman is not visible The belly of the woman as well as her breasts are exaggerated It is not known what the statuette meant to the people who made it or what importance it had From the Renaissance onward nude figures were shown in works of art more often Michelangelo is one of the Renaissance artists known for doing this 

Since the beginning of photography people have taken photographs of nude people Some people simply photographed nude people Some of the photographs were made to sexually arouse people These are generally called pornography Some people also photographed nude people because they thought the human body was something beautiful to show These photos are usually not sexual in nature and are known as nude photography The kind of photography that is in between is called erotic photography

The creation story in the Old Testament of the Bible mentions nudity as a sign of innocence Only after Adam and Eve have eaten from the tree of knowledge do they become aware of their nudity and start to feel ashamed Theologians see this feeling of shame as a consequence of the fall from grace Because of this they are later chased away from the Garden of Eden The Bible does not make a distinction between shame as a consequence of not obeying a rule and the shame resulting from nudity

The Old Testament often sees nudity as a consequence of being poor or of being a social outcast It is not seen as a result of breaking rules and accepted Later Orthodox Judaism sees nakedness as a bad thing

In Ancient Greece especially Ancient Athens people did not see a problem with nude men Nude women were seen as bad though and women were forbidden from being nude in public The Cynics taught that it was bad to have worldly goods Feelings like shame were also seen as bad There was nothing wrong with being naked 

The Gymnasion shows by its name alone that public nudity was not common in Ancient Greece The name comes form gyns which means naked The gymnasion was used for sports In Ancient Greece most sports were done totally naked In most places in Ancient Greece women were forbidden from doing sports or from attending sports events

The only place were women were allowed to do sports was Sparta There they also did sports like the men but separated from these They were also naked while doing sports

Another place where nakedness was tolerated was in the arts

In Ancient Rome nudity was nothing special or unusual It was seen more as a sign of not needing much People did not attach sexual feelings to it When the Romans had conquered Ancient Greece they did not think it was necessary to discuss or forbid that the Olympic Games were done in the nude Cato the Elder mentions that usually the virtuous Roman worked nude during the summer months

The Celtic and Germanic tribes bathed nude in rivers and lakes together and that sometimes children grew up nude Romans also tell us that some of them fought the Romans in the nude

Both Jainism and Hinduism have special monks In Jainism these are called Digambars in Hinduism they are called Sadhus Both lead an ascetic lifestyle and are well respected in their community Part of this lifestyle is that they wear little or no clothes

Many cultures that expect some level of modesty associate nudity with sexuality These cultures usually know striptease in some form When the difference between the sexes is shown in the main stream media of these cultures this is often seen as sexually related In Latin cultures the common definition of modesty does not generally allow genital nudity but the definition of what is lewd has changed and womens breasts are now commonly exposed or depicted without scandal

Nudity in front of a sexual partner is widely accepted but there may be restrictions for example only at the time and place of sex or with subdued lighting during bathing with the partner or afterwards covered by a sheet or blanket or while sleeping

In Ancient Greece it was seen as normal that the athletes taking part in sporting events like the Olympic Games were nude for most events At that time women were not allowed to take part or in the games or watch them Nudity with women was frowned upon

At least since the early 20th century there is a movement of people wanting to do some things together while they were nude Sometimes it was just seen functionally like a common bath in a pond or lake Some people do other activities together where being naked is usually not required For instance some people prefer nude sunbathing when otherwise a Swimsuit could be worn There are some nude bicycle tours This movement is generally known as naturism or nudism In 2009 Appenzell Innerrhoden a small Swiss canton voted to stop nude hiking German tourists have been walking nude through the Alps wearing only boots socks and a back pack The canton will fine nude hikers 200 Swiss francs

The Naturism movement of the 20th century claims that being nude is healthy Starting in 1853 reformer Arnold Rikli said that Sun and airbathing is a good thing and that it can only give its full potential when done in the nude Many of these views have been proved wrong today Not smoking or drinking alcohol is good for health regardless of whether clothing is worn or not People suffering from being exposed too little to the sun will also be so if they are clothed Wearing wet clothes can lead to cystitis

Some doctors recommend sleeping in comfortable clothes or sleeping naked At some points in time fashion dictates very tight fitting clothes These can be bad for health

Some people use the nudity as a form of protest like a movement in the United States that wants equal treatment of bare chested men and women This movement fights for the right of women to be topless Often this is done with topless demonstrations

One example that nudity was used as a form of protest even in the Middle Ages is the story of Lady Godiva She is said to have ridden through Coventry totally naked only covered by her long hair She did this to protest against the high taxes

Nudity is often used to draw the attention of customers to a given product That way nude people or people with very little clothing are often shown on covers of magazines even if the content of the magazine has nothing to do with nudity Naked people sometimes in connection with body painting are used to distribute fliers at events

This uses erotic stimuli especially to people of the opposite sex On the other hand nudity seems to work all by itself in such contexts Nudity in public places is rare and people generally do not expect it The more it is used however the less it will act on people At some point it will have become normal

Most children do not develop a feeling of shame until they are about five years old For this reason there have been discussions These discussions try to answer two basic questions

Different people have different opinions on the subject

Works of art such as paintings statues or photographs have shown nude children or nude children with nude adults In recent years showing nude children has become more and more problematic especially with photographs In a few cases photographs taken by parents showing their toddler or small child naked have been seen as child pornography by courts In May 2008 police in Sydney Australia raided an exhibition by the photographer Bill Henson This exhibition showed images of naked children The raid was done on allegations of child pornography Incidents such as this one sent a strong message to the community

People cannot agree if parents should appear naked in front of their children Gordon and Schroeder say that there is a wide variation on parental nudity from family to family According to them there is nothing wrong with bathing with children or otherwise appearing naked in front of them In their opinion doing so may provide an opportunity for parents to give important information They note that by ages five to six children begin to develop a sense of modesty and recommend to parents who wish to be sensitive to their childrens wishes that they limit such activities from that age onwards

Bonner recommends against nudity in the home where children are showing sexual behaviour considered problematic

A study by Alfred Kinsey found that 75 of the participants stated that there was never nudity in the home when they were growing up 5 of them said that there was seldom nudity in the home 3 said often and 17 said that it was usual The study found that there was no significant difference between what was reported by men and by women with respect to frequency of nudity in the home

In a 1995 review of the literature Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect Three years later his team finished an 18 year longitudinal study that showed that if anything such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects particularly for boys

Different cultures have different opinions on whether children should see people other than their parents and other children naked In general the opinions are also different depending on how old the child is and what context the nudity is placed in

Many countries have made laws that should protect children from seeing sex scenes by accident That way such scenes may usually not be shown during the day British TV must not show such scenes between 530am and 9pm This is called watershed The Broadcasting Code requires that Nudity before the watershed must be justified by the context 

Sometimes the nudity of children in front of other children has been an issue In Europe it is common that all students take a shower together after sports classes Usually showering is segregated by sex

In the United States and some of English speaking Canada students at tax funded schools have historically been required to shower with classmates of the same sex after physical education classes In the United States public objections and the threat of lawsuits have resulted in a number of school districts in recent years changing policy to make showers optional A court case in the State of Colorado noted that students have a reduced expectation of personal privacy in regards to communal undress while showering after physical education classes According to an interview with a middle school principal most objections to school showers that he had heard were actually from the students parents rather than from the student

Most people feel uneasy or ashamed when they are nude This fact has been used both as a means of torture and as a punishment That way during witch hunts the alleged witches were stripped to discover what was called the witches mark It was believed that the devil left this mark as part of the pact the witch had with him When the mark was found this was then used as evidence in the trials

Nakedness can also be part of a punishment or a public humiliation Torture manuals sometimes make a difference as men and women react differently when they are disrobed 

The United States and its allies invaded Iraq in 2003 After they had done this members of the United States Army Reserve abused prisoners Photographs were circulated that showed that prisoners had to pose naked were sometimes bound by ropes and intimidated that way

The term robber baron was first used in the 12th and 13th centuries to describe wealthy men who lived in large castles along major transportation rivers like the Rhine in Europe They would send ships out onto these rivers to stop anybody who was traveling through who did not know better and collect a tax from them on any money or goods on these ships They were not officially allowed to collect these taxes It was only the Holy Roman Emperor who could decide what taxes to be charged how much and who could charge it

Wineries are large plantations built along the fertile banks of major rivers like the Rhine 

The rivers provided plenty of water for the grapes in the winery allowed easy transportation of goods carried off wastes and trash and kept a heavy mist over the river and the fields which was cool and kept the sun out 

The sun was bad for the grapes so it was good to keep it out 

Once the grapes ripened and were picked they were placed in a large vat where workers would jump in and crush them with their feet The juice would flow down to a conical opening covered by a filter which kept out the grapes The juice flowed along a pipe to a barrel cask or firkin and was allowed to ferment or age thus allowing wine to be made

Sugar is the common name for a number of chemical substances that have a sweet taste Most of the time it refers to either sucrose lactose or fructose Sugar is contained in certain kinds of food or it is added to give a sweet taste Sugar can look like a white or brown powder Sugar is extracted from certain plants such as sugarcane or Sugar beet

Regular sugar is called sucrose Fructose is the sugar that is in fruits As chemicals sucrose and fructose are both made by two smaller sugars Glucose is the more common of these smaller sugars The human body changes regular sugar into the smaller sugars

Scientists call sugars carbohydrates This is because sugars are made from carbon and water Hydro or hydrate is a way to say contains water Carbohydrates can be simple carbohydrates or complex carbohydrates Simple carbohydrates are made of only one or a few of the smallest sugars Complex carbohydrates are made of many of the smallest sugars

Starch is a chemical found in foods such as bread crackers and potatoes It is a complex carbohydrate that is made from many many glucoses Starch is the way non scientists say complex carbohydrates When starch is eaten the human body breaks it apart into smaller sugars This starts in the mouth When one holds a food with starch in their mouth for a few minutes it starts to taste sweet This is because the starch is broken into smaller sugars that taste sweet

Sugar is not the only substance that makes food sweet Artificial sweeteners are often used to replace sugar in different types of food

Anti tank dogs were dogs with explosives placed on their backs These dogs were trained to run under enemy tanks The explosives were then remotely detonated in order to destroy the target tank

These dogs were trained by the Soviet Union during World War II to be used against German armored vehicles They were trained on Russian tanks which used diesel fuel In battle the dogs often ran toward the smell of diesel fuel from the Soviet tanks instead of the intended German targets 

The German Army soon learned about the dogs so all Russian dogs were shot on sight by the Germans Very few dogs remained in the Eastern Front as a result of this

After the war better weapons against tanks were made Therefore it is unlikely that anti tank dogs will ever be used again

Ido is a planned language a so called reformed Esperanto which was developed in 1907 Ido was made by a group of people that thought Esperanto was too hard to be a world language They did not like how Esperanto used letters with special marks over them because that made it hard to type and they thought that a world language should be easy to learn and write Ido is not as popular as Esperanto but still about 1000 people in the world speak it and they have a conference every year where people come together and speak the language

Ido is easy to learn for many reasons

Each word in Ido comes from a smaller word called a root word A root word has a root and an ending The speaker can take the root and put it on another word to make a new one For example urbo means city and estro means leader The root of urbo is urb and if estro is put on the end it becomes urbestro which means mayor Or the speaker can put something on before chef means chief or leader and if the speaker puts that before the word it becomes chefurbo which means capital city

Here are some of the endings

Pronouns are the words in a language like I you he she it we they and so on Ido was made from Esperanto and all of Esperantos pronouns end in i The people that made Ido thought that they sounded too much the same and that it might be too difficult to hear sometimes Also most languages have two ways of saying you so they decided to have two ways of saying you Lastly they decided to make a pronoun that can mean he or she Some languages like the Finnish language and the Estonian language have something like this

Here is a chart of all the pronouns in English Ido and Esperanto

Ido is a language that came from Esperanto so they look very similar Since Esperanto has more speakers than Ido most people that know Ido first learned Esperanto and then later learned that Ido is a language too Sometimes Idists and Esperantists do not agree with each other Luckily they both agree that making a language that everybody can learn is a good idea Most Idists and Esperantists can understand most of each others language

Here are samples of the language Ido to show what the language looks like On the right is a page from a magazine in Ido called Adavane written by an Ido group in Spain every two months This is a page from a diary by a girl named Anne Frank a Jewish girl from the Netherlands that was killed in 1944 by the German government of Adolf Hitler

This was a song by a bard from Russia named Alexandr Sukhanov he used words from the poetry of another Russian person named Yunna Mortis This is the Ido version sung with guitar

Owls are birds in the order Strigiformes Most of them are solitary and nocturnal 

Owls are specialists at night time hunting They feed on small mammals insects and other birds and a few species like to eat fish as well 

They are found in all parts of the Earth except Antarctica most of Greenland and some other small islands 

The two most important groups of owls are the true owls and the barn owls

Owls have large eyes and holes for ears a hawk like beak and a rather flat face 

Most birds of prey have eyes on the sides of their heads but the owls eyes are facing forwards to help it see better in the dark Their eyes are also fixed inside their sockets so they have to turn their whole head to look at other things Owls can rotate their heads and necks up to 270 degrees in both directions 

Owls are good at looking at things far from its eyes but it cannot see anything clearly within a few centimeters of their eyes Owls use small feathers on the beak and the feet that help it feel the prey it catches

Most owls hunt at night and in twilight A few owls are also active during the day

The owls hunting depends on surprising its prey Their most important adaptation is their almost silent flight The feathers are soft with fringes on the back edge and the base of each is downy This all muffles noise and makes for silence Also coming in for the kill they glide 

The dull colors of the owls feathers make them less visible by camouflaging the owl This helps them as they roost during the day 

Also they have fantastic hearing The shape of the head helps slight sounds reach the ears The feathers of the facial disc are arranged in order to increase sound delivered to the ears Their ears are asymmetrical allowing the owl to locate a sound They can hear a mouse move in the grass 

An owls sharp beak and powerful talons allow it to kill its prey before swallowing it whole unless it is too big Owls usually regurgitate the parts of their prey that they cannot digest These parts include bones scales and fur Scientists who study the things that owls eat can get clues by studying the parts that the owl spit back out called owl pellets These owl pellets are often sold by companies to schools for use in the students biology and ecology lessons

Although owls live separately the noun for a group of owls is a parliament

A sword is a hand held weapon made for cutting It is often made of metal It has a long blade and a handle called a hilt Often there is some form of hand protection such as a cross guard or a basket It can be used either for cutting slashing or stabbing depending on the type of sword

There are many kinds of swords One kind of sword is a sabre A sabre is a curved light sword sharpened on one side and at the tip and was generally used on horseback A broadsword is a straight sword that is sharp on both sides and at the tip A rapier is long and thin with a basket protecting the hand Another type of sword is a foil used in sport fencing and is long and thin with a button at the tip to protect the fencers from injury Larger swords such as Longswords or claymores are used with two hands In Eastern martial Arts swords like the Katana are used A Katana has one sharp edge and a small guard near the handle Some Katanas are used with one hand while other larger versions are used with two hands

Swords were first created from bronze by blacksmiths in Ancient Egypt around 2500 BC Soon other cultures adopted them and they began to spread quite quickly Before guns were invented swords were much more common as a weapon After the invention of the gun swords remained as sidearms as secondary weapons used in man to man fight once the battle lines had contacted after shooting Since after American Civil War swords have not been used as much by armies except as a ceremonial part of uniforms Some guns however have bayonets to perform the same function

Today Sport fencing is an Olympic games sport which uses very light swords as a strict scoring system Western Martial Arts use swords that are much closer to the original blades such as longswords rapiers and sabres The blades used are blunt but they are much heavier than a sport fencing sword which means the fencers need much more armour Likewise the Japanese sport kendo is swordplay in armour with two handed bamboo swords called shinai

The sword of King Arthur Excalibur is one of the most famous swords although it is suspected it is legendary and does not exist

The Frisian freedom fighters Pier Gerlofs Donia and Wijerd Jelckama are known to have wielded swords of great size Donias sword was a long as 210 cm and weighed 7 kg The swords are kept in the Frisian Museum in Leeuwarden

Moses was a religious leader lawgiver and prophet according to the Hebrew Bible Generally he is also seen as the author of the Torah He is often called Moshe Rabbenu in Hebrew and seen as the most important prophet in Judaism Christianity Islam the Bah Faith and the Rastafari also see him as an important prophet Moses has also been an important symbol in American history from the first settlers up until the present

According to the Book of Exodus Moses was born in a time when his people were increasing in number and the Egyptian Pharaoh was worried that they might help Egypts enemies Moses Hebrew mother Jochebed hid him when the Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed and he ended up being adopted into the Egyptian royal family After killing an Egyptian slave master Moses fled across the Red Sea to Midian where he tended the flocks of Jethro a priest of Midian on the slopes of Mt Horeb After the Ten Plagues were unleashed on Egypt Moses led the Hebrew people out of Egypt across the Red Sea where they based themselves at Horeb and compassed the borders of Edom It was at this time that Moses received the Ten Commandments Despite living to the age of 120 Moses died before reaching the Land of Israel

Moses was born of the Levi tribe The new Pharaoh afraid of the ever growing Israelite population ordered every new born Hebrew boy be thrown into the Nile but let every girl live Moses mother Jochebed gave birth and kept him secret for three months When she no longer could keep him hidden she fashioned a basket lined with tar and pitch and placed him in the reeds along the riverbank while his sister Miriam kept watch from a distance Coming to the Nile to bathe a princess of the Pharaoh discovered the crying baby and noticed he was a Hebrew child Joining the attendants Moses sister offered to find a Hebrew woman to nurse the baby for the princess who agreed Bringing Moses real mother the princess asked her to be the babys wet nurse for which she was paid When the child grew older she took him to pharaohs daughter who named him Moses saying I drew him out of the water

Moses grew up a privileged member of the court being well educated academically and physically A member of the Pharaohs household saw him taught martial arts of the day tactics and leadership The Pharaoh sent him away to fight and returned with success making him popular with the people

Moses fled to Midian where he married Jethros daughter Zipora One day Moses was tending his father in law Jethros sheep and came to Mount Horeb Gods angel made a bush burn with fire but it did not burn up When he came nearer God spoke to him and ordered him to remove his shoes as he was on holy land God commanded him to be a leader for the Israelites and bring them out of Egypt At first Moses did not want to do it and said that he was not good with words but God commanded him and gave Aaron his brother to speak for him Moses return to Egypt and told the elders what happened

Moses then went to the Pharaoh and asked him to let the Israelites go However the Pharaoh did not agree Finally God inflicted ten plagues upon the Egyptians before Pharaoh agreed to release the Israelites The last plague was the killing of all first born both human and animals However to save the Israelites they were instructed to mark their doors with blood from a Lamb which is an allusion to Jesus Christ shedding His blood to save mankind in the New Testament so that the avenging angel would see it and know to pass over that house

The Pharaoh finally decided to let the Israelites go who then migrated in large numbers from Egypt The Pharaoh later changed his mind and followed Moses and his people with an army to attack them But Moses made the Red Sea to part and give way for Israelites to pass The Israelites were safe but the Pharaohs army was destroyed

Moses led the Israelites through the wilderness and God gave them manna and quails to eat and water from rocks to drink He also caused the Amalekites to lose in a battle When Moses came to Mount Sinai he went up to receive the Ten Commandments and other laws from God The Ten Commandments were written by God on two tablets God also told him the instructions of the priests duties Moses was up the mountain for forty days and forty nights

When the people waited for Moses and did not find him they made Aaron his brother make a calf out of gold and worshiped it God warned Moses about it and when Moses came down and saw what they did he was so angry that the tablets fell and they smashed into pieces The people of Levi tribes are commanded to kill people who worshiped the calf

Later on Moses asked God to forgive the people God wrote for Moses two more tablets and put them in the Ark Moses also asked craftsmen to make the Tabernacle as God wanted

While the Israelites were wandering around the wilderness Moses was the one whom God spoke to However the people kept complaining about the hardships God instructed Moses to send twelve spies to scout the land God is giving to them however some of them became afraid because the people living there looked stronger and more powerful than they They told the others not to go there Only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh reported the truth as God wanted God decided because of this that the Israelites would wander forty years in the wilderness and every one except Joshua and Caleb from that generation would die without seeing the promised land

God gave many laws to the Israelites through Moses Moses made Joshua take over him before he died

Moses died before he reached Canaan the land God was leading his people to He was 120 years old when he died

Today Jews around the world follow the laws of the Ten Commandments and the Torah that God gave to them through Moses He is also believed to be a prophet by Muslims

The Bible the Torah and the Quran have references to a person called Moses in them The name they give to the person varies Other people also have written about Moses These include Tacitus and Strabo It is not known how much these descriptions have taken from earlier sources which may now have been lost 

An existing earlier source is the Ipuwer Papyrus which records the events of the Ten Plagues

No other written records from countries such as Egypt or Assyria have been found that are from before about 850 BCE and that tell about the stories of the Bible or its main characters There is no known physical evidence to say that Moses really existed Pharaohs have ordered the destruction of records that put them into a bad light Several cartouches from monuments have also been destroyed in different epochs of Ancient Egyptian history

It looks like the story written about Moses in the Bible has two different sources There were two groups of people who told the story The two stories were passed on separately Only later were they combined into the version that can now be found in the Bible Passing on the stories from one generation to the next has perhaps also introduced inaccuracies Some people added things to the story when they told it They also omitted other things

According to the Torah Moses ordered the death penalty for many offences He also had defeated enemies killed Jews Christians and Muslims consider him to be a holy figure For this reason criticism of these passages of the Hebrew Bible has been left to others

In the late eighteenth century for example the deist Thomas Paine commented at length on Moses Laws in The Age of Reason Paine also gave his view that the character of Moses as stated in the Bible is the most horrid that can be imagined giving the story at BibleverseNumbers3113 18 as an example In the nineteenth century the agnostic Robert G Ingersoll wrote that all the ignorant infamous heartless hideous things recorded in the inspired Pentateuch are not the words of God but simply Some Mistakes of Moses In the 2000s the atheist Richard Dawkins referring to the same passage like Paine concluded No Moses was not a great role model for modern moralists

Canaan was an ancient country and the land promised to Abraham and his children by God in the Bible The Canaanite people lived in this area from about 2000 BCE until the time of the Bible It covers most of the area that is now Israel and Lebanon

Prophets are people who said that God or gods talked to them They freely teach other people what they learned Most of them warn people that something very good will happen if they change their lives

There are prophets in Christianity Islam Judaism Mormonism Zoroastrianism and in other religions 

For the main Abrahamic religions there are two kinds of prophets major and minor Major prophets gave a lot of teachings while minor just re teach things other prophets taught or they do not have many teachings

Mount Cotopaxi is a volcano in Ecuador The mountains altitude is 5911m That is high enough for snow to fall on it even though it is near the equator If the volcano erupted it would be very bad for the people living around it because of the destruction and damage it could cause

Israelite is a term used to refer to people from the land of Israel when talking about ancient and Biblical times It usually refers to a member of one of the Twelve Tribes of Israel Nowadays a person from the modern State of Israel is called an Israeli 

Israelites lived in the kingdom of Israel in areas where the country of Israel is now Israel split off from a kingdom called Judah whose people were later called Jews Israel was conquered by the Assyrians in 721 BCE Judah was conquered by the Babylonians in 586 BCE Many Jews were taken away from Judah When the Persians defeated the Babylonians they let the Jews return to rebuild the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem about 70 years later

Sometimes there are tigers with different colors There are White Tigers that have white fur with black stripes or that even have pure white fur They have blue or green eyes Most Bengal tigers have orange fur The white coat only appears once in every 10000 births The Bengal tiger is the national animal of Bangladesh and India

Tigers vary in size depending on their subspecies Siberian tigers are the largest They can grow to be 12 feet long and weigh as much as 840 pounds

The tiger has 6 living subspecies and 3 extinct subspecies

Tigers are becoming very rare because people hunt them for their skin and destroy the forests they live in The Bengal tiger has the biggest population with 3500 left in the wild The South Chinese tiger has the smallest population with only 20  30 left in the wild and about 60 in captivity

Tigers eat many different types of prey All tigers are carnivores or meat eaters They eat gazelle monkeys and other animals located in Asia Some tigers may eat up to 50 pounds of meat a day Tigers kill their prey by clamping down on the preys throat and suffocating it

A leopard is a big feline of the genus Panthera It lives in Africa and Asia

Leopards generally have yellow fur with dark rosettes and spots and a lighter colored underside But there can be a lot of differences in the different leopard subspecies There are also often leopards who are completely black those are also called black panthers Male leopards are about 30 larger than female leopards

Originally the leopard lived in all of Africa and southern Asia But today many leopard subspecies especially in Asia are endangered disappearing or dying The leopard lives in the largest range of all big cats and because of this it has a lot of different subspecies Leopards also live in a lot of different environments rainforests forests mountains and savannas

The leopard is mostly active at night It can climb very well and it stays up in trees a lot of its time It mostly eats middle big mammals but also birds reptiles and insects Leopards hunt at different times of the day and they also use different methods for hunting Most often leopards will secretly move towards their prey and attack it when they are close or hide and wait for it to come close After the hunt leopards often take their prey up on a tree or sometimes hide it so that other animals cannot take it away

Leopards usually live alone and try not to meet another leopard They only come together to mate Young leopards leave their mothers after 13  18 months

Leopards mostly eat monkeys but rodents reptiles amphibians insects birds and fish are also eaten Leopards do not usually eat humans but sometimes leopards that are hurt or sick can eat people when they do not have enough to eat A leopard in India is believed to have eaten more than 125 people

There are nine subspecies of leopards recognized today one in Africa and eight in Asia They are

The Jaguar is a large feline which lives in South and Central America 

The jaguar is the third largest feline after the tiger and the lion It is also the largest and most powerful feline in the Western Hemisphere

Because of its spots jaguars look like leopards though it is usually larger and stronger and its behavior is more like that of a tiger It likes to stay near water and like the tiger it is famous for being a big cat that enjoys swimming It usually hunts alone 

The jaguar has a very powerful bite even compared to other big cats Because of its strong bite jaguars can bite through armoured reptiles like caimans crocodiles turtles and tortoises Jaguars kill their prey in an unusual way they bite directly through the skull between the ears and into the brain

The word jaguar is dwr In British English it is djur

Jaguars have yellow or yellow orange fur with brown and black rosettes and spots They are big and heavy and also have very strong muscles which makes them really powerful

Sometimes there are jaguars who are completely black but if you look closely you can still see the spots They are called black panther or just panther This is a colour morph of the same species a kind of polymorphism

Jaguars live in South and Central America They mostly live in rainforests but also in savanna swamp and open areas

They cannot climb well but they are good swimmers and they love to eat

Jaguars are not specialized with their food but eat almost anything they get big and small mammals birds reptiles fish and livestock It is an ambush predator When hunting they usually try to secretly get very close to the prey and then the jaguar suddenly jumps at it and throws it down The jaguar bites the skull of its prey to kill it It then takes the prey to a safe place and eats it

After a pregnancy of about 100 days the female gives birth to usually 1  4 babies The young leave their family after 12 years and they become mature at about 3 years Jaguars can live up to 1012 years old in freedom but in captivity they can live to 2022 years old

A cheetah is a large feline that lives in Africa It is the fastest land animal and can run up to 110 kilometres per hour for a short time

The name cheetah may come from a Hindi word meaning spotted one or from the Sanskrit word chitraka An adult has yellow or tan fur with solid black round or oval spots measuring 75 to 15 inches in diameter The spots cover nearly the whole body Only the white throat and abdomen are not spotted The tail ends with 46 black rings and a bushy white tuft The head is small with eyes set high and a black tear mark running from the inner aspect of each eye down to the mouth The teeth are small An adult cheetah weighs 80140 pounds is about 32 inches tall at the shoulder and 4856 inches long with another 2832 inches in tail Cheetahs are sometimes mistaken for leopards However the difference is that leopards are much heavier animals with rosette shaped spots and no tear marks 

There are also cheetahs with a different fur called a King Cheetah These cheetahs have bigger spots and also stripes on their fur because of a mutation

Most cheetahs live in Africa but very few can be found in South Asia and India They live in the savannas

Cheetahs are active during the day and hunt in the early morning or late evening They hunt and eat mostly gazelles and other animals that are not very heavy or strong They also eat small mammals and birds if they are very hungry

When the cheetah hunts it slowly and secretly moves toward its prey When it is close to the prey it runs after it very quickly When the prey falls or is caught by the cheetah then he bites the throat of the prey so that it dies because it cannot breathe The cheetah cannot defend itself against lions or hyenas who would take the cheetahs prey away

After a pregnancy of about 94 days the female gives birth to usually 13 babies Young cheetahs become mature at about 2 years of age Cheetahs can live to be 20 years old in captivity

The cheetah has unusually low genetic variability and a very low sperm count Their sperms also suffer from deformed flagellae and so their movement is damaged Apparently cheetahs went through a great reduction in numbers during the last ice age Inbreeding after the event further reduced the variation

Richard Wright

Syd Barrett started the group and played guitar and sang in the band He left soon after at the start of 1968 because of mental illness that was made worse by heavy drug use The other people in the band were Roger Waters David Gilmour Richard Wright and Nick Mason David Gilmour joined the band in 1968 Roger Waters quit the band in 1985 

During most of their career they played a kind of rock music that some people call progressive rock

The original members of Pink Floyd met in an architectural college The band started as a blues band Later under Syd Barretts leadership they played music that was psychedelic in style After Barrett left the band they started to play longer and more complicated songs and to play at a lot of colleges and universities Soon they were famous as studio musicians who loved to experiment with music On the album Atom Heart Mother from 1970 they used a brass band and a choir

They used a lot of things to make their concerts interesting to watch They had a round movie screen on the stage They would show videos on the screen when they played They also used lighting and lasers in a much fancier way than many bands do They also had big balloon puppets The most famous is in the shape of a pig which first appeared on the cover for their album Animals The pig has become a symbol of Pink Floyd Another symbol that reminds people of Pink Floyd is a prism with light shining through it This was the cover of Dark Side of the Moon one of their most popular albums The album was released in 1973 and stayed on music charts for a very long time Millions of people bought it

The album The Wall recorded in 1979 was also famous It was made into a movie directed by Alan Parker in 1982 That album is important to the history of the group It talks about the distance they put between them and their fans It was the last album they all worked on together before starting to split up 

Roger Waters forced Richard Wright to leave the band in 1979 but Wright came back in 1987 after Waters quit Waters tried to sue the other members so that they could not call themselves Pink Floyd without him but he did not succeed Because of this and other reasons there was a lot of anger and bitterness between Waters and the other members of the band especially Gilmour

The last album of new songs that Pink Floyd released is called The Division Bell It was made in 1994 when Pink Floyd also played their last concert tour The very last time that Pink Floyd played was in 2005 as part of the Live 8 concerts for charity Waters sang with the band for the first time since leaving the band It was a big surprise to many people who thought Pink Floyd would never play together again especially not with Roger Waters

Syd Barrett died of pancreatic cancer in 2006 Richard Wright died of cancer in 2008

Transgender is a term used to describe people who may act feel think or look different from the gender that they were born with The word transgender is used to include many groups of people who share one important trait but may not be the same in other ways The common trait for transgender people is that they call themselves transgender and feel that their given gender is not quite right Sometimes the word transgender is also used by people who prefer it to the word transsexual 

The picture in the introduction shows as an example a person at a transgender rally in Paris This person identifies herself as being of the female gender but she shows by the sign on her hand that she has XY chromosomes This means she was born with male sex 

Definitions 

Because the word transgender is used to cover a wide variety of people it is called an umbrella word Many different types of people think of themselves as transgender Many different types of people are called transgender Different English speakers define words in different ways For these reasons the term trans people is often used 

Some common definitions of the words used in this article are listed here These are common ways but not agreed to by everyone

These definitions are important to help understand that what people look like outside is not always the same as how they feel inside Some people do not fit well into the gender binary idea People who are transgender usually want to be called by the pronoun that matches their gender identity so this article will do that

Who is transgender There are many groups who are included under the umbrella of transgender Some of the bigger groups are

People like those who in modern Western societies are now identified as transgender or transsexual have existed in many cultures and for thousands of years However only in the last century has science and medicine been able to meet some of the needs for bodily change of trans people who want to change their body 

People who have traits that are different from the gender they are born with have been accepted in some societies both historically and now For example some Native American tribes accepted two spirit peoplefactdateApril 2009 Similarly a Tongan person born with a male body who acts and dresses in a female way is known in the local dialect as a fakaleitifactdateApril 2009 

The hijra in India are born physically male but they socialize and act as if they are women in many ways In the past they used to castrate themselves and even remove the penis in order to urinate through a small hole Now with the arrival of western medicine many hijari choose to take hormone therapies and sometimes have surgery to change their physical gender Many of these people still call themselves hijari but some now call themselves transsexuals or transgender women All of these people were and are accepted in their society and many have special roles in their society 

In Western Society there have often been people who have chosen to act and dress in a way that was not gender specific or was not that of the gender they were born with Cross dressing actors were very popular in the theatre of the late 19th century 

An example of a transgender person is the 19th century military surgeon who was known as James Barry It is now believed that Barry was born female but disguised his sex all his adult life Barrys work which saved and helped thousands of lives by improving treatment of wounds to stop amputations would not have been possible as a woman because as a female he could never have attended medical school or entered the army 

A 20th century example of a transgender person is Jan Morris a geographer explorer and journalist who began life as James Morris As James Morris married and had children but felt female and eventually became Jan Morris

Issues 

Transgender people are not always accepted in every society They can suffer discrimination violence and even murder Transgender people have fought for and have gained many rights and protections in some societies In many places the fight for transgender rights is associated with the fight for homosexual and bisexual rights Together these groups are sometimes called by the acronym LGBT for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender especially since the Declaration of Montreal

Unfortunately like all political relationships this is not always peaceful Some transgender people do not want to be part of the gay lesbian and bisexual community They may see themselves as straight and not feel like they belong with homosexual people Some gay lesbian and bisexual people do not want to be part of the transgender community They may see transgender people as strange or bad and worry that the rest of society will see homosexuals in that same way if transgender people are included in LGBT However homosexual and transgender people often have some of the same problems in society So many gay lesbian bisexual and transgender people try to work together to solve all of their problems

Transgender people who wish to take medicine and have surgery to change their bodies face several problems In order to change their bodies they must have doctors who are willing to help them and make the changes They sometimes cannot do this because doctors will not help them They may also not be able to do this because even if a doctor would treat them they may not be able to afford the medicine or surgery But the Declaration of Montreal affirms that such medical care be provided for them by public health insurance  

Many transgender people do not like being labeled as having a disease gender identity disorder They do not feel being transgender is an illness or disease They see it as a harmless trait like being homosexual or left handed

However many transgender people depend on this diagnosis For some people they can only get medical and surgical treatment paid for by their government if it is to treat a disease So if it is not a disease they will not get the medicines and surgery they need Also some laws protect people from discrimination if they have a disease If transgender people do not have a disease they do not get this protection

This argument still goes on in both the transgender community and in the medical community that treats them

Transgender people have problems with laws and regulations about sex To be seen and treated as the sex they wish transgender people usually have to change their first name They also may want to change their identity documents to say the correct sex For example a transgender woman may wish to change her birth certificate or driving license to say her new female name and to say that she is a female

These changes can protect transgender people from discrimination For example transgender woman who have been raped may not be allowed to go to a rape crisis center for care unless her identity papers say she is a female These changes can also be necessary for transgender people to be allowed to marry their spouses in places where it is illegal for homosexual people to marry These changes can even protect transgender people from violence especially the rape Some people may be revealed to be transgender because their identity papers do not match how they look Being revealed as transgender can put people in danger in some places because of transphobia

Unfortunately in many places this is hard or impossible for transgender people to change their identity documents unless after the surgery to change sex or even after the surgery This is changing however Recently the United Kingdom passed the Gender Recognition Act of 2004 This act allows people to have their change of sex officially recognized without surgery Once changed they have all the rights privileges and responsibilities of their new gender

Noon is the time exactly halfway through the day written 1200 or 1200 in the 24 hour clock and 1200 pm in the 12 hour clock Midday also means noon although this also means around noon or very early afternoon

Solar noon is when the sun appears the highest in the sky compared to its positions during the rest of the day It occurs when the Sun is exactly halfway between sunrise and sunset This is also the origin of the terms am and pm ante meridiem and post meridiem At solar noon the sun is due south seen from the Northern Hemisphere and due north seen from the Southern Hemisphere The sun is directly overhead at solar noon at the equator on the equinoxes at Tropic of Cancer on the summer solstice in June and at Tropic of Capricorn on the winter solstice in December

Because of the use of time zones and daylight saving time the highest point of the sun and a clock time of noon are usually different 

The opposite of noon is midnight

In traditional magical thinking noon represents with heaven order and life 

The 24 hour clock is a way of telling the time in which the day runs from midnight to midnight and is divided into 24 hours numbered from 0 to 24 This system is also referred to as military time or as continental time In some parts of the world it is called railway time Also the international standard notation of time is based on this format

A time in the 24 hour clock is written in the form hoursminutes or hoursminutesseconds Numbers under 10 have a zero in front eg 0907 Under the 24 hour clock system the day begins at midnight 0000 and the last minute of the day begins at 2359 and ends at 2400 which is identical to 0000 of the following day 1200 can only be mid day Midnight is called 2400 if used to mean the end of the day and 0000 if used to mean the beginning of the day For example you would say Tuesday at 2400 and Wednesday at 0000 to mean the exact same time

However the US military prefers not to say 2400  they do not like to have two names for the same thing so they always say 2359 which is one minute before midnight

To convert between the 12 hour clock and the 24 hour clock use the table to the right

24 hour clock time is used in computers military public safety and transport In many Asian European and Latin American countries people use it to write the time Many French Italian German and Romanian people use it in speaking

Many models of digital wristwatches and clocks are available that display the time of day using the 24 hour clock

In railway timetables 2400 means the end of the day For example a train due to arrive at a station during the last minute of a day arrives at 2400 but trains which depart during the first minute of the day go at 0000 

To write shop opening hours until midnight use for example 00002400 07002400

The Spanish American War was a war fought between Spain and the United States of America in the year 1898 This war was fought in part because a lot of people wanted Cuba to become independent and also because many Americans wanted their country to get a colonial empire Spain lost the sea war and had to give up its colonies of Cuba the Philippines Puerto Rico and part of Guam All of these colonies except for Cuba would become US colonies at the end of the war 

Following reports of Spanish abuse and killing of Cubans the United States sent warships to Cuba Spain was losing control of Cuba and had been putting Cubans into concentration camps The United States sent ships to Cuba to try to force Spain to give up Cuba The US battleship Maine exploded in Cuban waters killing about 260 people on board US newspapers blamed Spain for the explosion Spain tried to avoid going to war but pressure from US newspapers called yellow journalism and ordinary people persuaded US government to go to war Some of these people just wanted Cuba to become independent but others hoped that the United States could build a colonial empire overseas like many European countries had done

Some diseases are caused by infection Infection is when another organism gets into a persons body and causes harm There are many kinds of infectious agents viruses bacteria parasites and fungus These four kinds of infectious agents cause most infectious disease There are other kinds though For example mad cow disease is caused by prions Prions are a form of virus that are basically abnormal clumps of proteins We are not even sure that prions are alive But they act just like other infectious diseases

Some infections are caused by different infectious agents at different times For example some diarrhea is caused by bacteria Some is caused by viruses

This is a very short list There are many more diseases from infection and other causes common diseases

Some diseases can be passed from one person to another easily Other infectious diseases are harder to get If a person kiss or touches another person who is infected with the flu a cold measles or a sore throat he or she may get their disease They may also give the person their disease if they cough on them Other diseases like AIDS herpes and hepatitis B are only passed by closer contact Having sex with an infected person blood transfusions or touching their blood or urine can sometimes pass these diseases

People can stop disease by

Bacteria are usually treated with antibiotic medicines like Tetracycline and Penicillin Viruses will not be killed by antibiotics They must be treated with special medicines called antivirals Medicines to treat HIVAIDS like zidovudine are antivirals Antifungals like miconazole and fluconazole treat infections from fungus Anti parasitic medicines like Praziquantel and mebendazole

Some infectious diseases have no treatments that work well For example there is no medicine that works well to cure West Nile Virus and Rabies So it is important to avoid getting these diseases

Some infectious disease goes away on its own These mild diseases do not need to be treated For example colds are caused by viruses and they do not need medicines

Some diseases can be prevented by immunizations Immunizations try to make a person have an immune reaction to an infectious agent This is usually done before the person gets the disease Examples of diseases prevented by immunizations are polio tetanus and pertussis In some cases if all of the disease can be removed from society we can get rid of the disease completely An example of this is smallpox This virus used to kill people cause blindness and bad scars Now there has not been a person who had smallpox in over thirty years

Fishing is catching fish either for fun or so they can be eaten A peron who catches fish is called a fisherman There are many different types of fishing the goal of fishing for money is to catch or harvest seafood Fishing can be done in the sea or in a lake or river and by boat or from the shore

Fishing for money is a very dangerous job because people can die However people are willing to take this risk because much money can be made in the process Fishing gives a lot of food to many countries around the world but those who take it as a job must often find fish far into the ocean under bad conditions People who go fishing for money get almost all aquatic life from tuna cod and salmon to shrimp lobster clams and squid Ways to fish for money have become very simple using large nets and machines to catch fish Many countries have made rules limiting how much fish people can catch

Raising fish in the forms of aquaculture and mariculture add to the free range catch of fish

Fishing for fun is normally done with a fishing rod and line with any number of hooks to get the fish This is something called angling There may be rules that say how many lines and hooks one fisherman can use and how many fish he can catch Popular kinds of fish people get for fun in fresh water include Black Bass Pike Muskellunge Perch Carp Trout Salmon and Sunfish Fish people get in saltwater include Swordfish Marlin Tuna and others 

Rules generally do not allow the use of nets and catching fish with hooks not in the mouth However some kinds of fish can be taken with nets for bait and a few for food Non sport fish that are not said to be worth as much can sometimes be taken by many ways like snagging bow and arrow or even gun because they are seen as competing with more valuable fish

Recreational fishing laws also include other life that lives in water such as frogs and turtles

Sport fishing is a recent popular way of recreational fishing where fishermen try to get more fish than other fishermen This sport came from local fishing contests into a large contest in the USA where skilled fishermen can compete and be helped out by companies giving money and other large contests around the world

We see a lot  of words related with the names of fish and fishing tools These words may be unknown to the learners The teacher should give their translation or show their pictures If learners see the pictures of net arrow rod and hook it will be easy for them to differentiate these tools from each other

Catch and release fishing is increasingly practiced especially by fly fishermen as well as spin and bait casting fishermen to increase conservation and to protect rare fish such as marlin The practice is however disputed as it by some is considered unethical to perform painful actions to the fish for fun and not for the reason of food production Because of this catch and release practice is illegal in Norway

People catch fish but not always for foodsometimes for entertainment First of all the teacher should explain to his learners the importance of fish and other seafood for peopleWhile presenting this text first teacher must know if the learners know fish producing countries or the seas rivers lakes that these types of fish live because here the country Norway is mentioned maybe the learners dont know this country The teacher may ask the learners which words are unknown for them First they have to guess the meaning of these words according to the context but if its not possible the teacher give the translation

Fish can also be collected in ways that do not injure them for observation and study or for keeping in Aquarium There is a substantial industry devoted to the collection transport export and farming of wild and domesticated live fish usually freshwater or marine tropical fish

In junior stage teacher may ask what is aquarium used for and if they had seen it anywhere After learners reply shehe can tell that there are very big aquariums in the world and people usually keep there live fish in order to demonstrate them to the people

Some fish such as lobster and crab are caught commercially in pots or traps These traps can be made from wood or metal and hold many fish at once They are baited with fresh fish such as tuna and cod or raw meat Fishing boats must have licences to catch these fish and quotas are rigorously enforced

Teachers should describe what is trap or net if he has a chance he can show these tools The pictures of mentioned fish can be shown too The learners should understand that fishing with traps isnt good as very small fish together with big ones are taken out of water then they are thrown away as they are not useful for food

In the past fishing has been so good for getting money that people began overfishing  a serious problem that does lots of damage Overfishing does not always mean extinction but simply that a fish type has been harvested so that there cannot be as many of that kind of fish as before As more boats are sent out to catch the fish many population levels of a type of fish can drop Then there are not enough of that kind of fish left to have new kinds of fish

Many times fishing boats catch fish they do not mean to catch called bycatch All kinds of fish can become bycatch and they are usually thrown back into the sea after they have died Drift net fishing sometimes catches creatures like seals dolphins whales and sea turtles This kind of fishing made people complain In the 1980s it was guessed that 18 miles of nets were lost every night tangling up boats and animals

The Confederate States of America was a short lived government that existed in the southern United States during the American Civil War It was established in 1861 by seven southern states in which slavery was legal after Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the US but before he took office South Carolina Mississippi Florida Alabama Georgia Louisiana and Texas declared their secession from the United States After war began Virginia Arkansas Tennessee and North Carolina joined them The first capital of the Confederacy was Montgomery Alabama but for most of the war the capital was Richmond Virginia

The government of the Confederacy was much like the United States government The CSA constitution was similar to that of the United States however it emphasized states rights and clearly protected slavery Jefferson Davis was chosen as president and Alexander Stephens as Vice President As in the United States the CSA president had a cabinet of advisors

The United States government did not agree that the states could leave and start a new government Thus the Union government refused to abandon all its forts in the states that wanted to secede War began when the CSA attacked one of those forts Fort Sumter in South Carolina This war is known as the American Civil War and it lasted from 1861 to 1865 After some of the deadliest battles in US history Union forces gradually regained control of southern states As Confederate forces surrendered the Confederacy fell apart and the Civil War came to a close in 1865 Following the war slavery was outlawed everywhere in the United States The process of restoring the states of the CSA to the United States continued until 1877

Even today many people argue about whether the Confederate States of America was ever a country The Union never said that the Confederacy was really a country Although British and French companies sold ships and materials to the Confederacy no nation officially recognized the CSA as an independent country

The CSA was also called the South the Confederacy and Dixie

A rainforest is a tropical forest that gets a lot of rain It usually has a lot of plants and animals A very well known rainforest is the Amazon Rainforest Most of it is in Brazil though Ecuador Colombia Chile and other countries have parts of it

Scientists say over half of all plant and animal species live in the rainforest Also more than 14 of all medicines come from here Covering only 6 of the Earths land area they still provide 40 of the oxygen

The rainforest is in three major geographical areas around the world

The rainforest gets an average of 50 to 250 inches of rain a year It is warm year round rarely getting above 93 F or getting below 68 F It has an average humidity of 77 to 88 The rainforest has carpet of green rot leaves on the floor This is called the humus layer Rainforests are in danger of deforestation because lumber industries are chopping down the trees for profit

Most scientists think of the rainforest in four layers The top layer is the Emergent layer Then is the canopy layer The canopy is made of the tallest trees that grow to be 75150 feet tall Under the tall canopy is the understory The understory is made up of smaller trees vines and shrubs The bottom layer is the forest floor This is made up of the small plants on the ground

The emergent layer is at the top of the trees High in the trees eagles perch Their keen eyes search constantly for small monkeys and other prey Butterflies parrots toucans and hundreds of other colorful birds constantly fly through the tops of the trees

The canopy is like a huge green roof over the forest The trees grow up thin and straight like pillars They do not put out branches until they are very tall Then they spread out like an umbrella in the sunlight The trees are so close together that very little light or rain goes through to the lower layers Many kinds of monkeys birds and insects live in the canopy These kinds of animals often never touch the ground in their entire life All the food and water they need they find among the tall trees Because it rains all the time water can be in holes in the trees leaves and plants that grow on the trees The animals eat the leaves and fruit of the trees insects or other animals The tall canopy trees must be able to reach the sunlight high in the air and still get nutrients from the thin soil on the forest floor Their roots do not go deep into the soil because there is nothing there for the plants to reach Instead the roots spread out in all directions along or just under the ground That way they can quickly make use of the nutrients from the recycled plants and animals that have fallen to the floor

The understory is usually a dark humid place under the canopy There is very little light and no breeze because they are blocked out by the canopy The plants under the canopy must be able to live with very little sunlight Bushes large green plants and small trees make up this layer Often they will only grow in open patches where a big tree has fallen down Other plants like vines grow on the big trees They get the nutrients they need from the tree which is getting sunlight up in the canopy

The ground level is called the forest floor Snakes tapirs jaguars tamanduas and gorillas are just a few of the species that live here It is dark on the rain forest floor Insects giant centipedes spiders ants and beetles are also very abundant here The floor of the rain forest is often very open and easy to walk across That is because so little light reaches the floor that very few plants can grow there Most people think wrongly because of most movies that show people cutting their way through the thick plants and vines in the jungle That type of jungle is only around rivers and clearings where light can reach the forest floor

One type of plant in the rainforest does not need soil These plants are called epiphytes or air plants Air plants live on the branches of other trees in the canopy or understory with their roots out in the air In the humid rainforest they collect water from the rain that falls on them

One kind of air plant is a flower called an orchid There are thousands of different kinds of orchids in the rainforest Some air plants store water in pools in and around their roots These pools can become homes for frogs and salamanders Frogs usually need to lay their eggs in ponds but some rainforest tree frogs lay their eggs in the pools in air plants That way the frogs never have to go down to the ground

Millions of kinds of insects live in the rainforest It never gets cold enough to kill them There are bees butterflies termites beetles and many kinds of flies There are ants everywhere One kind of ant is the army ant Army ants do not have nests They march out in a line every day to hunt for other insects which they eat At night they hook themselves together to form a living nest around their queen and larvae or baby ants

Snakes live in the trees and on the forest floor They eat frogs eggs birds insects and small animals Some of the snakes like the fer delance of Latin America are poisonous but others are not One large non poisonous snake is the anaconda of South America It is one of the largest snakes in the world A full grown anacoda kills its prey by wrapping itself around the animal and squeezing it until it cannot breathe Then the snake swallows the prey whole If the animal is big enough the snake may not eat again for weeks

Monkeys are a very common animal in the rainforest Most live their lives up in the canopy and the understory They have long arms to swing from branch to branch and some use their tails to hold onto the trees while they eat They are fast and agile jumping easily from tree to tree for food Different monkeys eat different things They can eat nuts flowers roots and frogs Their hoots and howls are heard throughout the rainforest even when they cannot be seen among the trees

Many colorful birds also live among the canopy of the rain forest and there are also animals that live on the forest floor The tapir is a forest animal that looks like a large pig It is actually in the same animal family as the horse and the rhinoceros They live in South American and Asian rain forests eating leaves twigs and fruit Tapirs are the only one of the animals hunted by the big cats of the rain forest Jaguars leopards and tigers are the largest predators of the rain forest All of these cats have beautiful fur coats that have made them desired by hunters for years The spotted coats of the jaguar and leopards were especially popular for fur coats Today most countries are trying to protect their big cats but many are still hunted illegally

These are only a few of the animals and plants in the rainforest About half of all of the different kinds or species of plants and animals in the entire world live in rain forests Many of the plants animals and insects do not even have names because they have never been classified by a scientist

There are many tribes of people who have lived in the rainforests for thousands of years These forest dwellers usually belong to one of two groups They are usually huntergatherers or slash and burn farmers

Huntergatherers live as they do in every other region of the world They kill animals and gather what the forest provides for part of their food Unlike in the Arctic tools are always available Unlike in the desert water is always available The people do not need clothes to protect them from the weather The forest even provides a way to make hunting easier Many of the people hunt with poisoned arrows The poisons come from the plants of the forest That makes the animals easier to kill

Most of the forest people are slash and burn farmers They raise crops in small clearings as well as hunting and gathering in the forest This provides them with food year round They start by cutting down the trees and the other plants in an area They let the dead plants dry out then they burn them The ash from the burned platns goes into the soiil and makes it fertile for a little while This is called slash and burn farming

The small clearings grow food crops for a few years then the family or group moves on and clears a new field The old field is left to be overgrown by the forest In a few years it once again looks like the rain forest that surrounds it

This type of farming does not harm the rain forest when only a few people are doing it The small clearings become rain forest again without any damage The land is used and recycled for use again some other time The rain forest easily regrows to fill in the clearings after the people leave That is changing today Today the rain forests asre getting smaller because too many people are burning them

There are some serious problems concerning the rainforests that need to be fixed Rain forests are being cut down too quickly Every year an area about the size of West Virginia is being destroyed This is a problem for everyone

Rain forests are so large and thick that for many years very few people lived or went there Today however that is changing Millions of poor often hungry people live near the rain forests of the world These people are desperate for a better life and they think they can find it in the forests

Settlers can get into the rain forests because modern machines have opened roads deep into the jungle The roads are usuaslly built by businesses who want to cut down trees or dig up minerals in the forest Governments build other roads for trade and to allow settlers into the forest Poor people come into the forest by the thousands on the roads and take land to raise food They burn off the trees and plants to make a field Then they plant crops for food and to sell All around them other farmers do the same so there is no forest left to grow back

The new farms can only grow crops for a few years in the poor soil The farmers then sell the land to a cattle rancher or just leave and clear a new piece of land The soil is so poor that it will not even grow grass to feed cattle for more than a few more years By then the ground is hard packed and grows only a few weeds The rain forest is destroyed and nothing can be done with the land

If this continues long enough the forests will be destroyed and the farmers will have no place to move Then those people will broken wikt linkstarvestarve because there will be no land left where they can grow food Forcing them to stop cutting down the forest will not help because they would just starve now instead of later New ways need to be found for these people to live on the rain forest land without destroying it

Also no one knows how destroying the rain forests will change the earth We know that less rain will fall once the trees are gone That may cause some rivers which supply water to cities around the rain forest to dry up during part of the year Also burning trees puts carbon into the air Carbon absorbs heat from the sun Will the burning of so many trees change the air and make the climate on the earth warmer Experts are arguing about it but it might be happening

The rain forests are also the source of many things that are useful to human beings As many as one out of every four drugs bought at the store were discovered in rain forest Coffee chocolate bananas corn tea sweet potatoes Brazil nuts rubber and tapioca all came from the rain forest Very valuable wood is taken from the trees of the rain forest Mahogany teak and balsa wood come from there Those trees can not be grown without the thick wet warm rain forests Thus the loss of the rain forests would hurt other people besides those that must live there

The Welsh language is the Celtic language of Wales that is still spoken throughout the country Around 21 of the people of Wales as well as some people outside Wales can speak Welsh Many people in Wales say they can understand some form of Welsh such as spoken written or can read Welsh even if they do not speak it all the time Almost all Welsh people understand and can use the English language Welsh is a compulsory subject for children in all schools in Wales and it taught as a second language in non Welsh language schools In Welsh it is known as Cymraeg or yr iaith Gymraeg which means the Welsh language in Welsh 

Welsh has mutations Mutations are when a sound or a letter changes at the start of a word An example is the Welsh word gwneud which in English it means to do and dod which means to come Sometimes the word changes from gwneud to wneud and from dod to ddod These sounds or letters changes also occur within and at the end of words although the simplified classification found in ordinary books does not mention this

In Welsh there is formal and informal Welsh Formal Welsh is used when writing in formal documents and when speaking to a group when speaking to someone older than yourself speaking to someone you have just met or someone you would like to show respect towards Formal words and phrases use variations of chi meaning you Sometimes people will ask you to call them chi

Informal Welsh is used when sending e mails or sending text messages to your friends or family and when talking with people you have known for a long time Informal words and phrases use variations of ti meaning you Sometimes people will ask you to call them ti

There are some sounds and letters that exist in Welsh but not in English such as the letters ch and ll The first sound is pronounced like the Scottish Loch Ness and an example Welsh word that uses the ch is bach which means small Ll is a voiceless l and is made by placing the tongue on the top of the top gum and blowing A Welsh word that uses the ll is llan which means church Both ch and ll are single letters in the Welsh alphabet along with dd ff ng ph rh and th

Here are some things to say in Welsh How to say it is in brackets

Here are a few other words

Welsh books and newspapers have been printed for hundreds of years Some of these books have been translated into English and some books in other languages have been translated into Welsh Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone was translated into Welsh with the translation of Harri Potter a Maen yr Athronydd which means the same as the English title

BBC Radio Cymru is a Welsh language radio station that is available throughout Wales Some local radio stations have some Welsh and English programs during the day

The Welsh television channel S4C has been on air since 1982 It broadcasts shows such as the soap opera Pobol y Cwm and childrens programs such as Superted and Sam Tn

In August 2009 the mobile phone maker Samsung unveiled a new Welsh language mobile phone would be available from September 2009 It includes Welsh language predictive text and menus 

The Welsh Alphabet has some extra letters that are not used in English and does not have some others Although certain letters do not exist in Welsh they are used sometimes to make sounds that could not possibly be made otherwise A good example is the word garej The letter j does not exist in the Welsh language and is a lend word from English The traditional word for garage in Welsh is modurdy which means motor house Another lend word is toiled which means toilet in English There are now many lend words in spoken Welsh Here is the Welsh alphabet

A1 B C CH2 D DD2 E1 F2 FF2 G NG2 H I1 J L LL2 M N O1 P PH2 R RH2 S T TH2 U1 W1 2 Y1

1 These letters are vowels The letter W can be used either as a vowel or as a consonant This is the same with letter I which can also be used as a consonant when it is said like an English Y like in iogwrt meaning yoghurt 2 Letters that are not in the English alphabet or have different sounds CH sounds like the KH in Ayatollah KHoumeini DD is said like the TH in THere F is said like the English V FF is said like the English F NG sounds like it would in English but it is tricky because it comes at the beginnings of words One trick is to blend it in with the word before it LL sounds like a cat hissing PH sounds like the English F too but it is only used in mutations RH sounds like an R said very quickly before a H TH sounds like the TH in THin W has been explained in the sentences before about vowels

The United States Census Bureau said the city has a total area of 51 km 33 km of it is land and 18 km of it is water The total area is 3535 water

Hoboken was an island by the Hudson River to the east To the west was a swamp near the Palisades on the west Hoboken was a campsite by the Lenni Lenape Then Hoboken became bad and there was war and disease Europeans came in the 17th century The name Hoboken comes from the original Lenape name for Hobocan Hackingh or land of the tobacco pipe

The first European to find Hoboken was Henry Hudson He stopped his ship near Weehawken Cove on October 2 1609 Three Native Americans sold Hoboken to Michael Paauw Director of the Dutch West India Company on July 12 1630 The first European settlers of Hoboken were Dutch farmers Hendrick Van Vorst of Jersey City leased the land to Aert Van Putten who was Hobokens first person In 1643 Van Putten built a farm house and brew house north of Castle Point The brew house was Americas first

The land was taken by William Bayard Bayard who liked the revolutionary cause changed to a Loyalist Tory in 1776 after New York ended At the end of the Revolutionary War Bayards land was taken by the Revolutionary Government of New Jersey

After the American war for independence Hoboken was bought by Colonel John Stevens in 1784 for about 90000 In the early 19th century Stevens made the waterfront better for Manhattan people He tested his inventions Later in the century Hoboken became better by being a shipping port and industrial center Hoboken became a city in 1855 and Cornelius V Clickener became the first Mayor By the 19th century shipping lines were using Hoboken as a port and the Delaware Lackawanna Western Railroad had became a railroad center at the waterfront 

In 1832 a cave called Sybils Cave opened and was popular At that time Hoboken was not yet an industrial city and Hoboken was a country spot Sybils Cave was used in one of Edgar Allan Poes stories in 1841 The water in the cave was bad so the cave closed in the 1880s and in the 1930s it was filled with stone David Roberts the mayor of Hoboken will re open the cave for the first time in over 60 years

Hoboken was new and the people grew They got many jobs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries The Hoboken Land and Improvement Company started by Colonel Stevens in 1838 created many streets began housing and created building sites The housing was made up of masonry of three to five stories Many buildings survive to the present day and the street grid It was also at this time that German immigrants became the main group in Hoboken Along with the main industry of creating ships well known industries that created a big presence in Hoboken were Maxwell House Lipton Tea and Hostess among others In 1870 the Stevens Institute of Technology was created at Castle Point the highest point in Hoboken

After the war Italians were the citys major group with the Irish having been a big group

In the 1960s other people followed including Puerto Ricans High crime rates shortly followed and many of Hobokens original residents slowly moved out including Irish and Italians In the middle of the 20th century industries looked for greener areas port jobs went to larger places in Newark Bay and the car truck and airplane relpaced the railroad and ship as the way of moving in the United States Most of the ports closed around 1975

In the 1970s and 1980s Hoboken changed itself by letting in artists musicians and young and happy people were going into Manhattan for work Making Hoboken better was done in the same way as in the Manhattan Making Hoboken better has continued with many new places to live now being built on what used to be industrial sites on the waterfront and even more so in the western parts of Hoboken that were wost for the longest time Although political control of the city is largely influenced by the citys long term residents the yuppies who have settled in Hoboken are now showing extensive interest The City of Hoboken is controlled by the Faulkner Act

In the 20th century Hoboken sank from its earlier incarnation as a lively port town into a severely rundown condition It was often included in lists with other New Jersey towns and cities that had seen much better days such as Paterson Elizabeth and Camden Heaps of uncollected garbage and roving packs of semi wild dogs were common sights Then in the late 1970s it began a surprising rejuvenation that led to its becoming by the mid 1990s easily one of the states most vibrant communities 

The city today is noted for its excellent views of Manhattan fine grained street grid historic architecture and lively collection of restaurants and bars Its compactness and historic street layout mean that a car is more of a hindrance than a help in getting around and the city retains a basic pedestrian orientation On weekend nights the town swells with young partygoers from nearby New Jersey towns who practice a rowdier style of barhopping than is fashionable across the river in Manhattan Hoboken pockets their liquor money and quiet Sundays see families and artsy types back in possession of streets and parks

Hobokens gentrification has become relatively advanced though a large base of native residents remains in the city and holds political power The population of newcomers or yuppies as they are typically called in the local press consists of college and post graduate students bi nationals older artists and increasingly well to do commuters to Manhattan The presence of these individuals gives Hoboken a unique energy and a growing reputation as a desirable place to live However the rising cost of living in the town particularly in rental units has already resulted in a significant exodus of the bohemian population that was responsible for turning the citys reputation around

The Hoboken waterfront is the western shore of the Hudson from Newark Street to Stevens Institute of Technology sandwiched by the Holland Tunnel to the south and Lincoln Tunnel to the north directly across from Lower Manhattans Canal Street The waterfront defined Hoboken as an archetypal port town and powered its economy from the mid 19th century to the outbreak of World War I when the federal government seized most of it under eminent domain Control of the waterfront was returned to the city in the early 1950s On the Waterfront consistently listed among the five best American films ever was filmed here dramatically highlighting the rough and tumble lives of dockworkers and the infiltration of unions by organized crime Today the waterfront is cherished for its scenic views of the Hudson and Manhattan accessible to all by professionally landscaped parks built on the foundations of former piers

The Monkees were a rock band The band was created originally for a comedy television series of the same name which aired on NBC from 1966 to 1968 The members of the group were Davy Jones Michael Nesmith Peter Tork and Micky Dolenz They had hits with Last Train to Clarksville Im a Believer and Daydream Believer Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart were songwriters and producers who worked with the Monkees Another writerproducer for the Monkees was Chip Douglas Many of the songs recorded by the Monkees came from the Brill Building writers in New York City

Four actors with musical skills were chosen out of 437 hopefuls who auditioned for the series Britisher Davy Jones was under contract to Columbia Pictures had issued records and performed on British and American television Columbia was looking for a vehicle for Jones and Screen Gems who would produce the show was their TV division Nesmith was from Texas played in country and rock bands and had published his own songs Dolenz was a grown up broken wikt linkchild actorchild actor from Los Angeles California who sang and played in cover bands Tork had been a working folk musician in New Yorks Greenwich Village Each had their own wit and personality could entertain an audience and could also sing

Other young men who auditioned for the show included Stephen Stills Danny Hutton Harry Nilsson and Paul Williams Charles Manson was later rumored to have auditioned but he was imprisoned at the timeCitation neededdateApril 2011

Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider wanted to make movies but had little experience in that Schneiders father was president of Columbia Pictures and offered them the chance to make a broken wikt linkpilot episodepilot episode for a television series If the series was sold to a network they could produce and direct broken wikt linkepisodeepisodes and gain experience

Rafelson had already wanted to produce something involving musicians and their life When the Beatles appeared in the movies A Hard Days Night and Help people enjoyed watching them onscreen both playing out their lives and performing broken wikt linkslapstickslapstick comedy along with playing music Rafelson and Schneider adapted what they saw in the Beatles movies and also in American movies and television While the Beatles were always shown as a popular well known band their show would be about an unknown band looking for the chance to become famous

The pilot episode was filmed in the fall of 1965 A first playing for a test audience did not score well but a re edited version scored very well and the series was sold to NBC To make sure there was enough music for the series broken wikt linkmusic publishermusic publisher Don Kirshner was hired His Brill Building songwriters were among the best young talent

Actor James Frawley the son of William Frawley wanted to become a film director He worked with Rafelson and Schneider then with the Monkees as they were selected Before the series began filming Frawley spent six weeks working with the members teaching them about broken wikt linkimprovisationimprovisation in acting and comedy and helping them learn to play characters

The Monkees appeared for two seasons on NBC television with 58 episodes made in all The show won two Emmy Awards in 1967 for Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy The series gave promotion to the Monkeess records while their music made people interested in watching the show While the shows natural audience was children and teenagers there were also jokes and other things that older viewers could enjoy The band sometimes talked directly to the audience and made fun of the fact that they were on a television show Many episodes ended with short interviews with the Monkees where they talked about their careers and things that were important to them This made their fans feel like they knew the members of the band

Each episode featured two songs One was normally a single side and the other was a new song The band lip synched to recordings on camera and also filmed unrelated scenes in random places with whatever objects were there These were edited together and called romps The romps looked much like music videos

A large problem the Monkees faced was broken wikt linkaccusationaccusations that none of them could play a musical instrument because the music on their first records was mostly made by studio musicians Nesmith and Dolenz played guitar and Dolenz took drum lessons so he could play drums on camera Tork played guitar keyboards and banjo Jones learned to play drums and guitar and a custom bass guitar was made specially for him He also played percussion instruments like tambourine

The band had little experience playing together though and were not able to make the music needed to begin the show The producers planned at first to use prerecorded music and went ahead with that plan Don Kirshner had good broken wikt linkinstinctinstincts for knowing what would sell well and took charge of the recordings limiting the input the Monkees themselves had in making the music For most of the first seasons songs the members only sang and did not play on the records Boyce and Hart also noticed that when all four Monkees were together in the studio they would try to make each other laugh during takes and things did not get done They began bringing the band to record in ones and twos Kirshner also okayed Nesmith to produce two of his own songs for each Monkees album Nesmith could choose musicians and sing but could not play on the records himself

In time the band improved musically and wanted another chance to play on their own recordings They also began to perform live for audiences Kirshner would not change his mind issued a whole album without even telling the band and planned to issue a new single Nesmith argued with Kirshner and his attorney and called a broken wikt linkpress conferencepress conference telling the media about his unhappiness with how the music was made Many people thought this proved the Monkees were broken wikt linkphonyphonies and did not deserve to be popular To prove themselves the Monkees recorded a new single then a new album with each member playing instruments Their new records did not sell as well as their first ones but they felt better knowing the music was really theirs and they still had hit records

Kirshner issued the single A Little Bit Me A Little Bit You without getting an OK first This was reason enough to fire him from the Monkees production team Kirshners career was not harmed and he went on to produce other music his way including songs for The Archies He later hosted a show Don Kirshners Rock Concert which featured bands in a live setting

The Monkees became tired of the same formula used in episode after episode of the series and wanted to try doing a variety show instead NBC and the shows producers did not want to change the way the show was done The two sides could not agree and the show was cancelled even though it was still popular

After the television series ended the Monkees starred in a movie Head and a TV special 33 13 Revolutions per Monkee Neither was successful and the bands later records were not hits The Monkees kept performing for audiences but less and less people went to their shows The band members each quit one by one Tork left at the end of 1968 saying he was broken wikt linkexhaustionexhausted Nesmith left in 1970 to start his own band Jones left during 1970 and went back to performing solo 

The Monkees appeared in reruns on CBS from 1969 to 1972 first during lunchtimes and later alongside Saturday morning cartoons ABC later aired the series from 1972 to 1973

Each former Monkee tried different things during the next decade Tork worked as a musician teacher and singing waiter Nesmith pursued a country music career then began to make videos Jones and Dolenz both sang on records Jones did more theater work while Dolenz made cartoon broken wikt linkvoiceovervoiceovers

Dolenz and Jones teamed up with Boyce and Hart in 1976 to tour and perform the Monkees old hits They also made a new album together Later Jones and Dolenz went to England to appear in a production of Harry Nilssons The Point Both stayed in England Jones appeared in Godspell and other musical plays and retrained as a jockey Dolenz became a television director and producer During these same years Nesmith started his own company to produce music and videos Tork went back to performing and sometimes making records

The Monkees appeared in broken wikt linksyndicationsyndication from 1975 on usually playing on local television stations during afternoons A compilation album The Monkees Greatest Hits was issued and their old hits still played on radio stations A second Greatest Hits album appeared later

In 1986 Tork Jones and Dolenz reunited as part of an oldies show tour MTV aired nearly every episode of their old series one Sunday to promote the tour and it became a surprise hit Twenty years after they started a new generation of young people were interested in the Monkees The tour went from a small one to a major one and the Monkees were back MTV and the Monkees worked well together Nickelodeon a sister network to MTV aired their series and the band appeared on Nickelodeon and MTV during the late 1980s Nesmith mostly did not join the reunion because of his production career but he did make a few rare appearances with them The other members also kept their solo careers between tours

During the 1990s the reunited Monkees continued to tour and appear as guests on television Nesmith rejoined them for a new album Justus a TV special and he appeared with them onstage in England He left when they began to tour the United States though and did not return After 2000 they toured less often Tork left again in 2001 and Jones and Dolenz last worked together in 2002

Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia was the Emperor of Ethiopia He is also known as the religious symbol for God incarnate among members of the Rastafari movement who call themselves by his name before becoming Emperor  Ras Tafari

Tafari was made into local governor of Sidamo in 1907 and Harar province in 1911 As governor of Harar he had a huge following but he agreed not to remove Lij Iyasu from power as regent in exchange for Lij Iyasu not removing him as governor of Harer However Iyasu became a Muslim and also he did try to remove Tafari as governor breaking the agreement Tafari said that now the agreement was broken he did not have to keep it either and so he did remove Iyasu as regent Because Iyasu had gone over to Islam the nobles replaced him with Empress Zauditu on September 27 1916 and made Tafari regent From this time onward he controlled Ethiopia He was made negus in 1928 and was crowned Haile Selassie I King of Kings of Ethiopia Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah Elect of God on November 2 1930 His coronation was given widespread publicity throughout the world especially through two TIME Magazine articles in a row This publicity created interest on the far away island of Jamaica where a belief in his divinity soon arose because of his titles and because they saw him as a symbol of black liberation 

In 1936 he left Ethiopia after the invasion by Mussolinis Italy He gave a speech at the League of Nations asking the world to stop the Italians but they failed to act With the help of the British in World War Two he was able to return to Ethiopia in 1941 In 1963 the Emperor did everything he could to help start the Organisation of African Unity with its headquarters in Addis Ababa In 1966 he visited Jamaica where he met the Rastafarian community of Jamaica On September 12 1974 he was overthrown by a Marxist coup and they said died of natural causes the following August However there is some disagreement around why he died and many Rastafarians claim he is still alive

Ethiopia is a country in the Horn of Africa It has one of the most well known histories as a country in Africa and the world Unlike other African countries Ethiopia stayed together during the Scramble for Africa except for 5 years when it was ruled by Italians Ethiopia used to be called Abyssinia The word Ethiopia is from the Greek word BNP per capita 1370 

The Kingdom of joan lanm the first known kingdom of great power to rise in Ethiopia rose during the first century AD The Persian religious figure Mani listed Axum with Rome Persia and China as one of the four great powers of his time It was in the early 4th century that a Syro Greek castaway Frumentius was taken to the court and over time changed King Ezana to Christianity making Christianity Ethiopias religion For this he received the title Abba Selama At different times including a time in the 6th century Axum ruled most of modern day Yemen just across the Red Sea

The line of rulers from the Axumite kings was broken a few times first by the Jewish Queen Gudit around 950 then by the Zagwe dynasty Around 1270 the Solomonid dynasty came to control Ethiopia claiming that they were related to the kings of Axum They called themselves Neguse Negest basing their claims on their direct relation to Solomon and the queen of Sheba

During the rule of Emperor Lebna Dengel Ethiopia made its first good contact with a European country Portugal This was a good development When the Empire was attacked by Somali General and Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al Ghazi Portugal responded to Lebna Dengels request for help with an army of 400 men which helped his son Gelawdewos beat al Ghazi and remake his rule However Jesuit missionaries over time offended the Orthodox faith of the local Ethiopians and in the mid 17th century Emperor Fasilidos got rid of these missionaries At the same time the Oromo people began to question the Ethiopian Christian authorities in the Abyssinian territories and wanted to keep their own religion

All of this led to Ethiopias isolation during the 1700s The Emperors became figureheads controlled by warlords like Ras Mikael Sehul of Tigray Ethiopian isolationism ended following a British mission that made friendship between the two nations however it was not until the reign of Tewodros II that Ethiopia began to take part in world matters once again

One can say that Oslo is divided into to two parts the West end and the East end with the West traditionally being the upper class area and the East end being a more middle class to poor area However this divide has faded during the last 50 years as less people are manual workers and more people get employed in better paid middle class jobs Oslo is looked upon as a very expensive city with high prices in bars and restaurants as well as high prices for houses and apartments 

Currently the mayor of Oslo is Fabian Stang from the Conservative Party

The Saga of Norwegian Kings says that king Harald III Sigurdsson founded Oslo around 1048 Recent archaeological research has found Christian graves from before 1000 Because of these two facts Oslo celebrated its 900 year anniversary in 1950 and its 1000 year anniversary in 2000

One of the more famous landmarks in Oslo is Akershus Fortress It was first built around 1290 Oslo was destroyed in fire in 1624 and the fortress was rebuilt closer to Akershus Fortress by the order of King Christian IV of Norway The king gave the new city the name Christiania which later also written as Kristiania In 1925 the name of the city was changed back to Oslo

Calvin and Hobbes is a comic strip by Bill Watterson about a boy called Calvin and a tiger called Hobbes When Calvin looks at Hobbes he sees a real tiger However everyone else sees Hobbes as a toy This comic began in 1985 and has been in over 2400 newspapers Readers bought almost 23 million Calvin and Hobbes books

In the comic Calvin spends a lot of time with Hobbes In pictures with only Calvin and Hobbes in them Hobbes looks like a cartoon tiger He stands on two legs In pictures with any other person Hobbes looks like a stuffed animal Calvin meets Hobbes in the first story Calvin catches him with a string and a tuna fish sandwich as bait Calvin and Hobbes have all sorts of trouble and adventures The comic strip continued from November 18 1985 until December 31 1995

Calvin is a 6 year old boy He is named after a religious thinker or theologian John Calvin His last name is never in the comic

Calvin often pretends and he has a powerful imagination He also does things without thinking He is often very excited and is curious about everything Sometimes he is selfish and rude Calvin does not get good grades in school but he knows very many complex words that usually only adults know You know how Einstein got bad grades as a kid he says Well mine are even worse

Calvin usually wears a shirt with red stripes on it He has blond hair that stands up on his head Watterson has described Calvin this way

Calvin often appears one of his many imaginary personalities Sometimes he thinks he is a superhero called Stupendous Man Sometimes he is an astronaut and explorer called Spaceman Spiff Other times he appears as a private eye Tracer Bullet There are many others like Captain Napalm

In classic comic tradition of sidekicks Hobbes is like Calvins good side because he is more mature and makes smarter decisions than Calvin does When Calvin does something like throw a snowball at a girl Hobbes will say You think shes cute right 

From most characters point of view Hobbes is Calvins stuffed tiger However from Calvins point of view Hobbes is as alive and real just like other characters in the comic strip He is named after 17th century philosopher Thomas Hobbes who had what Watterson called a dim view of human nature Hobbes is much more alert and aware of the bad things that can happen than Calvin is But he does not stop Calvins trouble making All that he really does is warn him Calvin will be the one to get in trouble for doing something wrong not Hobbes Hobbes also likes to surprise Calvin He approaches him quietly and then jumping on Calvin Calvin hates this

From Calvins point of view Hobbes is a real intelligent loyal and cunning tiger much larger than Calvin and full of his own attitudes and ideas But when the view changes to any other character readers see merely a little stuffed tiger Watterson explains it like this

Although the first strips clearly show Calvin capturing Hobbes by means of a trap a later comic seems to imply that Hobbes is in fact older than Calvin and has been around with him his whole life Watterson decided that it was not important to explain how Calvin and Hobbes had first met

Calvins mom and dad are mostly American middle class parents like many other characters in the strip their relatively realistic and sensible manners act as a contrast to Calvins childish and selfish behavior Both parents go through the entire strip without names They are only called Mom and Dad or nicknames such as hon and dear Watterson has never given Calvins parents names because as far as the strip is concerned they are important only as Calvins mom and dad This ended up being somewhat problematic when Calvins Uncle Max was in the strip for a week and could not refer to the parents by name and was one of the main reasons that Max never reappeared

Susie Derkins the only character in the strip with both first and last names is a fellow classmate of Calvin who lives in his neighborhood She first appeared early in the strip as a new student in Calvins class Unlike Calvin she is polite and very smart and eager to improve in her studies and grades at school and her imagination usually seems mild mannered and calm consisting of a standard young girls games such as playing house or having tea parties with her stuffed animals Her approach to these games is arguably more modern however some might say even skeptical Derkins was the nickname of Wattersons wifes family beagle and he liked the name so much he named this character after it As much as either of them hate to admit Calvin and Susie have quite a bit in common

Watterson admits that Calvin and Susie have a bit of a wild crush on each other and that Susie is inspired by the type of women Watterson himself finds attractive Her relationship with Calvin though is frequently conflicted and never really becomes sorted out and the closest things are times when Calvin sends dead flowers and hate mail as Valentines Day gifts for his own enjoyment

Sometimes Hobbes does something to attract Susies romantic attention He is often successful and this makes Calvin angry and jealous Although on the surface these events take the form of Hobbes teasing Calvin and showing off his charms they may be Calvins way to disguise his own crush on Susie by pretending that it is Hobbes crush instead

Moe is a bully a six year old who shaves who is always pushing Calvin against walls forcing to give him to give away his lunch money and calling him Twinky Moe is the only regular character who speaks in an unusual font his dialogue is shown in rough lower case letters Watterson describes Moe as every jerk Ive ever known And while Moe is not smart he is as Calvin puts it streetwise That means he knows what street he lives on as Calvin says

Miss Wormwood is Calvins bored and depressed teacher named after the apprentice devil in CS Lewiss The Screwtape Letters She continuously wears polka dotted dresses and serves like others as a foil to Calvins rude behavior Calvins response to the boring studies of schoolwork is endless dreams of his imagination She is eagerly waiting to retire taking a large amount of medication and is apparently a heavy smoker and alcoholic drinker

Although time does change in the Calvin and Hobbes universe which is mostly seen in the changing of the season Calvin returns to Ms Wormwoods first grade class every fall

As usual for an adult entering Calvins world Miss Wormwood sees things differently from Calvin For example when she talks to Calvin about his missing homework Calvins Spaceman Spiff persona sees her as a large slimy threatening snarling alien Slowly carefully Spiff draws his death ray blaster

Rosalyn is a teenage high school senior student and the person who watches Calvin whenever Calvins parents go on a night out together She is the only babysitter able to put up with Calvins bad behavior which she uses to demand raises and advance payment from Calvins desperate parents She is also according to Watterson the only person Calvin truly fears certainly she is his equal in sneakiness and is willing to play as dirty as he does Rosalyn has a habit of sending him to bed at 630 which he refuses to do and only makes more trouble Rosalyns boyfriend Charlie never appears in the strip but calls her on the telephone sometimes Calvin often cuts short these calls Originally she was created as a nameless one time only character with no plans to appear again however Watterson decided he wanted to keep her unique ability to scare Calvin which led to many more appearances

At one time during the strip shown in the book collection The Revenge of the Babysat Calvins parents prepare to go out on a night with a dinner and a movie while leaving Calvin with Rosalyn When he finds out she is coming Calvin runs up to Hobbes and explains the situation Later when Rosalyn appears Calvin and Hobbes hear that Rosalyn needs to study for a big science test They decide to ruin her studying After Calvins parents leave Calvin approaches Rosalyn curious about what shes doing After slyly talking her away from her science notes he quickly grabs them runs to the bathroom door with Hobbes and locks the door while Rosalyn yells from he outside demanding her notes back Once they flushed her notes Moments later when the wonder if Rosalyn has gone Calvin opens the door only to find Rosalyn pounce upon him and throw him to bed at 7 oclock which Hobbes notes that they went to bed 30 minutes later than usual The ending shows Calvins parents coming back home to find Rosalyn charge extra money for the job while Calvins parents argue if theres another babysitter in town

During the winter Calvin likes to make ugly or frightening snowmen when once Calvin created the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons Also his snowmen creations have had snowmen with missing or multiple heads snowmen taking anothers head for a bowling ball and snowmen being knocked over by his familys car

Also Calvin frequently throws snowballs at Susie most likely having himself being chased by Susie Once Calvin also made a gigantic snowball and dropped it at Susie while on top of a tree as where Susies mom described it as a the size of a bowling ball

The monsters under the bed are described as scary octopus tentacled shaped creatures that lived under Calvins bed every time he went to sleep Often they would try to bribe Calvin to come under the bed by giving him a new toy or by urging Hobbes to push Calvin over in return for a fresh piece of salmon According to Calvin hed usually describe them as all fangs and no brains They often lie to Calvin when he asks how many monsters are under my bed when theyd usually reply theres only one or none and go to sleep Although various monsters were known to exist under Calvins bed two named monsters Maurice and Winslow appeared and re appeared during the strips middle times

Get Rid Of Slimy Girls is Calvins anti girl club The clubs goal is to annoy and bother girls and Calvins main target is Susie Derkins The club has only two members Calvin and Hobbes Calvin is supreme dictator for life and Hobbes is the first tiger They two usually make plans like throwing water balloons or snowballs at Susie Often these plans have a bad ending However every time GROSS finishes a mission or meeting they always get awards such as medals honors and promotions Of course the word gross also means disgusting

Calvin hates school and homework so much He usually tries to avoid them His Mom always makes him ride the school bus even though he does not want to and sometimes tries to run home and not go to class In one Sunday comic strip Calvins imagination became so wild and creative that he imagined getting in a F 15 Eagle airplane and blasting his elementary school to pieces with many missiles

Tony Randall was an American actor He was best known for his role as Felix Unger on the TV show The Odd Couple

A lesbian is a homosexual woman This means a woman who is sexually attracted to other women and not to men

The word lesbian comes from Lesbos an island in Greece An ancient poet Sappho lived on Lesbos Sappho wrote mostly poems about love Many of her love poems are written to women So her name and the island where she lived make people think about women who love women Sometimes lesbians are also called Sapphists from the name Sappho

Lesbians were involved in the early feminist movement Feminism is the political and social movements that promote womens equality and rights However there was conflict between lesbians and straight women in the feminist movement In the 1960s and 1970s some straight feminists wanted the lesbians out of the womens rights movement They wanted feminism to be accepted by society They believed lesbians were less accepted by society and might hurt the feminist movement

Eventually the womens rights movement accepted its lesbian members Now many important feminist leaders are out lesbians

Many lesbian couples want to have children In order to raise children they sometimes adopt However some places do not allow homosexual couples to adopt childrenSo many of them want to be able to adopt children

Some lesbian couples also have their own biological children To do this they may have artificial insemination This is when sperm from a donor male is placed in a woman to make a pregnancy Some lesbian women do this at home with a friend they choose to be the donor However many may use sperm banks These are medical businesses that match couples who need donor sperm with men who will donate Sometimes this is done anonymously which means the couple does not know the donor Sometimes this is done with the donor known and even chosen by the couple

Unlike gay sex between males lesbian sex is not against the law in as many places Some religions that condemn gay male sex say nothing about lesbian sex

However just like gay men in most parts of the world lesbians cannot marry This means they do not have the legal benefits and protection of marriage This can cause lesbians and gay men many problems

A school union is two or more school departments that share a superintendent but nothing else each town has a lone school board Normally only one of the schools in the school union has a high school but unlike MSADs students in the whole school union are not forced to be at that school School union students are given a choice of bordering school districts and the school union pays for the students tuition

The third type is a MSAD This is a broken wikt linkregionalregional school district that has two or more towns into one school department with one high school and middle school These towns do not have lone school boards but instead have one central board governing the entire district Students are forced to be at the central high school Normally a MSAD comprises one larger town and one or more smaller towns The larger town has a high school and middle school while the bordering towns have elementary schools as well but no secondary schools The elementary schools normally cut off after grade 5 or grade 6 Sometimes towns in a MSAD do not have an elementary school but broken wikt linkpossesspossess a high school andor middle school but the bordering towns have the elementary schools

The last type of school is a CSD This mostly happens in school districts with such a small student population between many towns that the school district cannot justify an elementary school outside the largest town in the district In not common cases a CSD refers to only a high school of a school union Sometimes in towns that do not have other towns bordering it for miles and miles the entire student population gos to one school grades PK12

Students can choose to go to a school in another district if the parents agree to pay the school broken wikt linktuitiontuition

Private schools are less common than public schools A big number of private elementary schools with under 20 students exist but most private high schools in Maine are actually semi private high schools This means that while it costs money to send children there towns will make a contract with a school to take children from a town or MSAD at a slightly downed rate Often this is done when it is seen cheaper to subsidize private tuition than make a whole new school when a private one already exists
