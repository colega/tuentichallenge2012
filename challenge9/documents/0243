African elephants are the two species of elephants in the genus Loxodonta one of the two existing genera in Elephantidae Although it is commonly believed that the genus was named by Georges Cuvier in 1825 Cuvier spelled it Loxodonte An anonymous author romanized the spelling to Loxodonta and the ICZN recognizes this as the proper authority

Fossil Loxodonta have only been found in Africa where they developed in the middle Pliocene

Males stand 364 meters tall at the shoulder and weigh 5455 kg while females stand 3 meters and weigh 3636 kg to 4545 kg  The largest bulls will weigh 24000 poundsand stand a little over at the shoulder

Elephants have four molars each weighs about 11 lbs and measures about 12 inches long The front pair wear down and drop out in pieces as the Two new molars emerge in the back of the mouth and the old molars shift forward to replace those that dropped out Elephants replace their teeth six times At about 40 to 60 years of age the elephant no longer has teeth and will likely die of starvation a common cause of death

Their tusks are teeth the second set of incisors become the tusks They are used for digging for roots and stripping the bark off trees for food and fighting each other during mating season or defending themselves against predators They weigh from 50 100 pounds and can be from can be from 5 to 8 feet long Both bulls and cows have tusks 

Bush and Forest Elephants were formerly considered subspecies of the same species Loxodonta africana However they are nowadays generally considered to be two distinct species The African Forest Elephant has a longer and narrower mandible rounder ears a different number of toenails straighter and downward tusks and considerably smaller size With regard to the number of toenails the African Bush Elephant normally has 4 toenails on the front foot and 3 on the hind foot the African Forest Elephant normally has 5 toenails on the front foot and 4 on the hind foot but hybrids between the two species commonly occur

Poaching significantly reduced the population of Loxodonta in certain regions during the 20th century An example of this poaching pressure is in the eastern region of Chadelephant herds there were substantial as recently as 1970 with an estimated population of 400000 however by 2006 the number had dwindled to about 10000 The African elephant nominally has governmental protection but poaching is still a serious issue 

Human encroachment into or adjacent to natural areas where bush elephants occur has led to recent research into methods of safely driving groups of elephants away from humans including the discovery that playback of the recorded sounds of angry honey bees are remarkably effective at prompting elephants to flee an area Some elephant communities have grown so large in Africa that some communities have resulted to culling large amounts to help sustain the ecosystem All in all African elephants are some of the smartest land animales in the world

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the sovereign state England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland are parts of this state 

It began to take its present shape with the Acts of Union in 1707 which united the crowns and Parliaments of England and Scotland to create the Kingdom of Great Britain A further Act of Union in 1800 joined the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland

In 1922 the territory of what is now the Republic of Ireland gained independence and only Northern Ireland continued to be part of the United Kingdom As a result in 1927 Britain changed its formal title to The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland usually shortened to the United Kingdom the UK or Britain

For history before the creation of the United Kingdom see

The first step towards political unification were taken on May 1st 1707 shortly after the parliaments of Scotland and England had approved Acts of Union which combined the two parliaments and the two royal titles 

Perhaps the greatest single benefit to Scotland of the Union was that Scotland could enjoy free trade with England and her colonies overseas For Englands part a possible ally for European states that were hostile to England had been neutralized 

Certain aspect of the former independent kingdoms remained separate Examples of Scottish and English institutions which were not merged into the British system include Scottish and English law which remain separate as do Scottish and English banking systems the Presbyterian Church of Scotland and Anglican Church of England also remained separate as did the systems of education and higher learning 

As the Scots were better educated than the average Englishman they made a disproportionate contribution to both the government of the United Kingdom and the administration of the British Empire

The second stage in the development of the United Kingdom took effect on January 1st 1801 when the Kingdom of Great Britain merged with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland

The legislative union of Great Britain and Ireland was completed under the Act of Union 1800 The countrys name was changed to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland The Act was passed in the British and therefore unrepresentative Irish Parliament with substantial majorities achieved in part through bribery namely the awarding of peerages and honors to critics to get their votes The separate Parliaments of Great Britain and Ireland were abolished and replaced by a united Parliament of the United Kingdom Ireland thus became part of an extended United Kingdom Ireland sent around 100 MPs to the House of Commons at Westminster and 28 peers to the House of Lords 

Hostilities between Great Britain and France recommenced on May 18 1803 The Coalition war aims changed over the course of the conflict a general desire to restore the French monarchy became closely linked to the struggle to stop Napoleon The Napoleonic conflict had reached the point at which subsequent historians could talk of a world war Only the Seven Years War offered a precedent for widespread conflict on such a scale

The Victorian era marked the height of the British Industrial Revolution and the broken wikt linkapexapex of the British Empire Although commonly used to refer to the period of Queen Victorias rule between 1837 and 1901 scholars debate whether the Victorian periodas defined by a variety of sensibilities and political concerns that have come to be associated with the Victoriansactually begins with the passage of Reform Act 1832 The era was preceded by the Regency era and succeeded by the Edwardian period The latter half of the Victorian era roughly coincided with the first portion of the Belle poque era of continental Europe and other non English speaking countries

Britains control over its Empire loosened during the interwar period Nationalism became stronger in other parts of the empire particularly in India and in Egypt 

Between 1867 and 1910 the UK granted Australia Canada and New Zealand Dominion status 

The end of the Second World War saw a landslide General Election victory for Clement Attlee and the Labour Party 

As the country headed into the 1950s rebuilding continued and a number of immigrants from the remaining British Empire were invited to help the rebuilding effort During the 1950s the UK lost its place as a superpower and could no longer maintain its large Empire This led to decolonization and a withdrawal from almost all of its colonies by 1970 

Though the 1970s and 1980s saw the UKs integration to the European Economic Community which became the European Union in 1992 and a strict modernization of its economy

After the difficult 70s and 80s the 1990s saw the beginning of a period of continuous economic growth that has to date lasted over 15 years The Good Friday Agreement saw what many believe to be the beginning of the end of conflict in Northern Ireland since this event there has been very little armed violence over the issue

In the 2001 General Election the Labour Party won a second successive victory

Despite huge anti war marches being held in London and Glasgow Tony Blair gave strong support to the United States invasion of Iraq in 2003 Forty six thousand British troops one third of the total strength of the British Army were active to assist with the invasion of Iraq and after that British armed forces were responsible for security in southern Iraq in the time before the Iraqi elections of January 2005 

2007 sees the conclusion of the premiership of Tony Blair followed by the premiership of Gordon Brown

 The term United Kingdom was first used in the 1707 Act of Union However it is generally seen as a descriptive term indicating that the kingdoms were freely united rather than through conquest It is not seen as being actual name of the new United Kingdom which was the Kingdom of Great Britain The United Kingdom as a name is taken to refer to the kingdom that emerged when the Kingdom of Great Britain and Kingdom of Ireland merged on 1 January 1801

 The name Great Britain was first used by James VII in October 1604 who indicated that henceforth he and his successors would be viewed as Kings of Great Britain not Kings of England and Scotland However the name was not applied to the state as a unit both England and Scotland continued to be governed independently Its validity as a name of the Crown is also questioned given that monarchs continued using separate ordinals in England and Scotland To avoid confusion historians generally avoid using the term King of Great Britain until 1707 and instead to match the ordinal usage call the monarchs kings or queens of England and Scotland Separate ordinals were abandoned when the two states merged with the Act of Union 1707 with subsequent monarchs using ordinals apparently based on English not Scottish history One example is Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom who is referred to as being the Second even though there never was an Elizabeth I of Scotland or Great Britain Thus the term Great Britain is generally used from 1707

 The number changed several times between 1801 and 1922

4 The Anglo Irish Treaty was ratified by The British Parliament Dil ireann and the the House of Commons of Southern Ireland a parliament created under the British Government of Ireland Act 1920 which was supposedly the valid parliament of Southern Ireland in British eyes and which had an almost identical membership of the Dil but which nevertheless had to assemble separately under the Treatys provisions to approve the Treaty the Treaty thus being ratified under both British and Irish constitutional theory

The Acts of Union were a pair of Parliamentary Acts passed in 1706 and 1707 by respectively the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland to make effective the Treaty of Union which had been negotiated between the two countries The Acts joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland which had been separate states before with separate legislatures but with the same monarch into a single Kingdom of Great Britain

The two countries had shared a monarch for about 100 years The Acts took effect on 1 May 1707

Spitz type breeds of dog have long thick fur that is often white and pointed ears and noses Many times the tail is over the dogs back

No one knows where Spitz type dogs came from though most seen today live in the Arctic There is no archaeological signs showing stages between the wolf and Spitz type dogs but Spitz like skeletons have been found up to 5000 years old

Though it is not certain for how long wolves have bred with Spitz type dogs it is known that humans have bred Spitz types with wolves in more recent times to get wolf like breeds such as the Alaskan Malamute

About 3000 years ago dogs began to migrate from the Arctic into temperate Europe North America Asia and sometimes Africa Skeletons from around 2000 years ago in Switzerland show that Spitz type dogs have lived in central Europe for thousands of years These dogs are the ancestors of the European Spitz types such as the German Spitz and Schipperke Many Spitz types also migrated into Korea and China Later many of these dogs were moved by humans to Japan most likely from Korea These Asian Spitz types are the ancestors of todays breeds such as the Chow Chow and the Akita Inu

Through special breeding Spitz types have evolved to help humans in three ways hunting herding and pulling sleds Smaller breeds such as the Finnish Spitz and the Lundehund were used in Scandinavia to hunt birds and smaller mammals Larger breeds such as the Karelian Bear Dog and the Norwegian Elkhound were used for hunting large animals like moose and elk The largest of all the Spitz types notably the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland Dog were used to pull sleds up until the 19th century 

Spitz types are good at living in cold northern climates They often have a warm water proof layer of fur that is thicker than the outer layer of fur Small ears help reduce the risk of frostbite and thick fur that grows on the paws protects the dogs from sharp ice

Many Spitz type breeds are wolf like in their independence and aggression towards new humans and animals and can require much training before they become friendly Some like the Karelian Bear Dog are impossible to train as companion dogs

The cuteness of the Spitz type have caused people to create companion dog breeds from them The very small Pomeranian was at first a much larger dog similar to a Keeshond before being bred to make a small court animal The Keeshond is a friendly and loyal though very lively pet Other companion Spitz type dog breeds is the American Eskimo Dog

The Articles of Confederation were the first written plan of government for the United States of America This lasted from 1776 to 1781 A confederation is a group of states who cooperate for a common purpose 

Even though the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution were established by many of the same people the two documents were very different The original five paged Articles contained thirteen articles a conclusion and a signatory section The following list contains short summaries of each of the thirteen articles

The history of the United States is what happened in the past in the United States a country in North America Native Americans have lived there for thousands of years long before Europeans went there In 1492 Christopher Columbus went to America In 1607 English people went to Jamestown Virginia This was the first successful town in the United States The American colonies were settled mostly by England who had thirteen colonies in what would become the United States People from France Spain and the Netherlands also settled in America While the english colonies were growing many Native Americans died of disease or lost their land 

By 1733 there were 13 colonies They were the first states In 1775 at Lexington and Concord a war between the colonies and England called the Revolutionary War started This war started because the American colonists believed that they were not being treated equally to the Englishmen living in England On July 4 1776 people from 13 colonies created the United States Declaration of Independence This said that they were free from England George Washington helped lead the Americans during the Revolutionary War which the Americans won 

After the Revolution the United States set about becoming a new nation The leaders of the states created a constitution in 1787 and a Bill of Rights in 1791 These were based on the idea of social contracts by John Locke and others In the early 1800s the new nation faced many controversial issues such as slavery During the 1800s the United States gained much more land in the West and began to become industrialized In 1861 several states in the South left the United States to start a new country called the Confederate States of America From 1861 to 1865 the North and South fought a war called the American Civil War over states rights slavery and the type of country the United States would become

After the North won the war all of the states that had left joined the United States again The country went through reconstruction which meant putting the country back together In the late 1800s many people came to the United States from Europe and worked in large factories This period also led to the rise of rich businessmen which is why it is called the Gilded Age In the early 20th century the United States became a world power It was also one of the largest economies in the world The United States fought in World War I and World War II Between the wars there was a period of boom and bust or a period of good times followed by a period of bad times The boom period was known as the Roaring Twenties The bust period was known as the Great Depression The Great Depression ended with World War II

After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union entered a time known as the Cold War During the Cold War the United States government spent a lot of money on defense It fought in Korea and Vietnam It also put Neil Armstrong and other Americans in space During this time African Americans Chicanos and women fought for more rights In the 1970s and 1980s the United States started to make fewer things in factories than they used to The Cold War ended in 1991 when the Soviet Union fell apart The Middle East became important in American foreign policy especially after the September 11 attacks in 2001 

The Pre Columbian Era is the time before Christopher Columbus went to America in 1492 At that time Native Americans lived on the land that is now the United States They had different cultures Native Americans in the Eastern United States hunted game and deer Native Americans in the Northwest fished Native Americans in the Southwest grew corn and built houses called pueblos and Native Americans in the Great Plains hunted buffalo Around the year 1000 many people think that the Vikings visited Newfoundland However they did not settle there

The English tried to settle the Americas at Roanoke Island in 1585 The settlement at Roanoke Island did not last and no one knows what happened to the people there  In 1607 the first lasting English settlement was made at Jamestown Virginia by John Smith John Rolfe and other Englishmen interested in money and adventure In its early years many people in Virginia died of disease and starvation The colony lasted because it made money by planting tobacco

In 1621 a group of Englishmen called the Pilgrims settled at Plymouth Massachusetts A bigger colony was built at Massachusetts Bay by the Puritans in 1630 The Pilgrims and the Puritans were interested in making a better society not looking for gold They called this ideal society a city on a hill A man named Roger Williams left Massachusetts after disagreeing with the Puritans and started the colony of Rhode Island in 1636

England was not the only country to settle what would become the United States In the 1500s Spain built a fort at Saint Augustine Florida France settled Louisiana and the area around the Great Lakes The Dutch settled New York which they called New Netherland Other areas were settled by Scotch Irish Germans and Swedes  However in time England controlled all of the colonies and most American colonists adopted the English way of life The growth of the colonies was not good for Native Americans Many of them died of smallpox a disease brought to America by the Europeans The ones who lived lost their lands to the colonists 

In the early 1700s there was a religious movement in the United States called the Great Awakening During the Great Awakening preachers such as Jonathan Edwards preached sermons One of them was called Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God The Great Awakening was one of the first events in American History that was a mass movement or something that many Americans were involved in The Great Awakening along with the Salem Witch Trials was a reaction to what America was like around 1700 and may have led to the thinking used in the American Revolution

By 1733 there were thirteen colonies The colonies are often divided into three groups The northern group was called New England and included New Hampshire Massachusetts Rhode Island and Connecticut There were four Middle Colonies New York New Jersey Pennsylvania and Delaware The South had five colonies Maryland Virginia North Carolina South Carolina and Georgia New England had small farms and focused on fishing forestry shipping and small industry to make money The South had large plantation farms that grew tobacco and later cotton Plantations were farmed first by indentured servants and later by slaves  The Middle Colonies had medium sized farms These colonies also had people from many different cultures with many different beliefs All three regions were tied to the Atlantic economy Atlantic merchants used ships to trade slaves tobacco rum sugar gold spices fish lumber and manufactured goods between America the West Indies Europe and Africa New York Philadelphia Boston and Charleston were the largest cities and main ports at that time

From 1754 to 1763 England and France fought a war over their land in America called the Seven Years War or the French and Indian War which the English won After the war they issued the Proclamation of 1763 It said that people who lived in the thirteen colonies could not live west of the Appalachian Mountains Many colonists who wanted to move to the frontier did not like the Proclamation

After the French and Indian War the colonists began to think that they were not getting their rights as freeborn Englishman This meant they wanted to be treated fairly by the English government Part of this was because of the Proclamation of 1763 but it was mainly caused by new taxes the British made the colonies pay to pay for the war  Americans called this No taxation without representation meaning that the colonists should not have to pay taxes unless they had votes in the British Parliament These taxes included the Sugar Act Stamp Act Townsend Duties and Tea Act Each tax led to more unity between the colonies In 1770 colonists in Boston known as the Sons of Liberty got in a fight with British soldiers This became known as the Boston Massacre After the Tea Act the Sons of Liberty dumped hundreds of boxes of tea in a river This was known as the Boston Tea Party  This led to the British Army taking over Boston After that leaders of the 13 colonies formed a group called the Continental Congress Many people were members of the Continental Congress but some of the more important ones were Benjamin Franklin John Adams Thomas Jefferson John Hancock Roger Sherman and John Jay

In 1776 Thomas Paine wrote a pamphlet called Common Sense It argued that the colonies should be free of English rule This was based on the English ideas of natural rights and social contract put forth by John Locke and others  On July 4 1776 people from 13 colonies agreed to the United States Declaration of Independence This said that they were free and independent states and were not part of England any more The colonists were already fighting Britain in the Revolutionary War at this time The Revolutionary War started in 1775 at Lexington and Concord Though American soldiers under George Washington lost many battles to the British they won a major victory at Saratoga in 1777 This led to France and Spain joining the war on the side of the Americans In 1781 an American victory at Yorktown helped by the French led Britain to decide to stop fighting and give up the colonies America had won the war and its independence

In 1781 the colonies formed a confederation of states under the Articles of Confederation but it only lasted six years It gave almost all the power to the states and very little to the central government The confederation had no president It could not remove Native Americans or the British from the frontier nor could it stop mob uprisings such as Shays Rebellion After Shays Rebellion many people thought the Articles of Confederation were not working

In 1787 a constitution was written Many of the people who helped write the Constitution such as Washington James Madison Alexander Hamilton and Gouverneur Morris were among the major thinkers in America at the time Some of these men would later hold important offices in the new government The constitution created a stronger national government that had three branches executive legislative and judicial

Some states agreed to the Constitution very quickly In other states many people did not like the Constitution because it gave more power to the central government and had no bill of rights  To try and get the Constitution passed Madison Hamilton and Jay wrote a series of newspaper articles called the Federalist Papers  Very soon after the Bill of Rights was added This was a set of 10 amendments that limited the governments power and guaranteed rights to the citizens Like the Declaration of Independence the Constitution is a social contract between the people and the government The main idea of the Constitution is that the government is a representative democracy elected by the people who all have the same rights However this was not true at first when only white males who owned property could vote Because of state laws as well as the 14th 15th 19th 24th and 26th Amendments almost all American citizens who are at least 18 years old can vote today

In 1789 Washington was elected the first President He defined how a person should act as President and retired after two terms During Washingtons term there was a Whiskey Rebellion where country farmers tried to stop the government from collecting taxes on whiskey In 1795 Congress passed the Jay Treaty which allowed for increased trade with Britain in exchange for the British giving up their forts on the Great Lakes However Great Britain was still doing things that hurt the US such as impressment

John Adams defeated Thomas Jefferson in the election of 1796 to become the second President of the United States This was the first American election that was between two political parties As president Adams made the army and navy larger He also got laws passed to stop people and newspapers from saying bad things about him These were called the Alien and Sedition Acts

In the election of 1800 Jefferson defeated Adams One of the most important things he did as President was to make the Louisiana Purchase from France which made the United States twice as big Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark to map the Louisiana Purchase Jefferson also tried to stop trade with England and France so that the United States would not become involved in a war the two countries were fighting Fighting broke out between the United States and England in 1812 when James Madison was President This was called the War of 1812

One of the problems of this period was slavery By 1861 over three million African Americans were slaves in the South This means that they worked for other people but had no freedom and received no money for their work Most worked picking cotton on large plantations Only a few white people in the South owned plantations Most white people in the South owned no slaves at all Cotton became the main crop in the South after Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin in 1793 There were a few slave rebellions against slavery including one led by Nat Turner All of these rebellions failed The South wanted to keep slavery but by the time of the Civil War many people in the North wanted to end it Another argument between the North and South was about the role of government The South wanted stronger state governments but the North wanted a stronger central government

After the War of 1812 America had an Era of Good Feelings under Presidents James Madison and James Monroe Under Monroe the United States policy in North America was the Monroe Doctrine which suggested that Europe should stop trying to control the United States and other independent countries in the Americas Around this time Congress called for something called the American System The American System meant spending money on banking transportation and communication Due to the American System bigger cities and more factories were built One of the big transportation projects of this time was the Erie Canal a canal in the state of New York By the 1840s railroads were built as well as canals By 1860 thousands of miles of railroads and telegraph lines had been built in the United States mostly in the Northeast and Midwest

In the early 19th century there was an industrial revolution Many factories were built in Northeastern cities such as Lowell Massachusetts Most of them made clothes Many factory workers were women and some were children or people from Ireland or Germany Despite this industrialization America was still a nation of farmers

In the early and mid 1800s there was a religious movement called the Second Great Awakening It started in upstate New York but spread to New England and the Midwest During the Second Great Awakening thousands of people gathered at large religious meetings called revivals The people of the Second Great Awakening thought they could bring about a Golden Age in America through religion The Second Great Awakening led to new religious movements such as the Holiness Movement and the Mormons and helped groups like the Methodist Church grow The Second Great Awakening led to two movements in reform that is changing laws and behaviors to make society better One of these was the Temperance Movement which believed that drinking alcohol was not good for society The other was abolitionism which tried to end slavery People such as Harriet Beecher Stowe and William Lloyd Garrison wrote books and newspapers saying that slavery should stop They also formed political movements which included the Liberty Party the Free Soil Party and the Republican Party Some abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass were former slaves By 1820 slavery was very rare in the North but continued in the South

In the 19th century there was something called the cult of domesticity for many American women This meant that most married women were expected to stay in the home and raise children In a marriage an American woman was very much under the control of her husband and had almost no rights Women who were not married had only a few jobs open to them such as working in clothing factories and serving as maids By the 19th century women such as Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton thought that women should have more rights In 1848 many of these women met and agreed to fight for more rights for women including voting Many of the women involved in the movement for womens rights were also involved in the movement to end slavery

In 1828 Andrew Jackson was elected President He was the first president elected from the Democratic Party He changed the government in many ways Since many of his supporters were poor people who had not voted before he rewarded them with government jobs which is called spoils or patronage Because of Jackson a new party was formed to run against him called the Whigs This was called the Second Party System Jackson was very much against the National Bank He saw it as a symbol of Whigs and of powerful American businessmen Jackson also called for a high import tax that the South did not like They called it the Tariff of Abominations Jacksons Vice President John C Calhoun was from the South He wrote that the South should stop the tariff and perhaps leave the Union These words would be used again during the Civil War

People started to move west of the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains at this time The first people who moved west were people who caught and sold animal skins such as John Colter and Jim Bridger By the 1840s many people were moving to Oregon by wagon and even more people went west after the California Gold Rush of 1849 Many new states were added to the first thirteen mostly in the Midwest and South before the Civil War and in the West after the Civil War During this period Native Americans lost much of their land They had lost military battles to the Americans at Tippecanoe and in the Seminole War In the 1830s Indians were being pushed out of the Midwest and South by events such as the Trail of Tears and the Black Hawk War By the 1840s most Native Americans had been moved west of the Mississippi River  

In 1845 Texas which was a nation after it left Mexico joined the United States  Mexico did not like this and the Americans wanted land Mexico had on the West Coast  This led to the US and Mexico fighting a war called the Mexican American War During the war the US captured the cities of San Francisco Los Angeles Monterrey Veracruz and Mexico City As a result of the war the US gained land in California and much of the American Southwest Many people in the North did not like this war because they thought it was just good for Southern slave states

In the 1840s and 1850s people in the Northern states and people in the Southern states did not like each other very much mostly due to the issues of slavery in the territories and the power of the federal government People in the government tried to make deals to stop a war Some deals were the Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas Nebraska Act but they did not really work to keep the Union together People in the South were angry at books like Uncle Toms Cabin that said that slavery was wrong People in the North did not like a Supreme Court decision called Dred Scott that kept Scott a slave People from the South and people from the North started killing each other in Kansas over slavery This was called Bleeding Kansas One of the people from Bleeding Kansas John Brown took over a town in Virginia in 1859 to make a point about slavery being wrong and to try to get slaves to fight their owners

In the election of 1860 the Democratic Party split and the Republican candidate for President Abraham Lincoln was elected After this many Southern states quit the Union Eventually eleven states quit They started a new country called the Confederate States of America or the Confederacy A war broke out between the Union and the Confederacy The South had better generals than the North but it had fewer railroads and almost no weapons factories Not having factories made it harder for Southern soldiers to get guns or uniforms The South could not get supplies because Northern ships blockaded the Southern coast

Early in the war Confederate generals such as Robert E Lee and Stonewall Jackson won battles over Union generals such as George B McClellan and Ambrose Burnside who were not as good In 1862 and 1863 the Union Army tried to take the Confederate capital of Richmond Virginia several times but failed each time Lees army invaded the North twice but was turned back at Antietam and GettysburgIn the middle of war Lincoln made the Emancipation Proclamation which supposedly freed all slaves in the Confederacy and started letting black men fight in the Union Army The war started going the Unions way after the battles of Gettysburg and Vicksburg in 1863 Gettysburg stopped Lee from invading the North and Vicksburg gave the Union control over the Mississippi River In 1864 a Union Army under William T Sherman marched through Georgia and destroyed much of it By 1865 Union General Ulysses S Grant had taken Richmond and forced Lee to give up the fight at Appomattox

In April 1865 Lincoln was shot and killed while watching a play The new president Andrew Johnson had to go through the process of Reconstruction which was putting the United States back together after the Civil War During this time the 13th 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution were passed freeing slaves making them citizens and allowing them to vote Congress was run by Radical Republicans who wanted to punish the South after the Civil War They did not like Johnson and almost removed him from office They also sent many soldiers to the South installed unpopular scalawag governments and made the South pass the 14th and 15th Amendments The South did not like this so they made Jim Crow laws that placed blacks in lower roles and forced them to work as poor farmers called sharecroppers White Southerners started a group called the Ku Klux Klan that attacked blacks and stopped them from voting

During this time many people moved to the United States from other countries such as Ireland Italy Germany Eastern Europe and China Many of them worked in large factories and lived in big cities such as New York City Chicago and Boston often in small poor close together apartments called tenements or slums They often were used by political machines who gave them jobs and money in exchange for votes

Political machines had control of the government in the last decades of the nineteenth century Most of the Presidents were chosen by political machines and were corrupt The government could do little because the Presidents did not have control of Congress Leaders of big businesses often had more power than the government At this time there were several very big businesses called trusts People who ran trusts made millions of dollars while paying workers in their factories low wages Some of these people were John D Rockefeller Andrew Carnegie and JP Morgan

After the Civil War people continued to move west where new states were formed People now could get free land in the West due to an 1862 law called the Homestead Act Most of the land in the West was owned by the government railroads or large farmers Railroads called the Transcontinental Railroad finished in 1869 helped get people and goods from the west to the rest of the country Chicago became the center of trade between West and East This was because most of the rail lines met there There were problems between the white settlers and the native Indians as more people began to move west Because of this many more Indians were killed at battles such as Wounded Knee Almost all the Indians land was taken away by laws like the Dawes Act

Many Americans did not like the railroad because it charged farmers so much money that it made them poor Workers led several strikes against the railroad that were put down by the army Also farmers started groups to fight the railroad such as the Grange These groups became the Populist Movement which almost won the presidency under William Jennings Bryan The Populists wanted reforms such as an income tax and direct election of Senators The Populist Party died out after 1896 Many of the things the Populists wanted would happen during the Progressive Era

In the United States progressivism is the belief that the government should have a larger role in the economy to provide good living standards for people especially workers Imperialism was the belief that the US should build a stronger navy and conquer land

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the US started being more active in foreign affairs In 1898 the United States fought a war with Spain called the Spanish American War The United States won and gained Puerto Rico Guam Guantanamo and the Philippines Combined with the purchase of Alaska and the taking over of Hawaii the United States had gained all the territory it has today plus some it would later lose after World War II Around this time the US and European nations opened up trade with China This was because they had beaten China in the Opium Wars and the Boxer Rebellion The US and Europe were able to trade with China through the Open Door Policy 

In 1901 Theodore Roosevelt became President He had been a soldier in the Spanish American War He called for a foreign policy known as the Big Stick This meant having a large navy and exercising control over Latin America Between 1901 and 1930 the United States sent soldiers into Latin America several times When Roosevelt was president work was begun on the Panama Canal a link between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans that made travel around the world much faster 

During this time people started to notice the poor condition of American cities A group of people called the muckrakers wrote books and newspaper articles about subjects like the power of big business unclean practices in factories and the condition of poor people Roosevelt and Congress answered their concerns with laws such as the Pure Food and Drug Act The Act controlled the way food was made to make sure it was safe Another response to the muckrakers was something called trust busting where big businesses were broken up into smaller ones The biggest business broken up this way was the Standard Oil Company in 1911

In 1912 Woodrow Wilson became President He was a Progressive but not quite the same as Roosevelt He fought the triple wall of privilege which was big business taxes and fees on goods coming into the United States During this time the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Amendments to the US Constitution were passed They allowed for a federal income tax and direct election of US Senators

The United States did not want to enter World War I It eventually entered the war in 1917 for two reasons One was that a ship carrying Americans called the Lusitania was blown up by the Germans The other was the Zimmerman Telegram a message Germany sent to Mexico about invading the US The United States fought on the side of Britain and France and the war ended a year later Wilson worked to create an international organization called the League of Nations The main goal of the League was preventing war However the United States did not join because isolationists rejected the peace treaty At the end of World War I a flu pandemic killed millions of people in the US and Europe After the war the United States was one of the richest and most powerful nations in the world

FileJohn Calvin Coolidge Bain bw photo portraitjpg180pxthumbrightCoolidge The business of America is businessThere was a lot of racism in the 1920s The Ku Klux Klan was powerful once again and attacked blacks Catholics Jews and immigrants People blamed the war and problems in the business sector on immigrants and labor leaders whom they said were Bolsheviks Many people also thought that the United States had lost touch with religion They dealt with that by changing religion but also by attacking science

The 1920s were an era of boom and prosperity for the United States Many Americans began buying consumer products such as Model T Fords and appliances Advertising became very important to American life During this time many African Americans moved out of the South and into large cities such as New York City Chicago St Louis and Los Angeles They brought with them jazz music which is why the 1920s are called the Jazz Age The 1920s were also the Prohibition Era This was because middle class religious rural people who supported temperance and prohibition got the Eighteenth Amendment passed During the 1920s drinking alcohol was supposedly illegal but many Americans drank it anyway This led to much organized crime involving selling illegal alcohol 

After World War I the United States had an isolationist foreign policy That meant it did not want to enter into another global war It passed laws and treaties that supposedly would end war forever and refused to sell weapons to its former allies 

In 1921 Warren G Harding became President He believed that the best way to make the economy good was for the government to be friendly to big business by cutting taxes and regulating less While the economy was doing very well under these policies the gap between how much money the rich had and how much money the poor had was as big as it had ever been Hardings presidency had several problems The biggest one was Teapot Dome The Teapot Dome scandal involved one of Hardings advisors taking a lot of money in exchange for allowing oil drilling in the Navy Oil Reserve Harding died in 1923 and Calvin Coolidge became President Coolidge believed that the government should keep out of business just like Harding and continued many of Hardings policies Coolidge chose not to run again in 1928 and Herbert Hoover became president

In 1929 a Great Depression hit the United States The stock market crashed Many banks ran out of money and closed By 1932 over a quarter of the nation had no jobs and much of the nation was poor or unemployed Many people were driven off farms not only because of the Depression but also because of a storm known as the Dust Bowl and because farmers had not been doing well during the 1920s

President Hoover tried to do something about the Depression but it did not work In 1932 he was defeated and Franklin D Roosevelt became President He created the New Deal It was a series of government programs which would give relief recovery and reform 

The New Deal had many programs such as Social Security the National Recovery Administration Works Progress Administration the Civilian Conservation Corps and Tennessee Valley Authority These programs put millions of Americans to work though often at low pay Many of these programs were started early in Roosevelts term in a time called the Hundred Days or in 1935 in a time called the Second New Deal Programs like Social Security grew out of populist movements by people such as Huey Long that were called Share Our Wealth and Ham and Eggs The New Deal also led to the rise of workers unions such as the Congress of Industrial Organizations

The New Deal is often called the period that saved capitalism and stopped America from becoming a Communist or Fascist state  Although the New Deal improved the economy it did not end the Great Depression The Great Depression was ended by World War II

As World War II was beginning the United States said they would not get involved in it Most Americans thought the United States should remain neutral and some people thought the United States should enter the war on the side of the Germans Eventually the US did try to help the Allied Powers with the Lend Lease Act It gave the Allies a lot of money and guns in trade for use of air bases throughout the world

On December 7 1941 Japan attacked Pearl Harbor a US base in Hawaii The US was no longer neutral and it declared war on the Axis Powers The US entering World War II ended the Great Depression because the war created many jobs While some of the battles the US fought in were air and naval battles with Japan the US mainly fought in Europe and Africa The US opened up several fronts including in North Africa and Italy The US also bombed Germany from airplanes blowing up German cities and factories On June 6 1944 American and British forces invaded Normandy A year later the Allies had freed France and taken Berlin In 1945 Roosevelt died and Harry Truman became president The US decided to drop two atomic bombs on Japan Japan gave up soon afterwards and the war ended However the atomic bombs killed many ordinary people in the cities not only soldiers At least 250000 Japanese people died in four days 

The war meant different things for women and minorities During the war many women worked in weapons factories They were symbolized by a character called Rosie the Riveter Many African Americans served in the army but often in segregated units with white officers Japanese Americans on the West Coast were forced to live in internment camps though a few also served in the Army

After World War II the Soviet Union and the United States were the two most powerful countries left in the world The Cold War was a period of tension between the two countries over ways of life The two countries tried to get other countries on their side The Soviet Union tried to get countries to become Communist and the United States tried to stop them from being Communist American and Soviet soldiers never fought in battles but they fought indirectly in the Korean War and the Vietnam War 

The Korean War lasted only a few years but led to American soldiers being in Korea since then The Vietnam War lasted much longer It started with a few American troops in Vietnam but by the 1960s thousands of Americans were being sent to Vietnam Both wars were between a Northern Communist government helped by the Soviet Union and Communist China and a Southern government helped by the US The Korean War resulted in a split Korea but the Vietnam War resulted in a Communist Vietnam after the United States left due to American people wanting to end the war Over a quarter million Americans died or were wounded in Vietnam which was very much a military failure The US and Soviet Union argued about where they could place nuclear weapons One of these arguments was the Cuban Missile Crisis During the Cuban Missile Crisis the US and Soviet Union came very close to attacking each other with nuclear weapons 

During the Cold War the United States had a Red Scare where the government tried to find people it thought were Communist The House of Representatives had a group called the House Un American Activities Committee to deal with this and Joseph McCarthy led hearings in the Senate The Red Scare led to people losing their jobs going to jail and even being executed Many actors and authors were put on blacklists which meant they could not get jobs in movies or get credit for their writings

The Cold War began with an arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union to see who could have more and better weapons This started after the Soviets were the second country to develop an atomic bomb  In the United States this started something called the Military Industrial Complex which meant business and government working together to spend a lot of money on large scale weapons projects Business and government helped each other to get more money and more power Part of the Complex was something called the Marshall Plan which rebuilt Europe while making them buy American goods The Complex allowed for a growing middle class but also kept the Cold War going

Besides the arms race another part of the Cold War was the Space Race This started when the Soviets launched a satellite into space called Sputnik in 1957 Americans became worried that the United States was falling behind the Soviet Union and made their schools focus more on math and science Within a few years both the United States and the Soviet Union had sent satellites animals and people into orbit  In 1969 the Apollo 11 mission put Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon

United States foreign policy changed in the 1970s when the United States left Vietnam and Richard Nixon left office due to Watergate In the 1970s and 1980s the United States had a policy of detente with the Soviet Union This meant that the two countries signed treaties to stop use of weapons Under Nixon and Ronald Reagan the United States sent troops and money to many Latin American governments to stop them from being Communist This led to violence in Latin America Around this time the economy suffered because the United States was not making as many things as it used to and because some countries in the Middle East were not giving the US as much oil as it wanted The Middle East became very important in American foreign policy after several Americans were kidnapped in Iran in 1979 In the 1980s people in the US government sold weapons to people in Iran and gave the money to contra soldiers in Nicaragua This was called Iran Contra In the 1970s and 1980s the US normalized relations with China The Cold War came to an end as Communist governments in the Soviet Union and other countries fell apart

The United States once again had prosperity Millions of white people moved out of the cities and into suburbs and into Southern and Western states known as the Sunbelt They bought new cars and television sets The birth rate in the 1940s and 1950s rose leading to a population growth known as the Baby Boom Peoples thoughts about the future led into Space Age or Googie style art and architecture Many more people became part of the middle class but there were still many people who were poor

One of the groups that were often poor were African Americans Most either lived in poor neighborhoods in Northern cities or in the South where they faced racism and Jim Crow segregation These conditions led to the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s led by Martin Luther King Jr and others In 1954 the Supreme Court found school segregation illegal in Brown v Board of Education though it would be several years before school segregation was ended In 1955 King led a bus boycott in Montgomery Alabama In the late 1950s and 1960s he wanted action to stop segregation in businesses and public places King got help from Presidents John F Kennedy who was shot and Lyndon B Johnson In 1963 he led a march on Washington calling for civil rights Soon after Congress passed laws that made most segregation illegal Johnson also had a program called the Great Society that helped poor and minorities

Blacks were not the only group pushing for rights in the Cold War era Gays and lesbians who had often been persecuted started to ask for rights beginning with the Stonewall riots in 1969 Chicanos also fought for rights as did women Though women had had jobs during World War II most of them went back to the home after the war Women did not like that they often held jobs that paid less than men or that fewer opportunities were open to them People like Betty Freidan and Gloria Steinem founded groups such as the National Organization for Women to try and solve these problems NOW and other groups wanted an Equal Rights Amendment that would guarantee them equality in all areas In the 1970s and 1980s many more jobs and opportunities were opened to women There were some women like Phyllis Schlafly who opposed Freidan and Steinem and were known as anti feminists It was partly because of the anti feminists that the Equal Rights Amendment was defeated but also because women had already gained equality in many areas and they did not want to be drafted into the army

In the 1960s the counterculture was created Some of the followers of the counterculture were called hippies They had long hair and acted very liberally living communally smoking marijuana and practicing free love The counterculture along with college students were the groups most against the Vietnam War They also were the groups that listened to new music known as rock and roll

In 1973 the Supreme Court issued a decision called Roe v Wade which made many abortions legal This along with the counterculture and the push for rights of minorities and gays led to a reaction by Jerry Falwell and other conservatives who called themselves the Religious Right and the Moral Majority After Watergate these forces combined with people who did not like big government to create a new Republican Party who got Ronald Reagan elected President in 1980 Reagan said that Government is not a solution to our problem government is the problem

Post Cold War and beyond 

In the late 1980s and early 1990s the Cold War came to an end This was due to the Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev starting a policy called perestroika the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union breaking into different countries Around this time the United States became a post industrial society That means it did not make as many things as it used to and had many people working in service jobs Part of these service jobs were in computers and the Internet which came into wide use in the 1990s By this time the United States had a very large trade deficit meaning it received more goods from other countries such as China than it sent to other countries The Middle East became the main focus of US foreign policy because the United States got billions of barrels of oil from there Many countries in the Middle East did not care for the US because it is an ally of Israel In 1991 the United States fought a war with Iraq called the First Gulf War or Operation Desert Storm This was due to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein ordering an attack on Kuwait a small country that the United States got oil from

In 1992 Bill Clinton became President Under Clinton the United States sent soldiers into Bosnia as part of a United Nations mission The United States also agreed to a trade pact called the North American Free Trade Agreement and dropped some of its rules on banking Many people did not like some of the things Clinton did and he lost control of Congress to the Republicans in 1994 Clinton was impeached for lying in court about sexual activity with a secretary named Monica Lewinsky but the Senate voted against removing him as President

In 2000 George W Bush was elected President even though Al Gore got more votes Soon into Bushs term terrorists attacked the World Trade Center on September 11 2001 They took control of four airplanes and crashed two of them into the World Trade Center and one into the Pentagon Thousands of people died when the buildings burned and fell down Bush became much more popular with the American people after the attacks Soon after the attacks the government passed a new law called the USA PATRIOT Act The PATRIOT Act allowed government agencies to collect information about Americans who were thought to be terrorists Many people thought this law was bad for Americans rights Soon after the attacks the US and NATO went to Afghanistan to find Osama bin Laden and others who they believed planned the September 11 attacks In 2003 the United States invaded Iraq because some people thought Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction Millions of people from around the world did not like the War in Iraq The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have lasted many years and have been called a Long War or a new American Empire By 2011 most American soldiers had left Iraq and combat there was over

In 2005 the southern United States was hit by a huge hurricane called Hurricane Katrina Much of the city of New Orleans was destroyed In 2006 the Democrats won back Congress because Americans did not like the way Bush dealt with War in Iraq or Katrina At the end of Bushs term the United States entered the worst recession since the Great Depression  Barack Obama was elected President in 2008 He became the first African American President of the United States During his first years in office Obama and Congress passed reforms on health care and banking They also passed a large stimulus bill to help the economy during the recession During the recession the government used large amounts of money to keep the banking and auto industries from falling apart Obama not only had to deal with the recession but also a large oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico A movement called the Tea Party started during Obamas presidency This group opposes Obamas health care plan and other policies they see as big government Due to the recession the Tea Party and a dislike of what Obama did Republicans won a large number of House and Senate seats in the 2010 election In 2011 Tea Party members of Congress almost shut down the government and sent the US into default A few months later many young people protested against big business They thought big business made too much money

The United States faces many issues at the present One of these is what kind of government the United States should become Liberals want a large government while the Tea Party and other groups want a smaller government One of these debates is over health care Health care costs a lot more today than it did a few years ago Conservatives and liberals also disagree on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage There are also many trends and developments that the US must deal with One of these is immigration Many people are coming to the US from Latin America and Asia especially Mexico This is called the browning of America There is also something called the graying of America That refers to the Baby Boom getting older and retiring Other issues facing the United States are a growing concern about the environment This has led to the creation of many green jobs or jobs that create clean or renewable energy

The exponential function is among the most useful of mathematical functions It is used to represent exponential growth which has uses in virtually all science subjects and also in Finance where it has prominence

One example of an exponential function in real life would be interest in a bank If a person deposits 100 into an account which gets 3 interest a month then the balance each month would be

Notice how the extra money from interest increases each month The greater the original balance the more interest the person will get

Two mathematical examples of exponential functions are shown below

a2

a3

The number e is important to every exponential function For example a bank pays interest of 001 percent every day One person takes his interest money and puts it in a box After 10000 days he has 2 times as much money as he started with Another person takes his interest money and puts it back into the bank Because the bank now pays him interest on his interest the amount of money is an exponential function After 10000 days he does not have 2 times as much money as he started with but he has 2718145 times as much money as he started with This number is very close to the number e If the bank pays interest more often so the amount paid each time is less then the number will be closer to the number e

A person can also look at the picture to see why the number e is important for exponential functions The picture has three different curves The curve with the black points is an exponential function with a base a little smaller than e The curve with the short black lines is an exponential function with a base a little bigger than e The blue curve is an exponential function with a base exactly equal to e The red line is a tangent to the blue curve It touches the blue curve at one point without crossing it A person can see that the red curve crosses the x axis the line that goes from left to right at 1 This is true only for the blue curve This is the reason that the exponential function with the base e is special

A computer file is a means to store information that belongs together Computer files can be opened by computer programs Usually they are stored on some kind of file system

There are different kinds of computer files that hold different kinds of data

The way the information is organized in a file is called the file format

Data format in information technology can mean

A file is a tool It is used to shape materials by cutting away some of it Today files are usually made of a steel bar that has a rough surface By rubbing the surface against a material some of the material is cut away There are also nail files used to shape a persons fingernails

Kornberg was born in St Louis Missouri to a Jewish family He was the first of three children born to Arthur Kornberg and his wife Sylvy The parents worked together as biochemists Roger Kornberg earned his bachelors degree from Harvard University in 1967 and his PhD from Stanford University in 1972 He then became a Fellow at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the University of Cambridge England

All heredity is controlled by genes For the cells to make use of the information in the genes a copy of part of the gene must be made The copying is called transcription Transcription makes an RNA copy of part of the DNA The RNA is moved out of the cell nucleus to ribosomes where it does its work This is called messenger RNA and it gives the amino acid sequence for protein production This second process is called translation The RNA with the instructions for proteins is called RNA polymerase II This process works in all eukaryotes including all plants and animals

Kornberg worked with Aaron Klug and Francis Crick at the MRC in the 1970s He discovered the nucleosome a very important protein structure in chromosomes Nucleosomes form the basic repeating units of eukaryotic chromatin This packs the large eukaryotic genomes into the nucleus and allows it to be controlled 

Kornberg made the discovery that signals to the RNA are made by another protein that they called Mediator The Nobel Prize committee said the great complexity of eukaryotic organisms is enabled by the fine interplay between tissue specific substances enhancers in the DNA and Mediator The discovery of Mediator is therefore a true milestone in the understanding of the transcription process

After long effort Kornberg was able to use X ray crystallography to take 3D pictures of RNA molecules lipids and proteins With these studies Kornberg has created a picture of how DNA works The Nobel Prize committee said the truly revolutionary aspect of the picture Kornberg has created is that it captures the process of transcription in full flow What we see is an RNA strand being constructed and hence the exact positions of the DNA polymerase and RNA during this process

In 1959 Roger Kornbergs father Arthur Kornberg received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for studies of how genetic information moves from one DNA molecule to another This is called DNA replication Arthur Kornberg found the first enzyme that could make DNA This was the first known enzyme to take its instructions from a DNA copy Roger Kornbergs younger brother Thomas Bill Kornberg discovered DNA polymerases II and III in 1970 and is now a geneticist at the University of California San Francisco All three Kornbergs have worked to understand how genetic information is used in cells Arthur and Roger Kornberg are the sixth father and son to win Nobel Prizes

Professor Kornberg has received these awards

All We Know Is Falling is the debut album of the band Paramore It was recorded in just three weeks In April 2006 the CD was released in the UK In 2005 a Japanese version was released with the bonus track O Star

Paramore released three videos from their debut album The first was for the single All We Know followed by Pressure and Emergency

A businessperson is someone who works at a job that focuses on making money Generally it is someone who works in the management of a company 

Businessperson is used more commonly than in the past in place of the words businessman or businesswoman to avoid sexism and stereotypes Sometimes the words businessman or businesswoman are used to point out a man or woman

Businessmen generally wear standard business clothes a suit with collar shirt and necktie However this changes depending on the company the local culture and the country In more casual places neckties can be left out 

Businesswomens clothes have gone through many changes Dresses and suits are common today

In geometry a tangent is a straight line that touches a curve at one point Where they touch each other the line and the curve are both going in the same direction For this reason the tangent is a good approximation to the curve near that point They are almost the same

The History of North America deals with an area where humans came to live relatively recently compared to Africa Europe and Asia 

Scientists have different theories as to the origins of the early human population of the North America The indigenous peoples of North America themselves have many creation stories that tell that native Americans have been present on the land since its creation A few of these scientists are Jan Kevin H Bautista Joseph Emmanuel A Padilla and Nigel O Hufana

Before contact with Europeans the natives of North America were divided into many different communities from small bands of a few families to large empires They lived in several culture areas which roughly correspond to geographic and biological zones of North America and give a good indication of the main occupation of the people who lived there Native groups can also be classified by their language family It is important to note that peoples with similar languages did not always share the same material culture nor were they always allies

Scientists believe that the Inuit people of the high Arctic came to North America much later than other native groups as evidenced by the disappearance of Dorset culture artifacts from the archaeological record and their replacement by the Thule people

During the thousands of years of native inhabitation on the continent cultures changed and shifted Archaeologists often name different cultural groups they discover after the site where they are first found One of the oldest cultures yet found is the Clovis culture of modern New Mexico A more recent example is the group of related cultures called the Mound builders found in the Mississippi river valley They flourished from 3000 BC to the 1500s AD

The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the domestication of many common crops now used around the world such as tomatoes and squash Perhaps most importantly they domesticated one of the worlds major staples maize

As a result of the development of agriculture in the south important cultural development was possible there For example the Maya civilization developed a writing system built huge pyramids had a complex calendar and developed the concept of zero 500 years before anyone in the Old World The Mayan culture was still present when the Spanish arrived in Central America but political dominance in the area had shifted to the Aztec Empire farther north

Upon the arrival of the Europeans in the New World native peoples found their culture changed drastically As such their affiliation with political and cultural groups changed as well several linguistic groups went extinct and others changed quite quickly The name and cultures that Europeans recorded for the natives were not necessarily the same as the ones they had used a few generations before or the ones in use today

There was limited contact between North American peoples and the outside world before 1492 Several theoretical contacts have been proposed but the earliest physical evidence comes to us from the Norse or Vikings Norse captain Leif Ericson is believed to have reached the Island of Newfoundland circa 1000 AD They named their new discovery Vinland The only Norse site yet discovered in North America is at LAnse aux Meadows Newfoundland and Labrador The Norse colonies were later abandoned

The Viking voyages did not become common knowledge in the Old World and Europeans remained ignorant of the existence of the Americas until 1492 As part of a general age of discovery Italian sailor Christopher Columbus proposed a voyage west from Europe to find a shorter route to Asia He eventually received the backing of Isabella I and Ferdinand II Queen and King of newly united Spain In 1492 Columbus reached land in the Bahamas 

Almost 500 years after the Norse John Cabot explored the east coast of what would become Canada in 1497 Giovanni da Verrazzano explored the East Coast of America from Florida to presumably Newfoundland in 1524 Jacques Cartier made a series of voyages on behalf of the French crown in 1534 and penetrated the St Lawrence River

Initially European activity consisted mostly of trade and exploration Eventually Europeans began to establish settlements The three principal colonial powers were Spain England and France although eventually even small powers like the Netherlands and Sweden received minor holdings on the continent 

Settlement by the Spanish started the European colonization of the Americas involving genocide of the native Indians They gained control of most of the largest islands in the Caribbean and conquered the Aztecs gaining control of present day Mexico and Central America This was the beginning of the Spanish Empire in the New World The first successful Spanish settlement in continental North America was Veracruz in 1519 followed by many other settlements in colonial New Spain and Spanish Florida

The first successful English settlements were at Jamestown and Plymouth in what are today Virginia and Massachusetts respectively The first French settlements were Port Royal and Quebec City in what is now Nova Scotia and Quebec The Fur Trade soon became the primary business on the continent and as a result transformed the Native Americans lifestyle

Farther to the south plantation slavery became the main industry of the West Indies and this gave rise to the beginning of the Atlantic slave trade

By 1663 the French crown had taken over control of New France from the fur trading companies and the English charter colonies gave way to more metropolitan control This ushered in a new era of more formalized colonialism in North America

Rivalry between the European powers created a series of wars on the North American landmass that would have great impact on the development of the colonies Territory often changed hands multiple times Peace was not achieved until French forces in North America were vanquished at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham at Quebec City and France ceded most of her claims outside of the Caribbean

Viceroyalty of New Spain was the name of the viceroy ruled territories of the Spanish Empire in Asia North America and its peripheries from 1535 to 1821

The coming of the American Revolution had a great impact across the continent Most importantly it directly led to the creation of the United States of America However the associated American Revolutionary War was an important war that touched all corners of the region The flight of the United Empire Loyalists led to the creation of English Canada as a separate community Meanwhile Spains hold on Mexico was weakening Independence was declared in 1810 by Miguel Hidalgo starting the Mexican War of Independence In 1813 Jos Mara Morelos and the Congress of Anhuac signed the Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America the first legal document where the separation of the New Spain with respect to Spain is proclaimed Spain finally recognized Mexicos independence in 1821

From the time of independence of the United States that country expanded rapidly to the west acquiring the massive Louisiana territory in 1803 An attempt at northern expansion was blocked by Britain during the War of 1812 At the same time British settlement in Canada increased  US expansion was complicated by the division between free and slave states which led to the Missouri Compromise 1820 Likewise Canada faced a division between French and English communities that led to the outbreak of civil strife in 1837 Mexico faced constant political tensions between liberals and conservatives as well as the rebellion of the English speaking region of Tejas which declared itself the Republic of Texas 1836 In 1845 Texas joined the United States which would later lead to the MexicanAmerican War As a result of conflict with Mexico the United States made further territorial gains in California and the Southwest

In Mexico the entire era was dominated by the dictatorship of Porfirio Daz

As a part of the British Empire Canada immediately was at war in 1914 Canada bore the brunt of several major battles during the early stages of the war including the use of poison gas attacks at Ypres Losses became grave and the government eventually brought in conscription despite the fact this was against the wishes of the majority of French Canadians In the ensuing Conscription Crisis of 1917 riots broke out on the streets of Montreal In neighboring Newfoundland the new dominion suffered a devastating loss on July 1 1916 the First day on the Somme

The United States stayed apart from the conflict until 1917 joining the Entente powers The United States was then able to play a crucial role at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 that shaped interwar Europe

Mexico was not part of the war as the country was embroiled in the Mexican Revolution at the time

The 1920s brought an age of great prosperity in the United States and to a lesser degree Canada But the Wall Street Crash of 1929 combined with drought ushered in a period of economic hardship in the United States and Canada

From 1936 to 1949 this was a popular uprising against the anti Catholic Mexican government of the time set off specifically by the anti clerical provisions of the Mexican Constitution of 1917

Once again Canada found herself at war before her neighbours however even Canadian contributions were slight before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor

The entry of the United States into the war helped to tip the balance in favour of the allies

Two Mexican tankers transporting oil to the United States were attacked and sunk by the Germans in the Gulf of Mexico waters in 1942 The incident happened in spite of Mexicos neutrality at that time This led Mexico to declare war to the Axis nations and entered the conflict

The destruction of Europe wrought by the war vaulted all North American countries to more important roles in world affairs The United States especially emerged as a superpower

The early Cold War era saw the United States as the most powerful nation in a Western coalition of which Mexico and Canada were also a part At home the United States witnessed convulsive change especially in the area of race relations In Canada this was mirrored by the Quiet Revolution and the emergence of Quebec nationalism

Mexico experienced an era of huge economic growth after World War II a heavy industrialization process and a growth of its middle class a period known in Mexican history as the El Milagro Mexicano

The Caribbean saw the beginnings of decolonization while on the largest island the Cuban Revolution introduced Cold War rivalries into Latin America

A creation myth or creation story explains how the universe started how the earth came to be and why there are humans Creation myths are usually part of religions and mythologies Very often creation myths say that humans were made by a god spirit or other supreme being 

In the beginning there was just water All the animals lived above it and the sky was overcrowded They were all curious about what was beneath the water and one day Dayunisi the water beetle volunteered to explore it He explored the surface but could not find any solid ground He explored below the surface to the bottom and all he found was mud which he brought back to the surface After collecting the mud it began to grow in size and spread outwards until it became the Earth as we know it 

In the beginning nothing existed darkness was all around Suddenly from the darkness camea thin disc one side yellow and the other side white appearing suspended in midair Within the disc sat a small bearded man Creator the One Who Lives Above When he looked into the endless darkness light appeared above He looked down and it became a sea of light To the east he created yellow streaks of dawn To the west tints of many colours appeared everywhere There were also clouds of different colors He also created three other gods a little girl a sun god and a small boy Then he created celestial phenomena the winds the tarantula and the earth from the sweat of the four gods mixed together in the Creators palms from a small round brown ball not much larger than a bean The world was expanded to its current size by the gods kicking the small brown ball Creator told Wind to go inside the ball and to blow it up The tarantula who knew what to do spun a black cord and attaching it to the ball crawled away fast to the east pulling on the cord with all his strength Tarantula repeated with a blue cord to the south a yellow cord to the west and a white cord to the north With mighty pulls in each direction the brown ball stretched to immeasurable size it became the earth No hills mountains or rivers were visible only smooth treeless brown plains appeared Then the Creator created the rest of the beings and features of the Earth

In the Judeo Christian Islamic story it is believed that an entity referred to as God created the universe in six days

Christian scientists that believe God created the earth are called Creation scientists They research to find proof of creation and that the universe was designed by God

Many cultures have stories describing the origin of the world which may be roughly grouped into common types In one type of story the world is born from a world egg such stories include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana In related stories the creation is caused by a single entity emanating or producing something by his or herself as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi Buddha the ancient Greek story of Gaia the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth the ancient Egyptian god Atum story or the Genesis creation myth In another type of story the world is created from the union of male and female deities as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa In other stories the Universe is created by crafting it from pre existing materials such as the corpse of a dead god as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology or from chaotic materials as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology In another type of story the world is created by the command of a divinity as in the ancient Egyptian story of Ptah or the Genesis creation myth as a part of Jewish and Christian mythology In other stories the universe emanates from fundamental principles such as Brahman and Prakrti or the yin and yang of the Tao

Although Heraclitus argued for eternal change his quasi contemporary Parmenides made the radical suggestion that all change is an illusion that the true underlying reality is eternally unchanging and of a single nature Parmenides denoted this reality as  Parmenides theory seemed implausible to many Greeks but his student Zeno of Elea challenged them with several famous paradoxes Aristotle resolved these paradoxes by developing the notion of an infinitely divisible continuum and applying it to space and time

The Indian philosopher Kanada founder of the Vaisheshika school developed a theory of atomism and proposed that light and heat were varieties of the same substance In the 5th century AD the Buddhist atomist philosopher Dignga proposed atoms to be point sized durationless and made of energy They denied the existence of substantial matter and proposed that movement consisted of momentary flashes of a stream of energy

The theory of temporal finitism was inspired by the doctrine of creation shared by the three Abrahamic religions Judaism Christianity and Islam The Christian philosopher John Philoponus presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past Philoponus arguments against an infinite past were used by the early Muslim philosopher Al Kindi the Jewish philosopher Saadia Gaon and the Muslim theologian Al Ghazali They employed two logical arguments against an infinite past the first being the argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite which states

The second argument the argument from the impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition states

Both arguments were adopted by later Christian philosophers and theologians and the second argument in particular became more famous after it was adopted by Immanuel Kant in his thesis of the first antinomy concerning time

Fakhr al Din al Razi criticized the idea of the Earths centrality within the universe In the context of his commentary on the Quranic verse All praise belongs to God Lord of the Worlds he raises the question of whether the term worlds in this verse refers to multiple worlds within this single universe or cosmos or to many other universes or a multiverse beyond this known universe He rejected the Aristotelian and Avicennian notions of a single universe revolving around a single world and instead argued that there are more than a thousand thousand worlds beyond this world such that each one of those worlds be bigger and more massive than this world as well as having the like of what this world has He argued that there exists an infinite outer space beyond the known world and that God has the power to fill the vacuum with an infinite number of universes

File formats are also known as file types A computer stores data in a computer file in the shape of a file format For example images are stored in a different shape than music files 

Also most types of data have many varieties of file formats all with their own special strengths and weaknesses

There are for example more than five ways to store text as a file Two of the most known ways are the plain txt format and the simplest of the HTML formats The difference is that a txt file can only store a sequence of characters but an HTML file can also store links to other files and the formatting of the text for example whether the text is bold underlined or italic

Often a file in a file which can store more information is bigger than a file in a format which can only store simple basic data But the file in the more functional format can be more difficult to use with more simple programs and a faster computer can be needed to use it

File formats made for commercial proprietary software are sometimes a secret so that people who do not work in the company which made the proprietary software cannot use their own and others files in the format without buying their software That action is called vendor lock in and can be used to make a monopoly Because of that it is sometimes a crime

Lascaux is the name given to a number of caves in southwestern France famous for their cave paintings The original caves are located near the village of Montignac in the Dordogne dpartement They contain some of the most well known Upper Paleolithic art These paintings are estimated to be 16000 years old They primarily consist of realistic images of large animals Many of these animals are known from fossil evidence to have lived in the area at the time Lascaux was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list in 1979

The caves were discovered in 1940 By 1955 about 1200 people visited them every day They were then closed and restored Replicas of the cave paintings were made in another cave nearby Today the original cave is no longer accessible to the public 

In 2000 another problem emerged Certain kinds of fungi started to grow in the original cave These are extremely resistant to the usual fungicides used even to formaldehyde The fungus lives in symbiosis with a bacterium which is capable of destroying the fungicide Therefore the fungicide needs to be combined with an antibiotic to kill the bacterium as well

As of 2006 the situation is more or less under control The original caves are now sprayed with the fungicideantibiotic every fortnight Special workers need to clear the cave walls by hand removing the mycelium which grows despite the treatment

Throughout the monththe moon goes through lunar phases A lunar phase is a transformation that the moon goes through Each lunar phase can be identified by the appearance of the moon and the time of the month

There are 8 total phases that the moon undergoes At first the moon is invisible because it is a new moon This starts out the cycle The moon however soons shows itself after a couple of days The next phase is a Waxing Cresent After that the moon comes out of the darkness and becomes a half moon The next step is a gibbous which is about 34 or 75 of the moon showing The last waxing phase is the full complete moon When that is all done the moon shrinks and every phase listed is repeated again except the moon is getting smaller as opposed to larger Finally it restarts the cycle again 

These changes happen because the moon revolves or moves slowly around the moon When the moon is shown as a cresenthalf moonetc it is because the 2 different hemispheres of Earth are looking at different illuminated parts of the moon So astronomersin the Northern Hemisphere may see a Waxing Gibbous but people in the Southern Hemisphere will look up and probably see a Waxing Crescent

The history of Asia can be seen as the history of several distinct regions East Asia South Asia and the Middle East that have more or less context depending of the situation in the central Eurasian steppe

The coastal periphery was the home to some of the worlds earliest known civilizations with each of the three regions developing early civilizations around fertile river valleys The civilizations in Mesopotamia the Indus Valley and China had much in common Therefore it is likely that they exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel Other aspects such as that of writing developed individually in each area Cities states and then empires developed in these lowlands

The steppe region had long been inhabited by nomads and from the central steppes they could reach all areas of the Asian continent The earliest known expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo Europeans which spread their languages into the Middle East India and in the Tocharians to the borders of China The northern part of the continent was not accessible to the steppe nomads due to the dense forests and the tundra These areas were very broken wikt linksparselysparsely populated

The centre and periphery were kept separate by mountains and deserts The Caucasus Himalaya Karakum Desert and Gobi Desert formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could only cross with difficulty The city dwellers were more advanced in civilisation but they could do little militarily to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe Because the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force the nomads who conquered states in China India and the Middle East were soon forced to adapt to the local societies 

Alexander the Great conquered an area from Turkey to India in the 4th century BC The Roman Empire would later control parts of western Asia The Achaemenid Seleucid Parthian and Sassanian empires were based in Ancient Persia Many ancient civilizations were influenced by the Silk Road which connected China India the Middle East and Europe The religions of Hinduism and Buddhism which began in India were an important influence on South and East Asia 

The Islamic caliphate and other Islamic states took over the Middle East starting in the 7th century and later expanded into India and Indonesia The Crusades would be fought from the 12th century in Christian Europes attempt to retake the Holy Land from the Muslims The Mongol Empire conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century an area extending from China to Europe 

The Russian Empire began to expand into Asia from the 17th century eventually taking control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century The Ottoman Empire controlled Turkey and the Middle East from the 16th century onwards In the 17th century the Manchu conquered China and established the Qing Dynasty although this was in decline by the nineteenth century and had been overthrown in 1912 

Several European powers had control of other parts of Asia by the 1900s such as British India French Indochina and Portuguese Macau and Goa Russia and Britain struggled for power in the Central Asian region in the nineteenth century The Trans Siberian Railway that crossed Asia by train was complete by 1916 Parts of Asia remained free from European control although not influence such as Persia Thailand and most of China In the twentieth century Imperial Japan expanded into China Korea and Southeast Asia during the Second World War After the war many Asian countries became independent from European powers During the Cold War the northern parts of Asia were communist controlled with the Soviet Union and Peoples Republic of China while western allies formed pacts such as CENTO and SEATO Conflicts such as the Korean War Vietnam War and Soviet invasion of Afghanistan were fought between communists and anti communists In the decades after the Second World War a massive restructuring plan drove Japan to become the worlds second largest economy a phenomenon known as the Japanese post war economic miracle The Arab Israeli conflict has dominated much of the recent history of the Middle East After the Soviet Unions collapse in 1991 there were many new independent nations in Central Asia

Phelps has been the McVickar Professor of Political Economy at Columbia University since 1982 He is also the director of Columbias Center on Capitalism and Society

His Nobel Prize award was announced on 9 October 2006 He received the award on his own breaking the recent pattern of awarding the prize to two or more winners at the same time

Edmund Phelps was born in 1933 near Chicago but he grew up and went to school in Hastings on Hudson New York where his family had moved when he was six years old In 1951 he went to Amherst College as an undergraduate student At his fathers advice Phelps took his first economics course in his second year at Amherst His economics teacher was James Nelson and his studies were based on a famous textbook by Paul Samuelson Phelps was very interested in studying business He knew of important unsolved problems and had new ideas such as the gap between microeconomics and macroeconomics

After receiving his BA at Amherst in 1955 Phelps went to Yale University for graduate studies There his professors were some of the greatest economists such as Nobel prize winners James Tobin and Thomas Schelling and he studied with Arthur Okun William Fellner and Henry Wallich were very important in his study courses Phelps received his PhD from Yale in 1959 The work for his PhD was based on an idea by Tobin that peoples need in an emergency has more effect than sudden price changes

After receiving his PhD Phelps went to work as an economist for the RAND Corporation His main interest was macroeconomics but RAND focused on defense work so Phelps decided to return to the his studies the next year 1960 He took a research job at the Cowles Foundation and a teaching job at Yale At the Cowles Foundation his research was mainly on future prices and wages following the work of Robert Solow As part of this research Phelps published in 1961 a famous paper on the golden rule savings rate one of his most important works for economic science He also wrote papers about other economic theories such as monetary economics and its importance when producing the best economic growth

Work at the Cowles Foundation gave Phelps the chance to meet with other important economists who were working on growth theory such as David Cass and Nobel Prize winner Tjalling Koopmans Also during the academic year of 1962 63 Phelps visited MIT where he met with Nobel prize winners Paul Samuelson Robert Solow and Franco Modigliani

In 1966 Phelps left Yale and moved to University of Pennsylvania where he was offered a permanent job as professor of economics While at Pennsylvania most of Phelps research was on the links between employment wages and inflation He wrote about this in 1968 Money Wage Dynamics and Labor Market Equilibrium This research had important new ideas about the Phillips curve It was the first idea of the natural rate of unemployment and said that inflation rates did not affect labour market In January 1969 Phelps held a meeting at Pennsylvania University to support the research on inflation and employment The story of the meeting was published the next year in a book which was very important and is known as the Phelps volume During this time Phelps worked with other economists on research of economic growth the effects of monetary and broken wikt linkfiscalfiscal policy and best population growth

In the year 1969 1970 Professor Phelps worked for the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Science at Stanford University Meeting with Nobel prize winners Amartya Sen and Kenneth Arrow and reading the work of John Rawls whom he met during that year gave Professor Phelps an interest to research outside of macroeconomics In 1972 he published research he named statistical discrimination He also published research on economic justice using ideas from Rawls book A Theory of Justice

In 1971 Phelps moved to the Economics Department at Columbia University where Nobel prize winners William Vickrey and James J Heckman were studying Nobel Prize winner Robert Mundell joined three years later as well as Phoebus Dhrymes Guillermo Calvo and John B Taylor Professor Phelps published research on the inflation tax and the effects of fiscal policy on inflation In 1972 Phelps published a book about his new theory The book had many ideas about the effects of being unemployed for a long time and made him more popular

In the next years Keynesian economics were thought of as less important after the publication of John Muths work called rational expectations Phelps with Calvo and John Taylor started a programme to rebuild Keynesian economics with new ideas about prices and wages being kept the same for certain time Professor Phelps and John Taylor published research in 1977 about how to calculate wages During the 70s Phelps and Calvo worked on research for making contracts using asymmetric information

In the late 70s Professor Phelps researched with Roman Frydman who was taught by Phelps They worked on rational expectations and showed problems in it A book was published in 1983 about what people said at a big meeting they had to talk about rational expectations in 1981 This book was not thought of as very important

In 1982 Phelps was made the McVickar Professor of Political Economy at Columbia During the early 80s he wrote a textbook about economics knowledge The book Political Economy was published in 1985 but was not used in a lot of schools

In the 1980s Professor Phelps worked with European universities and institutions such as Banca dItalia and Observatoire Franais des Conjonctures conomiques He became interested in the continuing high unemployment in Europe and published some work about it with Jean Paul Fitoussi During the next years Professor Phelps worked to calculate the natural rate of unemployment He published some of his research in a 1994 book Phelps also worked with Luigi Paganetto at the University of Rome Tor Vergata and between 1988 98 they held the Villa Mondragone International Seminar

In 1990 Phelps took part in a mission from the EBRD to Moscow where he and Kenneth Arrow worked on the reform of the USSR He became a member of the EBRDs Economic Advisory Board and stayed there until 1993 Professor Phelps became interested in the Eastern European transition economies while there

In its announcement the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Phelps work had deepened our understanding of the relation between short run and long run effects of economic policy

George Mason University Professor Tyler Cowen wrote in the Marginal Revolution blog that his main contribution is a better understanding of the Phillips curve and the dynamics of short run unemployment and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment Cowen also wrote that his 1960s macro work was true important and extremely influential The capital theory work endures and provides a foundation for subsequent theory The overall scope is impressive and Phelpss concerns never strayed far from the real world Cowen by writing that the award to Phelps meant The big questions still matter Unemployment economic growth labor markets capital accumulation fairness discrimination and justice across the generations are indeed worthy of economic attention

Professor Cowen and Berkeleys Professor Brad DeLong both said the choice of Phelps was a good noe and Harvard Professor Gregory Mankiw said it was a wonderful choice

Nanotechnology is a part of science and technology about the control of matter on the atomic and molecular scale  this means things that are about 100 nanometers or smaller Nanotechnology includes making products that use parts this small such as electronic devices catalysts and sensors etc Nanotechnology is defined as the study of structures between 1 nanometer and 100 nanometers in size To give you an idea of how small that is there are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 milesFileNanostructure geometriesjpgthumbTypical nanostructure geometries

Nanotechnology brings together scientists and engineers from many different subjects such as applied physics materials science interface and colloid science device physics chemistry supramolecular chemistry self replicating machines and robotics chemical engineering mechanical engineering biology biological engineering and electrical engineering

Generally when people talk about nanotechnology they mean structures of the size 100 nanometers or smaller There are one million nanometers in a millimeter Nanotechnology tries to make materials or machines of that size

People are doing many different types of work in the field of nanotechnology Most current work looks at making nanoparticles that have special properties such as the way they scatter light absorb X rays transport electrical currents or heat etc etc At the more science fiction end of the field are attempts to make small copies of bigger machines or really new ideas for structures that make themselves New materials are possible with nano size structures It is even possible to work with single atoms

There has been a lot of discussion about the future of nanotechnology and its dangers Nanotechnology may be able to invent new materials and instruments which would be very useful such as in medicine computers and making clean electricity On the other hand nanotechnology is new and there could be unknown problems For example if the materials are bad for peoples health or for nature They may have a bad effect on the economy or even big natural systems like the Earth itself Some groups argue that there should be rules about the use of nanotechnology

The first use of the ideas in nano technology was in Theres Plenty of Room at the Bottom a talk given by the scientist Richard Feynman at an American Physical Society meeting at Caltech on December 29 1959 Feynman described a way to move individual atoms and molecules using very small apparatus to build and operate even smaller instruments and so on down to the needed scale In the course of this he noted sometimes problems will appear because of the changes in scale The weight of things under study would become less important but for example surface tension and Van der Waals force would become more important

Feynmans simple idea seemed possible The word nanotechnology was explained by Tokyo Science University Professor Norio Taniguchi in a 1974 paper He said that nanotechnology was the work of changing materials by one atom or by one molecule In the 1980s this idea was studied by Dr K Eric Drexler who spoke and wrote about how important nano scale events and things are Engines of Creation The Coming Era of Nanotechnology is thought to be the first book on nanotechnology Nanotechnology and nanoscience got started in the early 1980s with two key developments the start of cluster science and the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope Soon afterwards new molecules made of carbon were discovered  first fullerenes in 1986 and carbon nanotubes a few years later In another development people studied how to make semiconductor nanocrystals Many metal oxide nanoparticles are now used as quantum dots In 2000 the United States National Nanotechnology Initiative was begun to help develop the science in America

One nanometer is one billionth or 10 9 of a meter When two carbon atoms join together to make a molecule the distance between them is in the range of 012 015 nm and a DNA double helix is about 2nm from one side to the other On the other hand the smallest living thing with a cell is a bacterium about 200mm long at the other hand 

To understand the scale better think about the difference between a nanometer and a meter It is the same size difference as a golf ball and the Earth Or another way of putting it a nanometer is the amount that a hair on a mans face grows in the time it takes him to lift his hand to shave Nails also grow one nanometer per second

There are two common approaches in the field of nanotechnology In the bottom up idea materials and instruments are built from molecules which join together because of their chemistry In the top  down idea nano objects are made out of bigger things without trying to move parts of them at the level of atoms

Some of the laws of physics become more obvious as the system gets smaller For example the effects of very small movements as well as quantum mechanical effects like the quantum size effect where electrons in solids move differently for very small sizes of particle This effect does not come into play by going from macro to micro sizes However it becomes the most important thing when working in the nanometer size range A number of physical properties also change when a macroscopic system becomes a microscopic one One example is the increase in amount of surface area for the volume inside it This changes how heat and chemicals interact with the material The new types of interaction in nanosystems are of interest in nanomechanics research Nanomaterials can be catalysts ie they help chemical reactions happen more easily This can be very useful for the chemical industry to reduce energy use and production of expensive or toxic by products but care has to be taken to avoid catalyzing unwanted reactions such as in their interaction with biomaterials

Materials made very small can show different properties which we do not see on a macroscale this makes some completely new inventions possible For example substances which usually stop light become transparent it becomes possible to burn some materials solids turn into liquids at room temperature insulators become conductors A material such as gold which does not react with other chemicals at normal scales can be a powerful chemical catalyst at nanoscales These special properties which we can only see at the nano scale are one of the most interesting things about nanotechnology

Modern scientists can now make small molecules with almost any structure These techniques are used today to make a wide variety of useful chemicals such as medicines or polymers This ability lets us ask questions about using this kind of method at a larger level to try to put these single molecules together into structures containing many molecules organized into a system

This idea uses molecules that move themselves or organize themselves into some useful structure like building blocks Here it is very important for molecules to find exactly the other molecules that they should connect with Molecules can be designed so that a certain structure is more likely to appear because of the forces between the molecules The Watson Crick basepairing rules are a way of doing this so is the way a lot of enzymes work or the structures that proteins make In this way two or more parts of a structure can be designed to find each other and work together to make a bigger and more useful system 

Such techniques should be able to make a lot of small structures at the same time and much cheaper than top down methods but it may be difficult for them to design bigger and more complicated structures Most useful structures need a lot of atoms organized into a structure that has a small probability of making itself But there are many examples of these structures in biology especially Watson Crick basepairing and enzyme interactions The interesting job for nanotechnologists is to use the same techniques to make new systems which do not happen in nature

Arias started on his political career in the 1970s

In January of 2005 Arias was selected as the candidate for the National Liberation party and he was reelected for president of Costa Rica from 2006 2010 There was a lot of polemic and criticism for his support towards the TLC process in Costa Rica but because of his political background and determination most Costa Ricans still trust and respect Arias and his decisions for the well being of the country

He is also a recipient of the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism and a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security

Universal History World History or Global History examines history from a global perspective 

It looks for common patterns that one can find across all cultures Universal historians use a thematic approach That means they look at history from two viewpoints On the one hand they look at processes of world history that have drawn people of the world together on the other hand they want to find out how patterns of world history reveal the diversity of the human experience

The study of universal or global history is in some ways a product of the current period of accelerated globalization This period has two tendencies it integrates various cultures and it shows their differences when people of different cultures and civilizations have to live with each other 

To discuss the history of the world in a unified framework is not that new For example it was a genre popular in the 19th century and with Christian historians going back to at least the 4th century 

A brewery is a building where beer is made or a business whose trade is the production and sale of beer 

Breweries can take up several city blocks or be a collection of equipment in a homebrewers kitchen The diversity of size in breweries is matched by the diversity of processes degrees of automation and kinds of beer produced in breweries Typically a brewery is divided into distinct sections with each section reserved for one part of the brewing process 

The oldest brewery in the world still in operation is believed to be the Bavarian State owned brewery Weihenstephan found in the German city of Freising which can trace its history back to 1040 Although the Zatec brewery in the Czech Republic claims it can prove paying beer tax in 1004 

Butane is an alkane Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons Usually Butane is a flammable gas it burns very well 

Butane is sold in canisters for cooking and camping It is also used as fuel in cigarette lighters and as propellant in aerosol sprays or deodorants Some kinds of Butane are used in refrigerators 

Mixtures with Propane are known as LPG

Butane is dangerous Inhalation can lead to death by asphyxiation Contact with the skin can lead to frostbite If the liquid comes in contact with the air it will explode 

Liquefied petroleum gas is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases It is commonly used in the household for example for cooking or as fuel for heating LPG is replacing Chlorofluorocarbons more and more also because it is less harmful to the ozone layer

Very often mixes of propane and butane are sold

Aerosol spray is system used in certain containers like spray cans The contents of the can like color or deodorant are pressurized The can has a valve When this valve is opened the liquid is forced out It will emerge as an aerosol or mist Apart from the liquid there is another substance in the container usually called propellant When the valve is opened some propellant will be forced inside the container That way the pressure in the container is kept constant

He was awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Andrew Fire for the discovery of RNA interference Mello has been a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator since 2000

Mello was born in New Haven Connecticut on October 18 1960 He was the third child of James and Sally Mello His father James Mello was a paleontologist and his mother Sally Mello was an artist His fathers parents moved to the US from the Portuguese islands of Azores His parents met while at the Brown University and were the first children in their families to go to college His grandparents on both sides finished school as teenagers to work for their families James Mello was awarded his PhD in paleontology from Yale University in 1962 The Mello family moved to Falls Church in northern Virginia so that James could take a job with the United States Geological Survey in Washington DC 

After a short time in Falls Church the family moved to Fairfax Virginia when James Mello began work as Assistant Director at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History Some of his happiest early memories were holidays with his whole family in Colorado Wyoming and more often to the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia 

The Mello family enjoyed long talks at the dinner table and this was very important to young Craig Mello He learned to argue to listen and to accept if he was wrong about something At a time when young Mello was not doing well in school his family helped him build his confidence and broken wikt linkself esteemself esteem Mellos first few years of grade school were difficult He was five years old when he started first grade in a local private school He was too young to enter first grade in the public system He does not know if he was a slow learner or just not interested but he did not do well in school until the seventh grade In second grade Mello only pretended that he could read and he was embarrassed of being talked to by the teacher He enjoyed playing outdoors in the woods and creeks more than time spent in the classroom At this time his older siblings were great students so his teachers wanted him to do well During these early years Mello had no doubt that he would be a scientist when he grew up

Mello went to Fairfax High School He took all of the science courses except advanced physics Mellos favorite teachers were of earth science chemistry and biology

After he was awarded his high school diploma Mello went to Brown University Mello studied biochemistry and molecular biology for his first years at Brown University Some of his teachers at Brown University were Frank Rothman Ken Miller Susan Gerbi and Nelson Fausto He was awarded his BS from Brown University in 1982 

After finishing his studies at Brown Mello went to Boulder Colorado for more studies He took courses in molecular cellular and developmental biology Some of his teachers were called David Hirsh Dick McIntosh Mike Yarus Larry Gold and Bill Wood Mello joined David Hirshs lab in 1982 Davids lab was filled with people such as Dan Stinchcomb who taught Professor Mello about molecular biology These people were important to train Professor Mello for the future 

During Professor Mellos first year in Boulder David Hirsh decided to take a position in industry Because of this Mello moved to Harvard University where he could research with Dan Stinchcomb who was starting an wiktindependent lab

Mello enjoyed his time at Harvard He worked on his project and worked long hours in the lab He was able to visit lectures about many subjects He was awarded his PhD from Harvard in 1990 He was a broken wikt linkpostdoctoralpostdoctoral fellow at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in the laboratory of Dr James Priess

In 2006 Professor Mello and Andrew Z Fire were awarded the Nobel Prize for work that began in 1998 when Mello and Fire along with their colleagues published research work in the journal Nature The research was about tiny pieces of RNA causing the cell into destroy the genes Messenger RNA before it can produce a protein  stopping certain genes from working 

In the yearly Howard Hughes Medical Institute Scientific Meeting held on November 13 2006 in Ashburn Virginia Professor Mello talked about the phone call that he received telling him he had won the Nobel Prize He said it was after 430 am and he had just checked his daughter was sleeping He returned to his bedroom and he got a phone call that his wife told him not to answer as it was a broken wikt linkcrank callcrank call His wife told him the phone had rung while he was out of the room and someone was making a bad joke on them by saying that he had won the Nobel prize When he told her that this was the day that Nobel prize winners were contacted he said her jaw dropped He answered the phone and the voice on the other end told him to get dressed and that in half an hour his life was about to change

Swedens Karolinska Institute chooses the Nobel Prize winners for Physiology and Medicine They said This years Nobel Laureates have discovered a fundamental mechanism for controlling the flow of genetic information

Mello and Fires research at the Carnegie Institution for Science and the University of Massachusetts Medical School had shown that RNA is very important in gene control Professor Nick Hastie director of the Medical Research Councils Human Genetics Unit said It is very unusual for a piece of work to completely revolutionize the whole way we think about biological processes and regulation but this has opened up a whole new field in biology

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was an Indian guru He was most famous for his development of Transcendental Meditation He also was known for his association with the rock bands The Beatles and The Beach Boys

His birth name was either Mahesh Verma Shrivastava or Mahesh Prasad Varma His parents were Hindus from the Kshatriya caste He was born in Raipur India He graduated from Allahabad University in Uttar Pradesh and began his career as a physicist His physics work made him interested in the sound vibrations made by spoken syllables and how those vibrations could change a persons body or consciousness In time he became a disciple of Swami Brahmananda Saraswati who was called Guru Dev He later became the swamis secretary He could not become the swamis broken wikt linksuccessorsuccessor because of Indias caste system but he could become a guru on his own Guru Dev gave him the name Bal Brahmachari Mahesh Later he adopted the name Maharishi while yogi was a name given to teachers of yoga

Transcendental Meditation grew out of Guru Devs teachings and the Maharishis own physics studies A person practices Transcendental Meditation by sitting quietly and mentally repeating a broken wikt linkmantramantra of syllables or names considered broken wikt linksacredsacred or holy in Hinduism In Transcendental Meditation the sounds are used purely as sounds independent of any associated meanings in any languageMeditating helps a person to relax and to concentrate on important things During this meditation a person transcends conscious thought to a quieter state of mind and this gives the technique its name

The Maharishi began what he called the Spiritual broken wikt linkRegenerationRegeneration Movement in 1958 He traveled around the world teaching Transcendental Meditation to ordinary people Unlike many gurus he did not require followers to give up their everyday lives or move to an broken wikt linkashramashram to live and study He believed that helping people to relieve stress and learn how to focus would improve their lives and in time make a better world He taught for nearly ten years with little public notice He also published a book The Science of Being and the Art of Living and recorded a spoken word album that explained his beliefs

During 1967 during the last months of his ten year world tour he visited England and people there began to join his Spiritual Regeneration Movement One person who joined was Pattie Boyd the wife of George Harrison who was a member of The Beatles Harrison had learned to play the sitar an Indian musical instrument and was interested in Hinduism He had not found a guru whose teachings interested him When Pattie told him about the Maharishi he became interested and all four Beatles went to a lecture given by the Maharishi They sent a message to him asking to meet in person All of the Beatles were interested in TM because it was simple and they could continue on as musicians instead of having to change their lifestyle They each joined the movement and began to promote the Maharishi and his teachings They even announced that they gave up the use of drugs which had earlier caused broken wikt linkscandalscandal for the band because of what they learned

Brian Epstein manager of the Beatles was also interested in TM but had many problems in his personal life He decided not to join the Beatles when they traveled to Wales to attend a weekend class given by the Maharishi and stayed home Later that weekend Epstein overdosed on sleeping pills and died in his sleep The Beatles were very hurt by the news and worried about what would happen to their careers Maharishi tried to comfort them telling them to think happy thoughts about Epstein and let his spirit find peace

The Beatles wanted to study with the Maharishi in India They had just started their own company Apple Corps and with Epstein gone they had to work out many details for themselves They could have found another manager but decided they did not want one and looked after Apple personally until their helpers could take over running the company Finally in early 1968 they made the trip to India

The Beatles enjoyed the atmosphere in India and the free time they had between classes and began to write songs for a new album which was later called the White Album One by one the Beatles lost interest Ringo Starr who had a sensitive stomach became sick from the spicy food served at the ashram and headed home after just a few days Paul McCartney in time became bored and also headed home George Harrison and John Lennon stayed longer but were upset when Magic Alex a friend who came to India with them began to tell them stories about the Maharishi trying to have sexual intercourse with some of the women who came to the ashram This broken wikt linkdisillusiondisillusioned Harrison and Lennon and they went home the next day

The Beatles were earlier interested in making a movie about the Maharishi and his work When they began to talk with him about it he surprised them by knowing more about business matters than they ever expected and by asking questions about his share of the movies profits They did not think a holy man would be interested in such things Between this and Magic Alexs stories the band decided the Maharishi was a broken wikt linkphonyphony They publicly broken wikt linkdenouncedenounced him telling the media they thought he was something other than what he proved to be Lennon wrote a song about him whose words went Maharishi what have you done You made a fool of everyone He later changed the name Maharishi to Sexy Sadie to keep the Maharishi from seeking revenge of some kind or a lawsuit against him

Years later the Beatles realized Magic Alexs broken wikt linkaccusationaccusations were false McCartney and Harrison began again to say good things about the Maharishi and to promote his work Starr called him one of the broken wikt linkwise manwise men I met in my life Lennon never forgave Maharishi for letting him down personally but still used TM from time to time Lennon realized that he had been looking for a broken wikt linkfather figurefather figure and that any father figure he found was going to let him down in the end so he was better off to work out his own problems

The Beatles were not the only celebrities to get involved with the Maharishi and his work Actress Mia Farrow folk rocker Donovan and Mike Love of the Beach Boys also studied with the Maharishi in India and the Beach Boys later promoted TM much more than the Beatles ever had They toured together with the Maharishi and Mike Love insisted people who worked for them meditate daily The association did not work well for the Beach Boys and an album they recorded at a school started by the Maharishi sold poorly In time most of the Beach Boys lost interest but Love continued to promote the Maharishi and his works

Magician Doug Henning also became a follower of Transcendental Meditation He campaigned to open a theme park called Vedaland based on Hinduism and the Maharishis teachings after his death Doug Hennings widow continued the campaign

Scientists studied people who meditated and learned that TM really did help them to relax and to think more clearly A few broken wikt linkevangelicalevangelical Christian ministers and writers denounced TM calling it a broken wikt linkbackdoorbackdoor into Eastern religions and said that mantras were really a way of invoking the Devil or demons Other Christians saw no harm in it or encouraged people who wanted to meditate to instead chant the name of Jesus Christ or a name for God or a line from a psalm or Christian prayer In any case TM went on to help many people around the world and it is still taught as a form of meditation

For other types of keyboards please see Keyboard

 A computer keyboard is an important device that allows a person to enter symbols like letters and numbers into a computer It is the main input device for most computers

There are different types of keyboards The most popular type is the QWERTY design which is based on typewriter keyboards The QWERTY design was made so the most frequently used letters would not jam a mechanical typerwriter or typesetting machine Now there are no more typewriters but the design stayed because people were used to it QWERTY is the first 6 letters on the upper row of letters on the keyboard An ergonomic keyboard is made to be easier for people to use without hurting their hands or arms The keyboard can type letters numbers and punctuation and also lets you control the computer using special keys like the START button and the arrow keys A Dvorak keyboard is an alternative layout

Keystroke logging is capturing a record of each key that is pressed Keystroke logging can be used to measure employee activity Hackers can also use keystroke logging Scientists discovered that most keyboards give off electromagnetic radiation that can be used to tell which keys have been pressed Spies could determine what has been typed by remotely sensing such signals

Researchers are studying if keyboards can spread diseases Some keyboards were found to contain five times more germs than a toilet seat

The term rhythm guitar refers to the style of playing a guitar by broken wikt linkstrumstrumming chords and sometimes playing repeated broken wikt linkriffriffs instead of using the guitar to play melody lines or solos Rhythm guitarists add to the sound of a band whether they play rock and roll or other kinds of music

John Lennon of The Beatles usually played rhythm guitar for the band with George Harrison playing lead guitar However Lennon sometimes played keyboards and once in a while took the lead guitar role as he did in the songs You Cant Do That and Get Back

Sheet music for rhythm guitar is usually written above the classical notes It is written in Guitar chord format

The Book of Revelation which is sometimes called Revelation to John Apocalypse of John or Revelation of Jesus Christ is the last book of the New Testament in the Bible

The last book of the New Testament is usually called the Book of Revelation or simply Revelation Some of the earliest manuscripts have the title of The Revelation of John Later manuscripts usually have the title of The Revelation of the Theologian This is why the Authorized King James Version calls Revelation the Revelation of Saint John the Divine divine was a seventeenth century word for theologian

The book is usually called Revelation The title found on some of the earliest manuscripts is The Apocalypse of John and the most common title found on later manuscripts is The Apocalypse of the theologian In Greek the word apocalypse means revealing or unveiling

Some people consider Revelation to be the most difficult book in the Bible Over the course of the book the author has two visions There are many different ways to interpret these visions and there have been many arguments over which way is right

There is some disagreement over whether the John who wrote the letters of John the John who wrote The Gospel of John and the John who wrote the Book of Revelation are the same person The person writing Revelation called himself John He also wrote that he was on Patmos when he saw his first vision

The term keyboard could mean

Theodor Fontane was a German novelist and poet regarded by many to be the most important 19th century German language realist writer 

Fontane was born in Neuruppin into a Huguenot family At the age of sixteen he became apprentice in a phamacy and then a pharmacist himselfIn 1839 at the age of 20 wrote his first work His first published work the novella Geschwisterliebe appeared in the Berlin Figaro in December 1839 

His first job as apothecary was in Dresden after which he returned to his fathers shop now in the provincial town of Letschin in the Oderbruch region In this time Fontane published articles in the Leipzig newspaper Die Eisenbahn and translated Shakespeare In 1843 he joined a literary club called Tunnel ber der Spree in Berlin where he came into contact with many of the most important German writers such as Theodor Storm Joseph von Eichendorff and Gottfried Keller

In 1844 Fontane enrolled in the Prussian army and set out on the first of many journeys to England There he learned about old English ballads Soon afterwards he wrote ballads himself At that time he became engaged to his future wife Emilie Rouanet Kummer whom he had first met when still at school 

He was  very short  enganged in the revolutionary events of the revolution of 1848 In 1849 he quit his job as an apothecary and became a full time journalist and writer In order to support his family he took a job as a writer for the Prussian intelligence agency Centralstelle fr Preangelegenheiten which was meant to influence the press towards a German national cause Again he specialised in British affairs and the agency sent him as correspondent to London for a couple of years His wife and two sons followed him there While still in London he quit his government job and on his return to Berlin became editor of the conservative Kreuzzeitung

His books about Britain include Ein Sommer in London Aus England Studien und Briefe and Jenseits des Tweed Bilder und Briefe aus Schottland At the period and following the fashion of Walter Scott traditional British stories were still en vogue on the continent His Gedichte and ballads Mnner und Helden tell of Britains glories in days gone by 

Back in Germany Fontane became particularly interested in the Mark Brandenburg region He was especially proud of its past achievements and delighted in the growth of its capital city Berlin His fascination with the countryside surrounding Berlin may be seen in his delightfully picturesque Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg

In 1870 he quit his job at the Kreuzzeitung and became theater critic for the liberal Vossische Zeitung This job he kept until retirement He had already written about Prussias war against Denmark and the Austro Prussian War Then he went to write about the Franco Prussian War in 1870 and was taken prisoner He remained in French captivity for three months His experiences there are set down in Kriegsgefangen Erlebtes 1870 subsequently he published his observations on the campaign in Der Krieg gegen Frankreich 1870 71

At the ripe age of 57 Fontane finally took to what he would be remembered for the novel His fine historical novel Vor dem Sturm was followed by a series of novels of modern life notably LAdultera a book about adultery which was considered so risqu that it took Fontane two years to find a publisher In his novels Frau Jenny Treibel Irrungen Wirrungen and Effi Briest he found his very own tone he wrote about insights into the lives of the nobility as well as the common man his achievement there was later described as poetic realism In Der Stechlin his last finished novel Fontane adapted the realistic methods and social criticism of contemporary French fiction to the conditions of Prussian life

See Thomas Manns 1910 essay The Old Fontane in Essays of Three Decades Very fine

In astronomy the argument of perihelion is a way of talking about the orbit of a planet asteroid or comet It is also known as the argument of periapsis or the argument of perifocus To save time the argument of perihelion is referred to as It is defined as the angle between the periapsis and the ascending node Periapsis is the point when the orbiting object comes the closest to the thing it is orbitting around For example the moon is at periapsis when it is closest to the Earth Sometimes words like perihelion perigee or periastron might be used instead of periapsis but the meaning is the same The ascending node is one of two places where an orbitting object passes through the reference plane an imaginary flat surface which runs through the object being orbitted around The size of the angle depends on which way the object is orbiting

Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God is famous sermon that was preached by Jonathan Edwards in 1741 He was an important Calvinist Congregational minister The sermon is often used in American high schools and college English classes as an example of the Puritan writings

Edwards taught the sermon many times The first time was in Northampton Massachusetts but it did not get much attention But on the second time in Enfield Connecticut it made many people weep swoon cry out and have convulsions

Deuteronomy 3235 says Their foot shall slide in due time That verse was the main focus of the beginning of the sermon As was normal in 18th century New England the sermon was printed and many copies were made It has proven to be the main reason of his theology and preaching that was taught by many people in the first Great Awakening

The Grameen Bank was started 1976 when Professor Muhammad Yunus a Fulbright scholar and Professor at University of Chittagong researched how to provide banking for the rural poor In October 1983 the Grameen Bank Project was made into an independent bank by the government The group and its first member Muhammad Yunus were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006

Some people have said the banks prices are too expensive and put people in a debt trap Some have also said that the bank would not work if people did not give donations At the same time it is often seen as a success story in microfinance and as the guide for other groups around the world

Muhammad Yunus the banks first member earned a PhD in economics from Vanderbilt University in the United States During the Bangladesh famine of 1974 he gave a small loan of USD 27 to a group of 42 families so that they could make small items and sell them without owing too much money Yunus believed that a lot less people would be poor around Bangladesh if they could find small loans

The Grameen Bank is the product of Yunus ideas The bank began as a research project by Yunus and the Rural Economics Project at Bangladeshs University of Chittagong They gave out some small loans and waited to know what would happen In 1976 the village of Jobra and other villages surrounding the University of Chittagong became the first places where Grameen Bank loaned money to people The Bank was very successful and with support from the main Bangladesh Bank gave loans for the Tangail District The banks success continued and it soon gave loans in many areas of Bangladesh On 2 October 1983 the project was made into an independent bank by the Bangladeshi government Bankers from ShoreBank a community development bank in Chicago helped Yunus by making Grameen Bank a part of Shorebank with money from the Ford Foundation After the 1998 flood of Bangladesh many people could not pay their debts to Grameen for a few years By the beginning of 2005 the bank had loaned over USD 47 billion to poor people 

Grameen Bank now loans money to poor people all over India By 2006 India had over 2100 Grameen Bank branches Its success has inspired similar projects in more than 40 countries around the world and has made World Bank to take an initiative to finance Grameen type schemes

The bank gets help with money In the mid 1990s the bank started getting most of its funding from the central bank of Bangladesh More recently Grameen has been borrowing money The Government of Bangladesh guarantees that money borrowed by the Grameen Bank will be repaid

 Grameen Bank is best known for solidarity lending  The Bank also incorporates a set of values embodied in Bangladesh by the Sixteen Decisions At every branch of Grameen Bank the borrowers recite these Decisions and vow to follow them

There is solidarity lending in over 43 countries Each borrower must belong to a five member group the group does not need to give a guarantee for a loan The loan is made to only one person but the whole group is to make sure that the money is repaid Each member has to pay for their own loan but if they have problems the group may help them pay because the group would not get any more loans from Grameen if all the groups loans were not paid

Grameen Bank does not take people to court if they cannot pay the system works on trust only Solidarity groups agree with Grameen to save enough for extra payments in case they cannot pay every time

Not many women in India can have loans from big banks so 97 of Grameens loans go to women Women get treated very badly in some countries and groups such as the World Bank are researching to know if small loans are helping women around the world Over 98 percent of Grameens loans have been paid back but the Wall Street Journal says that 20 of the loans took more than a year longer than the time agreed to pay the loan back Grameen says that more than half of its borrowers in Bangladesh now have all children of school age in school all household members eating three meals a day a clean toilet a rainproof house clean drinking water and can pay 300 taka a week towards their loans

One of the things Grameen Bank does for poor people is the Village Phone program Women entrepreneurs can start a business providing a payphone service in rural areas of Bangladesh The Village Phone Program was awarded the 2004 Petersburg Prize of EUR 100000 for Technology to Development The Development Gateway Foundation said Grameen has created a new class of women entrepreneurs who have raised themselves from poverty Moreover it has improved the livelihoods of farmers and others who are provided access to critical market information and lifeline communications previously unattainable in some 28000 villages of Bangladesh More than 55000 phones are currently in operation with more than 80 million people benefiting from access to market information news from relatives and more 

In 2003 Grameen Bank started a new loan program different from the Solidarity Group to help the beggars in Bangladesh This program is made to give small loans to beggars The loans cost only the amount of the loan and the repayment take a long time for example a beggar taking a small loan of around 100 taka can pay only 200 taka per week and only repays 100 taka 

The bank does not force the beggars to give up begging but tries to get them selling low priced items The Global Microcredit Summit in 2006 by one of the banks managers says that by May 2006 around 73000 beggars have taken loans of about 5832 million taka and repaid 3478 million taka

Grameen Bank is owned by the people who borrow the money mostly women The borrowers own 94 of the bank and the other 6 is owned by the Government of Bangladesh 

In October 2007 the bank had 734 million borrowers and 97 of those are women The number of borrowers has more than doubled since 2003 when the bank had only 312 million members In October 2007 the Bank had a staff of over 24703 employees and 2468 branches covering 80257 villages There were 43681 villages covered in the year 2003 Since its start the bank has loaned 34775 billion taka 31311 billion taka has been repaid The bank says 9835 of loans are repaid In 1998 95 of loans were repaid However many critics doubt this recovery rate and the definition that Grameen uses to come up with this rate

Grameen Bank received awards such as the Bangladesh Independence Day Award in 1994 The bank got its best known award on 13 October 2006 when the Nobel Committee awarded Grameen Bank and its first member Muhammad Yunus the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to create economic and social development from below The Nobel Foundation says From modest beginnings three decades ago Yunus has first and foremost through Grameen Bank developed micro credit into an ever more important instrument in the struggle against poverty Grameen Bank has been a source of ideas and models for the many institutions in the field of micro credit that have sprung up around the world

 Mosammat Taslima Begum used her first loan of 16 euro from the bank in 1992 to buy a goat and subsequently became a successful entrepreneur and one of the elected board members of the bank She collected the Nobel Prize for Grameen Bank on 10 December 2006 at the prize awarding ceremony in Oslo City Hall

Grameen Bank is the only business to have won a Nobel Prize In a speech given at the presentation ceremony Professor Ole Danbolt Mjs Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee said that by giving the prize to Grameen Bank and Muhammad Yunus the Norwegian Nobel Committee wanted to make more contact with the Muslim world to help women and on to fight against poverty

The people in Bangladesh were very happy with the Nobel Prize Some critics asserted that the award affirms neoliberalism

The Grameen Bank has grown into over two dozen groups called the Grameen Family of Enterprises These groups include Grameen Trust Grameen Fund Grameen Communications Grameen Shakti Grameen Telecom Grameen Shikkha Grameen Motsho Grameen Baybosa Bikash Grameen Phone Grameen Software Limited Grameen CyberNet Limited Grameen Knitwear Limited and Grameen Uddog

On 11 July 2005 the Grameen Mutual Fund One was listed as an Initial Public Offering One of the first mutual funds of its kind GMFO will allow the over four million Grameen bank members as well as non members to buy into Bangladeshs capital markets The Grameen group is worth over USD 74 billion 

The Grameen Foundation was based on the work of Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and they want to share the Grameen ideas and hurry microfinance to the worlds poorest people Grameen Foundation USA which has an A rating from Charity Watch supports microfinance institutions worldwide with loan guarantees training and technology transfer As of 2006 Grameen Foundation supports microfinance institutions in the following regions

Sudhirendar Sharma a development analyst says that the Grameen Bank has landed poor communities in a perpetual debt trap and that its ultimate benefit goes to the corporations that sell capital goods and infrastructure to the borrowers Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina who said There is no difference between usurers Yunus and corrupt people Hasina also says the bank wants too much in return for the loans Loans from Grameen Bank cost more than bigger banks around 20 interest The Mises Institutes Jeffrey Tucker says that Grameen Bank is not good enough for Indias economy and is a way of giving money to people who are not working

Neal Cassady was a member of the Beat Generation circle of writers and poets of the 1950s and 1960s He was a close friend of Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac and was the main inspiration behind Kerouacs breakthrough novel On the Road Later he was the broken wikt linkbus driverbus driver of Ken Keseys Merry Pranksters during the hippie era

Cassady was born in Salt Lake City literally on the road as his mother gave birth to him while his parents rode in a car They later separated with his father raising young Cassady in Denver Colorado He got into trouble often as a boy and spent part of his teen years in a broken wikt linkjuvenilejuvenile facility While locked up he began to write letters back and forth with Hal Chase another member of the Beat Generation Chase told his friends Kerouac and Ginsberg about Cassady who wanted to meet him After he was released Cassady traveled to New York marrying sixteen year old LuAnne Henderson on the way He met Ginsberg and began a homosexual relationship with him and a friendship with Kerouac recently divorced who began to teach Cassady about writing Kerouacs mother whom he lived with did not like Cassady sensing he was just a broken wikt linkcon artistcon artist Kerouac knew this was at least partly true but he did not mind since he enjoyed Cassadys company They looked a little like each other and strangers who met them often guessed the two were brothers They became very close personally and felt that they really were brothers though they came from different parents

Cassady was a broken wikt linkrestlessrestless person and his wife got tired of him not giving their marriage the attention it needed She left him and returned to her family Cassady soon forgot about her and started relationships with other women and also with men Before long he decided he wanted to travel Cassady was an expert driver and had no trouble driving cars at over 100 miles per hour over long stretches of highway Kerouac left his mother behind and joined Cassady on many road trips across the United States and even into Mexico When Kerouac got sick in Mexico City Cassady could not wait for him to get better and left Kerouac behind at a hospital Kerouac had to find his own way home and was angry at Cassady while Kerouacs mother thought it just proved her suspicions about him Cassady turned up later asking Kerouacs forgiveness which he gave him Good or bad Kerouacs experiences with Cassady were what he needed to finish a novel about broken wikt linkcross countrycross country travel which he had wanted to write for years

Kerouac was now married again to Joan Haverty and in trying to explain his friendship with Cassady to his new wife he typed a long broken wikt linknarrativenarrative using a roll of broken wikt linkteletypeteletype paper so he did not have to stop to change pages He spent three weeks working on the narrative almost non stop It became the manuscript for his new novel which he called On the Road His wife was bothered by the fact that he spent more time working on the manuscript than with her and separated from him not long after it was finished Kerouac spent the next six years making changes and improvements to the manuscript until a publisher agreed to print it as a book Cassadys name was changed to Dean Moriarty to make the book appear more fictional than it really was Kerouac delivered one of the first printed copies of On the Road in person to Cassady who did not give Kerouac the reaction he expected Instead of being happy and proud Cassady seemed broken wikt linkdisturbeddisturbed and scared by knowing that part of his life was now in print and his character documented for the public to see

On the Road was published in 1957 and it made both Kerouac and Cassady famous It did not do much to help their personal lives however Both men suffered from public broken wikt linkoverexposureoverexposure as the book became a broken wikt linkbest sellerbest seller A mistake on the books jacket made readers think that both men were much younger than they were Their adventures in the book had happened years earlier but many people thought they were recent Some readers wanted to travel with them or invite them to wild parties or have sexual intercourse with them Cassady enjoyed the attention for awhile but it took its toll on him personally Fame did not help his second marriage to Carolyn Robinson or the family they had together Kerouac himself hated all the attention he got and spent most of his time at home with his mother working on new books or drinking alcohol In time he became an alcoholic and it ruined his health

Cassady also partly inspired Allen Ginsbergs Howl and was mentioned in the poem as NC the secret hero of Ginsbergs latest writings Howl became a landmark work of the 1950s and added to Ginsbergs and Cassadys fame Ginsberg handled fame more easily than either Cassady or Kerouac and had a long public career

Cassady himself wanted to become a writer or a jazz musician but he was not a success at either He tried to take saxophone lessons but did not stay with them very long He mostly worked as a laborer or a broken wikt linkbrakemanbrakeman on railroads before and after On the Road was published Some of what he did write was published as a broken wikt linkmemoirmemoir titled The First Third but it was his only book He was more successful at writing letters to friends One was about his broken wikt linkseductionseductions of different women during a train trip He recorded long talks with Kerouac and Carolyn about their lives and thoughts and parts of these went into a later book by Kerouac titled Visions of Cody

Cassady also sold marijuana to help pay his bills One customer turned out to be an undercover policeman who arrested Cassady He spent a long time in jail Carolyn had to both work and try to raise their children alone

Freed from jail Cassady began to travel again During the 1960s he joined Ken Keseys Merry Pranksters who traveled back and forth across the United States in a bus holding acid tests a name for LSD parties Cassady drove the bus He acted as merrily as anyone and as full of energy as a young man when the Pranksters were around In private though he was not enjoying his life and old friends noticed he looked very tired

Cassady had tried to commit suicide a few times when he was younger and was unhappy Once he tried to freeze himself to death waiting outside in cold temperatures during a car trip but it took too long and he got back in the car Early in 1968 while revisiting Mexico he was found lying alongside a railroad track where he had been for a long time Exposure to harsh weather caused his death just days short of his 42nd birthday Nobody knew if he was trying to kill himself or not this time A few people who knew him felt that he wanted to die and had for awhile as he got older and that Cassady finally got his wish

Cassady left an broken wikt linkindelibleindelible mark on the world of the 1950s and 1960s through his documented adventures in the works of Kerouac Ginsberg and their friends He also turned up in Keseys writings about the Merry Pranksters He inspired later broken wikt linkbohemianbohemian characters like Jim Morrison of The Doors People today still read about his life and times and wish they were able to meet Cassady or make friends with him The people who knew Cassady remembered him fondly later even if he let them down personally because he was such a unique person People loved watching Cassady live his life to the fullest while he encouraged them to do the same with theirs

In 1976 Yunus visited the poorest households in the village of Jobra near Chittagong University He discovered that very small loans could be a lot of help to a poor person Some Jobra women were making bamboo furniture and had to take loans for buying bamboo but all their profits were being paid towards the loans The first loan Muhammad Yunus gave was USD 2700 from his pocket This 27 was loaned to 42 women in the village who made a profit of 0002 each from the loan

Muhammad Yunus was the first Bangladeshi and third Bengali to ever get a Nobel Prize After being told of the important award Yunus said that he would use part of his share of the 14 million award money to create a company that makes good food that the poor can afford and the rest would go toward starting an eye hospital for the poor in Bangladesh

John Keats was an English poet He is often ranked as one of the five most important poets of the Romantic movement in English literature the other four are William Wordsworth Samuel Taylor Coleridge Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley Though Keats was the youngest of these poets he also died before the others he suffered from tuberculosis and died in Rome at the age of 25

Keats was the son of an inn keeper who died when Keats was nine years old and his mother died of tuberculosis in 1810 The young Keats began studying to be a surgeon though his interest in literature grew stronger than his interest in medicine He became a friend and follower of the poet and editor James Henry Leigh Hunt and made his first attempts to write his own poetry Keatss active writing life lasted only about six years from the spring of 1814 through 1819 

His short life meant that he wrote less than many other poets His longest poems Endymion and Hyperion tell stories from ancient Greek mythology Many of his shorter poems are among the best known in English literature including La Belle Dame Sans Merci and his Sonnets and Odes

Keats was an active letter writer throughout his life like many people of his time Hundreds of his letters to friends and relatives have survived and Keats is often called one of the great letter writers in the English language

Endymion is one of the major poems of the English Romantic poet John Keats It is his longest poem Keats wrote the poem in 1817 and it was printed in a book in 1818 The poems opening line is one of the most famous lines of poetry in English literature

Keats called the poem A Poetical Romance He wrote in four sections or Books and each section is about a thousand lines long The poem is written in a form called rhymed couplets which means that every two lines rhyme together The story is based on the tale of Endymion from Greek mythology

Endymion was criticized harshly when it was first published Some of Keatss friends and admirers like the poet Shelley believed that the stress of this hostile reaction had a bad effect on Keatss mind and partly caused his early death from tuberculosis at the age of 25 But most modern critics and scholars of English literature do not think this is true

Hyperion is one of the major poems of the English Romantic poet John Keats The poem is based on the tale from Greek mythology that tells how the Titan Hyperion the first Greek sun god was replaced by Apollo

Keats worked on the poem mainly in August and September 1818 He finished the first two sections or Books each between 350 and 400 lines long and he also wrote 135 lines of Book III But he was not satisfied with what he had written he re wrote it bit by bit until April 1819 when he gave up for a while Some critics and scholars think that Keats set out to write the kind of long poem he had already done in his Endymion in 1817 but his outlook on poetry had changed to a point where he was no longer happy writing the kind of mythological epic that many other poets of his time tried to write

Keats tried to re do the poem in a new form that he called The Fall of Hyperion He worked on this second version during the last six months of 1819 and though he wrote more than 500 lines he gave up this second attempt too He was never able to complete either version of the poem in a way that satisfied him

Keats wrote the poem in blank verse without rhyme Though neither version was ever finished some critics think that they contain some of Keatss best verse as in the gloomy and powerful opening lines of the first Hyperion

A Sonnet is a type of poem It is 14 lines long and is written in rhyme 

The sonnet first appeared in Italy during the Renaissance The Italian poet Petrarch was famous for his sonnets It became common for poets to write sonnets in connected series called sonnet sequences to tell a story often one about a love affair Poets in other countries quickly adopted the sonnet William Shakespeare wrote the most famous sonnets in English literature though other poets of his time such as Ben Jonson Edmund Spenser Michael Drayton and Samuel Daniel wrote sonnet sequences also

Later English poets like John Donne William Wordsworth Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats wrote sonnets that are still admired and studied today The rigid rhyme scheme of the sonnet went out of fashion during the twentieth century but a few modern poets still write them sometimes Edna St Vincent Millay was one modern poet writing in English who often worked in the sonnet form Modern poets have often changed the traditional rhythms and rhyme patterns of the sonnet sometimes radically

In a traditional English or Shakespearean sonnet the first twelve lines are divided into three groups of four lines each called quatrains The last two lines usually rhyme and make up a rhymed couplet that concludes the poem by summing up the story told in the previous quatrains In the traditional Italian or Petrarchan sonnet the poem divides into a group of eight lines followed by a group of six lines

The letters of the alphabet are used to show the pattern of rhyme or rhyme scheme in the 14 lines in a sonnet The rhyme scheme 

is the typical pattern of an English sonnet The rhyme scheme

is typical of an Italian sonnet However the rhymes of the sestet in an Italian sonnet can vary widely cdcdcd cddcdd etc

A relational database is a way of storing information The database matches data by using identical information that is found within the data set The resulting groups of data are organized and are much easier for many people to understand

For example a database has all information about real estate sales in a town This information can be grouped by year or by sale price or by buyers last name and so on Such a grouping uses the relational model Hence such a database is called a relational database

The software used to do this grouping is called a relational database management system The term relational database often refers to this type of software

Relational databases are currently the main way in which companies store information like financial records medical records personal information and manufacturing and logistical data

The term relational database was originally defined by and is attributed to Edgar Codd at IBM Almaden Research Center in 1970

In mathematics a relation is used to describe certain properties of things That way certain things may be connected in some way this is called a relation It is clear that things are either related or they are not there are no in betweens

Formally a relation is a set of n tuples of equal degree Thus a binary relation is a set of pairs a ternary relation a set of 3 tuples and so forth A ternary relation however is always expressable as two binary relations Specifically in the context of functions this is known as currying

Particularly concerning binary relations the set of all the starting point is called the domain and the sets of the ending points is the range The domain is the xs and the range is the ys

An example for such a relation might be a function Functions associate keys with values The set of all functions is a subset of the set of all relations  a function is a relation where the first value of every tuple is unique through the set

Other well known relations are the Equivalence relation and the Order relation That way sets of things can be ordered Take the first element of a set it is either equal to the element looked for or there is an order relation that can be used to classify it That way the whole set can be classified

Relations can be transitive One example of a transitive relation is smaller than If X is smaller than Y and Y is smaller than Z then X is smaller than Z

Relations can be symmetric One example of a symmetric relation is is equal to If X is equal to Y Y is equal to X

Relations can be reflexive One example of a reflexive relation is is equal to X is equal to X

Picking up shortly after his mothers death Bambi follows his father the Great Prince into the forest With the help of Thumper and Flower Bambi must win his fathers approval but the Great Prince finds that his high spirited son may have a lesson or two to teach him as well

Many of the backgrounds used in the movie are exactly the same that were used in the original 1942 movie The old backgrounds were put through the computer to create a clearer image

The movie was released on home video at differing dates due to it being a theatrical release in some countries While the movie was a direct to video release in countries like the United States Japan Canada mainland China Hong Kong and Taiwan it was a theatrical release in some countries like the United Kingdom France Austria Mexico Dominican Republic Brazil Australia and some other European countries It broke the world record for the longest amount of time between two related movies made in a series being released 63 and a half years after the first movie As major studios continue to phase out VHS this was the last Disney animated movie released on VHSFactdateDecember 2008 Following its moratorium strategy in which releases are made available for a limited time only Disney gave the DVD a 70 day window for its US release The movie sold 26 million DVDs in its first week in the United States 

The film generally received an average rating from professional critics It was praised for its animation  regarded as some of the best among the Disney direct to video sequels  but the story was thought to be lacking and easy to make Movie fans were much more positive according to ratings on Amazoncom

In the original book on which Bambi was based Ronno was already a stag when Bambi was born instead of being mere weeks to months older than he was as in the movie An additional twist is that in the book Ronno was quite respectable and there was nothing at all personal about his rivalry with Bambi over Faline Ronnos character is never named in the original movie However documentation from Disney clearly indicates that the Ronno in Bambi II is the same deer which Bambi fought in the original right down to the same moves each deer makes during their fight in the sequel The age of the Great Prince changes as compared to the original movie In the original the Great Prince is said to be twice as old as the oldest deer In this movie the Great Prince is said to have been the same age as Bambis mother

There are several scenes in Bambi II which are noticeably similar to scenes from the first movie Bambi For example

His story is told by various ancient authors In most versions he is a shepherd and a young man of unusual handsomeness so much so that the Moon goddess Selene falls in love with him She uses her divine power to keep him asleep forever preserving his youth and beauty

The Endymion story has been re told by poets and playwrights The English playwright John Lyly wrote one version and the poet John Keats used the story as the basis for his long poem Endymion

Samuel Taylor Coleridge was an English poet Together with his friend William Wordsworth Coleridge is often said to have started the Romantic movement in English literature

Coleridge was the son of a minister and the youngest of ten children He attended the University of Cambridge though he never earned his degree He met Wordsworth another young poet in 1795 They became close friends and in 1798 they published their poems in a book called Lyrical Ballads which many critics consider a key event in English Romanticism Most of the poems in the book were written by Wordsworth though it also contained Coleridges The Rime of the Ancient Mariner which many people call his masterpiece and one of the great poems in English

In 1796 Coleridge wrote his poem Kubla Khan along with the Ancient Mariner it is his best known work At about the same time in the later 1790s Coleridge became addicted to opium At that time the drug was legal and was widely used as a pain killer Coleridges addiction to opium marked the rest of his life His health suffered and he had trouble supporting his wife and children He also had a hard time finishing the writing projects he started

Coleridge had a reputation as a great talker and people often invited him to their dinner parties to hear him speak He was a successful lecturer at times in his later life He gained a reputation as a thinker and philosopher as well as a poet

Scholars and critics of English literature have regarded Coleridge as a major figure In his 1927 book The Road to Xanadu John Livingston Lowes used Coleridges poetry especially Kubla Khan to study the working of the human imagination Critics have argued about the role that opium addiction played in the poets life and work In his 1971 book Coleridge the Damaged Archangel Norman Furman showed that Coleridge was guilty of plagiarism in many of his later works His opium addiction may have left Coleridge unable to tell when he was repeating the work of other writers that he had read

Magical Mystery Tour is a 1967 television movie made by The Beatles It is also the movies title song and the name of its soundtrack recording

Paul McCartney had the original idea for Magical Mystery Tour coming back from the Monterey Pop Festival in California during the summer of 1967 He drew a clock face on a paper plate and filled it with parts of the show he imagined McCartney based the idea on Ken Keseys Merry Pranksters who travelled the United States in a bus and also broken wikt linkmystery tourmystery tours which were low budget weekend vacation trips taken in England

The other Beatles liked the idea for the show and made plans to produce and direct it themselves After they stopped giving concerts in 1966 they had started making their own promotional films much like todays music videos They had success with promos and wanted to try making a whole programme to appear on television during the Christmas holidays

Beatles manager Brian Epstein helped set up the production and the Beatles asked friends members of their staff and some professional actors to ride with them in a rented bus over a holiday weekend and film whatever happened with magical elements to be added later Making the movie was one of the first jobs of the Beatless new company Apple Corps

Epstein unfortunately died before filming began Without him to look over business details things ran into trouble By the time things were set up John Lennon and George Harrison had changed their minds about performing and spent much of the bus trip asleep There also was not much for scenery along the roads or entertainment among the passengers

What turned into a bigger event than filming Magical Mystery Tour was the broken wikt linkentourageentourage that began to surround the bus wondering what the tour was all about People followed the bus for miles and caused broken wikt linktraffic jamtraffic jams People who saw the bus go by expected a happening of some kind but none had been planned In trying to be broken wikt linkspontaneousspontaneous nobody had worked out a broken wikt linkdestinationdestination for the bus or the trip Most of the commotion ended after Lennon personally removed the MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR lettering from the sides of the bus Later a Beatles assistant said the traffic jams should have also been filmed

Spots for songs and performances were included in Magical Mystery Tour and so was a broken wikt linkstorylinestoryline explaining what the trip was about The songs featured in the show included The Fool on the Hill I Am The Walrus Blue Jay Way an instrumental song Flying and Your Mother Should Know with a choreographed dance sequence Another band the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band played live during a striptease performance

Magical Mystery Tour appeared on British television on Boxing Day in 1967 and was a surprising flop Part of the reason for its failure was because it was shown in black and white while colour was an important feature Another part was because most of the viewers did not understand what was supposed to be happening Another part was that not much had happened on camera for long parts of the programme and it showed

Ringo Starr made a personal appeal to the BBC to show Magical Mystery Tour again in full colour The BBC gave it a second broadcast but it did not change opinions ABC in the United States cancelled plans to show Magical Mystery Tour in America

Even though Magical Mystery Tour was not a television success its soundtrack still sold well The shows songs were released as a double EP in England with a storybook and pictures from the show In America Capitol Records added songs from recent Beatles singles to the show songs and released a whole album The American version outsold the EP in England and in 1977 Parlophone Records released a British version of the album

 appeared in the show Magical Mystery Tour 

All songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney except Flying and Blue Jay Way

In economics hyperinflation is inflation that is out of control when prices increase very fast as money loses its value 

One example of hyperinflation is in Germany in the 1920s In 1922 the largest bank note was 50000 Mark In 1923 the largest bank note was 100000000000000 Mark In December of 1923 the exchange rate was 4200000000000 Marks to 1 US dollar Sometimes the rate of inflation was so high that prices doubled every two days The Rentenmark was introduced to stop this problem The exchange rate was set at 42 Rentenmarks to 1 US Dollar

At one time Bank notes were so worthless that people would burn them in fires to keep them warm The notes would burn longer than the amount of wood you could buy with them

In Zimbabwe the inflation rate was 23115088887 in July 2008

Cathar castles is a term used by the French tourist industry It used for castles in the Languedoc Roussillion usually built during the crusades against the Cathars 

The Cathars built fortified homesteads Some of them were Laurac Fanjeaux Mas Saintes Puelles Certain sites like Lastours Cabaret Montsgur Termes or Puilaurens were castra before being razed to the ground and becoming royal citadels The legend of Cathar architects and builders is no more than a myth The only monuments which witnessed the events of the first half of the 13th century The cathar church did not build anything For this reason the only ones which can claim the description Cathar are the small castles often totally unknown to the public Their unspectacular ruins are often far away from tourist routes

Because Raimond II was unable to recapture Carcassone in 1240 the city walls were strengthened by the French King He also destroyed small castra in the Corbires region and built citadels to protect the frontier with the kingdom of Aragon

These five castles are often called the cinq fils de Carcassonne

These five fortresses resisted various assaults led by the Aragonese army

In 1659 Louis XIV and the Philip IV of Spain signed the Treaty of the Pyrenees The French king also married the Infanta Marie Therese The treaty changed the borders It gave Rousillon to France and moved the frontier south to the crest of the Pyrenees where it is now The fortresses therefore lost their importance Some maintained a garrison for a while a few until the French Revolution but they slowly fell into decay often becoming sherpherds shelters or bandits hideouts

The Chteau dUsson is one of the Cathar castles that is now in southwestern France It can be found in the commune of Rouze in the Arige dpartement

Scouting is a youth movement It was started in 1907 as a movement for boys by Robert Baden Powell 

Baden Powell took many ideas from the experiences he made with the Mafeking Cadet Corps This corps was a paramilitary group made of boys It was formed during a siege in the Second Boer War The boys mainly carried messages that way the soldiers could focus on defending the city

Originally the scout movement was for boys only A similar movement for girls called Girl Guides was started in 1910 In most countries there are at the same time associations for Scouts and for Girl Guides Today often the Scouts accept girls too

In the scout movement people learn to work together to achieve a goal They also train their character to become better adults

Usually when they start in the scouts they give a promise to live by certain rules and to help others when they can

Scouts spend their time outdoors whenever possible

In 2005 there were more than 28 million boy scouts and over 10 million girl guides from 216 different countries Only in six countries was there no scout movement in 2006 They were Andorra Peoples Republic of China Cuba Laos Myanmar and North Korea 

In Cuba there was a scout organisation but the Communist government replaced it by the Jos Mart Pioneer Organization which is similar to scouts but without the international brotherhood and the peace mission 

Scouting organisations have been banned in Peoples Republic of China They have been replaced by Young Pioneers of China and Communist Youth League of China These organisations are a bit similar to scouts but without the international brotherhood and the peace mission There is a Scout Association in Hong Kong and one in Macau Hong Kong and Macau are Special Autonomous Regions of the Peoples Republic of China so the scout associations there are still allowed to exist In the Republic of China scouting was never banned 

There are no scouting organisations in Myanmar but there are a few boy scouts and girl scouts in Yangoon

Baden Powell was a military officer He was stationed in India and Africa in the 1880s and 1890s Since his youth he was fond of woodcraft and military scouting He therefore showed his men how to survive in the wilderness He noticed that if he taught the soldiers to develop independence they would no longer follow the orders given by their officers blindly

In 1896 during the Second Matabele War Baden Powell first met and became friends with the American born British Army Chief of Scouts Frederick Russell Burnham From Burnham he learned the ways of cowboy and indian scouts of the Western United States he started to wear a scout hat like the one worn by Burnham and he discussed with Burnham a scout training program for boys Three years later during the Second Boer War Baden Powell was besieged in the small town of Mafeking by a much larger Boer army The Mafeking Cadet Corps was a group of youths that supported the troops The cadets carried messages This freed the men for military duties It also kept the boys occupied during the long siege The Cadet Corps performed well helping in the defence of the town This experience was one of the many factors that inspired Baden Powell to form the Scouting movement Each member received a badge that showed a combined compass point and spearhead The badges logo was similar to the fleur de lis that Scouting later adopted as its international symbol 

In the United Kingdom the public followed his struggle to hold Mafeking through newspapers After the siege Baden Powell had become a national hero This pushed the sales of a small instruction book he had written about military scouting Aids to Scouting 

On his return to England he noticed the large interest of boys in this book which was also used by teachers and youth organizations Several people suggested to him to rewrite this book for boys especially during an inspection of the Boys Brigade This brigade was a large youth movement drilled with military precision Baden Powell thought this would not be attractive and suggested that it could grow much larger when scouting would be used He studied other schemes parts of which he used for Scouting

In his original book on boy scouting General Baden Powell introduced the scout promise as follows

Since the scouts were formed other people have tried to form scout like movements These movements are a bit like the scouts but they put more weight on different things There are for example scout like movements that focus more on the fact that the young people should get a good education in religious matters The movements that have been formed in countries such as Cuba or China are much like scouts they leave out some elements though that the national governments thought would harm the country

The History of Indonesia or more precisely of the Indonesian archipelago in South East Asia with 17508 islands goes back to Homo erectus There have been found fossilized remains of about one million years ago 

Austronesian people who form the majority of the modern population came to South East Asia from Taiwan They arrived in Indonesia around 2000 BCE The native Melanesian peoples went to the far eastern regions The agricultural conditions were very good When wet field rice cultivation was developed as early as the eighth century BCE villages and towns developed And small kingdoms began to flourish by the first century CE Indonesias sea lane position helped international trade There was trade with both Indian kingdoms and China already several centuries BCE Trade has since fundamentally shaped Indonesian history

From the seventh century CE the powerful Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished as a result of trade Hinduism and Buddhism were imported with it In the late 13th century the Hindu Majapahit kingdom was founded in eastern Java and under Gajah Mada its influence stretched over much of Indonesia this period is often referred to as a Golden Age in Indonesian history

During the 13th century Islam spread to the in northern Sumatra More and more Indonesian areas gradually adopted Islam By the end of the 16th century it was the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra But it mixed with existing cultural and religious influences 

The first Europeans arrived in Indonesia in 1512 when Portuguese traders led by Francisco Serro sought to monopolize the sources of nutmeg cloves and cubeb pepper in Maluku Dutch and British traders followed In 1602 the Dutch established the Dutch East India Company and became the dominant European power But Dutch control stretched not very far Only in the early 20th century it extended to borders of today

During the Second World War the Dutch lost control and in August 1945 Sukarno an influential nationalist leader declared independence and was appointed president After some fights the Netherlands formally recognized Indonesian independence in December 1949

Sukarno moved from democracy towards dictatorship But Sukarono lost power to the head of the military General Suharto who was formally appointed president in March 1968 He was supported by the US government and encouraged foreign direct investment in Indonesia which helped economic growth during the following thirty years But his rule went along with corruption and suppression of political opposition

In 1997 and 1998 Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the Asian Financial Crisis This increased popular discontent with the New Order and led to popular protests Suharto resigned on 21 May 1998 In 1999 East Timor voted to leave the state of Indonesia after a twenty five year military occupation After Suhartos resignation democracy improved A regional autonomy program was introduced and the first direct presidential election took place in 2004 But some political and economic instability has remained A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in Aceh was achieved in 2005

Leviticus is the third book of both the Bible and the Torah known as Wayiqra in transliterated Hebrew meaning And He will declare It was written by the Old Testament Patriarch Moses Leviticus was written to the Hebrew people of Israel The book has several main topics some of which are the Jewish laws of sacrificing to God and the work of the Priests

Professor Mather and John Boslough wrote all about the COBE teams work in a book called The Very First Light

The Book of Joshua is the sixth book of the Christian Bible and also the sixth book of the Hebrew Tanakh It is clear who wrote the book because most of the Jewish tradition believe it was Joshua son of Nun It is the first of the books of the Tanakh covering the history of Israel from the arrival in the Promised Land to the Babylonian captivity

It is thought that the book was written around the 15th century BC

After the death of Moses God put Joshua in charge of the people Joshua sent two spies to spy on the city of Jericho A women hid these two men and said they had already left She hid them on top of her roof underneath stalks of flax The spies later promised that they would keep the oath that Joshua made with them

Jericho fell when the people of Israel circled around the wall of Jericho seven times and blew their rams horns causing the wall to fall

Joshua told the spies to go to Rahabs house and bring out her family and belongings The spies did as they were told as they kept the oath Joshua saved Rahabs life and she went to live in Israel

Later God told Joshua to invade the city of Ai After they did this the people of Gibeon told Joshua that they do not want to be invaded so they made a treaty that said the could not fight

However three days later the people of Israel realized that they really made a treaty with Gibeons neighbors the Hivites The Hivities became cursed but the people of Gibeon promised that they would do whatever the Israelites say

After making peace with the Hivites they went to lay siege to Gibeon The Gibeonites sent a message to Joshua saying he needs to save the people of Gibeon So God killed many of the Amorites by making large hailstones Then Joshua made the sun stay over Gibeon and the moon over Ajalon Joshua later got very old and died and the people of Israel became captives of Jabin who was king of Canaan

It has the nickname of Macors del mar to differentiate it from San Francisco de Macors in the Duarte Province

The municipality had in 2002 a total population of 217141 105070 men and 112071 women The urban population was 892 of the total population In this numbers are included the population of the municipal district Guayacanes

There were two very small towns on the left side of the mouth of the river Macors Mosquito and Sol Even today San Pedro de Macors is called sometimes Mosquitisol after those two old and small towns

Since 1852 there was a military post in this place the Military Post of Macors part of the Hato Mayor del Rey municipality in the El Seibo Province

In 1856 the priest Pedro Carrasco built a Catholic church with the name San Pedro Apstol the church was between the two towns of Mosquito and Sol Both towns grew in direction of the church forming one town called San Pedro de Macors

When the country was again a Spanish colony San Pedro de Macors was made a Comandancia de Armas When the country was free again in 1865 every town with the category of Comandancia de Armas became a municipality But San Pedro de Macors was still a very small town of the El Seibo Province

After 1868 with the sugarcane plantations and the sugar factories San Pedro de Macors began to grow and it became one of the most important city in the Dominican Republic Many people from Cuba and Puerto Rico came to live here during the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th century Later came people from the Spain and the Middle East to work in businesses

To work in the sugarcane fields and factories people from Haiti and the British West Indies came to San Pedro de Macors and other regions of the country

The economy of San Pedro de Macors grew around the sugar production there were several sugar factories and most of that sugar was sent to other countries through its port and then it became one of the most important port of the country Rhum is also produced in the city rhum is made with alcohol from the sugar cane

There are also some important industries mainly to produce cement and textiles to send to other countries

The Epistle to the Galatians is the forty eighth book in the Bible written by the Apostle Paul The book was written to the people of Galatia with whom Paul had at a previous date founded the Congregation in their area 

It is not known for sure but most believe that the book was written around 57 AD

The book contains some of the most known Bible teachings such as that all have need of Salvation and the Fruits of the Spirit

A label can have several meanings

The Neanderthal a species of the genus Homo was a near relative of our own species Its scientific name is Homo neanderthalensis or Homo sapiens neanderthalensis 

Neanderthal fossils are only found in Europe Asia Minor and up to central Asia The first fossil was found in the mid 1800s

Neanderthals became extinct about 30000 years ago They perhaps evolved from Homo heidelbergensis and split off from modern humans between 700000 and 300000 years ago 

Neanderthals are either classified as a subspecies of modern humans or as a separate human species

Neanderthal remains have been found in most of Europe south of land covered by ice including the south coast of Great Britain Finds have also been made outside of Europe in the Zagros Mountains and in the Levant

In August 1856 the specimen that was to become known as Neanderthal 1 was discovered in the Neander Valley Germany The material was found in a limestone quarry near Dsseldorf A skull cap was first discovered followed by two femurs five arm bones part of the left pelvis and fragments of a shoulder blade and ribs 

Actually some remains had been found earlier but not recognised as a separate species from us The Engis child from Belgium was the first Neanderthal discovered in 1829 The second discovered was the Forbes Quarry find from Gibralter in 1848 

Neanderthal men were about 164168 cm tall and averaged 776 kg in weight Neanderthal women stood about 154 cm tall and averaged 664 kg in weight 

Neanderthals had stronger build and distinctive morphological features especially of the skull They were much stronger than modern humans especially in the upper body

Neanderthal long bones and joints are thicker than ours and some long bones have a slight curve Both the thickness and the curve suggest the need for more strength than our species

 Young Neanderthals  Since 2007 tooth age can be directly calculated using the noninvasive imaging of growth patterns in tooth enamel by means of x ray synchrotron microtomography

This research suggests much more rapid physical development in Neanderthals than in modern human children The x ray synchrotron microtomography study of early H sapiens argues that this difference existed between the two species as far back as 160000 years before present

Neanderthals seemed to suffer a high frequency of fractures These fractures are often healed and show little or no sign of infection suggesting that injured individuals were cared for during times of incapacitation 

Neanderthals showed a frequency of such injuries comparable to that of modern rodeo professionals showing frequent contact with large combative mammals The fractures suggest they may have hunted by leaping onto their prey and stabbing or even wrestling it to the ground

They lived in Eurasia during the ice ages of the Pleistocene and hunted large mammals such as bison auroch deer reindeer musk ox and mammoth

The skulls are slightly larger than Homo sapiens and this implies intelligence and probably the use of language The skeleton on the other hand suggests they tended to solve their problems more by force than we do

Neanderthal stone tools are called Mousterian and are an advance on the Acheulean tools made by earlier species of Man Homo sapiens stone tools are far more varied still and suggest that our species relied more on tools than the Neanderthals

Neanderthals were almost exclusively meat eaters although their diet did include cooked vegetables They made good tools and lived in complex social groups Research on their remains has shown that it is possible that they had a spoken language but the nature of any such language is unknown

There are a number of theories that try to explain why the Neanderthals died out It has been suggested that they may have been unable to adapt to the changing climate Alternatively it has been suggested that they were unable to successfully compete with the ancestors of modern humans

Oldenzaal is a municipality and a town in the eastern Netherlands near the border with Germany

It got city rights in 1249

 Sinanthropus pekinensis

 Javanthropus soloensis

 Meganthropus paleojavanicus

Homo erectus is an extinct species of the genus Homo Fossile remains were found in Java and in China But nearly all of them were lost during World War II But there are casts that are considered to be reliable evidence

Early in the 20th century it was believed that the first modern humans lived in Asia But during the 1950s and 1970s many fossil finds from East Africa showed that the oldest hominins came from there

Homo erectus remains one of the most successful and long lived species of the Homo genus It is generally considered to have given rise to a number of descendant species and subspecies The oldest known specimen of the ancient human was found in southern Africa 

Homo erectus yuanmouensis Homo erectus lantianensis Homo erectus pekinensis Homo erectus palaeojavanicus Homo erectus soloensis

The Palaeolithic refers to the prehistoric period when stone tools were made by humans They are found in the Great Rift Valley of Africa from about 26 million years ago They are found in Europe somewhat later from about 1 mya The Palaeolithic is by far the longest period of humanitys time about 99 of human history The geological period which corresponds to the Palaeolithic is the Pleistocene 

Stone tools were not only made by our own species Homo sapiens They were made by all previous members of the genus starting with relatively crude tools made by Homo habilis and Homo erectus In Europe the large brained Neanderthal Man made tools of high quality and was in turn outshone by the many tools made by our own species These tools are the first cultural products which have survived

The Palaeolithic dates from about 26 million years ago and ended around 15000BC with the Mesolithic in Western Europe and with the Epipaleolithic in warmer climates such as Africa The Palaeolithic age began when hominids started to use stones as tools for bashing cutting and scraping The age ended when humans began to make small fine tools and finally when plant crops and have other types of agriculture In some areas such as Western Europe the way that people lived was affected by the Ice age The move towards agriculture started in the Middle East 

During the Palaeolithic Age humans grouped together in small bands They lived by gathering plants and hunting wild animals As well as using stone tools they used tools of wood and bone They probably also used leather and vegetable fibers but these have not lasted from that time

The Oldowan is the archaeological term used to refer to the stone tool industry that was used by Hominids during the earliest Palaeolithic period The Oldowan is the earliest stone tool industry in prehistory from 26 million years ago up until 17 million years ago It was followed by the more sophisticated Acheulean industry Oldowan tools were therefore the earliest tools in human history and mark the beginning of the archaeological record The term Oldowan is taken from the site of Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania where the first Oldowan tools were discovered by the archaeologist Louis Leakey in the 1930s 

It is not known for sure which species actually created and used Oldowan tools It reached its peak with early species of Homo such as H habilis and H ergaster Early Homo erectus appears to inherit Oldowan technology and refines it into the Acheulean industry beginning 17 million years ago Oldowan tools are sometimes called pebble tools so named because the blanks chosen for their production already resemble in pebble form the final product Oldowan tools are sometimes subdivided into types such as chopper scrapers and pounders as these appear to have been their main uses

Acheulean is the industry of stone tool manufacture by early humans of the Lower Palaeolithic era in Africa and much of West Asia and Europe Acheulean tools are typically found with Homo erectus remains They are first developed out of the more primitive Oldowan technology some 18 million years ago by Homo habilis

It was the dominant technology for the vast majority of human history More than a million years ago Acheulean tool users left Africa to colonize Eurasiarefoutofafrica Their distinctive oval and pear shaped hand axes have been found over a wide area Some examples attained a very high level of sophistication Although it developed in Africa the industry is named after the type site of Saint Acheul now a suburb of Amiens in northern France where some of the first examples were identified in the 19th century

John Frere is generally credited as being the first to suggest a very ancient date for Acheulean hand axes In 1797 he sent two examples to the Royal Academy in London from Hoxne in Suffolk He had found them in prehistoric lake deposits along with the bones of extinct animals and concluded that they were made by people who had not the use of metals and that they belonged to a very ancient period indeed even beyond the present world His ideas were ignored by his contemporaries however who subscribed to a pre Darwinian view of human evolution

Radiometric dating often potassium argon dating of deposits containing Acheulean material is able to broadly place Acheulean techniques from around 165 million years agorefyoung to about 100000 years agorefyoungest The earliest accepted examples of the type at 165 m years old come from the West Turkana region of Kenyarefage although some have argued for its emergence from as early as 18 million years agorefroche

In individual regions this dating can be considerably refined in Europe for example Acheulean methods did not reach the continent until around 400 thousand years ago and in smaller study areas the date ranges can be much shorter Numerical dates can be misleading however and it is common to associate examples of this early human tool industry with one or more glacial or interglacial periods or with a particular early species of human The earliest user of Acheulean tools was Homo ergaster who first appeared about 18 million years ago Not all researchers use this formal name however and instead prefer to call these users early Homo erectusrefusage Later forms of early humans also used Acheulean techniques and are described below

There is considerable chronological overlap in early prehistoric stone working industries and in some regions Acheulean tool using groups were contemporary with other less sophisticated industries such as the Clactonianrefbarnham and then later with the more sophisticated Mousterian also The Acheulean was not a neatly defined period but a tool making technique which flourished especially well in early prehistory The term Acheulean does not represent a common culture in the modern sense rather it is a basic method for making stone tools that was shared across much of the Old World

The Clactonian is an industry of European flint tool manufacture that dates to the early part of the interglacial period 400000 years ago Clactonian tools were made by Homo erectus rather than modern humans Early crude flint tools from other regions using similar methods are called either Clactonian or core flake technology

The Clactonian is named after finds made at Clacton on Sea in the English county of Essex in 1911 The artefacts found there included flint chopping tools flint flakes and the tip of a worked wooden shaft along with the remains of a giant elephant and hippopotamus Further examples of the tools have been found at sites in Swanscombe Kent and Barnham in Suffolk similar industries have been identified across Northern Europe 

The Clactonian industry involved striking thick irregular flakes from a core of flint which was then employed as a chopper The flakes would have been used as crude knives or scrapers Unlike the Oldowan tools from which Clactonian ones derived some were notched implying that they were attached to a handle or shaft

The Clactonian industry may have co existed with the Acheulean industry which used identical basic techniques but which also had handaxe technology tools made by bifacially working a flint core However the 2004 excavation of a butchered Pleistocene elephant at the Southfleet Road site of High Speed 1 in Kent recovered numerous Clactonian flint tools but no handaxes A handaxe would have been more useful than a chopper in dismembering an elephant carcass so this is evidence of the Clactonian being a separate industry Flint of sufficient quality was available in the area and probably the people who carved up the elephant did not possess the knowledge to make the more advanced bifacial handaxe

The Mousterian is an industry of stone tools associated with Neanderthal Man Homo neanderthalensis It dates from about 300000 years to about 30000 years ago There are up to thirty types of tools in the Mousterian as contrasted with about six in the Acheulean

The Mousterian was named after the type site of Le Moustier a rock shelter in the Dordogne region of France Similar flintwork has been found all over unglaciated Europe and also the Near East and North Africa Handaxes long blades and points typify the industry Overall the items are more perfectly finished than any previous work The method used to get the blades and flakes is called the Levallois technique It is a prepared core technique the core is worked on so that a long fine blade can be struck off For this quality of work a soft hammer made of something like deer antler is necessary rather than a stone hammer The extra brain size of the Neanderthals is probably relevant to these advances

The cultures which follow the Mousterian are all cultures of modern humans Homo sapiens It is characteristic of our species to produce many more tools all specialised for particular tasks There are at least 100 types of tools in the Upper Palaeolithic compared to a maximum of 30 tools in the Mousterian

The Palaeolithic is sometimes divided into three periods which mark technological and cultural advances in different human communities

After the Palaeolithic follows the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras which marks the end of Stone Age The Bronze Age and the Iron Age come right after the Stone Age

Possibly among the earliest traces of art are Venus figurines These are figurines of women mostly pregnant with visible breasts The figurines were found in areas of Western Europe to Siberia Most are between 20000 and 30000 years old Two figurines have been found that are much older the Venus of Tan Tan dated to 300000 to 500000 years ago was found in Morocco The Venus of Berekhat Ram was found on the Golan Heights It has been dated to 200000 to 300000 years ago It may be the one of the earliest things that show the human form 

Different kinds of stone bones and ivory were used to make the figurines Some are also made of clay which was then burned in a fire This is one of the earliest known traces of the use of ceramics

Today it is not known what the figurines meant to the people who made them There are two basic theories

Scientists have excluded that these figurines were linked to the fertility of fields because agriculture had not been discovered at the time the figurines were made

The two figurines that are older may have mostly formed by natural processes The Venus of Tan Tan was covered with a substance that could have been some kind of paint The substance contained traces of iron and manganese The figurine of Berekhat Ram shows traces that someone worked on it with a tool A study done in 1997 states that these traces could not have been left by nature alone

Cave paintings are paintings that were made on the walls or roofs of caves Many cave paintings belong to the Palaeolothic Age and date from about 15000 to 30000 years ago Among the most famous are those in the caves of Altamira in Spain and Lascaux in Francep545 There are about 350 caves in Europe where cave paintings have been found Usually animals have been painted like aurochs bisons or horses Why these paintings were done is not known They are not simply decorations of places where people lived The caves they were found in usually do not show signs that someone lived in them

One of the oldest caves is that of Chauvet in France Paintings in the cave fall into two groups One has been dated to around 30000 to 33000 years ago the other to 26000 or 27000 years agop546 The oldest known cave paintings based on radiocarbon dating of black from drawings from torch marks and from the floors As of 1999 the dates of 31 samples from the cave have been reported The oldest paintings have been dated from 32900490 years ago

Some archaeologists have questioned the dating Zchner believe the two groups date from 2300024000 and 1000018000 years ago Pettitt and Bahn believe the dating is inconsistent They say the people at that periods of time painted things differently They also do not know where the charcoal used to paint some things is from and how big the painted area is

People from the Palaeolithic era drew well They knew about perspective and they knew of different ways to draw things They also were able to observe the behaviour of animals they painted Some of the paintings show how the painted animals behaved The paintings may have been important for rituals

In archaeology a biface is a two sided stone tool made by chipping off flakes with another tool It shows flake scars on both sides A view from the side of the final product tends to exhibit a lenticular shape Bifacial artifacts can be made on large flakes or blocks and may be grouped into many distinct classes 

Bolas are a throwing weapon made of weights on the ends of interconnected cords designed to capture animals by broken wikt linkentangleentangling their legs They are used by the gauchos in South America today but have been found in excavations of pre Hispanic settlements especially in Patagonia where indigenous peoples used them to catch guanaco and andu

Gauchos use boleadoras to capture running cattle or game The thrower gives the balls momentum by swinging them and then releases the boleadoras The weapon is usually used to entangle the animals legs but when thrown with enough force might even break the bone

There is no uniform design most bolas have two or three balls but there are versions of up to 8 or 9 balls Some bolas have balls of equal weightothers vary the knot and cord Gauchos use bolas made of leather cords with wooden balls or small leather sacks full of stones in the ends of the cords

Bolas can be named depending on the amount of weights used

Bolas of three weights are usually designed with two shorter cords with heavier weights and one longer cord with a light weight The heavier weights fly at the front parallel to each other hit either side of the legs and the lighter weight goes around wrapping up the legs

Other unrelated versions include qilumitautit the bolas of the Inuit made of sinew and bone weights and used to capture water birds

The death zone is the name used by mountain climbers for high altitude where there is not enough oxygen for humans to breathe This is usually above 8000 metres Most of the 120 climbers who have died on Mount Everest 8848 metres high have died in the death zone At the top of Mount Everest there is only about one third of the oxygen in the air that there is at sea level a human could only be there for a few minutes before they became unconscious Climbers have to carry oxygen bottles to be able to reach the top

Climber Lincoln Hall who was left for dead on Everest in 2006 managed to survive Lack of oxygen in his blood made it easier for him to get frostbite He also had headaches nausea and vomiting He thinks he had cerebral oedema or swelling of the brain This is caused at high altitude when blood leaks into the brain itself The swelling would have caused headaches confusion and disorientation This could kill a person if their brain became too compressed Hall was left for dead when his breathing and heartbeat stopped He was found the next day wandering near a cliff without his gloves or oxygen and his climbing suit unzipped

George Fitzgerald Smoot III is an American professor of astrophysics and cosmology In 2006 he won a Nobel Prize of physics for his work on COBE with John C Mather that made it possible to measure black holes and cosmic radiation much more exactly than was possible before 

This work gave new evidence for the big bang idea that the universe was once a big explosion This work was completed using the Cosmic Background Explorer Satellite The Nobel Prize committee said the COBE project can also be regarded as the starting point for cosmology as a precision science

Professor Smoot works for the University of California Berkeley Department of Physics In 2003 he was awarded the Einstein Medal 

Professor Smoot was born in Yukon Florida He went to Upper Arlington High School in Upper Arlington Ohio until 1962 He studied mathematics for some time before going to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he was awarded two bachelors degrees for mathematics and physics in 1966 and a PhD in particle physics in 1970

Smoots cousin Oliver R Smoot also studied at MIT and was made famous for the Smoot measurement of the Harvard Bridge between Cambridge and Boston The Smoot length was marked in paint over 360 times on the bridge and is repainted there every year Oliver later worked as the Chairman of the American National Standards Institute

Professor Smoot began to study cosmology and went to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory where he worked with Luis Walter Alvarez on the experiment HAPPE a high up weather balloon for detecting antimatter in the upper atmosphere 

He then took up an interest in the microwaves in cosmic radiation which had been discovered by Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson in 1964 This work gave new evidence of what the universe is made of Some researchers thought that the universe was rotating which would mean that temperature of microwaves would seem different when measured from different angles With the help of Alvarez and Richard A Muller Professor Smoot developed a radiometer to measure the difference in temperature from two angles 60 degrees apart The radiometer was put on top of a Lockheed U 2 plane but the measurements seemed to show that the universe was not rotating It did however detect another difference in the microwave temperature on one side of the sky They called this a dipole pattern and a Doppler effect of the Earths motion A doppler effect happens because the Sun and the Milky Way are moving at nearly 600 kms They think this is caused by gravity from the Great Attractor

The measurements from the radiometer showed that one side of the sky was different to the other but this was surprising because it was expected that many differences would be found all over the sky Smoot was working on finding these smaller differences in the late 1970s when he gave NASA an idea to make a satellite with a detector that was similar to the one mounted on the Lockheed aeroplane This detector would be much more powerful and it would not be affected by the atmosphere NASA spent US160 million on the satellite and named it the COBE The COBE satellite was delayed after the Space Shuttle Challenger was destroyed but was launched successfully on November 18 1989 After more than two years on 21 April 1992 the COBE research team claimed that the satellite had detected the small differences they were looking for This was very important in the study of the early universe The study was evidence for the birth of the universe Professor Smoot said If youre religious its like looking at God

More than 1000 researchers engineers and other workers helped to make the COBE John Mather was in control of the whole project and the experiments that made the COBE possible George Smoot was in control of measuring the small differences in the temperature of the radiation

Smoot worked with the San Francisco Chronicles journalist Keay Davidson to write a book called Wrinkles in Time all about the teams work In the book The Very First Light John Mather and John Boslough write more of the COBE story Mathers book says that Professor George was giving news of COBE to the press before NASA did This made problems between Smoot and Mather in the past

After COBE Smoot helped with another experiment with a stratospheric balloon called the MAXIMA experiment This ballon took some better measurements than the COBE Smoot has continued studying cosmic radiatin and now works on the third generation COBE satellite Planck He is also working on the design of a SupernovaAcceleration Probe a satellite which is to measure dark energy He has also assisted in analyzing data from the Spitzer Space Telescope in connection with measuring far infrared background radiation

Soundgarden is a American rock band The band started in 1984 in Seattle Washington The state of Washington has been a theme in many of their songs The members before the break up was singer Chris Cornell bass guitarist Ben Shepherd guitarist Kim Thayil and drummer Matt Cameron As of 2010 Soundgarden had sold over nine million records in the United Statesand an estimated twenty one million worldwide

Soundgarden have released a total of five studio albums Their two first albums were not very successful The bands members changed several times during the 1980s and early 1990s but Cornell and Thayil would been with the band to their break up in 1997 When Shepherd joined in 1990 Soundgardens next album Badmotorfinger became a mainstream success It was the bands first album to appear on the top 100 on the Billboard music chart and chart outside the United States Their fourth album Superunknown was even more popular and made them celebrities It sold over five million copies in the United States Down on the Upside was their fifth and last studio album and was released in 1996 The album was not able to meat the sales of Soundgardens two earlier albums in the United States and Canada Soundgarden broke up in 1997 after they released the compilation album A Sides Soundgarden is remembered as one of the big four of Seattle with Alice in Chains Pearl Jam and NirvanaAs of 2010 Soundgarden had sold over nine million records in the United Statesand an estimated twenty one million worldwide

Soundgarden was formed in 1984 by Chris Cornell and Hiro Yamamoto they were later joined by Kim Thayil Thayil had moved to Seattle from Park Forest Illinois with Yamamoto and Bruce Pavitt who would later start Sub Pop Records The band named themselves after a wind channeling pipe sculpture The Sound Garden located in Magnuson Park Seattle

Cornell originally played drums while singing but in 1985 the band enlisted Scott Sundquist to allow Cornell to concentrate on vocals The bands first recordings were three songs that appeared on a compilation for CZ Records called Deep Six It also featured songs by fellow grunge pioneers Green River Skin Yard Malfunkshun The U Men and the Melvins In 1986 Sundquist left the band and was replaced by Matt Cameron who was the drummer for Skin Yard

KCMU FM DJ Jonathan Poneman was impressed after seeing Soundgarden perform one night later saying I saw this band that was everything rock music should be Poneman offered to fund a release by the band so Thayil told him to team up with Bruce Pavitt Poneman offered to contribute 20000 in funding for Sub Pop effectively turning it into a full fledged record label The band signed to Sub Pop releasing the Screaming Life EP in 1987 and the Fopp EP in 1988 A combination of the two was issued as Screaming LifeFopp in 1990

Though the band was being courted by major labels in 1988 it signed to the lesser known SST Records to release its debut album Ultramega OK for which the band earned a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance in 1990 The bands first music video Flower was directed by Mark Miremont and aired regularly on MTVs 120 Minutes Soundgarden supported Ultramega OK with a tour of the United States in the spring of 1989 and a tour of Europe which began in May 1989 and which was the bands first overseas tour

In 1989 the band released their first album for a major label Louder Than Love through AM Records The signing caused a bad relations between Soundgarden and its traditional audience Thayil said In the beginning our fans came from the punk rock crowd They abandoned us when they thought we had sold out the punk tenets getting on a major label and touring with Guns N Roses There were fashion issues and social issues and people thought we no longer belonged to their scene to their particular sub culture Louder Than Love became the bands first album to chart on the Billboard 200 peaking at number 108 on the chart in 1990 Because of some of the song lyrics most notably on Hands All Over and Big Dumb Sex the band faced various retail and distribution problems upon the albums release

A month before touring for Louder Than Love was released bassist Hiro Yamamoto left to go back to college He was replaced by former Nirvana bassist Jason Everman Soundgarden went on a North American tour that startet in December 1989 and ended in March 1990 On this tour the band served as the opening act for Voivod on the bands Nothingface tour with Faith No More also serving as an opening act at the beginning and end of the tour The band then went on to tour Europe Bassist Jason Everman was fired immediately after Soundgarden completed its promotional tour for Louder Than Love in mid 1990 Louder Than Love spawned the EP Loudest Love and the video compilation Louder Than Live both released in 1990

Bassist Ben Shepherd joined Soundgarden in 1990 Soundgarden released Badmotorfinger in 1991 Although overshadowed at the time of its release by the sudden popularity of Nirvanas Nevermind the focus of attention brought by Nevermind to the Seattle scene helped Soundgarden gain attention The singles Outshined and Rusty Cage were able to find an audience at alternative radio and MTV The first single from Badmotorfinger Jesus Christ Pose garnered attention when MTV decided to ban its music video in 1991 Many listeners were outraged by the song and its video calling it anti Christian The band received death threats while on tour in the United Kingdom in support of the album Badmotorfinger was nominated for a Grammy for Best Metal Performance in 1992

The bands last studio album was Down on the Upside released in 1996 Four singles where released from the album Pretty Noose Blow Up the Outside World Burden in My Hand and Ty Cobb The album was notably less heavy than the groups previous albums and marked a further departure from the bands grunge roots Soundgarden explained at the time that it wanted to experiment with other sounds David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed instruments both acoustic and electric However tensions within the group startet during the sessions with Thayil and Cornell reportedly clashing over Cornells desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the bands trademark Despite favorable reviews the album did not match the sales of Superunknown

The band took a slot on the 1996 Lollapalooza tour with Metallica who had insisted on Soundgardens appearance on the tour After Lollapalooza the band embarked on a world tour Tensions continued to increase during the tour in support of the album When asked if the band hated touring Cornell said We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious because it becomes repetitious You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them Thats the point where we hate touring At the tours final stop in Honolulu Hawaii on February 9 1997 Shepherd threw his bass into the air in frustration after suffering equipment failure and subsequently stormed off the stage The band retreated with Cornell returning to conclude the show with a solo encore On April 9 1997 the band announced its disbanding Thayil said It was pretty obvious from everybodys general attitude over the course of the previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction Soundgardens final release a greatest hits compilation titled A Sides was released the following fall

Ben Shepherd was the vocalist on Wellwater Conspiracys first studio album Declaration of Conformity released in 1997 however he left the band in 1998 He has toured with Mark Lanegan and released the second Hater album in 2005

Regarding a future Soundgarden reunion Cornell stated in an October 2005 interview that it would probably not happen He continued Its almost like we sealed the lid and said this is Soundgarden and this is its lifespan and put it out there And it looks really great to me I think getting back together would take the lid off that and then could possibly change what to me seems like the perfect lifespan of the band I can not think of any reason to mess with that In interviews following his departure from Audioslave in February 2007 Cornell reiterated that the members of Soundgarden had no interest in reuniting In an interview in early August 2007 Cornell mentioned that Thayil has wanted to release a box set or B sides album of Soundgarden rarities although no further information was given

The Book of Judges is the seventh book in both the Christian Bible and the Hebrew Tanakh It was originally written in Hebrew to the people in Israel The Hebrew word for the book is Shaptiym which means people of judgment

Black people is a phrase that is used for a racial group of humans with a dark skin color The word has also been used to name a number of different people into one group Some meanings of the word mean only people of Sub Saharan African descent Others use the word for any of the groups that have dark skin color A meaning that also includes certain groups in Oceania and Southeast Asia southern South Asia and the southern Middle East

The Book of Ruth is the eight book of the Old Testament and the Tanakh It is one of the shortest books in both the Jewish and Christian holy books consisting of only four chapters It is unknown who wrote the book Some think that it was written by Samuel but there is no evidence for that According to many scholars this book was originally part of the Book of Judges and was later taken from that book and made independent It was probably written around 900 BC

The book tells the story of the family of Elimelech his wife Naomi and their sons Mahlon and Chilion Because of a famine they were forced to leave Bethlehem and go to the land of Moab Once there Elimelech died and his sons married two Moabite women Mahlon married Ruth and Chilion married Orpah After some time there Mahlon and Chilion both died

Naomi was forced to return home because her husband and sons were dead She then told Ruth and Orpah to return home to their families and find new husbands Orpah returned home but Ruth promised she would follow Naomi wherever she went 

They returned to home and Ruth decided she would go into the fields to pick up grain the wealthy people would drop on the ground A kind man named Boaz who was the owner of the field noticed her and her beauty He told his workers to drop extra grain for her When she went home to tell her mother in law how much she received they found out that Boaz was a close relative of theirs

After an even closer relative said he would not marry her Boaz and Ruth were happily married She would bear him a son named Obed who was the father of Jesse who was the father of David who was according to the New Testament the ancestor of Jesus

The Mesolithic was a period in the development of human technology between the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods of the Stone Age 

In the Palaeolithic people were pure hunter gatherers In the Neolithic they were farmers in settlements with domesticated animals and wheat with over 100 kinds of tools and with pottery The Mesolithic was a transitional period between the two It happened at different times in different places

The term was introduced by John Lubbock in his work Pre historic times published in 1865fact It was not much used until V Gordon Childe popularized it in his book The dawn of Europe

The Mesolithic culture can be set apart from that of the Palaeolithic in these ways

The Fertile Crescent was the first part of the world to move out of the Palaeolithic

In some areas such as the Near East agriculture was already underway by the end of the Pleistocene and there the Mesolithic is short In areas with limited influence of ice age the term Epipaleolithic is sometimes preferred 

Regions that experienced greater environmental effects as the last ice age ended have a much more evident Mesolithic era This lasted millennia In Northern Europe societies were able to live well on rich food supplies from the marshlands Such conditions produced distinctive human behaviours which are preserved in characteristic finds These conditions also delayed the coming of the Neolithic until as late as 4000 BC in northern Europe

The Epipaleolithic or peripheral old stone age is a term used for the hunter gatherer cultures that existed after the end of the last ice age before the Neolithic 

The term is sometimes confused with Mesolithic and the two are sometimes used as synonyms Yet when a distinction is made Epipaleolithic is used for those cultures that were not much affected by the ending of the Ice Age and the term Mesolithic is reserved for Western Europe where the extinction of the Megafauna had a great influence on the paleolithic populations at the end of the Ice Age

Agricultural revolution could mean

There are also several more local events related to agriculture and called revolutions

The Neolithic Revolution was the first agricultural revolutionthe transition from nomadic hunting and gathering communities and bands to agriculture and settlement It occurred in different prehistoric human societies at different times Most societies changed 97 thousand years ago 

The term refers to both the general time period over which these developments took place and the following changes to Neolithic human societies which are associated with the adoption of early farming techniques crop cultivation and the domestication of animals The Neolithic Revolution is important for developments in social organization and technology The changes most often associated with the Neolithic Revolution include an increased tendency to live in permanent or semi permanent settlements Because of this fewer people led a nomadic lifestyle To be able to know who the crops grown belonged to the concept of land ownership needed to be developed Modifications to the natural environment the ability to sustain higher population densities an increased reliance on vegetable and cereal foods in the total diet the development of hierarchy in society and of trading economies that use surplus production from increasing crop yields are other changes often cited

When humans started to domesticate crops and certain animals such as dogs goats sheep and cattle human society changed Because people now grew crops and raised livestock they no longer needed to move around that much They could build better settlements Their diet also changed It included more oats and vegetables People also started to keep and manage some foods  it was not advisable to eat all grain seeds because then there would be no seeds left to plant the next year Also as there were surpluses in some years these could be traded for other goods with other people

These changes happened in several places of the world independently They did not happen in the same order though The earliest farming societies in the Near East did not use pottery It is still unclear to what extent plants were domesticated in Britain or if permanently settled communities existed at all Early Japanese societies used pottery before developing agriculture

In the Paleolithic there were many different human species According to current research only the modern human reached the Neolithic though

Vere Gordon Childe gave the name Neolithic Revolution to this process in the 1920s He thought that it was as important as the Industrial Revolution

There are different theories why this transition could have happened

According to Harland there are three main categories of causes why the Paleolithic revolution happened

The British Army is the land armed forces branch of the British Armed Forces It came into being with unification of the Kingdoms of England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 The new British Army incorporated Regiments that had already existed in England and Scotland and was administered by the War Office from London Since 1963 it has been managed by the Ministry of Defence

From roughly 1763 the United Kingdom has been one of the leading military and economic powers of the world The British Empire expanded in this time to include colonies protectorates and Dominions throughout the Americas Africa Asia and Australasia Although the Royal Navy is widely regarded as having been vital for the rise of Empire and British dominance of the world the British Army played important roles in colonisation 

The British army was heavily involved in the Napoleonic Wars in which the army served in Spain across Europe and in North Africa The war between the British and French Empires stretched around the world The British Army finally came to defeat Napoleon at one of Britains greatest military victories at the battle of Waterloo

Under Oliver Cromwell the English Army had been active in the conquest and the settlement of Ireland since the 1650s The Cromwellian campaign was characterised by its uncompromising treatment of the Irish towns that had supported the Royalists during the English Civil War 

Mario Kart is a series of racing video games made by Nintendo It features Mario and his friends driving race karts The first game was called Super Mario Kart and was made for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console in 1993

Eight racers gather on a circuit and race for three or five laps until one kart finishes first Along the way players can pick up items to use against rivals Some items help the player and others hurt the other players For instance a lightning bolt will make all the other racers smaller and slow them down allowing the player who used it to speed ahead A mushroom will give a speed boost to the player who uses it

All games after Super Mario Kart feature another mode called battle mode In this mode all racers are given a number of balloons and they race around a track If they get hit by an item they lose one balloon and when they lose all of them they lose the game The last player with any balloons is the winner 

Each game features two different racing modes Players can either go right into whichever track of their choosing or they can play GP In GP players race on four or five tracks in a row and win a championship depending on how they place They receive points for how they placed in the race

The two latest games Mario Kart DS and Mario Kart Wii use the Nintendo Wi Fi Connection service to race against other players online In DS players could only race on tracks In Wii players can go into battle mode

Percy Bysshe Shelley was an English poet of the early nineteenth century He is widely thought of as one of most important poets of the Romantic movement in English literature Some of his poems like Ozymandias and Ode to the West Wind are among the most famous in English

Shelley was the son of a member of Parliament He attended the University of Oxford for only one year he was expelled for being an atheist In his own time Shelley was very unpopular for his political and religious views and for his personal conduct He married young but left his wife to run away with Mary Godwin After Shelleys first wife committed suicide Shelley married Mary Godwin she later became famous as Mary Shelley the author of the novel Frankenstein 

Shelley left England and spent much of his life travelling in Europe especially in Italy He became a close friend of the poet Lord Byron who also left England and travelled in Europe because of controversy at home Shelley continued to write poetry throughout this time he wrote several major works like the verse drama The Cenci and long poems like Alastor and Adonais as well as many shorter poems

About a month before his 30th birthday Shelley drowned in a boating accident off the coast of Italy He was one of a trio of important English Romantic poets of the same generation who died young the other two were Lord Byron and John Keats

Romani or Romany is the language of the Roma and Sinti The Indo Aryan Romani language should not be confused with either Romanian or Romansh both of which are Romance languages

Analysis of the Romani language has shown that it is closely related to those spoken in central and northern India Pothwari in particular This linguistic relationship is believed to indicate the Romas and Sintis geographical origin Loanwords in Romani make it possible to trace the pattern of their migration westwards 

The following table shows the distribution of Romani speakers in Europe according to Bakker et al The last column shows the percentage of Romani speakers in the Roma population in each country 

Fudge is a sometimes cake like candy that can be rich and can have the flavor of cocoa It is made by putting sugar butter milk and chocolate and mixing them together

Sinti or Sinta is the name of some communities of the nomadic people usually called Gypsies in English This includes communities known in German and Dutch as Zigeuner and in Italian as Zingari They are closely related to and are usually considered to be a subgroup of the Roma people

While the Sinti were until quite recently chiefly nomadic today only a small percentage of the group remains unsettled In earlier times they frequently lived on the outskirts of communities generally in squalor

The Sinti arrived in Germany and Austria in the Middle Ages eventually splitting into two groups Eftavagarja and Estraxarja These two groups then expanded the Eftavagarja into France where they assimilated into the local Romani groups and the Estraxarja into Italy and Eastern Europe mainly what are now Croatia Hungary Transylvania the Czech Republic and Slovakia eventually adopting various regional names

In Italy they are present mainly in Piedmont region

The Sinti have produced a great number of renowned musicians such as jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt

Bernoullis principle is a concept of fluid dynamics It says that when an incompressible fluid moves through different sizes of tube the fluids speed changes This change in velocity is called acceleration Newton showed that acceleration only occurs through the action of a force When a force acts over an area it is called pressure So any change in a fluids speed must be matched by a change in pressure Bernoulli saw that the speed of the flow went up in the smaller part of the tube while the pressure on the side of the tube went down

Basically the Bernoulli principle says that as speed of the fluid increases pressure decreases The photo on the right shows this happening The air in the wide part of the tube has a higher static pressure than the thin part For a steady flow the amount of fluid entering the pipe must equal the amount leaving the pipe so the fluid speed in the thin part must increase

The full version of Bernoullis principle includes both the work performed by the pressure and by the changes in potential energy from changes in height In this form the principle says the sum of the pressure kinetic energy and potential energy is a constant

The Book of Proverbs is a book in both the Tanakh and the Old Testament The book contains some of the most important teaching and instructions in each of their respective Religions 

Most scholars believe that Solomon was the writer of at least part of the book Other authors are mentioned as well but these references are missing in the Greek Septuagint The Septuagint sees King Solomon as the author of the whole Book of Proverbs In the Middle Ages scholars thought the Vulgate was a more faithful rendering of 301 and 311 In their eyes the words Agur and Lamuel were only other names for Solomon

Dates for the writing of the book are unclear Because of suggested authorship of Solomon and the workings of Hezekiahs men there are some dates that can be worked with However there are not enough to give specific timing to the completion of the book though it could have been as late as third century BC

English Renaissance drama or English Renaissance theatre means the stage plays written and acted in the later 16th century and the first half of the 17th century during the Renaissance period in England This period in English history saw a great growth in drama as an art form and public entertainment William Shakespeare widely thought of as the greatest writer in English literature is the most famous of many important playwrights poets and writers who worked in this era

English Renaissance drama is sometimes called Elizabethan drama since its most important developments started when Elizabeth I was queen of England from 1558 to 1603 But this name is not very accurate the drama continued after Elizabeths death into the reigns of King James I and his son King Charles I Shakespeare for example started writing plays in the later years of Elizabeths reign but continued into the reign of James When writing about plays from Jamess reign scholars and critics sometimes use the term Jacobean drama plays from Charles Is reign are called Caroline drama But for the subject as a whole terms like English Renaissance drama or theatre are more accurate

The year 1576 was a key date in this subject since that is when the first permanent theatre building was built in London It was called simply The Theatre because it was the only place of its kind in England at the time Before 1576 plays were acted in public halls and large houses and in inns and public squares and courtyards and other open spaces by troops of actors that mostly travelled around the countryside between cities and towns Once the actors had a permanent place to act plays they could develop their art without the constant need to travel The Theatre was followed by other theatres in the London area there were the Curtain The Rose the Swan the Globe and others too More plays were written by more playwrights to fill these theatres

Playwrights worked in both the classic types of drama tragedy and comedy They also began their own type of history play mainly about earlier English kings and the events of their reigns Richard Thayer Roberts the third and Shakespeares Richard III and Marlowes Edward II are two examples of this type of English history play Plays were often written in poetry early plays were mainly in rhymed verse though as time passed playwrights came to prefer unrhymed blank verse Prose was also used in some plays mostly for comedy

English Renaissance drama grew and developed until 1642 when it suddenly stopped In the early years of the English Civil War the Puritans who were fighting King Charles gained control of London and the region around it The Puritans were against play acting they thought it was sinful and immoral On September 2 1642 the Puritans forced the London theatres to close and to stay closed for most of the time until 1660 Then the English Restoration brought a new king Charles II who let the theatres re open In the 18 year gap between 1642 and 1660 English society had changed a good deal and a new style of drama rose up in the Restoration era it is usually called Restoration drama or Restoration theatre

The term Blank verse means poetry that does not use rhyme

Blank verse relies on the meter of the lines in the poem to give structure and to create the feeling of poetry as compared to prose An example from William Wordsworths poem Michael shows the lack of rhyme and the strict meter in blank verse each line sticks fairly closely to the pattern of ten syllables and five beats

Many critics judge blank verse to be better than rhyme for serious subjects and many poets have used blank verse for their most important works Shakespeare used rhyme in his early plays but in his more mature works like Hamlet he preferred blank verse John Milton wrote Paradise Lost in blank verse including a note at the beginning of the poem saying that rhyming poetry was used to disguise badly written poems and Wordsworth used it for The Prelude and The Excursion John Keats used rhyme in his Endymion his first try at a major poem for his second attempt Hyperion he switched to blank verse

Many 20th century poets gave up both rhyme and the strict meter of blank verse to write free verse

Bos primigenius namadicus

Bos primigenius mauretanicus

The Aurochs or urus was a large species of cattle once common in Europe but now extinct It was a wild animal not a domesticated animal The extinct aurochsurus is a completely separate species from the wisent

According to the Paleontologisk Museum University of Oslo aurochs developed in India some two million years ago came into the Middle East and farther into Asia and reached Europe about 250000 years ago They were once thought a different species from modern European cattle but today not any more 

Modern cattle have become much smaller than their wild ancestors the height of a large domesticated cow is about 15 meters while aurochs were about 175 meters 

Aurochs also had several features not often seen in modern cattle such as lyre shaped horns set at a forward angle a pale stripe down the spine and different color according to the gender Males were black with a pale stripe down the spine while females and calves were reddish Aurochs were also known to have very aggressive behaviour and killing one was seen as an act of courage in ancient cultures

At one time there were three aurochs subspecies namely Bos primigenius namadicus that occurred in India the Bos primigenius mauretanicus from North Africa and the Bos primigenius primigenius from Europe and the Middle East Only the European subspecies survived until recent times

The Battle of Marion was a military engagement in the American Civil War that occurred when Major General George Stoneman commander of the Union Army in Kentucky and Tennessee raided Southwestern Virginia General Stonemans plan was to destroy anything that might benefit the Southern war effort and was approved by his commanding officers on December 6 1864

The Confederates managed to hold the key positions on the battlefield against numerous Union charges Eventually the Confederates ran short of ammunition and were forced to withdraw The total casualties for this battle were 274 relatively low for a battle during the Civil War

After the battle the Union expedition set out to destroy the salt mines lead works and anything else in the area that could be of benefit to the Confederates

The town of Marion is in southwest Virginia on the Middle Fork of the Holston River in Smyth County Virginia It was about half way between the salt works at Saltville and the lead mines near Wytheville Since it is near the Mason Dixon line many of the towns families were divided and fought on opposing sides Until the winter of 1864 the town of Marion had been protected from fighting by the mountains and geographic location

Major General George Stoneman commander of the Union Army in Kentucky and Tennessee proposed another expedition into southwest Virginia to destroy all facilities and supplies of benefit to the Confederate war effort This gained the approval of Major General John Schofield on December 6 1864

Stoneman would use troops under General Alvan Gillem and those commanded by General Stephen Burbridge including the 5th and the 6th US Colored Cavalry who had participated in the failed previous attempt to destroy the salt works at the first Battle of Saltville Stoneman ordered Burbridge to bring his army of 4200 men through the Cumberland Gap to join Stoneman and General Gillem at Knoxville Tennessee where Gillem was refitting his own command into a picked force of 1500 men Stoneman did not reveal the objectives of the expedition to his subordinates until three days after it had departed Knoxville on December 10 On December 12 Stonemans force flanked and forced back Confederate General Basil Dukes cavalry at Rogersville Tennessee  The Federals defeated and scattered the Confederates the next day at Kingsport Tennessee There General Gillem captured 84 prisoners including Col Richard C Morgan and the brigades supply train 

On the 14th the Union army began to push Dukes cavalry back toward Abingdon Virginia The next day Stoneman and his cavalry went into camp at Glade Spring Virginia which was about convert13mikm west of Marion On December 16 Stonemans cavalry rode toward Marion destroying infrastructure and public buildings along their path

The opposing force of General Stoneman was the army of Major General John C Breckinridge who was the commander of the Department of Southwest Virginia Breckinridges command consisted of approximately 1000 regular troops with another 500 militia reserves Most of the army had been transferred to the Army of Northern Virginia to help in the defense of Richmond

Breckinridges army consisted of Colonel Henry Giltners brigade the 10th Kentucky Mounted Rifles and the 64th Virginia Mounted Infantry Breckinridges army also included General Basil Dukes cavalry General George Cosbys cavalry and Colonel Vincent Witcher and his 34th Battalion of Virginia Cavalry

On the night of December 16 General Breckinridge and his troops moved out of Saltville Virginia in an effort to stop Stoneman Taking the regular troops with him Breckinridge left Colonel Robert Preston in charge of the 500 militia men to defend the salt works General Breckinridge sent Witcher and his men of the 34th on ahead of his main force and ordered them to harass the Union army

At about 3 am Breckinridge and his small army began to travel across Walkers Mountain In the last few days before the march 4 of rain fell making travel difficult across the muddy roads At 400 am they reached the main road near Seven Mile Ford Virginia where Breckinridge waited for daylight before continuing

Around noon of December 17 1864 Breckinridges men mounted their horses rode toward Marion Meanwhile General Stoneman sent some of his Tennessee regiments to Wytheville Virginia to destroy anything that looked valuable Stoneman also sent two regiments of cavalry to destroy the lead mines and smelting facilities that were about ten miles from Wytheville

Stoneman and Burbridge continued on toward Marion where they encountered Witcher and his men Burbridges front regiment easily pushed back Witchers small regiment who stopped just so they could fire a volley into the Union cavalry They then continued to retreat toward Marion Witcher sent a courier to inform Breckinridge that they were coming to join them at Marion

General Breckinridges front regiment was the 10th Kentucky Mounted Rifles under the command of Colonel Benjamin Caudill Caudills men dismounted and fired into the Union cavalry causing several casualties As the rest of Breckinridges troops began to arrive on the scene General Stonemans men secured the high hill overlooking the river Breckinridge observed that these hills were the best defensive positions in the area following which he ordered the men of the 10th Kentucky Mounted Rifles to charge up the hill and drive out the Union army The rest of Giltners Brigade also joined in the charge routing the Union soldiers The result of the charge ended in Confederate favor and the Confederates gained control of the hill

Burbridge then began to form his men up in columns to counterattack the Rebel defenses As soon as the men were in position he ordered all columns to charge in unison After the signal the Union Army surged forward The first Confederate volley of shots depleted the Union forces considerably Even after the volley the Rebel forces were still vastly outnumbered Confederate Artillery commander Major Richard Page and his battery of four 10 pounder Parrott rifles began to fire attempting to slow the charge The overwhelming fire forced the Union soldiers to fall back with many casualtiesFactdateMarch 2008

The Union officers then reorganized their men and with a yell of their own charged again Like the previous charge this charge also was repelled One more charge occurred that day Courageously the men formed and prepared to face the withering fire that they knew would come from the breast works in their front For the final time that day the Union army charged into Confederate fire with the same results as the previous charges The Rebels had held on to their position during the first day of battle

Breckinridge ordered his men to move forward and build new breastworks These new defensive positions placed the two armies less than one hundred fifty yards apart During the night one Union officer was ordered to take positions at the covered bridge near the river He and 75 men took up positions in and around the covered bridge This was the only advance of that night by the Union army

The Union army that was positioned at the covered bridge fired the first few volleys at the rebels to harass their front positions General Burbridge attacked just as the fog lifted To entertain themselves soldiers from both armies began to hurl insults across the fields between them About midmorning Burbridge decided that the light rain probably would not stop falling any time soon and had his officers prepare to commence the battle

Both armies yet again raised their battle cries Columns of Union men charged across the fields into the same fire they had received the day before A combination of the colored and the white troops managed to push the 4th Kentucky Infantry and General Cosbys positions back Cosby rallied his men and counterattacked retaking their breastworks The Union soldiers that had taken positions at the covered bridge the night before began to take pressure from the 4th Kentucky in their front They realized their location was not safe one and some began to try to run back to the Union lines As these men would attempt to retreat from their positions at the bridge the rebels of the would pick most of them off The remaining Union soldiers at the bridge decided to wait out the battle Later in the day General Burbridge ordered one of his regiments to charge across the bridge on horseback to relieve the pressure on the trapped men The regiment solely received a few casualties and then retreated

On the far right General Duke was being pressed hard by the heavy columns of attacking soldiers Seeing this Colonel Giltner sent his regiment to reinforce Duke Before the 2nd arrived Duke and his men counterattacked the Union line and routed it Duke and Witcher then combined forces and charged the Unions extreme left flank This Union colored regiment was also completely routed

Burbridge and his men then went into a disorderly retreat The confederate rail breastworks had held but the holding of the line had resulted in the use of a huge amount of ammunition Each Rebel defender had shot at least seventy five rounds and some having fired as many as a hundred shots The Union army then ordered another charge with a large cavalry regiment that reinforced the Union infantry The unexpected fighting capabilities of the small Confederate army had temporarily created a reprieve for the salt works

Breckinridge ordered his field officers to make an inspection of the troops and to report back with the condition of his army The number of men wounded and killed had depleted his army to the point that he could judged that he could no longer hold back the Union army at the front lines Ammunition in the camp was also running low each man had no more than ten cartridges apiece With their supplies destroyed by Stonemans army at the towns of Wytheville and Abingdon there was little hope of being resupplied or reinforced in timeFactdateMarch 2008

Breckinridge then ordered his men to retreat from the battlefield Though the men faced miserable conditions they were confident they could hold the field the next day Angrily they obeyed orders and silently began to move out with Colonel Ben Caudill and his Mounted Rifles leading the way

The battle at Marion was a Union victory The vastly outnumbered Rebels had inflicted moderate casualties and slowed the advance on Saltville but were unable to stop it Finding their own path to Saltvilles defenses blocked Breckinridge and his men retreated further south while the Union raiders advanced FactdateMarch 2008Saltville would fall to a night attack on December 20  December 21 and the salt works would be destroyed by the Union army

The damage to the leadmines near Wytheville would keep them out of production for three months and then only partial production would be possible Salt production would not be resumed for over a month All railroad locomotives cars depots and bridges in the vicinity had been destroyed by the raid General Stoneman claimed to have captured 34 officers and 845 enlisted men during the raid

The Chauvet Cave or Chauvet Pont dArc Cave is near Vallon Pont dArc in the Ardche dpartement in southern France It became famous in 1994 when Paleolithic artwork was found on the wallsFossilized remains of many animals including some that are now extinct and some preserved footprints of animals and humans were also discovered The Cave was soon regarded as one of the most significant pre historic art sites along with Lascaux Altamira and Cosquer

The gorges of the Ardche region have many caves Many of them have geological or archaeological importance The Chauvet Cave however is unusually large and the artwork is well preserved and of good quality It has been called spectacular factdateJuly 2010 It appears to have been occupied by humans during two different periods the Aurignacian and the Gravettian Most of the artwork dates to the earlier Aurignacian era The only traces left of the later occupation during the Gravettian include a childs footprints the charred remains of ancient hearths and carbon smoke stains from torches that lit the caves It seems nobody had been in it after the child until it was discovered in 1994 The footprints are probably one of the oldest human footprints in existence being between 20000 and 30000 years old

The floor of the cave is of a soft material almost like clay There are paw prints of cave bears There are also large rounded depressions in the floor These are believed to be the nests where the bears slept There are many fossilized bones including the skulls of cave bears and the horned skull of an ibex

There are hundreds of animal paintings there At least 13 different species including those which have rarely or never been found in other ice age paintings are represented In addition to commonly hunted animals horses cattle reindeer etc The walls of the Chauvet Cave are covered with predatory animals lions panthers bears owls rhinos and hyenas Typical of most cave art there are no paintings of complete human figures although there is one possible partial Venus figure that may represent the legs and genitals of a woman A peculiar figure appears to have the lower body of a woman with the upper body of a bison There are a few panels of red ochre hand prints and hand stencils made by spitting pigment over hands pressed against the cave surface Abstract markingslines and dotsare throughout the cave There are also two unidentifiable images that have a vaguely butterfly shape to them This combination of subjects has led experts in pre historic art and cultures to believe that there was likely a ritualistic shamanistic or magical aspect to these paintings

The artists who produced these unique paintings used techniques not often observed in other cave art Many of the paintings appear to have been made only after the walls were scraped clear of debris and concretions This left a smoother and noticeably lighter area upon which the artists worked Similarly a three dimensional quality is achieved by incising or etching about the outlines of certain figures This visually emphasizes some of the animals and allows torch light to cast shadows about the edges

The cave contains the oldest known cave paintings based on radiocarbon dating of black from drawings from torch marks and from the floors Clottes concludes that the dates fall into two groups one centred around 27000 26000 BP and the other around 32000 30000 BP As of 1999 the dates of 31 samples from the cave had been reported with the earliest being 32900490 BP

However some archaeologists have questioned these dates 

The cave was named after Jean Marie Chauvet who discovered it on December 181994 together with Christian Hillaire and Eliette Brunel Deschamps

The researchers found that the cave had been untouched for 20000 30000 years

Druidism or Druidry is a form of modern spirituality that generally promotes harmony with nature often through the form of nature worship It is considered to be a Neopagan faith 

Originally inspired by 17th 18th and 19th century romantic movements early neo druidism was based upon largely historically incorrect depictions of the Iron Age Celtic druids and has no direct relation to the ancient Celts or their culture 

Neo druidic beliefs vary wildly and there is no set dogma or belief system by which all adherents follow The main belief is an idea that the Earth and nature is sacred and is worthy of worship itself For this reason many druids are pantheistic

A Metcard is a type of ticket used to use public transport in Melbourne Australia It allows the holder to use Trains Trams and Buses in two zones Zone 1 covers areas close to the CBD and Zone 2 covers the rest of the city There used to be a Zone 3 but that has been merged with Zone 2 The ticket is about the size of a credit card and contains a magnitic strip that tells a computer what type of ticket it is

Metcard replaced a identical yet simpler system of scratchies used on the Melbourne public transport network Scratchies were easy to cheat and the system was eventually abandoned in 2002 but not before tickets for many years of use were printed

Moves towards automated ticketing were first made by the then state Liberal Government in 1992 Tenders were called for the design supply installation and on going maintenance of such a system with the OneLink Transit Consortium announced as the preferred people to do it in September 1993 The contract was signed in May 1994 with the major technology supplier being the ERG Group 

Testing of prototypes commenced in December 1993 and the roll out of the system was carried out from August 1996 to April 1998 and acceptance occurred in November 1997 Public field trials were carried out on buses from August 20 1996 and on rail services from September 18 1996 The system commenced full revenue service from May 1998 at a cost of 330 million Contractual issues between OneLink and the Victorian Government were not settled until May 2002 with the payment of up to 65 million in a staged settlement

Controversy surrounded Metcard at its introduction due to it costing to much the abolition of tram conductors and the unreliability of ticket purchasing and validation machines The machines were attacked by vandals frequently and have seen several revisions to their design since

Consistent with the privatisation ethos of the government of the day Metcards operation was entirely outsourced with the transport operators having nothing to do with the system Metcard even had its own website and branding which became stronger than the anonymous and constantly renaming government then privatised operators

An study released by the State Government in 2001 showed over 1 in 4 of the machines at train stations did not work and 119 of mobile equipment in buses and trams was non operational The State Government renegotiated with ticketing network contract operator OneLink Transit Systems to improve the service to commuters Following these improvements a 2002 audit showed an increase in availability of machines to 921 at train stations and 983 on buses and trams Usability was also improved with tram machines able to sell daily tickets Furthermore vandalism across the network dropped by 62 between 2001 and 2002

VLine tickets were aligned with the Metcard system in April 2006 with each VLine ticket to stations in the Metcard area having the relevant zones printed on them In March 2007 the Nightrider bus service was also brought under the Metcard system Zone 3 was removed from the Metcard system on March 4 2007 due to a State Election promise made by Opposition Leader Ted Ballieu and matched by then Premier Steve Bracks 

The original Metcard contract with OneLink was to last nine years expiring in March 2007 In 2005 the contract was changed to permit the system to be extended and changed as work on the replacement myki project keeps going with the contract being able to be cancelled on six months notice

Most Metcards can be purchased in Zone 1 Zone 2 and Zone 1 Zone 2 types with them being valid within their respective zones All Metcards except for the City Saver Metcard are valid for muplitle trips on Trains Trams and Buses

Secondary sex characteristics are features that make it easy to tell the sexes of a species apart The features are not directly linked to reproduction 

Male birds usually have much more colourful feathers the females are better able to hide their feathers stands out less

Well known secondary sex characteristics in humans are the deeper voice facial hair and more muscular build in men In women those characteristics usually cited are more prominent breasts lips eyes hair wider hips more fat and generally a higher voice Faces generally make a big impact It is the part other people interact with

However the wider hips are needed to give birth Babies are born through the space between the three bones of a womans pelvis So is doubtful to call this a secondary characteristic except so far as the width helps attract mates Breasts are also essential but in humans they are much larger in proportion to other mammals and they do serve to attract males

Africas ancient historic period includes the rise of Egyptian civilization the further development of societies outside the Nile River Valley and the interaction between them and civilizations outside of Africa In the late 7th century North and East Africa were heavily influenced by the spread of Islam That lead to the appearance of new cultures such as those of the Swahili people This also lead to an increase in the Slave trade that had a very bad influence for the development of the whole continent till the 19th century African independence movements had their fist success in 1951 when Libya became the first former colony to become independent Modern African history has been full of revolutions and wars as well as the growth of modern African economies and democratization across the continent

The history of America is the history of North and South America including Central America and the Caribbean It begins with people migrating to these areas from Asia and possibly Oceania during the height of an Ice age These groups are generally believed to have been isolated from peoples of the Old World until the coming of Europeans in the 10th and 15th centuries

The ancestors of todays Native Americans were hunter gatherers who migrated into North America The most popular theory says that migrants came to the Americas via the Bering Land Bridge Beringia the land mass covered by the cold ocean waters in the Bering Strait Small Paleo Indian groups probably followed the mammoth and other prey animals It is possible that groups of people may also have traveled into North America on shelf or sheet ice along the northern Pacific coast

Cultural traits brought by the first immigrants later evolved and spawned such cultures as Iroquois on North America and Pirah of South America These cultures later developed into civilizations In many cases these cultures expanded at a later date than their Old World counterparts Cultures that may be considered advanced or civilized include Cahokia Zapotec Toltecs Olmec Aztecs Chimor and the Inca

The Pueblo people of what is now the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico living conditions were that of large stone apartment like adobe structures They live in Arizona New Mexico Utah Colorado and possibly surrounding areas

Chichimeca was the name that the Mexica applied to a wide range of semi nomadic peoples who inhabited the north of modern day Mexico and had the same sense as the European term barbarian The name was adopted with a negative tone by the Spaniards when they spoke of the semi nomadic hunter gatherer peoples of northern Mexico

The Zapotec emerged around 1500 years BCE Their writing system influenced the later Olmec They left behind the great city Monte Alban

The Olmec civilization emerged around 1200 BCE in Mesoamerica and ended around 400 BCE Olmec art and concepts influenced surrounding cultures after their downfall This civilization was thought to be the first in America to develop a writing system After the Olmecs abandoned their cities for unknown reasons the Maya Zapotec and Teotihuacan arose

Maya history spans 3000 years The Maya may have collapsed due to changing climate in the end of the 10th century

The Toltec were a nomadic people dating from the 10th  12th century whose language was also spoken by the Aztecs

Teotihuacan was both a city and an empire of the same name which at its zenith between 150 and the 5th century covered most of Mesoamerica

The Aztec having started to build their empire around 14th century found their civilization abruptly ended by the Spanish conquistadors They lived in Mesoamerica and surrounding lands Their capital city Tenochtitlan was one of the largest cities of all time

The oldest known civilization of the Americas was established in the Norte Chico region of modern Peru Complex society emerged in the group of coastal valleys between 3000 and 1800 BCE The Quipu a distinctive recording device among Andean civilizations apparently dates from the era of Norte Chico 

The Chavn established a trade network and developed agriculture by as early as 900 BCE according to some estimates and archaeological finds Artifacts were found at a site called Chavn in modern Peru at an elevation of 3177 meters Chavn civilization spanned from 900 BCE to 300 BCE

Holding their capital at the great city of Cusco the Inca civilization dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533 Known as Tahuantinsuyu or the land of the four regions in Quechua the Inca culture was highly distinct and developed Cities were built with precise unmatched stonework constructed over many levels of mountain terrain Terrace farming was a useful form of agriculture There is evidence of excellent metalwork and even successful brain surgery in Inca civilization

A continental divide is a line of raised terrain that creates a border between two watersheds Water falling on one side of the line travels to one ocean and water on the other side travels to another perhaps on the other side of the continent 

Because the exact border between bodies of water is usually not very easy to see the continental divide is not always clear The International Hydrographic Organizations publication Limits of Oceans and Seas describes the exact boundaries of oceans but it is not recognized around the world A complication is that some rivers empty into deserts or inland seas and so do not end up in the ocean

The Sassanid Empire or Sassanian Dynasty is the name used for the Persian dynasty which lasted from 224 to 651 AD 

The Sassanid Empire which succeeded the Parthian Empire was recognized as one of the two main powers in Western Asia alongside the Roman Empire and later the Byzantine Empire for more than 400 years

The Sassanid dynasty was founded by Ardashir I when he had defeated the last Parthian king Artabanus IV and ended when the last Sassanid Shahanshah Yazdegerd III lost a 14 year struggle to drive out the early Arab Caliphate the first of the Islamic empires 

The Sassanid Empires traditional territory included all of todays Iran Iraq Armenia Afghanistan eastern parts of Turkey and parts of Syria Pakistan Caucasia Central Asia and Arabia 

The Sassanid era is considered to be one of the most important and influential historical periods in Iran In many ways the Sassanid period saw the highest achievement of Persian civilization and constituted the last great Iranian Empire before the Muslim conquest and adoption of Islam 

Persia influenced Roman civilization considerably during the Sassanids timesp109 and the Romans reserved for the Sassanid Persians alone the status of equals The Roman Emperor wrote letters to the Persian Shahanshah which were addressed to my brother Their cultural influence extended far beyond the empires territorial borders reaching as far as Western Europe Africa China and India and played a prominent role in the formation of both European and Asiatic medieval art 

This influence carried forward to the early Islamic world The dynastys unique aristocratic culture transformed the Islamic conquest of Iran into a Persian renaissance Much of what later became known as Islamic culture architecture writing and other skills were borrowed mainly from the Sassanid Persians and propagated throughout the broader Muslim world

In the spring of 632 a grandson of Khosrau I Yazdegerd III who had lived in hiding ascended the throne In that same year the first raiders from the Arab tribes made their raids into Persian territory They were united by Islam Years of warfare had exhausted both the Byzantines and the Persians The Sassanids were further weakened by economic decline heavy taxation religious unrest rigid social stratification the increasing power of the provincial landholders and a rapid turnover of rulers These factors made the Islamic conquest of Persia easier than it would have been in earlier times

The Sassanids never mounted a truly effective resistance to the pressure applied by the early Arab armies

The Transcendental Meditation technique or TM technique is a kind of meditation that was developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Today the name is trademarked

The meditation is practiced while sitting down with the eyes closed and is practiced twice a day A review of research studies found the effects of this mediation technique to be the same as health education while other studies found the technique to have positive health effects

The Transcendental Meditation technique is learned in seven steps There are two lectures and a personal interview followed by four sessions in which the student learns how to meditate and the meditation is checked to make sure the technique is being done correctly

The goal of the Transcendental Meditation technique is said to be that the meditator continue to feel the deep rest and the comfort of the meditation while living everyday life

In 1955 Maharishi Mahesh Yogi began teaching a meditation technique he says was based on the Vedas He gave this method for meditation the name Transcendental Meditation

Before this Maharishi had studied with Swami Brahmananda Saraswati and was his secretary from 1941 until Brahmananda Saraswatis death in 1953 In 1957 Maharishi began the Spiritual Regeneration Movement in Madras India on the final day of a festival held in memory of his teacher In 1958 he began the first of a number of worldwide tours in which he began to teach the TM technique to people around the world

In the early 1970s Maharishi began to establish one Transcendental Meditation teaching center for each million of the people in the world which at that time would have meant 3600 Transcendental Meditation centers throughout the world In 1990 Maharishi moved to the town of Vlodrop the Netherlands where he began an organization he called The Global Country of World Peace that takes care of all of the teaching of the Transcendental Meditation technique around the world and says there are more than 6 million people worldwide who have learned the Transcendental Meditation technique

Transcendental Meditation has been found not to have any advantages over health education in improving a persons health 

Transcendental Meditation has been researched on since 1970 The earliest study done in 1970 showed that with the Transcendental Meditation technique the body rests deeply but is not asleep and is alert This study also showed that with the Transcendental Meditation technique stress became less

A study published in 1977 showed no effect on blood pressure Later studies show that the Transcendental Meditation technique has positive effects on blood pressure cholesterol insomnia aging illness smoking alcoholism anxiety heart attack and stroke

Transcendental Meditation websites say the Transcendental Meditation technique does not interfere with religion 

Cardinal Sin an Archbishop in the Catholic Church believes the technique interferes with Christian religions There are clergy who believe the technique does not interfere with religious belief and practices

International health means two different but related things It means care of people who travel from one country to another and knowledge of diseases foreign to the traveler It also means people from one country trying to improve health in another

There are different kinds of groups that are involved in international health They engage in international health for different reasons and with different ethics and rules

Governments of wealthy developed countries are often interested in the health of other countries They are especially interested in the health of neighbor countries The reasons for this are many if they have extra resources they may want to share them with their neighbors but also they may want to stop spread of diseases from their neighbor country across the border For example the United States is a richer country than Mexico and has little problem with measles or rabies in the interior but along the border with Mexico these diseases are more common

The Western Hemispheres countries have formed PAHO the Pan American Health Organization to deal with these kinds of problems in an organized way PAHO knows that people and goods flow across borders in both directions and a problem in one counbtry will soon be a problem in its partner countries PAHO is an example of an international organization

Non government organizations are associations organized outside of the government by volunteers and others and which serve a particular interest Often NGOs interested in health perform important functions in international health both in direct care and in development

Two years ago Heihachi could not capture Ogre

Not wanting to give up Heihachi said to his researchers to get blood samples skin tissue and hoof fragments left behind by Ogre in order to conduct genetic experiments Heihachis goal was to make a new life form by splicing Ogres genome with his own However the research was unsuccessful

After long experimentation Heihachis bioengineers came to the conclusion that an extra gene  the Devil Gene  was needed in order to successfully splice Ogres genetic code into another living organism Heihachi learned that his own genome did not have the Devil Gene but he knew someone who had it Jin Kazama

Jin who defeated Ogre in The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3 was shot and wounded by Heihachi As his life slipped away Jin transformed into a Devil Upon his transformation he struck down Heihachi and took flight Jins whereabouts were unknown after the Tournament

Heihachi searched for Jin to no avail However Heihachi found a photograph during his search that made him curious The 20 year old photograph was an image of a burnt corpse covered with laceration wounds Heihachi paid much attention to the corpses back which had what looked like deformed protruding wing like limbs

Thinking that the picture was of Kazuya his own son whom he threw into a volcano 20 years ago Heihachi diverted all his resources into a search for the body This search led Heihachi to G Corporation a modern biotech firm making unprecedented advances in the field of biogenetics research

Heihachi found out that the G Corporation found the corpse and got its genetic data In fact Heihachi learned that the company was in the middle of creating a new life form by using the data Heihachi also determined that Kazuyas remains and research data were secured at G Corporations Nebraska and Nepal research laboratories respectively

Friday 25 December The Tekken Force raided G Corporations maximum security research laboratory in Nepal The bottom floors of the building were destroyed and the remaining data storage facility containing file servers was taken away by a group of heavy duty helicopters

At the same time a separate unit led by Heihachi infiltrated the underground research facility in Nebraska where Kazuyas remains were preserved As Heihachi looked from his helicopter he soon realized that unlike the Nepal facility the operations in Nebraska were not going according to plan The tactical status monitor screens showed the first wave of the Tekken Force troops being blown out from the storage room where Kazuyas remains were supposedly kept

A silhouette of a large figure slowly emerged from the room When Heihachi could see clearly enough he instantly recognized the large figure as Kazuya

Kazuya was brought back to life in G Corporations research facility After his resurrection Kazuya offered his body as research material to determine the true nature of the Devil that resided within him Kazuyas goal was to combine his two selves into one Kazuya theorized that if he unified his body with the Devil he would be able to truly get its powers He could then finally take revenge against Heihachi and the Mishima Zaibatsu

Enraged that Heihachi thwarted his plans Kazuya obliterated the heavily armed Tekken Force and vanished into the flames of the labs wreckage Heihachi was infuriated by Kazuyas escape and took out his anger on his hapless subordinates who reported the escape

Dr Abel Heihachis lead scientific advisor urged the enraged Heihachi to quickly find a way to capture Kazuya Once his anger subsided Heihachi focused his mind and decided on a plan An evil smile crept upon his lips

Two years had passed since The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3 The Mishima Zaibatsu announced The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 and placed the massive financial empire as the top prize The champion who manages to defeat Heihachi at the end of the Tournament would inherit the Mishima Zaibatsu

Well aware that the tournament is just a trap designed to lure him out Kazuya nevertheless enters  it is his chance to defeat Heihachi

After hearing of Heihachis death people though that it would bring the end of the Mishima Zaibatsu However an unknown person had taken control and a month later Mishima Zaibatsu announced the opening of The King of Iron Fist Tournament 5

Following the end of the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 Heihachi Mishima defeated Kazuya Mishima and led him to Honmaru Temple planning to let both his son Kazuya and his grandson Jin Kazama battle and steal their Devil Genes Jin defeats both his father and his grandfather and flies away leaving the latter two asleep Shortly after a group Jack 4 robots invade the Honmaru The robots were made to take Heihachis life At the start Kazuya and Heihachi fight the Jack 4s as a team but eventually Kazuya throws Heihachi across the room as soon as he notices that Heihachi is getting tired Then Kazuya turns into Devil Kazuya and escapes leaving Heihachi to deal with the Jack 4s by himself They quickly explode leaving Heihach The explosion brings Heihachis father Jinpachi Mishima back to life from his 50 year sleep beneath the Temple and goes to and become head of the Mishima Zaibatsu A few months later the King of Iron Fist Tournament 5 is announced It turns out that Heihachi survived the explosion and now promises to find out and break the neck of the one who started this ridiculous tournament

Sola fide means Faith only Most protestants believe that people must trust Jesus They have to trust that Jesus brings people back into relationship with God Christians believe that sin creates a gap between people and God and Jesus who was perfect died taking the punishment for sin in place of people bridging the gap This is called salvation because Jesus saves people from a life and afterlife without God The idea of sola fide means that trust in Jesus is the only way to get salvation and finally get into heaven after death

The Rosenhan experiment is a test in psychiatry It wants to see how good a psychiatric diagnosis really is The first person to do the test was David Rosenhan The test is named after him It was first conducted in 1972 Rosenhan published the results in the journal Science under the title On being sane in insane places

The test is made of two parts In the first part psychiatrically sane people said they saw hallucinations to get admitted to a psychiatric ward This was done to test how the psychiatric hospitals would react The second part was the reverse Rosahan told the hospitals he would send fake patients But he did not send any fake patients 

The results of the study were very controversial When Rosenhan sent the people the hospitals was unable to detect them On the other hand when he told them he had sent some patients but really did not the hospitals recognised a large number of fake patients The study said that it was impossible to tell a difference between the sane and the insane

809 Lundia is a small binary V type asteroid orbiting in the Flora family in the Main Belt It is named after Lund Observatory Sweden

The V type spectrum says that it is not genetically related to the Flora family but rather is probably a piece blown off the surface of nearby 4 Vesta by a big impact in the past Its orbit is too far from Vesta for it to actually be a member of the Vesta family It is not clear how it came at an orbit so far from Vesta but other examples of V type asteroids fairly far from their parent body are known A mechanism of interplay between the Yarkovsky effect and nonlinear secular resonances has been suggested

A moon designated S2005 1 was seen based on lightcurve sightings in 2005 In fact the size of the two bodies appear to be close in size because during mutual occultations the brightness drops by a similar amount independently of which body is hidden Assuming an albedo similar to 4 Vesta suggests that the bodies are about 7 km across It takes 154 hours to orbit each other which says that the binary is very close the separation being of the order of 10 20 km if normal asteroid albedo and density values are assumed

Hato Mayor is a Dominican province it is on the eastern part of the country Its name comes from the name of its capital city Hato Mayor del Rey

It is one of the last provinces created in the Dominican Republic it was made a province on 3 December 1984 The provinces territory was part of the El Seibo province

Hato Mayor is bordered to the northwest by the province of Saman to the west by Monte Plata and to the south by the San Pedro de Macors province The Saman Bay is to the north of the province

Some native groups lived close to the coast in caves in Los Haitises region There were other groups mainly Tanos living inland but in general the population was low

When the Spanish people came to this region they found that there were many savannas with good grasses for food for cattle horses and sheep And they made nine hatos Hato is a word from southern Spain that means a large farm for raising cattle it is a common word in the Dominican Republic One of those hatos was Hato Mayor del Rey made in the name of King Charles I of Spain but given as a Mayorazgo to Francisco Dvila as the manager and the property was called sometimes Hato Mayor de Dvila

Because there were many French people and from other countries trying to live in the Saman region the colonial government founded the city of Sabana de la Mar in 1760 and brought people from the Canary Islands to live here

The area of Hato Mayor was part of the El Seibo province until the new province began in 1984

In 2002 there were 87631 people living in the Hato Mayor province and 58769 living in towns and cities The population density was 66 personskm

The estimated population in the province for 2007 was of 98491 inhabitants 51019 men and 47472 women for a population density of 7409 personskm

Hato Mayor has a total area of 132929 km It has 27 of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 15th largest province

The territory of the province covers across four geographical regions From north to south these regions are

Rivers with their sources on the northern side of the Cordillera Oriental are short and flow into the Saman Bay The longest here is the River Yabn with its mouth west of the city of Sabana de la Mar

Those rivers that flow to the south of the Cordillera Oriental and into the Caribbean Sea are longer The most important rivers are from east to west

There are two main roads in the province One is the Carretera Mella that begins in Santo Domingo and goes through Hato Mayor del Seibo the El Seibo province and ends in Higey it is one of the most important road in the country

The second road begins in Hato Mayor del Rey and ends in Sabana de la Mar

There are 3 municipalities and 4 municipal districts in the province Municipal districts are similar to municipalities but they depend on a municipality

The municipalities and its municipal districts are

The main economic activity of the province is farming the main products are cacao flowers and oil palm around El Valle and sugar cane south of Hato Mayor

Because there are many savannas with grasses around Hato Mayor del Rey and to the south of it cattle raising is a very important activity in the province the dairy industry is important with a large amount of cheese produced in the province

Fishing is important in Sabana de la Mar and other towns around the Saman Bay

The scanning electron microscope is a type of electron microscope that uses a focused beam of high energy electrons in producing a variety of signals at the surface of a solid specimen The signals produced by the interacting electrons contain useful information such as the shape atomic structure and conductivity

When an electron hits the surface it may be reflected absorbed or conducted away Electrons that are absorbed can cause the atom that they hit to become unstable forcing it to give off another electron or to give off light in order to stabilize Different detectors for the different types of reactions may be fitted to an electron microscope depending on what is being looked for

The magnification that can be achieved in a scanning electron microscope depends on how narrow the beam of electrons that strikes the surface can be and can reach 1 nanometer about the size of 3 to 5 atoms The control of the beam is achieved using magnetic fields with other magnetic fields being used to shape the beam and to move it across the sample The range of magnification may range from 30x to as high as 500000x

The electron beam is affected by air and water molecules so the sample must be placed in a vacuum The sample must also be conductive to allow the electrons not reflected or absorbed to be conducted away This gives some limits on the type of sample that can be used In the case of samples from plants or animals it often means that they must first be coated in gold before they can be placed in the microscope This is done in order to preserve the sample and keep it from changing or decaying throughout the scanning process

The scanning electron microscope is made up of several components

1 The electron gun is located at the very top or bottom of an SEM and is used to fire a beam of electrons at the object that we are looking at under SEM

2 The lenses are used to focus electron beams so that we can get clear and detailed images of the examined object They are not made of glass but they are made of magnets that change the path of electrons created from the electron gun

3 The sample chamber is the area where the specimen of interest is examined under SEM As the technique is very sensitive the chamber must be very sturdy and have no vibrations happen This is to allow for the specimen to be kept very still in order for the SEM to produce good images

4 The detector is the eyes of the microscope It is able to produce the most detailed images of a specimens surface Many different detectors can be used depending upon the information wanted from the sample used

5 The vacuum chamber is used to keep the electron beam from constant interference from air The air particles are bad for electron beams in that the electrons would be knocked out of the air and onto the specimen which will produce bad distorted surfaces of the specimen

Five OceansLocationOceans

An ocean is a large area of salt water between continents Oceans are very big and they join smaller seas together Together the oceans are like one ocean because all the oceans are joined Oceans cover 70 of our planet The largest ocean is the Pacific Ocean It covers 13 of the Earths surface The smallest ocean is the Arctic Ocean Different water movements separate the Southern Ocean from the Atlantic Pacific and Indian oceans It is also known as the Antarctic Ocean because it covers the area around Antarctica Older maps may not use the names Arctic Ocean and Southern Ocean The deepest ocean is the Pacific ocean The deepest point is the Mariana Trench being about 11000 metres deep The deep ocean is characterized by cold temperatures high pressure and complete darkness Some very unusual organisms live in this part of the ocean They do not require energy from the sun to survive because they use chemicals from deep inside the earth

Although many people believe that the oceans are blue because the water reflects the blue sky this is actually not true Water has a very slight blue color that can only be seen when there is a lot of water However the main cause of the blue or bluegreen color of the oceans is that water absorbs the red part of the incoming light and reflects the green and blue part of the light We then see the reflected light as the color of water

Organisms that live in oceans can live in salt water They are affected by sunlight temperature water pressure and water movement Different ocean organisms live near the surface in shallow waters and in deep waters Small plant organisms that live near the surface and use sunlight to produce food are called phytoplankton Almost all animals in the ocean depend directly or indirectly on these plants In shallow water you may find lobsters and crabs In deeper water marine animals of many different shapes and sizes swim through the ocean These include many types of fish such as tuna swordfish and marine mammals like dolphins and whales The skies above the open ocean are home to large sea birds such as the albatross

Nations like Russia and Japan have lots of huge ships that go to some of the worlds best fishing areas for many months These large ships have libraries hospitals schools repair shops and other things that are needed for fishermen and their families

Many people look at the sea as a source of food minerals and energy

Oceanographers estimate that over 15300 types of fish live in the oceans some of which are used for food Fish are a fine source of protein so many people eat them Fishing industries are very important because they make jobs and give food to millions of people Today usually through ocean fishing the ocean supplies about 2 of the calories needed by people Tuna anchovies and herring are harvested close to the surface of the ocean Pollock flounder and cod are caught near the ocean floor More than a million tons of herring are caught every year in the North Pacific and North Atlantic and almost eight fish out of ten fish are eaten as food for humans The other fish are used as broken wikt linkfertilizationfertilizer glue and pet and other animal food

There are many different ocean temperatures in the open ocean both vertically and broken wikt linkhorizonhorizontally Icebergs are made over very cold waters at either pole while waters at the equator are pretty warm Water cools and warms more slowly than land does so land influenced by the ocean has later and milder seasons than land that is farther away from the ocean

The surface part of the ocean also called the mixed layer is not much colder even when we go deeper down Below this surface zone is a layer of sudden temperature difference called a thermocline This is a middle layer hat is from the surface zone down to about 2600 feet Thermoclines may happen only at seasons or permanently and may change depending on where and how deep it is As evaporation happens it begins cooling and if the water evaporates very quickly the water becomes saltier The salty cold water is denser so it sinks This is why warm and cold waters do not easily mix Most animals and plants live in the warm upper layer Below the thermocline temperature in the deep zone is so cold it is just above freezing  between 32 ndash 374 F

A tebibyte is a unit of measurement in computers and similar electronic devices Tebibytes hold 1024 gibibytes or 1099511627776 bytes Some people call this number of bytes a terabyte

1024 tebibytes make one exbibyte

A petabyte is a unit of measurement in computers and similar electronic devices Petabytes hold 1000 terabytes or a thousand trillion bytes 

Large organisations use petabytes of storage to hold massive amounts of data To store this amount of data at home would require about 1000 large home computers People at home probably do not use petabytes they would use terabytes gigabytes megabytes and occasionally kilobytes

One thousand petabytes make one exabyte 

An exabyte is a unit of measurement for computers of the future Exabytes hold 1000 petabytes or a million trillion bytes An exabyte is so large that it would take about one million powerful home computers to store this amount of data

One thousand exabytes make one zettabyte

A zettabyte is a unit of measurement for computers of the future Zettabytes hold 1000 exabytes or a billion trillion bytes and 1000 zettabytes make one yottabyte 

A zettabyte is so large that it would take about a million supercomputers to store this amount of data

A yottabyte is a unit of measurement for computers of the future Yottabytes hold 1000 zettabytes or a trillion trillion bytes 

A yottabyte is so large that it would take about one thousand million supercomputers to store this amount of data

Natures services is a term for the ways in which nature benefits humans It means particularly those benefits that can be measured in economic terms Robert Costanza and other theorists of natural capital analysed natures services to humanity in the 1990s 

The economic contribution of seventeen of these services they calculated to be about US33 trillion per year greater than the activities of the whole human economy which was about US25 trillion This was based on estimated costs of replacing the services nature provides For that purpose they were compared with equivalent services that are produced by humans This calculation makes clear that mankind cannot develop without natures services

This study is central for the theory of natural capital 

But this study had no great influence on government policy or on WTO IMF or G8 economic and trade policy 

Signing Time is a childrens television show It teaches American Sign Language to children age one through eight It is shown in the United States It is hosted by Rachel de Azevedo Coleman It is shown by American Public Television in many cities across the United States

Research shows that sign language can help childrens learning ability to grow With just a few simple American Sign Language signs babies and toddlers some as young as nine months old can show people their needs before they can speak which may make them have fewer tantrums School aged children enjoy the benefits of learning a second language Children with developmental delays or special needs can find their own voice by using their hands to talk using sign language

Signing Time helps children learn through three senses visual auditory and kinesthetic and reaches children with different learning styles and abilities by making children want to communicate with other people through signing singing speaking and dancing

In the series songwriter and musician Rachel Coleman her daughter Leah Alex and their pet frog named Hopkins who is a cartoon teach hundreds of useful American Sign Language signs Children learn signs for words questions phrases movements colors sports days of the week everyday objects and activities that are done a lot Signing Time makes learning sign language easy for the whole family

In 1996 Rachel Coleman had a daughter who was named Leah Fourteen months after she was born Rachel and her husband Aaron found out that Leah was deaf since she was born After that the couple started to teach Leah sign language first with Signing Exact English then with American Sign Languageso that they could learn to communicate becoming good signers Rachel was surprised to see that after six months Leahs sign language vocabulary had more words the vocabulary of hearing children her same age Rachels sister Emilie Brown and her husband Derek were teaching Leahs baby cousin Alex how to sign and he learned it quickly also

A few years later Rachel had a second daughter Lucy was born 8 weeks premature with spina bifida and cerebral palsy Doctors worried that because of her cerebral palsy Lucy would never be able to speak or use sign language to communicate with her deaf sister but after the first volume was made Lucy started to sign and later to speak Rachel then thought that signing could be beneficial to all children

Rachel and Emilie decided to make a video for hearing children so that American Sign Language could be made accessible to all children and made Two Little Hands Productions their producing company together

Rachel hosts the show herself with her daughter Leah and nephew Alex also starring to help teach signs In My First Signs Rachel was not going to be in the videos but she was added to show the signs because Alex and Leah could not sign clearly enough all the time to teach viewers the signs In the earlier episodes Rachel did not want to sing and sign at the same time since it causes some problems for those who want true American Sign Language but customers responded wanting more songs and wanting to learn signs from them So already being a musician Rachel wrote more songs Rachel sings a lot of songs during each episode signing the words at the same time During the episode Rachel shows many signs from a certain topic and then has Leah and Alex signthey sign first nowalongside with many other children of different backgrounds After that the words are emphasized with song

The second season has a new layout that includes new signs and more original music Each program teaches signs from one theme marked by a theme song which is taught verse by verse This lets children develop a comforting knowing of the melody line of each song helping to give them a sense of mastery and a feeling like they are actually with the characters as they sing and sign along Also new parts ABC Time Counting Time Game Time Story Time and HoppingMoving Time look into the episode theme or other skills in a playful way These segments use teaching methods such as mnemonics songs stories and games which are good for many different learning styles and abilities by promoting wikt interactioninteraction through signing singing speaking and dancing

Rachel is the host of the Signing Time series She has spent much of her adult life working in entertainment While performing with her band We the Living Rachel foun out that her 14 month old daughter Leah was deaf Rachels second daughter Lucy had fetal surgery for spina bifida and was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy In spite of such limitations Lucy now communicates with both speech and sign language After years of musical silence Rachel has picked up that guitar again writing and performing all of the songs for Signing Time She used to sing for her band Now she sings for Lucy Leah and children everywhere In addition to starring in Signing Time Rachel is also a popular singer performer and speaker and has performed for hundreds of thousands of children all across the country

An arrowhead is point of an arrow or a shape resembling such a point

Arrowheads are found all over the United States Archaeologically they are usually made of stone primarily being flint obsidian or chert but in many excavations bone wooden and metal arrowheads have been found 

In North America Arrowheads are sometimes mistakenly attributed to the Historic Period American Indians but are actually from North Americas prehistoric ancestors some arrowheads date back to over 15000 years old 

In Scandinavia during the Viking age a wide range of arrowheads were used for a variety of tasks

Arrowheads are attached to arrow shafts and may be thrown or fired from a bow

Obsidian is a natural volcanic glass found as a kind of igneous rock It is produced when lava high in silica cools rapidly and solidifies without time for crystal growth Because there is no crystal structure obsidian blade edges can reach almost molecular thinness leading to its ancient use as arrowheads and its modern use as surgical scalpel blades

Obsidian is mineral like but not a true mineral because as a glass it is not crystalline Obsidian is dark in color similar to rocks such as basalt It consists mainly of SiO2 usually 70 or more Crystalline rocks with obsidians composition include granite and rhyolite

Obsidian is metastable at the earths surface over time the glass becomes fine grained crystals So no obsidian is older than Cretaceous age This breakdown of obsidian is accelerated by the presence of water Obsidian has a low water content when fresh typically less than 1 water by weight but takes it in when exposed to groundwater 

Pure obsidian is usually dark in appearance though the color varies depending on the presence of different materials Iron and magnesium typically give the obsidian a dark green to brown to black color A few samples are nearly colorless In some stones inclusions of small crystals produce a snowflake pattern It may contain patterns of gas which produce effects such as a golden sheen or a rainbow sheen

Obsidian was valued in Stone Age cultures because like flint it could be fractured to produce hand axes sharp blades or arrowheads Like all glass and flint obsidian breaks with a characteristic shell shaped fracture 

Pre Columbian Mesoamericans used obsidian a lot It was carved and worked for tools and decorative objects It was also polished to create early mirrors Mesoamericans also made a type of sword with obsidian blades mounted in a wooden body Called a macuahuitl the weapon could cause terrible injuries because it combined the sharp cutting edge of an obsidian blade with the ragged cut of a serrated edge

Native American people traded obsidian throughout North America Each volcano and in some cases each volcanic eruption produces a distinguishable type of obsidian So archaeologists can trace the origins of a particular artifact Similar tracing techniques have allowed obsidian to be identified in Greece also as coming from different islands in the Aegean Sea Obsidian cores and blades were traded great distances inland from the coast 

Modern archaeologists have developed a dating system to calculate the age of obsidian artifacts depending from the content of water in the object

Obsidian can be found in locations which have experienced rhyolitic eruptions Obsidan flows which you can hike on are found within the calderas of Newberry Volcano and Medicine Lake Volcano in the Cascade Range of western North America and at Inyo Craters east of the Sierra Nevada in California Yellowstone National Park has a mountainside containing obsidian between Mammoth Hot Springs and the Norris Geyser Basin and deposits can be found in many other western US states including Arizona Colorado Texas Utah Oregon and Idaho Obsidian can also be found in Armenia Turkey Italy Mexico Iceland Greece and Scotland

Obsidian is used in heart surgery as well crafted obsidian blades have a cutting edge many times sharper than high quality steel surgical scalpels with the edge of the blade being only about 3 nm wide Even the sharpest metal knife has a jagged irregular blade when viewed under a strong enough microscope When examined under an electron microscope an obsidian blade is still smooth and even One study found that obsidian produced narrower scars fewer inflammatory cells and less granulation tissue in a group of rats

Obsidian is also used for ornamental purposes and as a gemstone It possesses the property of presenting a different appearance according to the manner in which it is cut When cut in one direction it is a beautiful jet black when cut across another direction it is glistening gray

Obsidian can refer to

Arran or the Isle of Arran is the largest island in the Firth of Clyde Scotland

With an area of convert432km2sqmi0 it is the seventh largest Scottish island Just over 5000 people live there 

Arran shares with the Hebrides cultural and physical similarities Arran is mountainous and has been described as a geologists paradisep1117

People have lived there since the early Neolithic period from which time on there are numerous prehistoric remains 

From the 6th century on peoples from Ireland colonised the island and it became a centre of religious activity During the troubled Viking Age Arran became the property of the Norwegian crown before becoming formally absorbed by the kingdom of Scotland in the thirteenth century 

The 19th century clearances led to significant reductions in population and the end of the Gaelic language and way of life

The economy and population have recovered in recent years the main industry being tourism There is diversity of wildlife including three species of tree endemic to the area There are regular field trips in the summer by geology and biology students

The island is sometimes referred to as Scotland in miniature as it is divided into Highland and Lowland areas by the Highland Boundary Fault which runs northeast to southwest across Scotlandp297301 

The island is a popular destination for geologists who come to see intrusive igneous landforms such as sills and dykes as well as sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks ranging in age from Precambrian to Mesozoic

Most of the interior of the northern half of the island is taken up by a large granite batholith that was created by substantial volcanic activity around 60 million years ago in the Tertiary period There is an older outer ring of coarse granites and an inner core of finer grained material 

Sedimentary rocks dominate the southern half of the island especially Old and New Red Sandstone Sand dunes are preserved in Permian sandstones near Brodick there are localised outcrops of Triassic rocksp14349 and even some Cretaceous chalk 

Visiting in 1787 the geologist James Hutton found his first example of an unconformity to the north of Newton Point near Lochranza which provided evidence for his Plutonist theories of uniformitarianism and about the age of the Earth This spot is one of the most famous places in the study of geology

The Pleistocene glaciations almost entirely covered Scotland in ice After the last retreat of the ice at the close of the Pleistocene epoch sea levels were up to convert70mft lower than at present and it is likely that circa 14000 years ago the island was connected to mainland Scotlandp6869 

Sea level changes and the isostatic rise of land makes charting coastlines a complex task but the island is clearly ringed by post glacial raised beachesp28 

What this means is that the huge weight of ice pressed down the Earths crust here and so the beaches were much higher up than now Gradually long after the ice melted the island came back up

Kings Cave on the south west coast is an example of such a raised beach This cave which is over convert305mft0 long and up to convert153mft high lies well above the present day sea level 

There are tall sea cliffs to the north east including large rock slides under the heights of Torr Reamhar and at Scriden at the far north end of the island The Scriden rocks fell some two hundred years ago with a concussion that shook the earth and was heard in Bute and Argyllshirep19

On June 4 the government forcefully dissolved the protests This left many people injured or dead The exact number is not known today different people have different numbers The Chinese government speaks about 200 300 victims the New York Times says there were between 300 and 800 and the Chinese Red Cross talks about 2000  3000 

The official Chinese position on the events was that the protests needed to be dispersed in order not to harm the stability of the country 

Many of the scenes were shown around the world over western media 

As said before the cause of the protests was the corruption of the Communist Party then and over all the economic politics that the Government were taking during the previous ten years which although helped in some way the level of life for farmers and people who lived in the countryside was awful for intellectuals students and industrial workers who feared the unemployment rising and social problems

Cybernetics is the study of control and communication in the animal and the machine Norbert Wiener added Information is information not matter or energy155

Ross Ashby defined it as the art of steermanship co ordination regulation and control will be its themes for these are of the greatest biological and practical interest it treats not things but ways of behaving It does not ask what is this thing but what does it do Ashby continued 

Louis Couffignal said cybernetics was the art of ensuring the efficacy of action 

Cybernetics was from the first an inter disciplinary field of study It included people from at least a dozen academic disciplines There were two events which sparked it off after World War II The first was that scientists from different backgrounds had during the war worked together on various military projects They learned a good deal about how to cooperate with their various partners The second event was the invention of computers during the war 

The countries which started cybernetics were Britain and America but the idea spread quickly to France Russia and other countries Another more famous example of interdisciplinary studies was molecular and cell biology

Imagine a simple system such as a central heating system

A goal directed or control system has these four parts 

Cybernetics started rapidly and some of the greatest thinkers of the post war era were interested in it When this generation died and some of the hopes for artificial intelligence and robotics were slow to produce results cybernetics fell somewhat out of favour

A complex system is one where smaller elements make complex things happen These smaller elements can be simple elements or they can be complex systems within themselves Any such complex elements can be interrelated in simple or complex ways and may be hard to identify as distinct

The key problems of such systems are difficulties with their formal modeling and simulation From such perspective in different research contexts complex systems are defined on the base of their different attributes

Control theory is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and mathematics It deals with the behavior of dynamical systems The desired output of a system is called the reference

Blackletter or Gothic script is an old way to write text Everybody in Western Europe used to write in Blackletter between the 12th and 16th century In art history this period of the Middle Ages is called gothic

Some people call Blackletter Old English This is not right because Old English is many centuries older Also Gothic script has nothing to do with the Goths They lived in central Europe from the 3rd to 6th century and wrote in Runes

Carolingian minuscule was the direct and linear ancestor of blackletter Blackletter came from Carolingian when Europe in the twelfth century needed new books in many different subjects when more and more people learned to read New universities were founded each writing books for business law grammar history and other topics not only religious books where earlier scripts were used 

These books needed to be produced quickly to keep up with demand Carolingian though legible was time consuming and labour intensive to produce It was large and wide and took up a lot of space on a manuscript in a time when writing materials were very costly As early as the eleventh century different forms of Carolingian were already being used and by the mid twelfth century a clearly distinguishable form able to be written more quickly to meet the demand for new books was being used in north eastern France and the Low Countries

The term Gothic was first used to describe this script in fifteenth century Italy in the midst of the Renaissance because Renaissance Humanists believed it was a barbaric script Gothic was a synonym for barbaric Flavio Biondo in Italia Illustrata thought it was invented by the Lombards after their invasion of Italy in the sixth century 

Not only were blackletter forms called Gothic script but any other seemingly barbarian script such as Visigothic Beneventan and Merovingian were also labeled Gothic in contrast to Carolingian minuscule a highly legible script which the Humanists called littera antiqua the ancient letter wrongly believing that it was the script used by the Romans It was invented in the reign of Charlemagne although only used significantly after that era

The blackletter must not be confused either with the ancient alphabet of the Gothic language or with the sans serif typefaces that are also sometimes called Gothic

Textualis also known as textura or Gothic bookhand was the most calligraphic form of blackletter and today is the form most associated with Gothic Johannes Gutenberg carved a textualis typeface including a large number of ligatures and common abbreviations when he printed his 42 line Bible However the textualis was rarely used for typefaces afterwards

According to Dutch scholar Gerard Lieftinck the pinnacle of use for blackletter was the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries For Lieftinck the highest form of textualis was littera textualis formata used for de luxe manuscripts The usual form simply littera textualis was used for literary works and university texts Lieftincks third form littera textualis currens was the cursive form of blackletter extremely difficult to read and used for textual glosses and less important books 

Textualis was most widely used in France the Low Countries England and Germany Some characteristics of the script are

The Schwabacher was a blackletter form that was much used in early German print typefaces It continued to be used occasionally until the 20th century Characteristics of the Schwabacher are

The Fraktur is a form of blackletter that became the most common German blackletter typeface by the mid 16th century Its use was so common that often any blackletter form is called Fraktur in Germany Characteristics of the Fraktur are

Cursiva refers to a very large variety of forms of blackletter as with modern cursive writing there is no real standard form It developed in the fourteenth century as a simplified form of textualis with influence from the form of textualis as used for writing charters Cursiva developed partly because of the introduction of paper which was smoother than parchment It was therefore easier to write quickly on paper in a cursive script 

In cursiva descenders are more frequent especially in the letters f and s and ascenders are curved and looped rather than vertical The letters a g and s are very similar to their Carolingian forms However not all of these features are found in every example of cursiva which makes it difficult to determine whether or not a script may be called cursiva at all 

Lieftinck also divided cursiva into three styles littera cursiva formata was the most legible and calligraphic style Littera cursiva textualis was the usual form used for writing standard books and it generally was written with a larger pen leading to larger letters Littera cursiva currens was used for textbooks and other unimportant books and it had very little standardization in forms

Hybrida is also called bastarda and as its name suggests refers to a hybrid form of the script It is a mixture of textualis and cursiva developed in the early fifteenth century From textualis it borrowed vertical ascenders while from cursiva it borrowed long f and single looped a and g with an open descender

In the game people players can play as and against characters from Nintendos ideo game series like characters from the Mario games characters from the Pokmon games characters from The Legend of Zelda games and many others The Super Smash Bros games are very different compared to other fighting games

The point of the game is to beat the character that you are fighting To beat them you must hit them again until they are very hurt Once they are very hurt you have to knock them off the stage someway 

In 1P mode you have to fight all of the characters in the game and Master Hand and also play some mini games along the way In this mode you can unlock characters and stages by doing certain things It does not work like that with Master Hand though With Master Hand you have to hit him again and again until he dies You do not have to knock him off the stage Its impossible to knock him off the stage since hes really big

In multiplayer mode up to 4 people can play against each other non stop You can not unlock anything in this mode If there are fighters that have died at the same time they will fight in a sudden death battle In that battle they are badly hurt and they have to fight other fighters who made it into the sudden death battle as well

The two mini games are Break The Targets and Board The Platforms In Break The Targets you have to break 10 targets Its very hard to get all 10 of the targets The goes for Board The Platforms except you have to just simply land on all of the platforms Board The Platforms is a little bit harder than Break The Targets Characters can be unlocked in these mini games

A funnel cloud is a funnel shaped cloud of broken wikt linkcondensecondensed water droplets They usually appear with a rotating column of air  These extend from the bottom of a cloud that does not touch the ground or a water surface A funnel cloud can usually be seen as a cone or needle shaped cloud that extends out from the main cloud base Funnel clouds very often develop when supercell thunderstorms happen

If a funnel cloud touches the ground it becomes a tornado Most tornadoes begin as funnel clouds Many funnel clouds that appear do not actually touch the ground and do not become tornadoes Tornadoes can only be seen when they pick up stuff off the ground but one can see them from a distance of many miles

A funnel cloud that makes contact with water is called a waterspout A funnel cloud that touches the ground in front of a snow squall is called a winter waterspout

Cold air funnel clouds are usually short lived and are usually much weaker in strength than the tornadoes produced by supercells Cold air funnel clouds usually do not touch the ground but here have been reports that it can happen Then they become weak tornadoes or waterspouts

They are a common sight along the Pacific Coast and USA usually seen in the spring or autumn

A winter waterspout also known as a snow devil an icespout an ice devil a snonado or a snowspout is a very rare meteorological phenomenon in which a vortex from snow develops that looks like a waterspout One does not know much about this rare happening and there are only six known pictures of this event so far

Waterspouts that are not associated with a rotating updraft of a supercell thunderstorm are known as nontornadic or fair weather waterspouts and are by far the most common type 

Fair weather waterspouts occur in coastal waters and are associated with dark flat bottomed developing convective cumulus towers

The indigenous people of the Torres Strait have a distinct culture which has slight variants on the different islands where they live They are a sea faring people and engaged in trade with peoples of Papua New Guinea The culture is complex with some Australian elements some Papuan elements and some Austronesian elements just like the languages The Islanders seem to have been the dominant culture for many centuries and neighbouring Aboriginal and Papuan cultures show some Island influence in religious ceremonies and the like Archaeological linguistic and folk history evidence suggests that the core of Island culture is Austronesian Unlike the indigenous peoples of mainland Australia the islanders were traditionally agriculturalists although they supplemented their food supplies through hunting and gathering

Australian megafauna is a word used to describe a number of animal species in Australia that are quite a bit bigger than their closest living relatives These species became extinct during the Pleistocene but exact dates for their extinction have only been discovered recently

Scientists have been unable to agree on the reasons the megafauna became extinct It is possible when humans came to Australia and began hunting and using fire they may have caused the extinction of the megafauna Climate change which made the country much drier during an Ice Age about 18000 years ago may have also have led to the extinction of the megafauna Some scientists say that climate change alone caused the extinction of the megafauna This argument does not allow for the fact that the megaufaunal species had lived through two million years of climate changes They had lived through a number of dry times before their sudden extinction

Scientists have got new evidence based on new and better ways of finding dates using optically stimulated luminescence and Uranium thorium dating of megafaunal bones This suggests that humans were the main cause of the extinction of megafauna in Australia The dates show that the last of the megafauna became extinct around the same time about 47000 years ago This was the time in which humans first arrived in Australia The dates suggest the main reason for extinction was human burning of the land Many plants were not able to survive regular fires and so the types of plants changed Scientists have studied oxygen and carbon isotopes from teeth of megafauna These show sudden broken wikt linkdrasticdrastic non climate related changes in plants and in the diet of surviving marsupial animals as well as the loss of megafaunal species Further study of the teeth of megafauna shows the climate was dry at the time of extinction similar to the dry climate of today and that the megafauna were able to live in dry climates

On April 28 1905 the American astronomer William H Pickering said that he had found a tenth moon of the planet Saturn Pickering named the moon Themis No other astronomer has ever seen the moon that Pickering said he saw Because of this astronomers do not count Themis as an official moon of Saturn

Pickering tried to figure out an orbit for Themis He thought that Themis had an inclination of 391 to the ecliptic with 023 eccentricity and a semi major axis distance of 1457000 km This meant that Themis had an orbit like the moons Titan and Hyperion Pickering believed that it took Themis 2085 days to orbit Saturn in a prograde motion

D B Cooper is an alias for a man who hijacked an airplane in November 24 1971 At that time airline passengers were not searched before boarding their planes He carried a bomb onto a flight between Portland Oregon and Seattle Washington He received the ransom payment of 200000  He jumped from the airplane which was a Boeing 727 When he jumped the airplane was in the Pacific Northwest perhaps over Woodland Washington Hundreds of suspects have been named through the years but no conclusive evidence has surfaced regarding who Cooper was or where he lived The FBI believes he did not survive the jump Several people have tried to explain what happened after the jump Some of these explanations contradict each other 

Because no one expected he would jump and because little is known of what happened afterwards people are still interested in the case The Cooper case remains an unsolved mystery

The case is famous for its lack of evidence A few important clues have arisen nevertheless In late 1978 a placard which had instructions on how to lower the rear stairs of a 727 was found just a few flying minutes north of Coopers projected drop zone It is believed that this is from the rear stairway of the plane from which Cooper jumped In February 1980 eight year old Brian Ingram found 5880 in decaying 20 bills on the banks of the Columbia River

In October 2007 the FBI announced it was able to get a partial DNA profile of Cooper from the tie he left on the hijacked plane The FBI warehouse had lost other material with his DNA On December 31 2007 the FBI revived the unclosed case They published never before seen composite sketches and fact sheets online They did this because some people might remember them and help identify Cooper In a press release the FBI said that it still does not believe Cooper survived the jump wanted to know who Cooper was In March 2008 the FBI announced that another possible clue was being investigated after a torn tangled parachute was found within the bounds of Coopers probable jump site near the town of Amboy Washington However the FBI announced on April 1 2008 that the parachute in question was not D B Coopers The man responsible for packing the four parachutes said that the recently discovered parachute was not Coopers as his was nylon and the newly discovered parachute was silk dating from the 1940s

Normally the criminal laws cannot work against people years after their crimes In 1976 to prevent D B Cooper from escaping punishment a Portland grand jury charged D B Cooper with crimes

Since 1999 Ariel Washington holds an annual D B Cooper celebration on the anniversary of his jump

Sickle cell anemia is a disease passed down from family to family that affects red blood cells It changes the cells from flexible circles into rigid crescents This creates clotting in veins and can cause a heart attack 

This disease starts in childhood This is a life long disease and a life long blood disorder sickle cell disease or sickle cell anaemia characterized by red blood cells that have an abnormal rigid sickle shape Sickling decreases the cells flexibility and results in a risk of various complications 

The sickling occurs because of a mutation in the haemoglobin gene Life expectancy is shortened it is near fatal in pre modern societies Studies in the modern USA report an average life expectancy of 42 and 48 years for males and females respectively In Sir Cyril Clarkes standard text he says Almost all the children with the disease will die in infancyp25

Sickle cell disease occurs more commonly in people from parts of tropical and sub tropical regions where malaria is or was common 

One quarter of all aboriginal inhabitants of Sub Saharan Africa carry the gene In areas where malaria is common there is a survival value in carrying only a single sickle cell gene Those with only one of the two alleles of the sickle cell disease are more resistant to malaria since the infestation of the malaria plasmodium is halted by the sickling of the cells which it infests

The inheritance of the disease is an example of polymorphism kept in tropical populations by the heterozygous genotype HbHbs being the most fit It is called heterozygous advantage

Instead of laying eggs the females give birth to live young In the days leading up to birth the female can often be seen basking in the sun on a warm road

A substitution cipher is a form of cryptography 

In a substitution cipher a rule is used to change each letter of the message one at a time The rule says to replace each letter with another letter from the alphabet 

For instance this table gives a rule for a substitution cipher

Using this rule the sentence Jack and Jill went up the hill is changed to Etar tzn Evmm gkzc dw cuk uvmm The Caesar cipher is one example of a substitution cipher

Substitution ciphers are not safe enough to use for important messages Substitution ciphers can be broken by an idea called frequency analysis Some letters are more common than others in English sentences E is the most common then T then A and so on A message that has been changed by a substitution cipher will have different common letters but this gives a hint about the rule The most common letters in the changed message are likely to be the most common letters in English 

Breaking cryptograms is a common puzzle often found in newspapers

Suppose the changed message is

For this example capital letters are used for unknown letters and lowercase letters are used to denote letters we know or can guess 

By counting up the letters we see that the most common is I which we will guess is an e X is also quite common and XLI is found many times we guess that this is the the most common three letter group in English

E is the second most common letter We already have a guess for e and t so we guess that E is a We now have

We can now make some more guesses heVe may be here Rtate may be state and atthattMZe could be atthattime Filling in these guesses we get

This lets us make more guesses which lead to more until we have guessed everything

At this point we can insert spaces and punctuation

If we had made a wrong guess we would have found out at some point and could go back and make a new guess

Recordings of Schweitzer playing the music of Bach are available on CD Between 1934 and 1935 he had a trial recording for HMV on the organ of the old Queens Hall in London In mid December 1935 he began to record for Columbia Records on the organ of All Hallows by the Tower Barking London

Schweitzer became well known for his books on Jesus and Christianity He was not so much interested in the historical study of Jesus as in the Christian idea of the end of the world which can be found in the Bible and the teachings of Jesus Schweitzer also served as a minister for Saint Nicholas Church in Strassburg

In the philosophy of Albert Schweitzer the most important idea is the respect for life In his book The Philosophy of Civilization he wrote that true philosophy begins with the idea that I am a life that wants to live in the midst of life that wants to live Albert Schweitzers ethical principles meant that he tried to have a personal and spiritual relationship with the universe It also meant that he was vegetarian

Albert Schweitzer spent most of his life in Lambarene Africa In 1904 he was inspired to help sick people in the world so he studied medicine After his medical studies in 1913 he went to Lambarene with his wife to establish a hospital that would serve thousands of Africans

During World War I the French made Schweitzer and his wife both Germans leave Africa In 1924 he returned to Lambarene and managed to rebuild the destroyed hospital where he served as a physician 

From 1939 1948 he stayed in Lambarene since he could not go to Europe during the war Three years later he resumed his medical practices But he was no longer just a medical doctor and whenever possible he went to Europe to lecture at universities Slowly his ideas become known not only in Europe but worldwide 

In 1952 Dr Albert Schweitzer was awarded The Nobel Peace Prize for peace He gave a famous speech The Problem of Peace He died on 4 September 1965 at his hospital in Lambarene

Before statehood when the Five Tribes or Five Civilized Tribes were moved to Oklahoma from the Eastern United States the area that is now Coweta became part of the Creek Nation Coweta was named after a Creek Indian war town on the Chattahoochee River in southwestern Georgia and was first settled by American Indians about 1840 In 1843 Robert Loughridge arrived in the area and established a mission named Koweta

In 1867 after the Civil War the Creek Indians adopted a constitution which divided there nation into six districts Everything northeast of the Arkansas River including Tulsa became the Coweta district The political center of this district was in a log courthouse on Coweta Creek about a one fourth of a mile west from the modern day center of the downtown Coweta The Post Office was established on May 24 1897 and was named after the Koweta Mission

Many notable events occurred in 1903 Along with the arrival of the Missouri Kansas Texas Railroad Cowetas first newspaper The Courier was started the first school was built and a telephone line was put in

Tularemia is a disease Usually rodents get it It is caused by a bacterium Francisella tularensis There have been cases where the disease spread to humans The disease can be treated with antibiotics 

Cases of tularemia should be reported to the local health authority The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention thinkF tularensis could possibly be a bioweapons agent For this reason it has been included in the biological warfare programs of the USA USSR and Japan at various times A former Soviet biological weapons scientist Kenneth Alibek has said that an outbreak of Tularemia among German soldiers shortly before the siege of Stalingrad was due to intentional release of F tularensis by Soviet forces but this claim is rejected by others who have studied the outbreak In the USA practical research into using Tularemia as a bioweapon took place at Camp Detrick in the 1950s It was viewed as an attractive agent because

By the late 1950s the US biological warfare program was focused mostly on tularemia as a biological agent The Schu S4 strain was standardized as Agent UL for use in the M143 bursting spherical bomblet It was a lethal biological with an anticipated fatality rate of 40 to 60 percent The rate of action was around three days with a duration of action of one to three weeks and two to three months with frequent relapses UL was streptomycin resistant The aerobiological stability of UL was a major concern being sensitive to sun light and losing virulence over time after releaseFactdateDecember 2007

The United States later changed the military symbol for UL to TT and ZZ in an effort to retain security on the identity of military biologicals When the 425 strain was standardized as agent JT the Schu S4 strains symbol was changed again to SRFactdateDecember 2007

No vaccine is available to the general public The best way to prevent tularemia infection is to wear rubber gloves when handling or skinning rodents or lagomorphs avoid ingesting uncooked wild game and untreated water sources and wearing long sleeved clothes and using an insect repellent to prevent tick bites

In summer 2000 an outbreak of tularemia in Marthas Vineyard resulted in one dead person It brought the interest of the CDC as a potential investigative ground for aerosolized Francisella tularensis Over the following summers Marthas Vineyard was identified as the only place in the world where documented cases of tularemia resulted from lawn mowing The research may prove valuable in preventing bioterrorismFactdateOctober 2007

An outbreak of tularemia occurred in Kosovo in 1999 2000

In 2004 three researchers at Boston University Medical Center were accidentally infected with F tularensis after apparently failing to follow safety procedures

In 2005 small amounts of F tularensis were detected in the Mall area of Washington DC the morning after an anti war demonstration on September 24 2005 Biohazard sensors were triggered at six locations surrounding the Mall To this date no cases of tularemia infection have been reported as a result

In 2007 a lab of Boston Universitys Center for Advanced Biomedical Research where F tularensis were being kept for research was evacuated after smoke set off alarms An investigation has later determined that an electrical problem was the culprit and no bacterial contamination was found

In July 2007 an outbreak was reported in the Spanish autonomous region of Castile and Len and traced to the plague of voles infesting the region

Protactinium is a chemical element with the symbol Pa and atomic number 91

Protactinium is a silver metallic element that is in the actinide group with a bright metallic shine that it keeps for some time in the air It is superconductive at temperatures below 14 K

Due to its scarcity high radioactivity and toxicity there are currently no uses for protactinium outside of basic research

Protactinium 231 could possibly sustain a nuclear chain reaction and might be used to build a nuclear weapon The critical mass according to Walter Seifritz is 750180 kg Other authors conclude that no chain reactions are possible in Protactinium 231

Protactinium was first discovered in 1913 when Kasimir Fajans and O H Ghring encountered short lived isotope 234m Pa with a half life of about 117 minutes while they were studying the decay chain of 238 U They gave the new element the name Brevium the name was changed to Protoactinium in 1918 when two groups of scientists independently discovered 231 Pa The name was shortened to Protactinium in 1949

In 1961 the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority was able to produce 125 g of 999 pure protactinium processing 60 tons of waste material in a 12 stage process and spending 500000 USD For many years to come this was the worlds only way to get the element It is said that the metal was sold to laboratories for a cost of 2800 USD g in the following years

Protactinium is both toxic and highly radioactive It requires precautions similar to those used when handling plutonium

According to a 2001 research by Dr Jianguo Liu of Michigan State University the rate of destruction is higher after the reserves creation than before its creation Using NASAs satellite images and records of population Lius research team concluded that due to tourism and the increase in local population the reserve is facing an unprecedented threat Tourists do not think they have an impact on panda habitat but indirectly each visitor has some impact Liu said We do not see ourselves as a destructive force but we are

Charles Haddon Spurgeon was a British Baptist preacher People still know him as the Prince of Preachers In his lifetime Spurgeon preached to about 10 million people Spurgeon would often preach 10 times a week at different places His sermons have been translated into many languages Today there are more writings and books by Spurgeon than by any other Christian writer

Spurgeon was the pastor of the Metropolitan Tabernacle in London for 38 years Under the previous pastor Dr John Rippon it became the largest Baptist congregation in Great Britain He was part of several controversies with the Baptist Union of Great Britain and later had to leave that denomination Throughout his life Spurgeon suffered from depression and other mental illnesses In 1857 he started a charity organisation called Spurgeons which works all over the world

Charles Spurgeon was born on June 19 1834 in Kelvedon in the English county of Essex He was the eldest child of Eliza Jarvis and John Spurgeon His mother Eliza was born in nearby Belchamp Otten on May 3 1815 She was about 19 years old when Spurgeon was born His father John Spurgeon born in Clare Suffolk on July 15 1810 was about 24 years old There were 17 children in Spurgeons family but nine of them died when they were babies

When he was six Spurgeon read The Pilgrims Progress He read that book over 100 times in his life Spurgeon was also very good at mathematics As a young boy he would read the Scriptures at family worship He memorised many hymns as a child and would use many of them in his sermons later in life

As an early teenager he was very intelligent but was also fearful and doubting By the influence of his father and grandfather Spurgeon was kept from most normal sins As a child he thought that he was a good person But he later said that Day and night Gods hand was heavy on me He read the whole Bible but he thought that it was threatening him rather than promising him good things As he got older these things weighed on his conscience

On January 6 1850 when he was 15 a snow storm made him seek shelter in a Primitive Methodist chapel in Colchester While he was there a worker there said to him Young man you look very miserable Spurgeon knew this and he believed now that only God could heal him The worker seeing his need replied Young man look to Jesus Christ Look Look Look You have nothin to do but to look and live

Within moments he was converted to Christianity or as he said God opened his heart to the Salvation message He later said that I thought I could dance all the way home On May 3 1850 he was baptised in the River Lark at Isleham Later that year his family moved to Cambridge

He broken wikt linkpreachpreached his first broken wikt linksermonsermon in the winter of 185051 At that time he was made the pastor of the Waterbeach Baptist Chapel in Cambridgeshire His preaching was thought to be very good In 1853 he authored his first written work a Gospel tract

In April 1854 aged 19 and after he had preached for three months Spurgeon became the pastor of the New Park Street Chapel in London At that time it was the largest Baptist congregation in the city Within months of Spurgeon being the pastor there he became very famous Even before he was 20 Spurgeon had preached over 600 times His sermons were published every week and many people read them While he was at the New Park Street Chapel Spurgeon became friends with James Hudson Taylor Taylor was the man who started the China Inland Mission

The way Spurgeon preached was not new but it was easy to understand When he would read and teach the Bible in his messages many people would think about what Jesus had said Because the church congregation became too large for their building they had to move to Exeter Hall then to Surrey Music Hall and later to the Metropolitan Tabernacle By the age of 22 he was a very popular preacher He would preach to more than 10000 people at a time Even before the microphone was invented he spoke to an audience of almost 24000 at the Crystal Palace

On January 8 1856 Spurgeon got married to Susannah Spurgeon By the age of 33 she had to stay home because of her disabilities They had twin sons Charles and Thomas

While he was preaching on October 19 1856 there was a tragedy A group of men yelled Fire This made many people panic and run for the exits It was later found out that seven people died after being trampled to death Spurgeon was hurt emotionally by the actions of these men and it had a large influence on his life He had depression for many years He later said that he cried for no reason but still his ministry went on

On March 18 1861 the church moved to their newly built Metropolitan Tabernacle at Elephant and Castle in London The building could hold from five to six thousand people and was like a modern day megachurch Spurgeon read many books up to six a week 

Spurgeon liked singing hymns and wrote several of them He published a book of well known hymns for use at his church There was no pipe organ or other instruments in his church the hymns were always sang unaccompanied Spurgeon never called people to come forward after his sermons which is a custom of many evangelical preachers who like to talk to the people who have been moved in their faith by the preaching Spurgeon would say that anyone could meet him on Monday to talk about Christ There was always someone at his door the next day He preached there until his death 31 years later

When the missionary David Livingstone died in 1873 a copy of Spurgeons sermon Accidents Not Punishments was found among his belongings There was a comment at the top of the first page that read Very good DL Livingstone carried the sermon with him when he travelled to Africa but it was given back to Spurgeon Spurgeon had given the message on Sunday September 8 1861 at the Metropolitan Tabernacle in Newington London He had preached it because of two disasters that happened close to his house On Sunday August 25 1861 there was a tragic accident between two trains in the Clayton Tunnel between London and Brighton 23 people died from this crash and the crash also injured hundreds About two weeks later on Monday September 2 another train wreck in North London that made 15 more people die

Spurgeons wife was often too sick to leave their home to hear him preach Near the end of his life he had poor health with rheumatism gout and Brights disease He died near Nice in France on January 31 1892 Spurgeons wife and sons lived longer than him His body is buried in a tomb in London

Around the end of Spurgeons life he was part of many conflicts in the Baptist Union of Great Britain Spurgeon later left the Baptist Union Even after Spurgeons death there were such controversies there such as the talk over whether or not the Baptist Union should be allowed to meet in the Metropolitan Tabernacle Spurgeons son Thomas who was the co pastor of the Metropolitan Tabernacle with Archibald G Brown said that The Baptist Union almost killed my father Yes replied someone at BUGB and your father almost killed the Baptist Union

A controversy with Baptists started in 1887 when Spurgeon wrote what was later called the Downgrade Controversy It got that name when Spurgeon used word Downgrade when talking about how other Baptists looked at the Bible Spurgeon meant that things such as Charles Darwins theory of evolution were making the Baptist Union weak

The baptismal regeneration controversy was started by a sermon in the Metropolitan Tabernacle on June 5 1864 That was when Spurgeon spoke to Anglican Christian leaders who supported infant baptism The sermon is 16 pages long so it took around an hour for Spurgeon to preach it Over 350000 copies of this sermon were sold However Spurgeon did work with Anglicans as well as people from other denominations all his life

The Stockwell Orphanage was an orphanage started by Spurgeon for boys in 1867 and for girls in 1879 It was open until London was bombed in the Second World War It later turned into Spurgeons Child Care It is now mainly in England but has international projects in Mexico Africa and Eastern Europe

Spurgeons College is a theological institute in London Spurgeon started it in 1857 Spurgeons College is a member of the Baptist Union

His works have been translated into many languages He also made many volumes of commentaries sayings and other types of literature

George Fredrick Mller was an Christian evangelist and worker of orphanages in Bristol England He cared for about 10000 orphans in his life He was well known for giving an education to the children under his care so much that sometimes he was accused of giving the poor more then they should be given

Mller was born in Kroppenstedt a village in the Kingdom of Prussia His early life he was not very righteous He was a thief a liar and a gambler At age 14 while his mother was dying he was playing cards with friends and drinking His father wanted to give him a religious education that would give him a wealthy job as a clergyman in the church While studying divinity at college a fellow student invited him to a Christian house meeting He was welcomed there and he soon began reading the Bible He also began talking much with the others at the meetings He soon left his sinful life and began wanting to be a missionary He began preaching in churches nearby He still met with the growing group of evangelical believers in his university

In 1828 Mller almost started working with Jews in England But when he got there in 1829 he fell ill When he got better he promises he would obey the will of God He soon left London He believed that God would provide for his needs as he did his Christian work He became the pastor of a chapel in Devon Soon after he married Miss Mary Groves While he was the pastor of the church he would not take a regular salary He also stopped renting pews for the church He said that would give too much money to the wealthy

He moved to Bristol in 1832 In 1834 he founded the Scripture Knowledge Institution for Home and Abroad It had the goal of helping Christian schools and missionaries And also it gave away the Bible He did not get any money from the government He only accepting personal gifts But still they received and gave away 15 million by the time of his death It was mainly used for supporting the orphanages he worked at But also they giving away nearly two million Bibles and other religious texts

Mller and his wife began working with orphans in 1836 They then kept thirty girls in their own home Soon after that they opened three more orphanages That made the total of children they cared for about 130 In 1845 as they got bigger Mller decided that they would build another building for around 300 children In 1849 that home opened By 1870 more than 2000 children were being helped in their five homes

To this point Mller had never asked for financial support and he did not go into debt Even though their five homes cost over 100000 to build Many times he would get free food donations only hours before it was time to eat That helped his faith in God even more Every morning after breakfast there was a time of Bible reading and prayer Every child was given a Bible when they left the orphanage The children had nice clothes Mller even had a school inspector make sure things were done right 

In 1871 an article in The Times stated that since 1836 23000 children had been educated in the schools Also it said that thousands had been educated in other places that they paid for The article also said that since he started 64000 Bibles 85000 Testaments and 29000000 religious books had been made and given away They also had to pay the support of 150 missionaries

In 1872 after the death of his first wife in 1870 he got married to Susannah Grace Sanger In 1875 at the age of 70 he began a 17 year period of missionary travel He preached in the United States India Australia Japan China and nearly forty other countries He traveled over 200000 miles and that was before the airplane was invented Because he knew several languages he was able to preach in English French and German His sermons were translated into over twelve other languages 

He told in his autobiography how he came to closely read the Bible he came with great astonishment to find that it was able to speak decidedly to him He was a founding member of the Open Brethren movement In 1892 he went back to England He later died on March 10 1898

The Spectacled Bear also known as the Andean Bear is the last of the lineage of short faced bears Locally it is also called ukuko jukumari or ucumari The other short faced bears are now extinct They lived during Middle Pleistocene to Late Pleistocene age

The Spectacled Bear is a relatively small species of bear native to South America It has black fur with a distinctive beige coloured marking across its face and upper chest Males are 33 larger than females Males can weigh 130 200 kilograms and females 35 60 kilograms They are found in several areas of northern and western South America including western Venezuela Colombia Ecuador Peru western Bolivia northwestern Argentina and eastern Panama Spectacled bears are the only surviving species of bear native to South America and the only surviving member of the subfamily Tremarctinae Their survival has depended mostly on their ability to climb even the highest trees of the Andes

Convergent evolution is a process in biology It occurs when two species from unrelated lines develop the same traits or features This happens because they live in similar habitats and have to develop solutions to the same kind of problems

Similarity in traits can occur in two ways Both species might have acquired the trait by descent from a common ancestor In this case the structures are homologous An example is the tetrapod limb which has been inherited from early tetrapods in the late Devonianearly Carboniferous about 360 million years ago On the other hand both might be independent adaptations to similar conditions in their habitat In this case the structures are analogous Convergent evolution leads to analogous features

Examples of convergent evolution are extremely numerous it is an important feature of evolution See enList of examples of convergent evolution

Parallelophyly is the special case where two or more lines with a close common ancestor acquire the same character independently Cichlid fish in Lake Tanganyika in East Africa have developed the same feeding method in six different lines Stalked eyes on occur irregularly and independently in acalypteran flies which have clearly inherited the genetic capacity for such eyes This capacity is selected only in some linesp62 225

Father Armand David was a Lazarist missionary Catholic priest as well as a zoologist and a botanist He discovered many new species in China The best known of the animals he discovered are the Giant Panda and the Pre Davids Deer

Pre Davids Deer Milu in Chinese is a species of deer known only in zoos It likes marshland and is believed to be native to the subtropics It eats a mixture of grass and water plants

Adults weigh between convert150kglb0lkonabbron and convert200kglb0lkonabbron They have a nine month gestation period and one or two fawns are born at a time They reach maturity at about 14 months and have been known to reach the age of 23 years

Pre Davids Deer has a long tail wide hooves and branched antlers Adults have summer coats that are bright red with a dark dorsal stripe and dark gray winter coats The fawns are spotted

There is the Chinese official name Milu a Chinese nickname name and in Japanese Sibuxiang means the four unlikes because the deer has been described as having

Several other sources claim sibuxiang has different meanings

With this name this wild animal became part of Chinese mythology as the mount of Jiang Ziya in the Ming novel Fengshen Yanyi or Investiture of the Gods

This species of deer was first made known to Western science in 1866 by Father Armand David a French missionary working in China He had sent skeletons and a hide to Paris The Chinese emperor kept a herd of the deer in a royal hunting park in the southern part of Beijing In 1895 a flood washed away part of the wall and many of the deer escaped This left about 20 animals in the park This last herd of Pre Davids Deer in China were eaten by Western and Japanese soldiers during the Boxer Rebellion The last known deer in the wild was shot in 1939 near the Yellow Sea

A few animals had been taken illegally to European countries to be put on show After the remaining population in China had gone the remaining 18 deer in Europe were taken to Woburn Abbey England and bred to save the species The current population comes from this herd and can be found in zoos around the world Two herds of Pre Davids Deer were reintroduced to Nan Haizi Milu Park Beijing and Dafeng Reserve Jiangsu Province China in the late 1980s In spite of the small population size the animals do not appear to suffer genetic problems 

In October 2008 the ICUN listed the deer as Extinct in the Wild

The finite element method is the numerical method of solving systems of differential equations They are used extensively in many fields of engineering because they require very little knowledge of mathematics beyond basic algebra to use It belongs to the Methods of Weighted residuals in that the problem is formulated such that some conditions are satisfied exactly others are satisfied only approximately or numerically Ie the residual being the difference between the exact solution and the approximate solution is weighted and minimized to get the best approximation 

While the ease of setting up a problem using finite elements and getting a solution is the reason for its popularity it is also the cause of its frequent misuse and distrust of the answers obtained Typically it is recommended or required that experimental verification be performed before a model is acceptable for use It is the authors observation that the use finite elements in structural analysis is in particular poorly managed Engineers typically begin working with FE having very little knowledge of numerical methods or knowledge of finite element behavior There are no standards and guidelines for modeling and few managers who understand well enough to regulate modeling It has led to mistrust of the method its arrested development and some very bad analysis being performed that is emulated Much aircraft structural design is analyzed using FE

John Dowland was an English composer and lutenist He is best known for some beautiful songs which express his unhappiness such as Come heavy sleep Come Again Sweet Love and Flow my tears His instrumental music became very popular again in the 20th century

We hardly know anything about Dowlands early life He was probably born in London  He went to Paris in 1580 where he worked for the ambassador to the French court He became a Roman Catholic at this time

In 1594 the job of royal lutenist to Queen Elizabeth I became available Dowland did not get the job He said later that it was because he was a Catholic but there were other Catholic musicians at the English court so that may not have been the real reason 

Dowland continued to work in Europe instead He worked for the Duke of Brunswick Lneburg in Wolfenbttel He went to Italy where he wanted to study with Luca Marenzio in Rome He went to Venice and Florence but never got as far as Rome He published a book of lute music in 1597 which made him the most important English composer for the lute However he still did not get a job at the English court so he went to Denmark where he worked for King Christian IV of Denmark who paid him very well

Dowland seems to have been married and he had children although we do not know how many His wife and family always stayed in England

Dowland returned to England in 1606 and in 1612 got the job as one of James Is lutenists Strangely he does not seem to have composed anything between that time and his death in London in 1626 We do not know the date he died but we do know the date when he was buried

Most of Dowlands music is for his own instrument the lute It includes several books of music for solo lute songs for one voice and lute part songs with lute accompaniment and several pieces for viol consort with lute 

Many of his best known songs are full of sadness One lute song is called Flow My Tears A very well known instrumental work is Lachrimae a set of seven songs for five viols and lute each based on the tune of his song Flow My Tears It became one of the best known pieces of consort music in his own time His pavane Lachrymae antiquae was also one of the big hits of the seventeenth century

Dowlands music often shows the melancholia that was so fashionable in music at that time He wrote a consort piece called Semper Dowland semper dolens

Many later musicians have been inspired by Dowlands music including Benjamin Britten and the pop musician Sting

A partsong is a piece of music to be sung by two or more voices without accompaniment Many partsongs are written for four voices normally soprano alto tenor and bass Such a partsong can be performed just by four people but it can also be performed by a larger group which has divided into these four parts

The term partsong can refer to music such as a glee madrigal or unaccompanied anthem but it is usually used in English when talking about short secular songs without accompaniment In other languages there is no word which means quite the same thing

Partsongs were very popular in the 17th century in England They were often fun pieces to be sung at parties or in pubs They were often rounds catches or quodlibets In the 19th century the madrigal came into fashion again and so many composers started writing partsongs Composers such as Sterndale Bennett Arthur Sullivan Parry Stanford and Edward Elgar wrote many partsongs and later Finzi John Ireland and Moeran

In Europe many 19th century and early 20th century composers wrote songs which could be described as partsongs Schubert Schumann Mendelssohn Saint Sans Debussy and Ravel

Hazard symbols are special symbols They were made to warn people about dangers Usually they are pictograms Pictograms are small drawings that show what is happening in a way that is easy to understand

The European Union has made a few symbols that warn of dangers and that should be easy to understand These are the hazard symbols for chemicals

 ImageHazard EsvgExplosive 

ImageHazard OsvgOxidizing agent 

ImageHazard FsvgHighly flammable 

ImageHazard FFsvgExtremely flammable 

ImageHazard TsvgToxic

Example Barium chloride most acids ImageHazard TTsvgVery toxic Example Nicotine ImageHazard XsvgHarmful Example Caffeine and bleach ImageHazard XisvgIrritant Example Fumaric acid and bleach ImageHazard CsvgCorrosive

ImageHazard NsvgDangerous for the environment 

The n in Harmful stands for the French word nocif and the Italian word nocivo

A pictograph is a small drawing Today pictograms are used very often Because they are independent of the language they are often used where there are people who need to understand things even if they do not read or speak the language Pictograms are also often used where it is important to understand something fast Sight is faster than reading That way pictograms are often used for signalling in emergency situations such as showing emergency exits 

Common uses include those for road signs airports and train station and warning signs

Commensalism is a type of symbiotic relationship between two organisms In commensalism one organism is helped while the other is neither helped nor harmed 

An example of a commensalistic would be the Orchid in a tropical rain forest The orchid needs sunlight but all the sun is being soaked up by all the tall trees The Orchid will grow up the trunks of tall trees to gain access to the sunlight The Orchid is getting sunlight and the tree being grown on is neither helped nor harmed

Lindane is an insecticide It can be used to kill insects The European Union prohibits its use as an insecticide since 2008 This is because it takes a very long time to decay Checks are currently done to see how harmful it really is It might cause diseases such as Cancer or Parkinsons disease 

The World Health Organization classifies Lindane as Moderately Hazardous International trade with it is restricted and regulated under the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent Over 50 countries have banned it It might be included in Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants This would make it illegal to produce or use it all over the world

Fumaric acid is a chemical substance that occurs in various plants It also occurs as a by product at various times in the human body In chemistry it is used for food preservation It is known as E 297 Usually it replaces citric acid In medicine it is used to treat various diseases of the skin such as Psoriasis 

Albert Szent Gyrgyi was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1937 because of his work on Fumaric acid

Endospores are structures made by bacteria for survival purposes Bacteria turn to endospore when they undergo stress such as increase in heat or lack of nutrient This process is known as sporulation They have a tough coating which makes it resistant to radiation chemicals heat salt concentration and extreme pH It is not fully understood what causes it to be so resistant but scientists are attributing these resistance to calcium dipicolinate found in endospore

A Bacterial cell will make an endospore when it is low on food so it can survive until there is more food available in the environment An endospore will actually contain all of the important parts of the bacterial cell such as its DNA Only 2 species of bacteria can undergo sporulation to form endospore They are the bacillus and clostridium species Bacteria that can form endospore but are not in the endospore state are known to be in their vegetative state

Endospores are highly dangerous bio terrorist weapons This is because they are smaller than the vegetative state A bacterium in itself is already smaller than a eukaryotic cell Therefore considering the small size of endospore a small volume of it can already contain a large quantity of it

Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate mixtures like DNA and proteins The separation is based on how positively or how negatively charged a molecule is and its size Gel electrophoresis uses a gel and the application of an electric field through the gel The word electrophoresis comes from electro because an electric field is used and phoresis which means movement

The gel is made up of really large and branched molecules called polymers The amount of branches in the gel determines how easy molecules move depending on their size If there are a lot of branches only small molecules can pass through If there are few branches big molecules can pass through This is similar to a filter if the hole is small only small things can go through the hole

If a molecule has a big charge its attraction to the opposite charge is also big In gel electrophoresis molecules with big charges are going to move faster If a molecule charge is very small the attraction is going to be small This means the molecule is going to move slowly in the gel If the molecule does not have a charge it will not move

After the separation there are two common ways to see where the molecules moved to One way see the bands is to stain the gel The stain makes the places where the molecules moved to appear as colored bands The other way is observe the gel under an ultraviolet lamp to see the bands

Gel electrophoresis is the most commonly used technique to study DNA DNA is a really large molecule that contains genetic information DNA can be broken down to smaller pieces of different sizes and these pieces are then separated using gel electrophoresis

Proteins are large and complex molecules made of smaller pieces called amino acids Proteins can be studied by gel electrophoresis in two ways One way is to take a mixture of proteins and separate them in the gel The other way is to breakdown a single protein into smaller pieces The smaller pieces can then be separated in the gel

In medicine there is a special type of electrophoresis called iontophoresis Iontophoresis uses the same idea of gel electrophoresis to deliver drugs into the human body through the skin without using needles to inject the drug

Heinrich Schliemann was a German archaeologist He is famous for his work in Troy

Heinrich Schliemann was born in Neubukowin Germany His father Ernst Schliemann was a minister His mother Luise Therese Sophie Schliemann died in 1831 when Heinrich was 9 years old 

When his mother died Heinrich lived with his uncle in Neustrelitz He went to a grammar school in the town for about a year His father paid the school fees

Heinrich was very interested in history and was encouraged by his father to read history books After he left school he worked in a shop in Frstenberg for about five years He worked hard as an apprentice but he continued to read in his spare time

He was not able to work as an archaeologist at this time so he moved to a company which imported and exported products In this job he visited many different countries around the world and learnt to speak English French Dutch Spanish Portuguese Swedish Italian Greek Latin Russian Arabic and Turkish His ability to speak these languages was very important in his job because he had to speak to other countries

In 1850 Heinrichs brother Ludwig Schliemann died He moved to Sacramento where he opened a bank just like his brother The new bank bought gold dust and sold it on to make money In six months the bank bought and sold millions of dollars of the gold dust

Heinrich married his wife Ekaterina in 1852 but the marriage was troubled Ekaterina kept encouraging her husband to make more money but Heinrich felt that they were rich enough

Nobody knows how Heinrich became an archaeologist but he continued to travel to see famous historical icons around the world He even disguised himself as a tribesman to get into Mecca the holy Muslim city

He became very interested in Troy which was involved in a big dispute at the time He was inspired by many people in the city especially Ferdinand Fouqu and Frank Calvert who he met in 1868

Many reports have been found which talk about Heinrich burying his treasure he found in Troy dubbed Priams gold

Rijohns22 2142 22 April 2011update What I added is an update and what i wrote is about events that transpired between 2009  2010 so its an update

Cyclone Nargis was a tropical cyclone It was the first in the Indian Ocean in 2008 It was classified as a Category 4 storm It made landfall in Myanmar in April and May 2008 It s possibly one of the worst storms to have hit the country The United Nations estimated in its report that 15 million people were severely affected by this cyclone Officially at least 78000 were killed with 58000 not found the figures however are still rising and 80000 were reported dead in just one town After the disaster the Burmese government has called for help in dealing with the situation Some people say the government is having problems coping with the situation

More recent reports from the government say that about 80000 have died Some non governmental organizations estimate that the final number will be well over 100000 Certain aid workers that came into the country estimate that 2 to 3 million are homeless in the worst disaster in Burmas history They say it is comparable with the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami Andrew Kirkwood country director of a British charity organisation saidWere looking at 50000 dead and millions of homeless Id characterise it as unprecedented in the history of Burma It has had about the same effect as the tsunami on individual countries There might well be more dead than the tsunami caused in Sri Lanka The United Nations says that up to 25 million people need help upgentltly According to the same report access to the affected regions has been cut off The Red Cross says there could be up to 128000 dead

Because of the storm the government has declared five regions  Yangon Ayeyarwady Bago Divisions Mon and Kayin States currently as disaster areas Thousands of buildings were destroyed in the town of Labutta located in the Ayeyarwady Division state television reported that 75 of buildings had collapsed and 20 had their roofs ripped off It is believed that the cyclone is the deadliest tropical cyclone in the world since Hurricane Mitch in 1998 which killed about 18000 people At least 10000 people have been reported to have died in the delta town of Bogale 

A diplomat in the city of Yangon spoke to the Reuters news agency giving them a description of the scene He said that the area around him looked like a war zone as a result of the cyclone Burst sewage mains caused the landscape to flood with waste ruining the rice crop An official from the United Nations also talked about the situation at the time of the event Its a bad situation Almost all the houses are smashed People are in a terrible situation he said Another UN representative also talked about the incident He reported that The Irrawaddy delta was hit extremely hard not only because of the wind and rain but because of the storm surge The Daily Telegraph a UK newspaper reported that food prices in Myanmar could be affected by this disaster

On May 6 2008 the Burma government representation in New York formally asked the United Nations for help But in other ways it remains resistant to the most basic assistance As of May 7 2008 the government of Burma has not officially endorsed international assistance but stated that they are willing to accept international assistance preferably bilateral government to government The biggest challenge at present is obtaining visas for entry into the country 

According to Thai Rath Newspaper of Thailand on 8 May 2008 in the afternoon of 7 May 2008 the Burmese junta permitted Italian flights containing relief supplies from the United Nations and twenty five tonnes of consumable goods to land in Myanmar However many nations and organizations hope to deliver assistance and relief to Burma without delay Most of their officials supplies and stores are waiting in Thailand and at the Yangon airport as the Burmese junta does not want to issue visas for many of those people These political tensions raise the concern that some food and medical supplies might become unusable even before the Burmese junta officially accepts the international relief effort

Cyclone Nargis caused destruction in Burma now officially called Myanmar It happened on May 2 2008 The storm was estimated to be category 4 Cyclone Nargis Caused destruction and at least 138000 fatalities There were around 55000 people missing and lots of other deaths were found in other places In Sri Lanka the cyclone produced masses of rainfall which led to flooding and landslides across ten districts across the country The districts Ratnapura and Kegalle were the most affected where more than 3000 families were dead Thousands of houses were flooded with 21 reported destroyed As a result the rainfall left 4500 people homeless and more than 35000 people were affected on the island Three people were reported injured on the island with two others dead The power of the cyclone lowered temperatures along the Indian coastline Estimates of the people still missing were 53836 with 84537 confirmed dead already Thousands more people were still missing or washed out at sea and drowned it was feared up to 1 million people might have died in this disaster Thailand sent 100000 USD in supplies thirty tones of medical supplies and twelve tones of food supplies As well as this Italy provided 30 tons of emergency relief equipment like stretchers generators and water purifiers Also the United Kingdom committed 17 million Australia gave 25 million and 31 tonnes of supplies whilst Belgium sent 250000 China sent 10 million in relief resources France gave 1500 tons of medicine food and water and Germany sent 30 million All to help the people who had been affected

Toilet paper is soft paper used to wipe urine or feces after using the toilet It is usually sold in rolls made up of square sheets

Modern toilet paper is very absorbent and is designed to break up in the sewage system The paper is often available in different textures and colours

In former times people had no toilet paper and used other things The Greeks for example used stones or human hair Germans used leaves and straw Some peoples used maize leaves Some used sand instead of toilet paper In the Middle Ages people used moss and the rich ones preferred sheep wool The first toilet paper was produced in China in the 14th century In 1857 Joseph Gayetty produced toilet paper in cartons in the USA And the first rolls of toilet paper were produced in 1890 in Great Britain In many parts of the world newspaper is used instead of toilet paper

The North Atlantic Treaty is the treaty that founded NATO It was signed in Washington DC on April 4 1949 The original twelve nations that signed it and thus became the founding members of NATO were the following

Later the following nations joined

When Germany was reunified in 1990 the country as a whole became a member of NATO

The key section of the treaty was Article V which says that each member state has to consider an armed attack against one state to be an armed attack against all states The treaty was created with an armed attack by the Soviet Union against Western Europe in mind but the mutual self defense clause was never used during the Cold War It was used for the first time in 2001 when the September 11 2001 attacks against the World Trade Center and The Pentagon had taken place

In the United States the treaty was approved by the Senate in a vote of 82 to 13 on July 21 1949

The blockade of Germany during World War I was a part of the First Battle of the Atlantic between the United Kingdom and Germany 

About 750000 civilians died because of starvation caused by this blockade during the War Many more had to die from starvation after the Armistice in November 1918 as the blockade was continued into 1919 in order to force Germany to sign the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919

The British established a naval blockade of Germany early in the war This blockade was unusually restrictive in that even food was stopped as it was said to help the war The Germans regarded this as an attempt to starve the German people into submission and wanted to fight back As Germany could not fight with British naval strength on an even basis the only possible way Germany could impose a blockade on Britain was through the submarines The German Chancellor was against this sort of blockade because it meant attacking neutral ships as those of the United States as well But the military pushed unlimited submarine warfare forward

On 4 February 1915 Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany declared the seas around the British Isles a war zone Effective 18 February Allied ships in the area would be sunk without warning British ships hiding behind neutral flags would not be spared though some effort would be made to avoid sinking clearly neutral vessels

The German U boat force was now primarily based at Ostend in Belgium So German submarines had better access to the sea lanes around England The Germans made use of this advantage and sent out about 20 U boats to begin the naval blockade In January before the declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare as the submarine blockade was called 43550 tonnes of shipping had been sunk by U boats The number of sinkings then steadily increased with 168200 tonnes going down in August

Losses of British warships were small Although the battleship Formidable had been sunk by U 24 on New Years Day the fast destroyer screens soon made successful attacks on battleships and cruisers a thing of the past On the other hand there was little a Royal Navy warship could do to sink a U boat if the submarines captain was reasonably alert The U boat was generally safe from shelling once it had submerged It could be rammed if it were at periscope depth but ramming was hardly a reasonable tactic as a standard practice

Destroyers were not able to hunt the U boats as they were protecting the fleet so the British pressed every vessel they could into service including yachts and trawlers as auxiliary patrol vessels However the U boats were able to easily evade the patrols and sink merchant vessels traveling unescorted

Militarily unrestricted submarine warfare was proving a great success and the U boats stood a good chance of starving Britain into surrender However in terms of the propaganda war it was a great disaster for Germany America wanted to stay out of the European war but American public opinion had turned against Germany as unrestricted submarine warfare seemed to confirm the German reputation for brutality The deaths of American citizens traveling on British vessels torpedoed by U boats began to make headlines in the US

When on 7 May 1915 the American liner Lusitania was sunk by a German submarine American outrage brought the US closer to declaring war on Germany Under threat of US retaliation on 27 August the Kaiser imposed severe restrictions on U boats attacks against large passenger vessels On 18 September 1915 he called off unrestricted submarine warfare completely

Under military pressure on Germany early in 1917 the Kaiser declared full unrestricted submarine warfare once more Some German diplomats believed that the Americans would avoid war at all costs and if not hopefully Germany could bring Britain to its knees before the weight of American power made itself felt in Europe In February 86 vessels were sunk followed by 103 in March and then 155 in April But the US finally declared war on Germany in April 1917 and both America and Britain were able to deal with the U boat problem

LeBron Raymone James is an American professional basketball player who plays for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association The Cleveland Cavaliers picked him in the 2003 NBA Draft with the first pick in the draft James did not play college basketball and entered the NBA Draft immediately after high school He went to high school in Akron Ohio

James played with the Cavaliers for his first seven seasons During that time he was the NBAs top scorers He was selected as an All Star several times In 2007 he led Cleveland to the NBA Finals He was the Most Valuable Player of the NBA for the 2008 09 NBA season and 2009 10 NBA season In his MVP years Cleveland had the best record in the NBA but did not make it to the NBA Finals

On July 8 2010 he said that he would next play for the Miami Heat He said this in a one hour TV special on ESPN called The Decision On December 2 2010 James played in Cleveland for the first time since leaving scoring 38 points for the Heat as they beat the Cavaliers 118 90 Many fans angry at James for leaving Cleveland booed him throughout the game and held up signs with negative statements against James

In the 2011 season the Miami Heat came in second place in the NBA They made it to the finals of the NBA and lost in six games to the Dallas Mavericks This caused celebration in Cleveland

Silesian Voivodeship is one of the 16 Voivodeships of Poland It can be found in the south Poland and in east Silesia The capital city is Katowice 

The First Battle of the Atlantic was a naval campaign of World War I largely fought in the seas around the British Isles and in the Atlantic Ocean Both the German Empire and United Kingdom relied heavily on imports to feed their population and supply their war industry thus both aimed to blockade each other The British had the Royal Navy which was superior in numbers and could operate within the British Empire The German fleet mainly used unrestricted submarine warfare The successful blockade of Germany contributed to its military defeat in 1918 and still in effect enforced also the signing of the Versailles Treaty in mid 1919

Grand Total 12850814 gross tons

Note that unrestricted submarine warfare was resumed in February 1917 and the British began full scale convoying in September 1917 The heaviest losses were suffered in April 1917 when a record 881027 tons were sunk by the U boats

Sukhoi is a company Russias major aircraft holding company employing more than 29000 people Among the holdings members are leading Russian design bureaus and aircraft production plants The Company supports a complete cycle of work in aircraft engineering from frontend engineering to comprehensive aftersales support The holdings products such as Su marque combat aircraft are state of the art weapons systems in the global market which form the backbone of the frontline aviation of Russia and tactical air forces of many other countries Sukhoi is Russias major manufacturer of export aircraft placed 3rd in the world in terms of the numbers of modern fighters produced The Company is currently implementing promising programmes in the field of military and civil aircraft engineering Sukhoi has made some of the worlds most innovative aircraft such as the Su 37 Super Flanker Most of Sukhois shareholdings belong in other countries than Russia

The United States has bought aircraft from Sukhoi for aggressive training operations However Sukhoi sold aircraft to Iran and thus the United States banned Sukhoi from ever doing business with them again

The origin of Joint Stock Company Sukhoi Design Bureau dates back to team No 4 of CAHIs AGOS aviation flying boat aviation and aircraft prototype engineering facility the team having been taken over by PO Sukhoi in October 1930 It was at that point that the team of the future Design Bureau started to take shape

The next nine years saw the team produce The experimental fighters I 3 I 14 DIP The record breaking RD aircraft used by the crews of VP Chkalov and MM Gromov to perform a number of trailblazing long distance flights and by the crew of MM Gromov to set an absolute world record in direct flight range 10148 km the distance having been covered in 62 hours 17 min The long range DB 2 bomber an upgraded version of which called Rodina was used by the all female crew under VS Grizodubova to perform a non stop flight from Moscow to the Far East The multi role BB 1 aircraft which was the first Sukhoi series aircraft to be produced in large numbers and in its short range bomber and artillery reconspotter versions took an active part in the 

Great Patriotic War To set up production of the BB 1 the government resolution of 29th July 1939 appointed PO Sukhoi Chief Designer He together with the team of the Design Bureau which had been given a standalone status was relocated to production aircraft plant No 135 in Kharkov

The subsequent efforts of the team are focused on development of versions of the Su 2 aircraft The prototype armoured Su 6 attack aircraft in single seat and two seat versions for which PO Sukhoi was awarded Stalins Prize of the 1st Level in 1943 The prototype cannon armed Su 1 fighter The prototype long range two seat armoured Su 8 attack aircraft The experimental Su 5 and Su 7 with combined powerplants Beginning in 1945 the Design Bureau was engaged in development and building of The Su 9 Su 11 Su 15 Su 17 jet fighters The Su 10 jet bomber The twin engine Su 12 piston reconspotter Su 12 The Tu 2 bomber platform was used to develop and put into production the trainer bomber UTB 2 it addition design work was carried out on passenger and troop carrying aircraft the Su 14 jet attack aircraft and a number of other aeroplanes

The five post war years saw the Design Bureau develop and introduce the nations first booster aircraft control system landing braking parachute catapult ejection seat with telescopic trolley jettisonable nose with pressurized cockpit In November 1949 a governments resolution scrapped the Design Bureau not to be resurrected till May 1953 when it was set up with new production facilities The Design Bureau got a new lease on life with the advent of supersonic jet aviation That is why the design teams major projects at the initial stage were the supersonic fighters S 1 and T 3 The S 1 provided a platform for the family of fighter bombers the Su 7 and Su 17 and more than 20 versions of them with the Su 17 becoming the USSRs first aeroplane with a variable sweep wing The experimental T 3 became the platform for the first Soviet target interception air launched missile system Su 9 51 and the subsequent Su 11 8M and Su 15 98 systems In the 60s the list of the equipment being developed by the Design Bureau became longer In 1962 a project was launched to produce a long range strikerecon aircraft the T 4 the maiden flight of the prototype taking place on 22nd August 1972 This aircraft featured this countrys first fly by wire system and automatic throttle control with a weld fabricated airframe of titanium and heavy duty steel

The year 1969 saw the maiden flight of the frontline Su 24 bomber with variable sweep wing the first Soviet all weather strike aircraft The Su 24 was produced in several versions It is currently in the inventory of the Air Forces of the RF and a number of other countries

The year 1975 saw the maiden flight of the armoured Su 25 attack aircraft designed for destruction of battlefield targets The Su 25 was the nations first mass produced jet attack aircraft it has several versions and is currently a key asset of RF combat aviation

In 1969 the Design Bureau started development of a fourth generation fighter and in 1977 the prototype Su 27 fighter made its first flight In the following years the Su 27 platform was used to produce the Su 27UB Su 30 Su 32 and Su 33

In order to implement design solutions and master new materials and engineering processes an experimental prototype aircraft the Su 47 was developed

The aircraft building experience gained by the Design Bureaus team over many decades made it possible to produce a family of aerobatic aeroplanes the Su 26 Su 29 and Su 31 With these machines the national aerobatics team of the USSR and RF have won a total of 330 medals at the World and European Championships

At the beginning of the 90s the Design Bureau initiated work on civil projects The year 2001 saw the first flights of the utility transport aircraft Su 80GP and the agricultural Su 38L plane

Sukhoi Civil Aircraft is currently engaged in developing a family of regional RRJ aeroplanes

In different periods the team was headed by PO Sukhoi YeA Ivanov MP Simonov and since 1999 the Chief Executive Officer has been MA Pogosyan Over many decades the Design Bureaus team has developed about 100 aircraft types and versions with 60 types put into production giving a total of 10000 production aeroplanes Over 2000 planes have been exported to 30 countries Su planes have been used to establish over 50 world records

I have indefinitely blocked IuseRosary after he swore numerous times on the RfA board and on my own talk page and inserted nonsense into his own RfA He also inserted images of me See here here here and here I would also advice to read IuseRosarys talk page and my own talk page

I think a block is in order but I want to know how long other users think the block should extend until since an indef block isnt yet needed  Gwib  1145 13 April 2008

Please no more voting This situation doesnt warrant a polling of opinions of all users I think a brief conversation among admins should give us an answer shortly I notice that last time when a week long block was suggested we never actually did it I think that his actions here would probably warrant a week long block The real question is whether or not we want to take into consideration the trolling thats going on at other wikis If so my opinion is that a 2 week minimum would be in order a month might be more appropriate Im aware of other trolling but am not yet sure of the extent I also think a bureaucrat should go ahead and close his RfA immediately I take his actions as saying hes done with it Not to mention that there isnt a chance in hell were promoting a troll to adminship Tygrrr 1457 13 April 2008

This page shows 203 acts of vandalism from this range and from 10 different IP addresses This means that each of the IP addresses in this range contributed to at least 20 acts of vandalism While most of the edits were made last year a few were made this year which gives me cause for concern At least 50 of the addresses have been blocked 2 of which have been blocked multiple times

Here are some examples of the vandalism

This is a truncated list The full list shows 203 acts of vandalism I would like to beseech the administrators of this site to be extra vigilant when dealing with this range in the future if the need so arises While I do not believe that any actions needed at this time I do believe that administrators should keep their eyes out for any edits from this range as they are most likely to be vandalism Cheers Razorflame 2031 14 April 2008

I spent a lot of time on this post and would hate to not have this information utilized in any partiuclar way Cheers Razorflame 1517 21 April 2008

Hi there I just wanted to inform all the administrators on this Wikipedia about three trolling ranges that have either been dealt with by Majorly or are currently being dealt with The three ranges that I have seen trolling are

All three of these trolling ranges have been continuously recreating the article Gsthae with Tempo and we have blocked at least 5 or 6 IP addresses for these ranges

These are just some examples Majorly has already blocked the 213103xxxxxx range and probably will block the others I just wanted to let you guys know what was going on Thanks Razorflame 1943 23 April 2008

I believe that this range should be range blocked for having an excessive case of vandalism from this range If you dont believe me just check out some of these changes

Heres some examples of the blocks that this range has received

This is just a truncated list The whole list is a list of 754 changes from this range which I believe the majority to be vandalism After checking through most of these changes I have found that most of them have been reverted I havent yet checked into the block history for this range but looking at the number of changes from this range I have reason to believe that this range is abusing their rights here on the Simple English Wikipedia and that this range needs to be blocked for excessive vandalism

Super Mario Bros Deluxe is a 1999 Game Boy Color video game by Nintendo It features the 1985 classic Super Mario Bros It is the first game that has the original Super Mario Bros on a handheld console Gamers can play the game on the go as a result

In this game Bowser has kidnapped Princess Toadstool Mario must go through the eight worlds of the Mushroom Kingdom to save her

The game was well received by the media They liked how well the port was done and hoped that Deluxe would be the first of many NES to Game Boy Color ports

This is the original Super Mario Bros game as it debuted in the year 1985 One change is that players can now save the game The original game did not have a save feature Players can only save while playing a level and there are three save files This version also has a world map that players stay on before entering a level and allows them to choose whether to play as Mario or Luigi by pressing the Select button

In challenge mode players have three medals to earn find all five red coins find the Yoshi egg and get a high score The red coins are hidden and require the player to look up or down and find them in areas that are otherwise hard to get to The Yoshi egg is hidden somewhere on the level Each level has a high score already set if the player ties or beats the high score he or she will earn the medal for that level Like the Original 1985 mode a player can use the Select button to choose whether to play as Mario or Luigi However unlike the Original 1985 mode a 1up mushroom only awards 1000 points instead of an extra life

In Vs Game two players link up using the Game Boy Color link cable The levels are full of white and red blocks Red blocks block the player while white blocks make it easier to go through the level

Boo is a ghost that appears in the Mario world The player can race against Boo on the same levels of the Vs Game course

After the player scores 300000 points in Original 1985 mode this mode is unlocked It contains the The Lost Levels which players could play before on Super Mario All Stars for the SNES It is not a true port Wind and the way Luigi moves were removed World 9 and A D are also not in this game This version also reuses the original Super Mario Bros graphics instead of the newer ones

A match is a tool for lighting a fire under controlled circumstances Matches are sold in quantity either in a box or in matchbooks Most often the match itself is a small piece of wood or hardened paper At one end the match is coated with a material that will ignite from friction The lighting end of a match is known as the match head It either contains phosphorus or phosphorus sesquisulfide as the active ingredient and gelatin as a binder There are two main types of matches safety matches which can be struck only against a specially prepared surface and strike anywhere matches for which any suitably frictional surface can be used

There are also electric matches which use electricity and not friction to produce a fire

Matches that used sulfur were mentioned by Martial in ancient Rome He called them sulphurata

Around the year 1530 Matches appeared in Europe The first modern self igniting match was invented in 1805 by K Chancel assistant to Professor Louis Jacques Thnard of Paris though The head of the match was made of a mixture of potassium chlorate sulfur sugar and rubber They were ignited by dipping the tip of the match in a small asbestos bottle filled with sulfuric acid This kind of match was quite expensive and its usage was dangerous so Chancels matches never gained much popularity

Storm matches also known as lifeboat matches or flare matches have an easy to strike tip like a normal match but much of the stick is coated with a combustible compound which will keep burning even in a strong wind They have a wax coating to make them waterproof They are a component of many survival kits This particular match was used in the first mass produced Molotov cocktails

Bengal matches are actually small hand held fireworks akin to sparklers They are similar to storm matches in form but they include compounds of strontium or barium in the compound on the stick to produce a red or green flame respectively

William W Gothard is an American speaker and writer At the age of 15 he gave his life to helping teenagers and their parents live their life in Christian principles Much of his reputation comes from his efforts to finish that goal He founded the Institute in Basic Life Principles in 1961 He has also spoken at conferences and has written many books

Gothard was born the third of six children to be born to William and Carmen Gothard His father was the manager of an engineering firm He later served with several ministries When Gothard was in the 5th grade he says that God brought made him know of his need for a personal Savior Shortly after beginning to believe that Jesus was his savior he and his family joined a fundamentalist church Gothard received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Bible from Wheaton College In 1957 he also got his Master of Arts degree in Christian Education

He worked with gangs church youth groups high school clubs youth camps and families that had problems He later wrote out seven principles of life he believed were not optional In 1964 Gothard was given youth work in the LaGrange Bible Church in suburban Chicago Also Gothards Alma mater Wheaton College let him design and teach a program based on his work with youth The course was given the name Basic Youth Conflicts two hours of upper division undergraduate and graduate credit were awarded to students completing the course Forty six students youth pastors and teachers registered for that first class The next year over one hundred students joined the class

Gothard started an organization in 1961 called Campus Teams which in 1974 changed its name to Institute in Basic Youth Conflicts Later in 1989 the name changed again to Institute in Basic Life Principles Gothard is now the president and a board member of this organization In the 1970s they started the Basic Youth Conflicts Seminar across the United States More people came averaging between 10000 and 20000 people at each seminar In the early 1980s the seminar attendance began to get smaller Today seminars keep being held around the world and have an alumni base of more than 25 million

In 1984 under Gothards leadership a homeschooling program the Advanced Training Institute of America was founded He is the author of many books In 2004 Gothard received his PhD in Biblical Studies Gothard is not married and has no children

Gothards teaching focuses on seven life principles 49 character qualities and 49 commands that Jesus gave He views the Bible as the word of God and teaches that while there is only one interpretation of scripture However Gothards use of the Bible has met with criticism On his website he states the goal of my teaching is to provide Biblical principles and concepts of life to guide people in their choices

Gothard tells people not to listen to un Christian music including all popular and contemporary Christian music He is in favor homeschooling IBLP publishes its own homeschooling material He has discouraged the use of contraceptives or other family planning

As a part of the IBLP Gothard organized the Medical Training Institute of America The main purpose of the ministry is to train men and women to assist families in making wise decisions about health care issues The Medical Training Institute of America is not a medical school and does not give degrees

A group called the Personal Freedom Outreach has criticized Gothard in several ways Such as say that Gothards views and his interpretations of Scripture are legalistic teachings And that IBLP and such are cult like Gothard was also accused by some of being broken wikt linkhypocritecontemporary for not practicing what he preaches about conflict resolution and for his quiverfull teachings that married Christians should have as many children as possible Even when Gothard himself is not married and has no children even into his 70s

Don Veinot claimed in his critical book on Gothard that Dr Ronald Allen a conservative evangelical went to a Gothard seminar in 1973 and wrote that In this seminar I was regularly assaulted by the misuse of the Bible particularly of the Old Testament on a level that I have never experienced in a public ministry before that time

OConnor and Rand met on a movie set in the years of silent films They were appearing as extras Rand was also writing scripts and OConnor building a movie and stage career Rand admired OConnors looks and tripped him on the set to get him to notice her They married in 1929 

To make sure they had enough income to succeed OConnor let his acting career go becoming a rancher so Rand could succeed as an author which was her ambition He appeared in a presentation of her play Night of January 16th after she became better known

The couple had no children but were friends with some college students and young professionals including Nathaniel Branden Alan Greenspan and Leonard Peikoff OConnor played host to many discussions and forums about human interaction relationships and societies while wife Rand led the conversations

OConnor developed problems with alcohol abuse after Rand became a widely known writer This was partly in reaction to Rands relationship with Branden which became very personal and hurt the marriage He had also given up their ranch when the couple moved to New York City from California and he felt out of place Later OConnor stopped drinking alcohol and he and Rand mended their relationship

He found a new pursuit as he developed a talent for painting Some of Rands books used his paintings as broken wikt linkartworkartwork for their covers

Wi Fi Protected Access is the name for a number of standards to use encryption on a Wireless LAN The standards were created because researchers had found several weaknesses in Wired Equivalent Privacy Wired Equivalent Privacy or WEP was the standard that came before it The protocol WPA2 implements most of the standard IEEE 80211i

Products that have the label WPA were designed to work with most cards even those that came out before there was WPA This is not true for access points though

Products with the WPA2 implement all of the standard This is more secure but it may not work with some older cards

Wired Equivalent Privacy is a standard to use encryption in Wireless LANs It was introduced in 1999 

In 2001 mathematicians showed that WEP is not very strong A WEP connection could be decoded with software that can be easily found within minutes Because of this finding IEEE created a new 80211i group to fix the problems By 2003 the Wi Fi Alliance announced that Wi Fi Protected Access would replace WEP which was a subset of then upcoming 80211i amendment Finally in 2004 they made it official and said that it would go ahead It was part of the full 80211i standard the IEEE declared that both WEP 40 and WEP 104 are not recommended because they are not secure enough 

Even though it only offers low security WEP is still widely in use WEP is often the first security choice presented to users by router configuration tools even Today WEP provides a level of security that deters only accidental use As a result people can invade and enter the network

People sometimes call it Wireless Encryption Protocol which is wrong

The Congress of Vienna was a conference of ambassadors of the major powers of Europe It was held in Vienna from November 1 1814 to June 8 1815 The chairman was the Austrian statesman Klemens Wenzel von Metternich 

Its purpose was to decide about the political situation in Europe after the defeat of Napoleon To be precise there was never one Congress of Vienna Instead there were discussions in informal sessions among the Great Powers 

The Congress was concerned with determining the entire shape of Europe after the Napoleonic wars with the exception of the terms of peace with France which had already been decided by the Treaty of Paris signed a few months earlier on May 30 1814

The four victorious powers hoped to exclude the French from participation in the negotiations but Talleyrand managed to get into her inner councils in the first weeks of negotiations

Subspecies is a classification in biology It is directly below species When looking at the Latin name subspecies are indicated by the third name Subspecies can mix with each other animals or plants from different subspecies can have offspring together 

When looking at subspecies they can also be told apart sufficiently by looking at the appearance or DNA of an animal or a plant 

Very often there are populations that are between two subspecies this is because evolution is a continuous process Subspecies can often be recognised by subsp or ssp especially in botany 

Examples of subspecies are

In physics centrifugal force is a fictitious force that appears when describing physics in a rotating reference frame it acts on anything with mass considered in such a frame Centrifugal force is fictitious because although it may feel to a person like a certain force is being exerted on them someone outside the scene will see something different

Example If John is in a car that takes a sharp right turn he will feel as though he is being pushed to his left This is an imaginary force called a centrifugal force or a running away from the center force John feels it because he is inside the car and is affected by it However if Johns friend Andy is on the side of the road facing the front of Johns car and watches Johns car take a sharp right turn Andy will see the car push John to the right with the car as it changes direction This is a real force called centripetal force and acts towards the center of the circle of rotation

In other words Johns body traveling in a straight line before the car turned wanted to keep moving in a straight line because it had momentum in that direction but the car which was exerting a force on John by turning is pulling him to the right John feels like his body is being pushed to the left as the car turns but in fact his body is being pulled to the right by the turning car

This is a problem that appears in rotating situations There is a difference between what appears to be happening if watched from the outside or if the event was seen from within a rotating object These differing viewpoints are called frames of reference

Despite the name fictitious forces are experienced as very real by anyone whose immediate environment is a non inertial frame Even for observers in an inertial frame fictitious forces provide a natural way to discuss dynamics within rotating environments such as planets centrifuges carousels turning cars and spinning buckets

On December 31 2007 Fox Noggins sister channel Nickelodeon GAS left the satellite and digital cable channel lineups and moved to the online only TurboNick with Fox Noggin at Nite taking over Nick GASs channel position after splitting from Fox Noggin Channel

The networks programming consists mostly of recent Nick Jr Fox Kids and Fox Noggins original programming

Fox Noggin Channel was originally created as a joint venture between Viacoms Nickelodeon News Corporation and the Childrens Television Workshop but Sesame Workshops interest was sold to Nickelodeon in 2002

From 1999 until 2002 Fox Noggin Channel was targeted at preteens Starting in 2002 Fox Noggin Channel was now targeted at pre schoolers the format was changed due to low ratings The network takes its name from a slang term for brain reflecting its original purpose as an educational channel Until the Fall of 2003 the network aired classic episodes of Sesame Street as well as classic Sesame Workshop productions such as 3 2 1 Contact Square One TV Cro and The Electric Company As of September 2 2007 Fox Noggin no longer airs any show produced by Sesame Workshop

In addition to classic episodes of Nickelodeon favorites such as Blues Clues and Dora the Explorer and original shows such as Oobi and Jacks Big Music Show many preschool oriented shows originating from non US English speaking countries that would otherwise not likely be seen on American TV are shown Some examples include Franklin from Canada and Tweenies Connie the Cow Tiny Planets and 64 Zoo Lane from the UK However in 2006 this is being de emphasized Tweenies was permanently pulled from the schedule in January and Tiny Planets was pulled in April 2006 Tiny Planets was previously shown intermittently but not every day at 600AM Eastern500AM Central as Tweenies was for a year until it was pulled Since July 2006 this is also being done with 64 Zoo Lane suggesting that it too may disappear eventually However they have also recently introduced The Upside Down Show which is from Australia

The Spanish Conquest of Yucatn was the campaign undertaken by the Spanish conquistadores against the Late Postclassic Maya states This part of the conquest and colonization of the Americas began in the early 16th century but it took more time than the similar campaigns against the Aztec and Inca Empires It was about 170 years later before the last Maya stronghold fell that of the Itza capital of Tayasal on Lake Petn Itz in 1697 But except for the Petn region and the Guatemalan highlands the Spanish had control over Yucatn itself already by 1546 

Unlike the campaigns against the Aztec and Inca states the Maya had no single political center Therefore the Spanish had to fight city by city to brake resistance by the indigenous peoples   In the beginning the conquistadores were mainly interested to get as much gold and silver as possible Because the Maya lands were poor in this respect they were not very interesting for the Spanish at that stage But when land workers became important for the colonies the Spanish turned to the Maya region That was around the 1520s

The unit is named in honor of Henri Becquerel 

The Popol Vuh is a book written in the Classical Quich language It contains mythological stories and a genealogy of the rulers of the Post Classic Quich Maya kingdom of highland Guatemala

The book contains a creation myth followed by mythological stories of two Hero Twins Hunahpu and Xbalanque The second part of the book deals with details of the foundation and history of the Quich kingdom

The book is written in the Latin alphabet but it is thought to have been based on an original Maya codex The original manuscript which was written around 1550 has been lost but a copy of another handwritten copy in the early 18th century exists today in Chicago

The significance of the book is enormous since it is one of a small number of early Mesoamerican mythological texts it is often considered the single most important piece of Mesoamerican literature 

Part 1

Part 2

Part 3

Part 4

The book begins with the creation myth of the Kichee Maya which credits the creation of humans to the three water dwelling feathered serpents

and to the three other deities collectively called Heart of Heaven

who together attempted to create human beings to keep him company

Their first attempts proved unsuccessful They attempted to make man of mud but man could neither move nor speak After destroying the mud men they tried again by creating wooden creatures that could speak but had no soul or blood and quickly forgot him Angered over the flaws in his creation they destroyed them by tearing them apart In their final attempt the True People were constructed with maize The following is an excerpt of this myth

The Popol Vuh continues to be an important part in the belief system of many Quich 

Here are the opening lines of the book in modernized spelling and punctuation

When you see letters mixed with numbers and arithmetic like x22x 7 there is a good chance that it is a polynomial Mathematicians scientists and engineers use polynomials to solve problems Polynomials are taught in algebra which is a gateway course to all technical subjects

In algebra when you see letters numbers and arithmetic the understanding is that the letters stand either for numbers you do not know or for numbers that change during the course of the problem variables such as time If the only arithmetic is addition subtraction multiplication and whole number exponents then that mixture of letters numbers and arithmetic is called a polynomial If harder operations are used such as division or square roots then what you have is an algebraic expression A polynomial is an easy to use algebraic expression

Polynomials are often used to form polynomial equations such as x22x 7 0 or polynomial functions such as f x22x 7

The most important thing to remember about a polynomial is multiplication is understood That means for example that 2x means two times x or twice x If x is 7 then 2x is 14

The parts of a polynomial separated by plus or minus signs are called terms The plus sign or minus sign are part of the term Thus in the polynomial x22x 7 the terms are

If a polynomial has only one term it is called a monomial 5x3 is a monomial The multiplier out in front is called a coefficient the letter is called an unknown or a variable and the raised number after the x is called an exponent On a calculator and on some computers instead of putting an exponent above and to the right of the x the symbol is used so that the monomial above could be written 5x3

A polynomial with exactly two terms is called a binomial

A term with no letters in it is called a constant term

A term with one letter but no exponent is called a first degree term or a linear term

A term with one letter which has exponent 2 is called a second degree term or quadratic term A quadratic equation is an equation in which the largest exponent on any term is 2

In mathematics an unknown is a number we do not know In algebra an unknown is represented by a letter For example in the equation E m c2 the letter m represents an unknown mass and the letter E represents an unknown amount of energy Not all letters in algebra represent unknowns In the example above c represents a known quantity the speed of light which is about 186 thousand miles per second Because c is so large the formula E m c2 tells a person who understands algebra that in an atomic reaction a small amount of mass can produce a very large amount of energy

An online pharmacy is a pharmacy that operates on the Internet to sell medications to consumers There are online pharmacies in many countries of the world  from India the US Germany the UK  and many other nations that sell to consumers in their own countries and often to consumers worldwide 

Depending on its location and local regulations an online pharmacy may or may not require prescriptions to purchase prescription medications 

Prices at a given online pharmacy can vary from one city or country to another Typically drug prices at online pharmacies located in countries with drug price controls in place will have more affordable costs In contrast costs at pharmacies in countries where there are no drug price controls will usually be much higher Especially for consumers seeking low priced medications it can be very worthwhile to compare prices at various online pharmacies Prices can vary as much as 80 percent or more for one medication from one country to another

The foramen magnum is one of several holes in the base of the skull Normally the spinal chord is attached to it The Foramen Magnum is the largest aperture in the primate body This hole is located in the base of the human skull as part of the occipital bone back of the monkey skull and in between those locations for apes It is directly correlated with locomotion

Bipedalism is a form of movement on the ground Some species have evoled the ability to move on two limbs Those that do use their rear limbs Some animals move on two limbs all the time they are called habitual bipeds Optional bipeds have an alternative

The Taung Child is a fossil of a skull The skull also has an imprint of the brain It belongs to an Australopithecus africanus It was discovered in 1924 by quarryman working for the Northern Lime Company in Taung South Africa Raymond Dart an anatomist at the University of Witwatersrand received the fossil recognized its importance and published his discovery in the journal Nature in 1925 describing it as a new species The British establishment was at the time enamored with the hoax Piltdown man which had a large brain and ape like teeth  the exact opposite of the Taung Child  and Raymond Darts finding was not appreciated for decades

The fossil consists of most of the face and mandible with teeth It also has a natural endocast of the braincase It is estimated to be 25 million years old

Taung Child is believed to have been about three years old at the time of its death It was a creature standing 3 6 at approximately 20 24 pounds Taung Child had a cranial capacity of 340 cc living mainly in a savanna habitat Examinations of Taung Child compared to that of an equivalent 9 year old child suggest that A africanus had a growth rate to adolescence which is about the same as that found in modern apes like chimpanzees rather than that of modern Homo sapiens However intermediate species such as Homo ergasterHomo erectus are thought to have gone through growths intermediate between modern humans and apes The evidence has mostly been based on that of Turkana Boy discovered in 1984

In early 2006 it was announced that the Taung Child was likely killed by an eagle This conclusion was reached by noting similarities in the damage to the skull and eye sockets of the Taung Child to the skulls of primates known to have been killed by modern eagles

The left hand side of the endocast of the Taung child is covered in beautiful calcium carbonate crystals

Its significance lies in the fact that this was the first of the fossils which had been found in the twenties and thirties to provide evidence that humans indeed have a natural history all of their own  just as Darwin had predicted 

The skull is now in repository at the University of Witwatersrand

The federal government of the United States has three branches of government the legislature executive and judiciary

The executive branch is the part of the government that enforces the law Members of the US Electoral College elect a President who is the leader of the executive branch as well as the leader of the Armed Forces The President decides whether or not the bills that the Legislative branch passes will become laws and the President may veto any bill The President may also make executive orders to ensure that people follow the law Two of the most famous executive orders were President Abraham Lincolns Emancipation Proclamation and President Dwight D Eisenhowers order to send 1200 soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division to allow the Little Rock Nine into a school that refused to admit African Americans students The President is in charge of many departments that control much of the day to day business of government For example Department of Commerce makes rules about trade and business The President chooses the heads of these departments and also nominates judges at the federal level However the Senate part of the legislative branch must agree with all of the people the President chooses The President may serve two 4 year terms making 8 years in all

The Judiciary branch is made up of courts  Supreme Circuit the magistrate and municipal courts The Judicial branch interprets the laws

The state judges are elected by the citizens rather than being appointed They also run for their office as members of a political party

The duties of the judicial branch include 

Interpreting state laws Settling legal disputes Punishing violators of the law Hearing civil cases Protecting individual rights granted by the state constitution Determing the guilt or innocence of those accused of violating the criminal laws of the state Acting as a check upon the legislative and executive branches of state government The Supreme Court of Appeals in West Virginia is the highest court and supervises the lower courts It is composed of five judges who are elected for twelve year terms by the voters The Supreme Court is required to meet twice a year in January and in September and may hold special terms when necessary The Supreme Court has the authority to determine if state laws and actions of state officials including the Governor are constitutional Laws and executive orders cannot be enforced if they violate the state constitution

Most cases brought before the Supreme Court are appeals that have been tried in the circuit or magistrate courts Once a decision has been made by the Supreme Court that is the final decision with the exception of conflicts between state and federal laws which may be appealed to the United States Supreme Court

Of the five Supreme Court justices one is selected to be the Chief Justice The selection process is a rotation between the five justices each who serve as the chief justice for one year The Chief Justices duties include submitting a budget to the Legislature and according to the state constitution the Supreme Court will be appropriated for whatever amount it requests The Chief Justice also assigns justices to write opinions and decisions of the Court

The legislative branch is the part of the government that makes laws The legislative branch is called Congress Congress is divided into two houses

One house is the House of Representatives The House of Representatives is made up of Representatives who are each elected by voters from their own state The number of Representatives a state has is based on how many people live there the more people a state has the more representatives it gets Every 10 years the US Census Bureau conducts a census or count of the population of the United States States gain or lose Representatives based on their total population as shown by the census Representatives serve two year terms The total number of representatives today is 435 The leader of the House of Representatives is the Speaker of the House who is also the person who would become president if the President and Vice President were unable

The other house is the Senate In the Senate each state is represented equally by two Senators Because there are 50 states there are 100 senators Before the President makes treaties or appoints officials the Senate must approve them Senators serve six year terms The Vice President of the United States serves as president of the Senate but may only cast votes in order to break a tie vote In practice the Vice President is usually absent from the Senate and a Senator is selected to serve as president pro tempore or temporary president of the Senate

Representatives and Senators propose laws called bills in their respective houses A bill may be voted upon by the entire house right away or may first go to a small group of members of that house known as a committee which may recommend a bill for a vote by the whole house If one house votes to pass a bill the bill then gets sent to the other house if both houses vote for it it is then sent to the President who may sign the bill into law or veto it If the President vetoes the bill it is sent back to Congress If Congress votes again and passes the bill with at least a two thirds majority the bill becomes law and cannot be vetoed by the President

Under the American system of federalism Congress may not make laws that directly control the states instead Congress may use the promise of federal funds or extenuating circumstances such as national emergencies to encourage the states to follow federal law This system is both complex and unique

PCLinuxOS is a Linux operating system It is a free operating system for personal computers that was made to be easy to use 

The start of PCLinuxOS was a set of RPM packages created to improve successive versions of Mandrake Linux These packages were created by Bill Reynolds a packager better known as Texstar From the year 2000 to 2003 Texstar maintained his repository of RPM packages in parallel with the PCLinuxOnline Web site In an interview Reynolds said he started PCLinuxOS to provide an outlet for his crazy desire to package source code without having to deal with egos arrogance and politics

In 2003 Texstar created a fork of Mandrake Linux 92 Working closely with The Live CD Project Texstar has since developed that fork independently into a full fledged distribution The initial releases were successively numbered as previews ie p5 p7 p8 up to p81a then p9 p91 p92

In August 2006 three new CDsISOs numbered 093a were released MiniMe Junior and Big Daddy At the same time the original packages that make up the KDE desktop environment have been split into smaller ones while some less essential portions of KDE have been omitted from the CD As a result Texstar was able to fit the OpenOfficeorg package into the BigDaddy release MiniMe remains a minimal Live Install CD for experienced users wishing to add their own selection of packages while Junior adds a few essential desktop oriented packages meeting the user somewhere between the two other releases PCLinuxOS 2008 MiniMe edition was released on 2008 01 07

With the advent of PCLinuxOS 2007 also known as 94 PCLinuxOS became rebased on Mandriva Linux 2007 This implied a shift to a more modern code which will require a complete reinstall to this version The new version features a new look and built in 3D effects Both Beryl and Compiz come pre installed and can be configured with the PCLOS Control Center A new logo has also been designed for the new version and is incorporated in the boot screen A new login screen has been designed entitled Dark PCLinuxOS 2007 final version was released on 2007 05 21

PCLinuxOS Gnome 2008 a remastered community edition of PCLinuxOS featuring the GNOME 2212 desktop was released on March 21 2008 and is currently hosted at linuxgatororg

PCLinuxOS is distributed as a Live CD which can also be installed to a local hard disk drive When used as a Live CD it can work with a USB flash drive where the users configuration and personal data are saved The entire CD can be copied to and run from memory increasing speed PCLinuxOS uses the Advanced Packaging Tool a package management system together with Synaptic Package Manager a GUI frontend to APT in order to add remove or update packages If there is enough memory on the machine and a network connection the Live CD can update packages PCLinuxOS is also designed to be easy to remaster after installation creating ones own personalized CD using the mklivecd tool

Although it retains a similar look and feel to Mandriva Linux PCLinuxOS has diverged significantly The code was officially forked into an independent project in 2003 but after three years of contiguous development the devs took advantage of further development in Mandriva and forked the code again for PCLinuxOS 2007 

PCLinuxOS maintains its own software repository available via the Advanced Packaging Tool and its Synaptic front end completely replacing Mandrivas urpmi PCLinuxOS endeavors to maintain a fully valid upgrade path for version 10 This means that an installation could be continuously updated to the latest versions of packages hence foregoing the need to re install the entire distribution upon each successive release In the test releases before 10 it has sometimes been necessary to perform a reinstallation

Other differences include its own menu arrangement and custom graphics and icon sets

PCLinuxOS places specific emphasis on desktop computing concentrating its efforts for home or small business environments hence paying less attention to other more traditional uses like servers

There are several community projects associated with PCLinuxOS Since PCLOS includes the mklivecd script there are several third party distros based on PCLOS Some include 

The PCLinuxOS Magazine project is a community driven free publication focused on the users of PCLinuxOS by MyPCLinuxOScom This online publication was started in September 2006 by a group of PCLOS users with some publication experience All content for the publication is solicited from the PCLOS user base

The PCLinuxOS beautification project encourages and hosts user submitted media for visual aspects of PCLinuxos

All the above projects are tracked and have forums on the larger MyPCLinuxOS whose stated purpose is to be the home site of all community projects related to PCLinuxOS and offers help and support whether youre looking to start a projector join a project

A Lei is a flower necklace from Hawaii The flower used most is the Hibiscus or the Orchid May First is called Lei Day in Hawaii

The Orchidaceae is a large flower family which contains orchids It has about 1000 genera and more than 15000 species They are thought to be herbs This is because they do not produce wood Orchids can be found in almost every country in the world except for Antarctica

People have grown orchids for a great number of years They grow orchids for show for science or for food

Some orchids have very special ways of pollination For example the Ladys Slipper can trap insects and make them pollinate the flower Another instance is the Austrian orchid which grows underground and is pollinated by ants

Columbia and Ecuador have many different species The Brazilian Atlantic forest has over 1005 hundred species Other places with great variety are the mountains in the south of the Himalayas in India and China The mountains of Central America and southeastern Africa also have various species especially the island of Madagascar

Ecuador has 3459 species the greatest number recorded After Ecuador is Columbia which has 2723 After Columbia is New Guinea 2717 and Brazil which has 2590 species in all

In warm places where there is much grass or in places where there is dry savanna and rocky fields orchids grow in the ground They have firm underground roots and sometimes have tubers to help protect themselves against cold or snow The tubers also help protect them against long drought or fire The cold would freeze the roots if they were not protected to store the nutrients they need for blooming in the spring

It is thought that some species are becoming extinct in the wild This is mainly because people cut too many forests for agriculture But most of the species thought to be almost extinct are some of the most commonly grown and sold orchids Most of the rarer species are not recorded as in danger because people are not interested in them Because they are not costly the government does not usually study wild orchids Only academics find time to study them

The Little Ice Age was a period of cooling after a warmer era that is known as the Medieval Warm Period 

Climatologists and historians find it difficult to agree on either the start or end dates of this period Some say the Little Ice Age started about the 16th century and continued to the mid 19th century It is generally agreed that there were three minima one beginning about 1650 one about 1770 the last one about 1850 Each time was separated by slight warming intervals At first it was believed that the LIA was all over the world Now it is not clear if this is true 

During the period 16451715 in the middle of the Little Ice Age there was a period of low solar activity known as the Maunder Minimum The physical link between low sunspot activity and cooling temperatures has not been established but the coincidence of the Maunder Minimum with the deepest trough of the Little Ice Age is suggestive of such a connection The Sprer Minimum has also been identified with a significant cooling period near the beginning of the Little Ice Age Other indicators of low solar activity during this period are levels of the isotopes carbon 14 and beryllium 10

Throughout the Little Ice Age the world also experienced heightened volcanic activity When a volcano erupts its ash reaches high into the atmosphere and can spread to cover the whole of Earth This ash cloud blocks out some of the incoming solar radiation leading to worldwide cooling that can last up to two years after an eruption 

Another possibility is that there was a shutdown or slowing of Thermohaline circulation also known as the great ocean conveyor or meridional overturning circulation The Gulf Stream could have been interrupted by the introduction of a large amount of fresh water to the North Atlantic possibly caused by a period of warming before the little ice age There is some concern that shutdown of thermohaline circulation could happen again as a result of global warming 

Beginning around 1850 the climate began warming and the Little Ice Age ended Some global warming critics believe that Earths climate is still recovering from the Little Ice Age and that human activity is not the decisive factor in present temperature trends but this idea is not widely accepted

A trade route is a series of broken wikt linkpathwaypathways or roads that is used for the commercial transport of cargo 

Historically the period from 1500 BCE1 CE saw the Western Asian Mediterranean Chinese and Indian societies develop major transportation networks for trade Europes early trading routes included the Amber Road which served as a network for long distance trade Maritime trade along the Spice route became prominent during the middle ages nations tried to control this influential route During the Middle Ages organizations such as the Hanseatic League aimed at protecting interests of the merchants and trade also became increasingly important

In modern times commercial activity shifted from the major trade routes of the Old World to newer routes between modern nation states This activity was sometimes carried out without traditional protection of trade and under international free trade agreements which allowed commercial goods to cross borders with relaxed restrictions Innovative transportation of the modern times includes pipeline transport and the relatively well known trade using rail routes automobiles and cargo airlines

Zircon is a silicate mineral It is found in many different places in almost all kinds of rock The chemical it is made up of is called zirconium silicate ZrSiO4 Clear zircon may look like diamond and has been used as a cheaper replacement for diamond It is not the same as cubic zirconia which is man made from different chemicals In the United States zircon is considered to be the birth stone for the month of December

Zircons from the Jack Hills in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane Yilgarn Craton Western Australia have yielded UPb ages up to 4404 billion years This is judged to be the age of crystallization making them the oldest minerals so far dated on Earth In addition the oxygen isotopic compositions of some of these zircons indicate that more than 44 billion years ago there was already water on the surface of the Earth This interpretation is supported by additional trace element data but is also the subject of debate

John Piper could mean

John Stephen Piper is a Reformed Baptist theologian preacher and author He is the pastor for preaching of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis Minnesota and has written many books He started the evangelical ministry named Desiring God after his book Desiring God Meditations of a Christian Hedonist

Piper was born in Chattanooga Tennessee He is the son of Bill and Ruth Piper When he and his older sister were still young the Pipers moved to Greenville South Carolina where he spent the rest of his childhood He later graduated from Wade Hampton High School His father was an evangelist who worked with international radio and Bible programs until his death on March 6 2007

Piper went to Wheaton College in 1964 68 He majored in literature and minored in philosophy Because he studies Romantic Literature in college he went on to enjoy it in life Today he writes poems for special family events as well as writing story poems about the lives of biblical characters

After college he studied for and received a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena California While there he took several courses where he studied the writings of Jonathan Edwards He also did some doctoral work in New Testament Studies in Munich West Germany from 1971 1974

In 1980 after what he said was something that he could not turn down he became a preacher Piper became Pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis Minnesota He has been working there ever since Piper became popular when his book Desiring God Meditations of a Christian Hedonist was published He has written many books since In 1994 he started Desiring God Ministries Today Desiring God puts all of Pipers sermons and articles from the last three decades online for free as well as offering books CDs and DVDs

On January 11 2006 Piper was told that he had prostate cancer According to a letter sent to his church he and his doctors thought that the cancer was not a big problem When Piper talked about this he said This news has of course been good for me The most dangerous thing in the world is the sin of self reliance and the stupor of worldliness The news of cancer has a wonderfully blasting effect on both I thank God for that The times with Christ in these days have been unusually sweet Piper had surgery on February 14 2006 He married Nol Henry in 1968 and they now have four sons a daughter and several grandchildren

Piper calls himself a Christian Hedonist and teaches that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him He also teaches that Gods highest pursuit and mans deepest happiness are the same in one pursuit namely the pursuit of joy in God He was learned this theory in the writings of Jonathan Edwards Blaise Pascal and C S Lewis among others 

Piper believes in justification by faith alone apart from good works His teachings talk about the need for the Christian to have faith sanctification as this is evidence of Gods saving grace Piper says that someone who says they are a Christian but does not act Christian shows that they were never a true believer

Piper believes in the Post Tribulational view of the Rapture and leans towards historical premillennialism He believes that Romans 11 teaches many ethnic Israeli people will be saved at Jesus second coming

Piper is very neutral about the Torah in Judaism He says that it was made by God to reveal sin and show that man does not live up to Gods righteous standards Christians living under the New Testament are not under the Old Testament law and are able to complete it through faith in Jesus Christ

Piper teaches that God has only one chosen people mostly Jews in the Old Testament but he believes now that relationship has been won by the Christian church So the Church is rightful inheritor of all the promises made to Israel and Jews who do not take Jesus as Messiah have no right to this blessing

On the topic of spiritual gifts Piper believes that supernatural gifts such as miracles healings and speaking in tongues are around today He does not believe that the job of apostle is worked today He also believes that the gift of prophecy in the church is from God but is not infallible because of the medium namely men Thus while prophecies are to be embraced scripture reveals that they be sifted or tested in order to decipher that which is good

Most of Pipers books can be read online for free at Desiring Godorg

A gas chamber is an airtight room used for killing people or animals by means of gas The gas used is either poisonous or it causes asphyxiation The people or animals are put into the gas chamber the door is sealed airtight from the outside and a gas such as carbon monoxide or hydrogen cyanide is put into the chamber The victims die from choking from being made to breathe the poisonous gas

The gas chamber was first used in Nevada United States in 1924 as the government of Nevada did not want to use an electric chair and considered hanging to be cruel and inhumane Gee Jon was the first person to be executed in a gas chamber The gas chambers became notoriously infamous in the Nazi Germany as they were first used in the T 4 programme and then in the Holocaust for mass murdering of Jews Gypsies and other people that the Nazis did not like

By the 1990s the gas chamber had become less popular in the United States because people began to feel that it was too painful of a way to die When Donald Eugene Harding was executed in Arizona in 1992 witnesses described it violent death and an ugly event California stopped the use of gas chamber in 1995 as the officials found that dying from hydrogen cyanide poisoning which can take up to around fifteen minutes is an extremely painful way to die The last person to be executed in the gas chamber in the United States was Walter LaGrand in Arizona in 1999 It is unlikely that anybody else will be executed in the gas chamber because it is likely that it would be ruled cruel and unusual punishment and thus against the Constitution

The Battle of the Bulge was a battle of Allied Powers against Nazi Germany that took place during World War II The battle took place between middle of December 1944 to middle of January 1945

Until the end of 1944 the Allies had been able to recapture France and Belgium from Germany However the Allied forces were stopped There were few reasons why they were stopped

Adolf Hitlers plan was to push the Allied forces back from the Ardennes forests recapture the port of Antwerp and prove that Germany would not surrender As a result of this step he expected the Allies to end the war with Germany so that Germany could focus on stopping the Soviets from the Eastern Front

The plan did not work The Soviet Union forces almost reached Berlin and the Third Reich was about to collapse Hitler gathered his last good soldiers to mount one last attack He did it although his German generals did not agree with this plan of attack

The Allies did not see the Germans coming They were surprised and suffered many losses especially because the Allies commanders did not believe that the German could attack with big forces The Germans atttacked on 16 December

On 17 December the German forces massacred Allies forces near the city Malmedy An armoured unit of the Waffen SS under the command of Joachim Peiper attacked American military convoy They captured its soldiers and took them to a close field The German shot the Americans and 86 of them were killed Peiper was released by the Allies in 1956 and was murdered in his house in Paris in 1976

The soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division were besieged by the Germans at the important cross road Bastogne In brave battle they managed to keep Bastogne in Allies hands

The Wermacht managed to arrive 25 kilometers east to the city Namir

Despite the big surprise the Wermacht was not the same army from 1940 They did not have a lot of fuel and had planned to capture the Allies fuel to keep going After the weather improved Allied planes bombed the Wermacht columns pushing the Germans back slowly and on 16 January 1945 their outlet lines

The Allies and the Germans did not gain or lose any land Because the Allies had a much larger army they could make up their losses but for the Germans they could not replace what they had lost It was their last major attempt to gain ground

Nothing is a concept of being without all form of matter

The Moon is what people generally say when talking about Earths moon The moon can be seen from Earth The moon is actually very large about a quarter the size of the earth but because it is far away it looks very small The gravity on the moon is one sixth of the Earths gravity It means that you will be 6 times lighter on the moon than on Earth The moon is a rocky and dusty place

The Moon is lit up by the sun as it goes around the Earth This means sometimes people on Earth can see the whole moon and other times only small parts of it This is because the moon gives out no light People only see the parts that are reflecting light from the Sun These different stages are called Lunar Phases It takes the Moon about 2953 days to complete the cycle from big and bright to small and dim and back to big and bright As the moon passes between the Earth and Sun this phase is called the New Moon The next phase of the moon is called the waxing crescent followed by the first quarter waxing gibbous then to a full moon A full moon occurs when the moon and sun are on opposite sides of the Earth As the moon continues its orbit it becomes a waning gibbous third quarter waning crescent and finally back to a new moon People used the moon to measure time A month is approximately equal in time to a lunar cycle

Because the moon is tidally locked towards Earth half of the moon cannot be seen from Earth This is called the dark side of the moon even though the sun does shine on itwe just never see it lit

The moon has fascinated people for as long as people have existed to see it People often dreamed of standing on the moon and looking at Earth

Before people stood on the Moon some of the big countries in the world the United States and Russia sent robots to the moon These robots would orbit crawl or in the case of Luna 2 crash into the moon The robots were the first things that humans made that touched the Moon

Humans finally landed on the Moon on 21 July 1969 Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their lunar ship on the surface of the moon Then as half the world watched him on television Armstrong climbed down the ladder of the Eagle and was the first to touch the Moon as he said Thats one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind Famously the a was lost on the way to Earth and found many years after Later Buzz Aldrin hopped out of the Eagle and together they put the American flag near the spot where they landed Even though their footprints were left on the moon a long time ago it is likely that they are still there If you leave footprints on Earth wind will blow the dirt around filling in the footprints and making them disappear Rain could also smooth out the dirt But on the moon there is no wind or rain or even air Because of that the footprints do not get filled in or smoothed out

More people landed on the moon between 1969 and 1972 when the last spaceship Apollo 17 visited Eugene Cernan of Apollo 17 was the last person to touch the moon since 2008

Because its smaller in size the Moon has less gravity than Earth So if a person weighs 60 pounds on Earth the person would only weigh 10 pounds on the moon But even though the moons gravity is weaker than the Earths gravity it is still there If person threw a ball while standing on the moon it would still fall back down However it would fall much more slowly And if a person jumped up as high as possible on the moon he would jump higher than on Earth but still fall back to the ground A person could jump and do lots of tricks on the moon and not hurt himself at all even if he did not land on his feet Thats because the moons gravity would not pull as hard as the Earths gravity does 

As was said before the moon has no rain or wind so footprints would never wear away naturally

The Moon also has no atmosphere Without an atmosphere people are not protected from heat or cold Because of this astronauts have to wear very heavy spacesuits to protect themselves and to carry oxygen to breathe Of course since the moon does not have a lot of gravity the spacesuit would not be as heavy as it would be on Earth which is very heavy

In the Earth the sky is blue because the blue rays of the sun bounce off the gases in the atmosphere making it look like blue light is coming from the sky But on the moon because there is no atmosphere the sky looks black even in the daytime And because there is no atmosphere to protect the moon from the rocks that fall from outer space they crash right into the moon and make big broken wikt linkdentdents called craters The moon has thousands of these craters

The giant impact hypothesis is that the Moon was created out of the debris from a collision between the young Earth and a Mars sized protoplanet This is the favored scientific hypothesis for the formation of the Moon

On November 13 2009 NASA said that they had found a lot of water on the moonand maybe we could live on the moon someday

FileElectoral mapsvgthumb350pxrightElectoral votes by statefederal district for the 2008 electionThe United States Electoral College is a name used to describe the 538 Presidential electors who come together every four years during the presidential election to give their official votes for President and Vice President of the United States The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election of the president by Congress and election by popular vote 

Originally electors voted for two candidates and the people with the two highest vote totals would be elected President and Vice President That did not work very well so today the President and Vice President are elected on separate ballots

In order to win in the Electoral College a candidate needs 270 votes If there is no winner in the Electoral College the House of Representatives elects the President and the Senate elects the Vice President

Deduction is one of the two main types of reasoning The other is induction In deduction we apply a general rule to a particular case

Deductive arguments are attempts to show that a conclusion must follow from a set of premises or hypotheses A deductive argument is valid if the conclusion does follow necessarily from the premises 

Aristotle the first person we know who wrote down laws of deduction gives this example of deduction

The first two statements are called premises The last statement is called the conclusion

Mathematicians use deduction to discover new mathematics

Induction is one of the two main forms of logical reasoning The other is deduction In induction we find a general rule by using a large number of particular cases For example watching water in many different situations we can conclude that water always flows downhill

Induction is the method of science A scientist makes a large number of observations and then suggests a general rule that all of these observations follow He then publishes his ideas and they are checked in many other cases by other scientists The general rule becomes a scientific theory only if it passes all of these tests If it fails even one test then the theory must be either changed or thrown out The major scientific theories of today have been tested many thousands of times and have passed every test

The method of induction must be used carefully because even one failure disproves the theory For example people noticed that when the letters i and e appear together in a word the i usually comes first as in sieve bier and die So should we use induction to make a rule Always put i before e No because there are exceptions ceiling deceive and receive Then do we want a rule i before e except after c But there is another set of exceptions neighbor and weigh So someone proposed the rule i before e except after c or when sounded like a as in neighbor and weigh Even that rule is not always true Consider the word weird

You can see how hard it is to come up with a rule that is always true 

When a person uses induction carelessly and believes a rule that is not always true we say that they jump to a conclusion

Oklahoma Territory was an organized territory of the United States from May 2 1890 until November 16 1907 when Oklahoma became the 46th state It was made up of the western area of what is now the state of Oklahoma The eastern area consisted of the last remaining part of Indian Territory

In everyday speech the word theory is used as a best guess In modern science a scientific theory is a tested and expanded hypothesis that explains many experiments and fits ideas together in a framework If anyone finds a case where all or part of a scientific theory is false then that theory is either changed or thrown out

An example of a scientific theory that underwent many changes is the germ theory of disease In ancient times people believed that diseases were caused by the gods or by curses or by improper behavior Germs were unknown because germs are too small to see With the invention of the microscope germs were discovered and the germ theory of disease was proposed Thanks to the germ theory of disease many diseases can now be cured However the germ theory of disease had to be modified because some diseases are not caused by germs The flu and scurvy are examples of diseases that are not caused by germs but viruses or poor nutrition Scientists modified the germ theory of disease so that today we would state that theory as Some diseases are caused by germs

To be a scientific theory a theory must be tested a large number of times by many different scientists in many different places and must pass the test every time It must be stated exactly often using mathematics And it must fit in with all of the other scientific theories Science has many branches Physics chemistry biology geology and astronomy are some of the major branches of science A scientific theory in one branch of science must hold true in all of the other branches of science For example the atomic theory of matter that all matter is made up of atoms was discovered using physics but the chemicals used in chemistry the living tissue used in biology the rocks studied in geology and the planets studied in astronomy are all made up of atoms The atomic theory of matter holds in every area of science

Sometimes scientists come up with a theory that is wrong The discovery of an exception to a scientific theory is a major event and a scientist can become famous by discovering an exception to a rule Einstein became famous for his theory of relativity which found an exception to Isaac Newtons laws of motion Newtons theory which had been accepted for hundreds of years had to be changed and has been changed

Here is a list of some of the major theories of modern science These theories have been tested thousands of times and no exception has been found

Sacred Cenote is a well known cenote at the Maya site of Chichen Itza One can access it by a 900 foot paved corridor that leads from the Great Plaza The Sacred Cenote was used for human sacrifices to the rain god Chaac in periods of drought

A cenote is a type of sinkhole that contains groundwater It is typical in the Mexican Yucatn Peninsula and some nearby Caribbean islands The term comes from a word used by the lowland Yucatec Maya to refer to any location where groundwater can be got at 

Cenotes are surface connections to underground water bodies While the most well known cenotes are large open water pools measuring tens of metres in diameter such as those at Chichn Itz most cenotes are smaller sheltered sites and do not necessarily have any surface exposed water The term cenote has also been used to describe similar karst features in other countries such as Cuba and Australia in addition to the more generic term of sinkholes 

Cenote water is often very clear as the water comes from rain water infiltrating slowly through the ground The groundwater flow rate within a cenote may be very slow at velocities ranging from 1 to 1000 meters per year Cenotes around the world attract cave divers They have explored extensive flooded cave systems some of which have been investigated for 100 kilometers or more

Monkton is an English village located on the Canterbury Ramsgate road at the south western edge of the Isle of Thanet Kent near St Nicholas at Wade and Minster in Thanet The church is dedicated to Mary Madgalene Inside the Church is a plaque comemorating a Local Soldier Euncie Rochelle who died in the Iraq war Monkton is no longer believed to be a village in its own right and is usually assumed to be part of neighbouring village Minster in Thanet

In the November of 2007 the hamlet exploded with the remains afterwards being burnt down with firefighters attempting to put out the blaze but having such a small population and being so far away from any other main towns the thirty firefighters were unaible to reach it in time However fortunately all of Monktons population of twenty people was evacuated into safety to nearby Minster However Minster was reported to have complained about the overcrowding caused by this and threw out the newcomers expecting them to go back to the destroyed settlement Unfortunately for the hamlet Monktons largest building a single storey house was also lost and therefore it is thought to take a long time before the people of Monkton are able to resettle in a new hamlet or whether they will be able to reconstruct some of their old habitat

An electric chair is a specially built chair which is used to execute convicted criminals by electrocuting them This means that they are being killed as a punishment for a crime that they did usually a murder

An electric chair is a strong wooden chair which has electrodes for running electric current through the convicts body One electrode is placed on the convicts head and another is placed on the convicts right shin When the switch is turned on a 2000 volt current goes through the convict The current is to stop the heartbeat cause unconsciousness and cause death Sometimes the chair was made from the wood of the gallows which it replaced

The electric chair is sometimes used as the very symbol of death penalty It is also a part of Americana and the electric chairs of many states have ironic nicknames like Old Sparky Yellow Mama Gruesome Gertie Sizzling Sally or Hot Seat The execution itself is sometimes called riding the lightning

The electric chair was designed by Dr Alfred Southwick and first built by Harold Brown in 1888 Dr Southwick had seen a drunk man falling in a generator and dying immediately from electric shock There had been a very gruesome hanging in New York in 1886 that did not go right The drop had been too long and the convicts head was torn off Many people wanted a less cruel method of execution The state of New York chose the electric chair

This execution method has been used only in the United States and for several decades in the Philippines The electric chair has become a symbol of the death penalty and a part of American folklore However it is becoming replaced as a method of executing criminals in the United States by lethal injection Altogether 25 US states and the US federal government have used the electric chair

Death in the electric chair is usually quick as the convict dies from electric shock which stops the heart However if something goes wrong the death is more like frying the convict alive The electric chair has been declared as a cruel and unusual punishment in many states and is no longer used in most states In fact there are no longer any states that use the electric chair as its main way of executing criminals All states that use the death penalty use lethal injection as its main way of executing criminals now

So far the latest person executed in an electric chair has been Paul Powell a man who killed a teenage girl and raped another He was executed in Virginia in 2010

The Santiago Bernabu is a football stadium in Madrid Spain It is the second biggest stadium in Spain It has a capacity for 89000 people to sit

Electrocution or electric shock is when electricity passes through something living It happens when the human body gets in contact with electric current The electrocution has originally meant execution on electric chair but can mean today any accident with electricity 

The human body can stand voltage well but not very much electric current If the electric current is strong it can stop heartbeat and cause death Really high voltage andor current can cause severe burns and even fry the victim alive

Tikal is the largest of the ancient ruined cities of the Maya civilization It lies in modern day Guatemala at coor at dms 171319N893722Wtypelandmark Now it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist spot 

Tikal was one of the major cultural and population centers of the Maya civilization The oldest monumental architecture at the site dates to the 4th century BC The best time of Tikal was during the Classic Period from 200 AD to 900 AD In this period Tikal was in charge of the Maya region politically economically and militarily This is because it was linked with areas throughout Mesoamerica such as central Mexican the center of Teotihuacan After the end of the Late Classic Period no new major monuments were built Some palaces were burned and the population declined The site was abandoned by the end of the 10th century

The ruins are on lowland rainforest but Tikal had no water other than what was collected from rainwater and stored underground Archaeologists working in Tikal during the last century used the underground facilities to store water for their own use The absence of springs rivers and lakes nearby is unusual for a major city However Tikal did well with broken wikt linkintenseintensive agricultural techniques These were more advanced than the slash burn methods originally theorized by archeologists The reliance on seasonal rainfall made Tikal open to drought This is now thought to play a major part in the Classic Maya Collapse

The known rulers of Tikal with general or specific dates attributed to them include the following

Possibly among the earliest traces of art are Venus figurines These are figurines that show women Most often the women are shown as being pregnant with breasts well visible The figurines occur from Western Europeto Siberia Most are about 30000 years old Two figurimes have been found that are much older the Venus of Tan Tan has been dated to 500000 to 300000 years ago It was found in Morocco The Venus of Berekhat Ram was found on the Golan Heights It has been dated to 300000 to 200000 years ago It may be the earliest thing that shows the human form 

Different kind of stone bones and ivory were used to make the figurines Some are also made of clay which was then burned in a fire This is one of the earliest known traces of the use of ceramics

Today it is not known what the figurines meant for the people who made them There are two basic interpretations

Scientists have excluded that they were linked to the fertility of fields because agriculture had not yet been discovered

The two figurines that are older may have mostly formed by natural processes The Venus of Tan Tan was covered with a substance that could have been some kind of paint It contained traces fo Iron and Manganese The figurine of Berekhat Ram shows traces that someone worked on it with a tool A study done in 1997 states that this could not have been done by nature alone

This is a list of Muslims or people who follow Islam

The Venus of Tan Tan is a venus figurine It was found in Morocco It has been dated to be between 300000 and 500000 years old Unlike the other venus figurines it appears neither male nor female

The Venus of Berekhat Ram is a stone that was found on the Golan Heights in 1981 Scientists have proposed to classify it as a Venus figurinebecause there are traces it was worked on with a stone tool The things that have been worked can clearly be told apart from the natural stone It is therefore agreed that that the pebble has been modified by human action even though it bears little resemblance to the much later Venus figurines of about 30000 years ago

Uxmal is a large pre Columbian city The ruins are in Mexico today in the state of Yucatn According to the records of the Maya the city was built around the year 500 AD According to current research about 25000 people lived there Most of the buildings that can be seen today were built between 700 and 1100 After 1200 there seems to be no new construction The ruling family moved their capital elsewhere and the population of the city declined 

According to the documents of the Spanish conquerors the city still had some importance in the 1550s It was probably abandoned soon afterwards as the Spanish built no city nearby

Tayasal is a pre Columbian Maya archaeological site from the Postclassic period The site is in the southern Maya lowlands on a small island in Lake Petn Itz This island is now part of the Department of Petn in northern Guatemala Tayasal was the capital of one of the last independent Maya polities to be conquered by the Spanish conquistadores and colonizers along with Zacpeten and Eixequil in 1697 

As an archaeological site it was heavily damaged by the Spanish after its fall The capital city of the modern Petn department Flores has been built over the island and the nearby shores of the lake 

The Itza left the Yucatn region in the 13th century and built the city later known as Tayasal as their capital They called it Noh Petn or literally City Island It was also called Tah Itz or Place of the Itz

In 1541 Hernn Corts came to the island on route to Honduras but needed to move on and did not try to conquer it due to its very good defensive position 

The Spanish were not able to conquer the island until 1697 after several attempts that begun in 1629 when they marched in from Corozal in Belize Yucatn and Alta Verapaz attacked with boats and destroyed it Many Itz people hid in the jungle for years The structures of Noh Petn were turned into the Roman Catholic church and other buildings in the city of Flores 

An Archeological site is a physical location where archaeologists work Usually evidence has been found of a previous cultural achievement The archeologists working there will classify what they find They may also change the site so that what has been found can be preserved better

The site will be laden with trenches on specific rows or points so that excavation teams can excavate better To start the excavation the topsoil will be removed and special tools like pickaxes and mattocks would be particularly useful for breaking up and removing very hard compacted spoil Shovels and spades are used to clear away bulk debris left from picks and mattocks Other hand tools used in bulk clean up work would include hoes rakes forks and of course the wheelbarrow to cart it all away In some circumstances all of the spoil will be fine sieved from the wheelbarrow before dumping into a waste area

Central bearded dragons can grow to be about 2 feet long Half of the length of a Bearded Dragons body is its tail Females are usually smaller than males Bearded dragons come in many colors like brown grey reddish brown and even orange They sometimes change color a little bit when it gets hot or cold They have special scales that look like spikes on the sides of their body throats necks and heads These spines look a little like a beard and that is where a bearded dragon gets its name If a bearded dragon is scared it will flatten its body against the ground puff out its spiny throat and open its jaws to make itself look larger Bearded dragons sometimes open their mouths wide to allow hot air to warm them better when they are lying in the sun They will also open their mouths to help them cool down the warm air and heat escapes through their mouths It is similar to panting

In the wild the central bearded dragon lives in dry hot forests and deserts in Central Australia They can climb very well and spend a lot of time on top of tree branches fenceposts and bushes They are cold blooded and need the sun to keep their bodies warm so they spend the mornings and evenings out in the sun During the hottest part of the day and during the night they hide underground

Bearded dragons do not make sounds usually but when they are scared they might hiss like a cat They move their bodies and change color to talk to each other Sometimes young bearded dragons will wave their arms to greet adults A dominant bearded dragon will take the highest spot to rest and will climb over others to get there Bearded dragons also bob their heads up and down to communicate

When a female bearded dragon is ready to lay eggs she will not eat very much and will spend most of her time trying to dig

Central bearded dragons are omnivores They eat small and large insects grasshoppers but never feed them small animals like mice or small lizards It could make them impacted They also eat soft plants like leaves fruits vegetables and flowers They get most of their water from the food they eat but they need to drink sometimes too

Boxer is a character from the book Animal Farm by George Orwell He is a horse and is nearly eighteen hands high In the book he is as strong as two horses put together He has a white stripe down his nose and that gives him a strange appearance But still he was respected for his great power in work and his good character He works as a cart horse as does Clover Benjamin likes him in secret Through the book he falls into the quarry when he was pulling a cart full of rock and is sent the a veterinarian on an other farm by Napoleon Squealer then claims he died peacefully but Benjamin realises hes actually gone to the knackers Boxer was the most hard working animal in the farm and was respected by all When Boxer tried to support Snowball against Squealer Napoleon tries to attack Boxer with his dogs but Boxer easily crushes the dog Boxer is an ideal character showing loyalty along with his great hard work  

Boxer represents the loyal communist working class Him being slaughtered represents Stalin getting rid of the workers that are too old or too ill to participate in labour The windmill represents them building the Industries and Boxer getting up early represents the working class working extremely hard His gullibility represents the working class being gullible and doing what there told for promises in the future His slogans i will work harder represents the working classes belief in Communism and Napoleon is always right represents their trust in the political system 

His slogans are 

I will always work harder Napoleons always right 

He is a very loyal character caring and empathetic but a bit thick and does not see the real truth behind situations

Talking about problems is better than showing the possible problems that could happen by making problems yourself

Some people may sometimes get annoyed or angry when something that is important to them has not been done the way they wanted it to The person may show other similar situations which were dealt with better and this would mean there was an inconsistency with Wikipedia

When this happens the user who is angry may sometimes try to prove their point by showing the problems with the system by making problems happen These problems are usually disruptive

Sometimes to make a point people use policies badly

Some examples include 

Not all wrong use of policy is on purpose Some users may not know all the policies or may forget about them so those users are not breaking the rules

Sometimes people cause arguments by trying to put something on wikipedia even though it has been proved wrong They may argue about it without listening to other users

Wikipedia works with good faith edits and consensus When people refuse to listen even after other people administrators etc explain things to them then the person is making a point

If people purposefully put wrong information into Wikipedia to see how long it can stay there or to cause disruption this is wasting peoples time and is making a point

The Atari 2600 is a video game console It was first released in the United States in October 1977 The Atari 2600 uses game cartridges which can be changed in and out to change games This was a new idea in video games at the time Before the 2600 people had to buy a different system for each game they wanted to play Over 30 million Atari 2600 consoles were sold

While Atari designed their console they code named it Stella When it came out in 1977 they called it the Video Entertainment System There was also a version that was sold at Sears called the Sears Video Arcade It was not called the Atari 2600 until the Atari 5200 came out in 1982 The 2600 is called this because that is the part number the company used to tell the difference in versions

When the Atari 2600 came out it usually came with two joystick controllers a pair of paddle controllers and a game cartridge There were eight games available when the console launched Those games were Combat Air Sea Battle Basic Math Blackjack Indy 500 Star Ship Street Racer Surround and Video Olympics The 2600 originally sold for 199 FileCx78jpgAtari 2600 Paddle Controller FileAtari 2600 JoystickjpgAtari 2600 Joystick Controller FilePac man computer game for Atari 8 bit computers 1982jpgPac Man Game Cartridge 

The Atari 2600 uses different sets of colors depending on the television used with it

When the Atari 2600 was released nine games were available Those games were Combat Air Sea Battle Basic Math Blackjack Indy 500 Star Ship Street Racer Surround and Video Olympics Later more games came out including Pac Man Missile Command and Space Invaders The best selling Atari 2600 game was Pac Man which sold 7 million copies

Combat was chosen to be included in the box with the Atari 2600 It contained 27 games in one cartridge Each game involved tanks bi planes or jets

Space Invaders began as an intensely popular Japanese arcade game In 1980 a version of the game was released in America for the Atari 2600 The pixelated aliens from this game are still used as a popular symbol today

Pac Man began as an arcade game developed by Namco In 1982 a version was released for the Atari 2600 It sold the most copies of any game released for the Atari 2600 but though despite this the game was not popular with critics and consumers It was unpopular because of the major differences in gameplay between the 2600 version and the arcade version

See List of Atari 2600 Games for a bigger list of games

In 1980 the Atari 2600 was at the middle of an important development in video games the beginning of third party developers for console video games In 1980 a group of four dissatisfied Atari employees founded the company Activision Activision began by releasing four games Dragster Fishing Derby Checkers and Boxing This was an important moment in video game history as now every video game console on the market depends on some third party game support

Today those who want to play the games designed for the 2600 do not have to try to find the original console and cartridge as many of the games have been recreated in video game emulators One such emulator Stella will function on most any operating system After downloading this emulator users can download games from other websites and use this program to play them

In 1986 a cheaper version of the Atari 2600 was released Some people called this the Atari 2600 Junior It was smaller than the original version This Atari cost 50
