The Firebird is a ballet with music by Igor Stravinsky It was written in 1910 and choreographed by Michel Fokine The story of the ballet is based on a well known Russian folktale The Firebird The ballet is also known by its French title LOiseau de Feu

The music was first performed as a ballet by Diaghilevs Ballets Russes in Paris on 25 June 1910 conducted by Gabriel Piern Stravinsky was asked to write the ballet by the impresario Diaghilev Before that Diaghilev had asked the Russian composer Anatoly Lyadov to write it but Lyadov seems to have been too lazy to start work on it so Stravinsky was asked instead

The story is about Prince Ivan who climbs into the garden of the immortal and evil Kashchei He sees a magic bird flying in the garden He catches it The Firebird asks him to let him go promising the prince that she will do anything to help him if he gives him his freedom Ivan lets the bird go but takes a magic feather from the birds tail

Twelve princesses with their Tsarevna come into the garden and dance They are in the power of Kashchei Prince Ivan falls in love with the Tsarevna The next day he asks Kashchei whether he can marry her Kashchei is angry and sends his magic creatures after the prince Kashchei is about to turn him to stone when the Prince waves his feather The Firebird appears and comes to the princes rescue She puts a magic spell on the animals and they dance Then they all fall asleep When Kashchei wakes up the Firebird forces him to dance While he is dancing the Firebird tells Ivan that Kashcheis soul lies in an egg Ivan smashes the egg Kashchei loses his power the creatures and the palace The princesses wake up and the Prince marries the Tsarevna

The ballet is 50 minutes long Stravinsky arranged some of the music into shorter suites so that they could be played by an orchestra at concerts He did this three times in 1911 1919 and 1945 Each suite is a little different The 1919 version is the one most often heard while the 1945 is the longest as it has most of the ballet music in it

Animals with nervous systems are born with instincts An instinct is a part of the behaviour of an organism It is inherited not learned However the term does not include the operation of sense organs and does not include the normal working of the autonomic nervous system Instincts are to do with visible muscular action in response to releasers Releasers are triggers which set off chains of instinctive behaviour Although instincts are not learned in some cases their performance can be improved by experience and practice

There are some problems with the term instinct It can be used loosely to mean a general tendency such as a mans instinct is to protect his family It can be used to describe chains of behaviour of mixed origin Properly it is used only of well defined acts whose causation is inherited and which are triggered by specific stimuli called releasers 

Other terms for instinct are fixed action patterns and innate behaviour chains

Instinctive behaviours can be variable and responsive to the environment Any behaviour is instinctive if it is performed without being based upon prior experience that is in the absence of learning Sea turtles newly hatched on a beach will automatically move toward the ocean A joey climbs into its mothers pouch upon being born Honeybees communicate by dance the direction of a food source without formal instruction Other examples include animal fighting animal courtship behaviour internal escape functions and building of nests

Reflex actions are a special case A true reflex is distinguished from other behaviours by mechanism they do not go through the brain Rather the stimulus travels to the spinal cord and the message is then transmitted back through the body tracing a path called the reflex arc Reflexes are similar to fixed action patterns but a fixed action pattern can be processed in the brain as well A male sticklebacks instinctive aggression towards anything red during his mating season is such an example Examples of instinctive behaviours in humans include many of the primitive reflexes such as rooting and suckling behaviours which are present in most mammals

Some instinctive behaviors depend on maturational processes to appear For instance we commonly refer to birds learning to fly However young birds have been experimentally reared in devices that prevent them from moving their wings until they reached the age at which their cohorts were flying These birds flew immediately and normally when released showing that their improvement resulted from neuromuscular maturation and not true learning

While fixed action patterns and reflexes are clear examples of almost entirely instinctive behaviours most behaviours are complex and consist of both instinctive and learned components For instance in imprinting a bird has a sensitive period during which it learns who its mother is Konrad Lorenz famously had a goose imprint on his boots Thereafter the goose would follow whomever wore the boots The identity of the gooses mother was learned but the gooses behavior towards the boots was instinctive Similarly sleeping in humans is instinctive but how much and when one sleeps is clearly subject to environmental factors Whether a behaviour is instinctive or learned is common subject of nature versus nurture debates

In a situation when two instincts contradict each other an animal may resort to a displacement activity

Instinct is a built in need to do something Its not something an animal thinks about its something it does automatically A baby bird automatically throws its head back opens its mouth wide and screams for food It is an instinct Baby bats automatically cling to the cave wall Grasshoppers naturally spit out the things in their stomach on predators that try to eat them Bees naturally work to take care of the hive and make honey Butterflies inherit preferences for laying their eggs on certain plantsplant their young need to eat and thats where they lay their eggs Animals are born with these instincts and they follow their instincts without conscious thought

Organisms have two ways they can get behaviours One way is learn by observation and by repeating things which have a pleasant outcome The other way is to inherit the behaviour pattern by heredity

Petrouchka or Petrushka is a ballet with music by the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky It was written for Sergei Diaghilevs Ballets Russes in 1911 It was first performed in Paris at the Thtre du Chatelet on 13 June 1911 with the conductor Pierre Monteux with choreography by Mikhail Fokine and sets by Alexandre Benois

Petrushka is a story of a Russian traditional puppet He is made of straw Inside his body is just sawdust The puppeteer brings the puppet to life and gives it human feelings

At the first performance the role of Petrushka was danced by Vaslav Nijinsky Many of the audience found the music quite modern to listen to There were unusual rhythms and strange harmonies For example the two chords of C major and F sharp major are often heard together This is bitonality  It is a short ballet about 40 minutes long

In 1921 Stravinsky arranged three of the dances from his ballet for piano solo It is extremely difficult to play It was written for the great pianist Arthur Rubinstein In 1947 Stravinsky made changes to the ballet music using a smaller orchestra 

The action takes place on Admiralty Square in the Russian town of St Petersburg The Shrovetide fair is in full swing It is a Russian carnival The people are enjoying themselves before a period of fasting

The bustle of the crowd are described very well in Stravinskys music An organ grinder and two dancing girls entertain the crowd The music is a popular French song Une Jambe de Bois The drums then play a loud roll to announce the entry of the puppeteer or Charlatan When the curtain rises we see a tiny theatre The Charlatan introduces the puppets which have no life They just hang limp in his hands The three puppets are Petrushka a Ballerina and a Moor

The Charlatan plays a tune on his flute and the puppets come to life They dance a lively Russian dance

We then see Petrushka in his dark cell The Charlatan kicks Petrushka into this miserable cell Petrushka is treated very badly He is very unhappy The Charlatan is cruel because he gave Petrushka feelings and then made him miserable Petroushka hates the Charlatan and is in love with the Ballerina Petrushka shakes his fist at the portrait of the Charlatan which hangs on the wall He tries to escape from the cell but he cannot do so

The Ballerina comes into the room Petrushka wants to show his love for her but the Balllerina does not want him and leaves

In the third scene we see that the Moor has a much better life than Petrushka The Moor has a nice large room with bright colours He lies on a divan and plays with a coconut trying to cut it with his scimitar When he cannot do it he thinks the coconut must be a god and so he prays to it

The Charlatan puts the Ballerina in the Moors room The Ballerina thinks the Moor is handsome  She plays a tune on a toy trumpet and dances with the Moor 

Petrushka has managed to break out of his cell He interrupts the Ballerina and the Moor  Petrushka is madly jealous and attacks the Moor but soon realizes he is too small and weak The Moor beats Petrushka Petrushka runs for his life with the Moor chasing him and escapes from the room

The fourth and final scene goes back to the carnival scene It is early evening Several people each perform a dance the wet nurse the peasant dancing with a bear and some gypsies coachmen grooms and masqueraders 

Suddenly Petrushka rounds out into the crowd followed by the Moor with his sword The Moor catches him and kills him

The police come and question the Charlatan because they think he may be responsible for the murder of Petroushka The Charlatan shows everyone that Petrushka is only a puppet by holding the corpse above his head and shaking it

It is night the crowd leave The Charlatan leaves carrying Petrushkas body Suddenly he sees the ghost of Petrushka on the roof mocking him The Charlatan is terrified and runs away

The audience is left to wonder whether Petrushka is real or not

Black body radiation is radiation produced by heated objects particularly from a kind of special object that is made so it will absorb all radiation that falls on it and so that it will also radiate at all frequencies that heat energy produces in it

This part of the story of radiation was first explained by James Clerk Maxwell via wave theory but the predicted and actual intensity vs frequency curves did not go together right Because the way of classical physics did not work Max Planck explained their relationship by saying that there are individual things that vibrate each at its own frequency Each wave of each frequency has its own special energy level A single x ray is very high energy and can go right through the human body A single wave of infrared light is very low energy cannot go through the human body and can only warm it Planks good thinking was to realize that in order to get a single wave at the x ray frequency it was necessary to have a big enough package of energy to make such a strong wave So if a black body took in a single wave at the x ray frequency then it could give off an x ray at some later time But if the black body only took in infra red light it would not matter how much of it was absorbed It could only give off infra red light and could not give off even ordinary red light much less any higher energy light such as ultraviolet light or x ray radiation Planck said that the total energy given off by a black body at any particular frequency is equal to the number of the vibrating things n that were vibrating at a given frequency f times a special constant h that turns frequency units into energy units The equation is

The constant he made h is called the Planck constant

The idea that a unit of light at a given frequency always has the same energy the idea that there is a quantum of energy for each unit of light at a given frequency became the doorway into quantum mechanics so the idea of a black body is something that is basic to modern physics It shows up in discussions of a wide variety of physics topics having to do with energies and frequencies

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 9 Over the next week clouds and other thunderstorms grew near the tropical wave By August 22 it was upgraded to Tropical Depression Eleven Tropical Depression Eleven was located just to the north of Cuba at the time On August 23 it became Tropical Storm Jerry Jerry had winds at 40 miles per hour however the minimum pressure was not at the lowest still Jerry weakened back to a depression The National Hurricane Center did not expect to Tropical Depression Eleven to become a tropical storm because most of the showers and thunderstorms were over land 

On August 23 Tropical Storm Jerry made landfall in Jupiter Florida while it was still a weak tropical storm with winds at 40 miles per hour It stayed as a tropical storm until it went into the Gulf of Mexico It made a second landfall in Florida of August 25 while a tropical depression It crossed into Georgia soon after and into South Carolina Jerry died on the border of Georgia and South Carolina on August 28 The remains of Jerry either moved to the south back over to Florida or to the east over North and South Carolina But the remains of Tropical Storm Jerry did last for five days over the United States 

Tropical Storm Jerry killed two people in Florida three people in South Carolina and three more in North Carolina Jerry caused 19 million in damage in Florida 10 million in South Carolina and 11 million in North Carolina In total Jerry caused 40 million in damage and 8 people to be killed This was the first time since 1990 that a name starting with the letter J was used It was also only the second time that the name Jerry made been used to name a storm in the Atlantic Because there was not much damage the name Jerry was not retired so it was used again in 2001 and 2007 it will also be used again in 2013

In the opening volumes of the Histoire naturelle Buffon questioned the usefulness of mathematics criticized Carl Linnaeuss taxonomical approach to natural history outlined a history of the Earth with little relation to the Biblical account and proposed a theory of reproduction which ran counter to existing ideas 

The early volumes were condemned by the Faculty of Theology at the Sorbonne Buffon published a retraction but he continued publishing the offending volumes without any change

Buffon noted that despite similar environments different regions of the world have distinct plants and animals This observation later known as Buffons Law may be the first principle of biogeography 

Buffon understood the idea of common descent and discussed it a number of times This does not mean he believed in it Probably he did not but he discussed it fairly openly on a number of occasions Interpreting his ideas is not simple for he returned to topics many times in the course of his work

In volume 14 he argued that all the worlds quadrupeds had developed from an original set of just thirty eight quadrupeds On this basis he is sometimes considered a transformist and a precursor of Darwin

In Les poques de la nature Buffon discussed the origins of the solar system speculating that the planets had been created by a comets collision with the sun 

He also suggested that the earth originated much earlier than the 4004 BC of Archbishop James Ussher Basing his figures on the cooling rate of iron tested at his Laboratory le Petit Fontenet at Montbard he calculated that the age of the earth was 75000 years Once again his ideas were condemned by the Sorbonne and again he issued a retraction to avoid further problems

Charles Darwin wrote in his preliminary historical sketch added to the third edition of On the Origin of Species Passing over Buffon with whose writings I am not familiar Then from the fourth edition onwards he amended this to say that the first author who in modern times has treated it evolution in a scientific spirit was Buffon But as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods and as he does not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species I need not here enter on details 

The paradox of Buffon is that according to Ernst Mayr He was not an evolutionist yet he was the father of evolutionism He was the first person to discuss a large number of evolutionary problems problems that before Buffon had not been raised by anybody he brought them to the attention of the scientific world Except for Aristotle and Darwin no other student of organisms whole animals and plants has had as far reaching an influence

He brought the idea of evolution into the realm of science He developed a concept of the unity of type a precursor of comparative anatomy More than anyone else he was responsible for the acceptance of a long time scale for the history of the earth He was the founder of biogeography And yet he hindered evolution by his frequent endorsement of the immutability of species He provided a criterion of species fertility among members of a species that was thought impregnable

In chemistry a nitride is a compound of nitrogen with a less electronegative element attached together in a specific way Nitrides are a large class of compounds with a wide range of properties and applications

Most of the names for nitrides follow a simple pattern the name of the element attached to the nitrogen then nitride So GaN would be gallium nitride 

There are some exceptions however for the compounds that has had a usual name before For example NH3 is not called as hydrogen nitride even if it is the most simple of this class of molecules but it is continuing to be commonly ammonia

The Hiram College Library has provided a welcoming comfortable and intellectually stimulating environment for many generations of students faculty staff and community members But it has not always been the same place or even in the same place through its history The Library has grown added and subtracted parts nearly been destroyed and moved from one end of the campus to the other in its 100 year career

Prior to 1900 library facilities at Hiram College consisted of the small libraries of each of the student literary societies Delphic Hesperian and Olive Branch Societies usually limited access to their members and the only common library was the colleges depository collection of federal government publications that was stored in the original Hinsdale Hall 

The Teachout Cooley Library of Hiram College was erected in 1900 with money given by Abram Teachout Built of brick and wood it had two stories with a three story tower In 1923 a supplemental gift from the Teachout family made possible an addition built to the south of the original building and joined to it by means of a vestibule A Greek portico entrance was added and the size of the Library was essentially doubled An observatory with its telescope a gift of Lathrop Cooley was a prominent feature of the building until 1939 The observatory was relocated to its present site on Wakefield Road thanks to the generosity of Ella M Stephens

The Librarys collections then consisted of those books donated by the literary societies and the depository collection These were consolidated by the first Librarian of the college Emma Ryder While a student at Hiram she was made the librarian of the Olive Branch Society and did such an excellent job that she was asked to organized the libraries of the other societies After she graduated in 1890 she went on to study at the University of Chicago and Syracuse University before returning to Hiram in 1896 She served as the colleges Librarian until 1907 and introduced the Dewey Decimal System to the Library She also taught Greek and Latin was the College Registrar and the House Mother for Miller Hall 

The old building was largely destroyed by fire in February of 1939 In addition to thousands of books also lost were a major portion of the files and records of Professor John S Kenyon and the furnishings of the Vachel Lindsay Reading Room Kenyon a linguist was a prominent scholar of English pronunciation and regional dialects

But like a phoenix the Library rose again and a newer more modern building was erected with a main reading room on the lower floor and a browsing room above The card catalog was saved from fire damage and much of the lost book collection was replaced The west end of the browsing room was designated the Vachel Lindsay Room and the east end as the Adelaide Robbins Rhodes Room In 1962 this area was converted into the Geidlinger Music Room through a gift from Ms Ella Geidlinger and Mrs Ruth G Sheets in memory of their sister Charlotte Geidlinger 

In 1948 a further addition to the south side of the Library was built again with funds from the Teachout Foundation Finally a fourth addition was necessary by 1963 This expanded the building westward toward Dean Street and effectively doubled the size of the Library once again Included were rooms for the newly planned Archives and Special Collections It was made possible by a substantial gift from Mr and Mrs Harley C Price and the Library was renamed the Teachout Price Memorial Library

During the 1970s the Library came to share space with newer services the Media Center and the Dray Computer Center both on the lower level of the building The Media Center became administratively incorporated into the Library  By the late 1980s the continued growth of the collection the demand for more study space and the need to incorporate new technologies led to the decision to plan for a new building A comprehensive capital campaign by the college featured the construction of a 71 million facility as its centerpiece Funding came from hundreds of contributors and friends prominently the Kresge Foundation however no single donor contributed enough to confer a name to the building and so it remains the Hiram College Library Completed in 1995 the collections equipment and some of the furnishings of the Library were relocated in the new building that summer Features of the new building included space for a video studio a redesigned Archives and Special Collections a Library Instruction Room group study rooms and a multi functional space the Pritchard Room 

Shortly thereafter the Library provided access to its new online catalog and two years later joined the OhioLINK Consortium thereby expanding the options of our students faculty and staff far beyond the walls of the new building Since then change has been a nearly continuous process with modifications and improvements to the collections services and spaces of the Library becoming a yearly monthly and weekly affair Among the more prominent changes since 1995 include The movement of the music collections out of the Chamberlain Room and its replacement by the Childrens Literature and Curriculum Materials Collections Redesignation of the Media Center as the Center for Educational Technology and its reorganization of the CET under the auspices of the Computer Center Wholesale movement of collections to make room for a new reading area and music recording collections

At this point in the Librarys history it seems safe to say that the previous paragraph will undergo regular modification as we undergo self assessment to offer the best collections services and facilities possible

Hurricane Anita was the only major hurricane of the inactive 1977 Atlantic hurricane season It struck Mexico as a category 5 Though it struck as a category 5 no one knows the damage Anita killed 11 people in Mexico

A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 16 After it moved westward for about a week it started growing some clouds It changed the way it was moving to the northwest on August 27 while it was over Cuba but all clouds were over the Bahamas and Florida The tropical wave soon crossed Florida and entered the Gulf of Mexico While it entered the Gulf of Mexico an anticyclone made conditions good for a tropical cyclone to form The tropical wave also moved slow when it entered the Gulf of Mexico making it easier for it to develop By August 29 the tropical wave was good enough to be upgraded to Tropical Depression One 

Tropical Depression One went back on a westward path than a ridge forced it Conditions remained good and the tropical depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Anita later on August 29 Water temperatures were warm this allow Tropical Storm Anita to become Hurricane Anita during August 30 Hurricane Anita looked like it would strike Texas at first but other weather systems did not allow it to do so Anita began to quickly strengthen it had become a category 3 hurricane on September 1 By the next day Hurricane Anita had reached its highest winds as a category 5 hurricane while not far from the coast of Mexico 

Hurricane Anita stayed as a category 5 hurricane as it made landfall in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas on September 2 Anita weakened fast over land weakening to a tropical storm over central Mexico later that day It also weakened to a tropical depression before it reached the Pacific coast of Mexico

The name Anita was retired It was not replaced with anything specific because the tropical cyclone names change in 1979

Vasa was a big Swedish warship The ship was built from 1626 to 1628 The same year Vasa was ready outside Stockholm but sank by accident on her maiden voyage Vasa sank because she was too heavy on top Those who built her knew that she had problems but they didnt dare say that to the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus He was not in Sweden when Vasa was built and he wanted her to go fight in the Thirty Years War as soon as possible There was a hearing about why Vasa sank but no one was found guilty or judged for her sinking

Swedish divers in diving bells brought up some of Vasas cannons from the sunken ship in the 1660s Anders Franzn found Vasa in 1956 after he had read about the ship in sources and looked for her in the water around Stockholm The ship was brought up in 1961 and was then treated with special chemicals so that it would last for a long time The preservation treatment took almost 20 years to complete Vasa is now in the Vasa Museum in Stockholm Sweden It is a very popular place for tourists to visit It gets more than one million visitors every year

When Vasa was brought up there were thousands of things inside her There were bones of people clothes weapons tools coins food and even some of the sails The things and Vasa have been very good for historians because they helps them understand how it was in Sweden in the 1600s Vasa was a very expensive ship and was one of the largest in the world She had hundreds of sculptures and they were painted in many colors She was a symbol of how powerful Sweden wanted to look and how good the Swedish king was

The pollen tube is the tube which sperm from the pollen reaches the ovary and fertilises the plant to form seeds

The pollen tube of most seed plants acts as a passageway It transports sperm cells from the pollen grain from the stigma to the ovules at the base of the pistil In some gymnosperms sperms move directly through ovule tissue In other gymnosperms the pollen tube is involved only in nutrient uptake from ovule tissue by the pollen grain and does not convey sperm cells to the egg Like ferns other basal land plants and many algae these gymnosperms have flagellate sperm which swim through a watery fluid to fertilize the egg cells

In angiosperms the pollen tube germinates from the pollen grain and grows the entire length through the stigma style ovary and ovules to reach the eggs In maize this single cell can grow longer than 12 inches to traverse the length of the pistil The sperm cells by themselves are not motile and are carried within the tube As the tip of the tube reaches an egg it bursts and releases two sperm cells leading to a double fertilization One sperm unites with the egg cell to produce the embryo of a new plant while a second sperm unites with the central cell to produce the endosperm of the seed The endosperm is rich in starch proteins and oils and is a major source of human food

The Kuchisake Onna or split mouthed woman is a popular figure in Japanese folklore She even shows up in many modern day urban legends She often appears wearing a surgical mask to cover her mouth which has been ripped open from ear to ear She will ask unknowing passers by whether or not they think she is beautiful Often they will say yes and she will remove the mask showing them her torn face and ask again If the person says no then she will rip their face so it resembles hers

There are different rumors about how to avoid her killing you One is to say she is average and another is to ask her if you are beautiful in hopes of confusing her so one could escape while she has to think about what to do next

The stories of Kuchisake Onna came from the Heian period Japan where there lived a very beautiful but very vain woman Her husband thought she was being unfaithful to her and cut her face out of jealousy

A process is a series of stages in time where the last stage is the product result or goal 

Processes may be planned or unplanned

A process planned by humans has a purpose It is a course of action or a procedure to achieve a result or an end product The sequence from start to finish is the plan A plan may be written or programmed or just held in the mind Examples building a house fighting a battle sowing crops organising a wedding

A natural process has no conscious purpose and may or may not have a definite end product Though it has no purpose or plan it may follow a series of well defined natural changes It can be investigated and described Examples the evolution of the solar system biological evolution the growth of melting of ice at the Arctic the process of development from egg to adult

Processes often repeat whenever certain conditions hold Example car low on petrolgas visit garage and refill Most computer programs are of this type Processes may be circular planets revolve around sun eggs produce chickens and chickens produce eggs

Processes especially those which are cyclical may be subject to feedback A simple case is a central heating system Even an unplanned natural process may be controlled by feedback evolution is a good example in which the feedback is effected by relative fecundity

Swan Lake is a ballet op 20 by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky It was composed in 18751876 The story by Vladimir Begichev and Vasiliy Geltser was first split into four acts It was made from Russian folk tales as well as an ancient German legend It tells the story of Odette a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerers curse The broken wikt linkchoreographerchoreographer of the first performance was Julius Reisinger The ballet was first shown on February 20 1877 at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow and it was calledThe Lake of the Swans

Many critics have argued about what the Swan Lake story was based on Fyodor Lopuokhov called Swan Lake a national ballet because the swans come from Russian sources while many of the movements of the corps de ballet came from Slavonic ring dances According to Lopukhov both the plot of Swan Lake the image of the Swan and the very idea of a faithful love are essentially Russian The libretto is based on a story by the German author Johann Karl August Musus Der geraubte Schleier but this story only has a short outline of the plot of Swan Lake The Russian folktale The White Duck also has links to the story of the ballet People who knew Tchaikovsky said that he was very interested in the life story of Bavarian King Ludwig II who Prince Siegfried was based on

According to Tchaikovskys nephew Yuri Lvovich Davydov and his niece Anna Meck Davydov he had already written a little ballet called The Lake of the Swans at their home in 1871 This ballet included the famous leitmotif known as the Swans Theme Vladimir Petrovich Begichev bought the score of Swan Lake from Tchaikovsky in 1875 for a rather modest fee of 800 rubles and soon Begichev began to choose artists to dance in the ballet Julius Reisinger designed the dances Nobody knows whether Tchaikovsky and Reisinger worked closely together It seems that at first Tchaikovsky worked without knowing exactly what Reisinger wanted Tchaikovsky probably had some instructions about composing Swan Lake because he had to know what sort of dances would be needed But while the instructions that Tchaikovsky received for the scores of The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker have survived the ones for Swan Lake didnt When Reisinger began to plan the dances after the score was completed he told Tchaikovsky to change some of the music By doing this Reisinger made it clear that he wanted a very large part in the making of this piece Although the two artists needed to work together they both liked to work alone as much as possible

Tchaikovsky was very excited about creating Swan Lake We know this because of the quick speed with which he composed It was started the spring of 1875 and created within one full year First he wrote scores of the first three numbers of the ballet then orchestrated it in the fall and winter and was still trying to do the instrumentation in the spring By April 1876 the work was fully completed Tchaikovsky mentioned a draft but it has never been found He also wrote many letters to friends saying how he had always wanted to work with this type of music how excited he was about doing it

Swan Lake is was written for a normal orchestra of the time

Adriaen Coorte was a Dutch painter He mainly painted still life He signed works between 1683 and 1707 Most of his paintings are small His style is typical of Dutch 17th century still life painting Other Dutch painters who lived at the same time had a different style of painting Coorte was one of the last practitioners of this intimate category

Very little is known about his life Hw was probably born in Middelburg and also died there He became a pupil of Melchior dHondecoeter around 1680 in Amsterdam From 1683 he seems to have returned to Middelburg where he set up a workshop and signed his small carefully balanced minimalist still lifes He often painted on paper that was glued to a wooden panel About 80 signed works by him have been catalogued and nearly all of them follow the same pattern small arrangements of fruits vegetables or shells on a stone slab lit from above with the dark background typical of still lifes earlier in the century Instead of the Chinese or silver vessels favoured by his contemporaries his tableware is very basic pottery Objects and light are studied intensely and are painted with a wondrous tenderness Neither his birth nor death date is certain and archival evidence only exists in Middelburg for his membership in the Guild of St Luke there from 1695 onwards when he was fined for selling a painting without being a member of the guild His works appear frequently in contemporary Middelburg taxation inventories

Coorte was probably not well known to the people who lived at the same time outside the city of Middelburg Much like Vermeer he was almost entirely forgotten In the 1950s the Dutch art historian Laurens J Bol revived his reputation beginning with an article in 1952 and finally publishing the first monograph and catalogue raissone on Coorte in 1977 Bol arranged an exhibition of 35 examples of Coortes work in 1958 at the Dordrechts Museum This became a sensation in the Netherlands the poets Hans Faverey and Ed Leeflang were both inspired by the paintings In 2003 there was an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art Washington In 2008 a new travelling exhibition was set up Ode to Coorte that was nearly as successful making Coorte the most celebrated rediscovered Dutch Baroque painter of recent decades

A still life is a work of art most often a painting In a still life objects like flowers fruit or glasses are arranged in a certain way and then painted Still life painting has been popular since the 17th century when Dutch painters like Adriaen Coorte raised it to a fine art However the idea is old examples can be found in antiquity With a still life the artist can focus more on composition and arrangement than with other forms of painting such as landscape painting or portraiture

Homo rhodesiensis is a possible hominin species described from the fossil Rhodesian Man Other morphologically comparable remains have been found from the same or earlier time period in southern Africa East Africa and North Africa These remains were dated to be between 125000 and 600000 years old

Homo georgicus is a species of Homo that was proposed in 2002 It is based on fossil skulls and jaws found in Dmanisi Georgia in 1999 and 2001 which seem intermediate between Homo habilis and H erectus 

A partial skeleton was discovered in 2001 The fossils are about 18 million years old The remains were first discovered in 1991 by Georgian scientist David Lordkipanidze accompanied by an international team which unearthed the remains Implements and animal bones were found alongside the ancient human remains

At first scientists thought they had found mandibles and skulls belonging to Homo ergaster but size differences led them to name a new species

At around 600 cm brain volume the skull D2700 is dated to 177 million years old and in good condition offering insights in comparison to the modern human cranial morphology The cranium was the smallest and most primitive Hominin skull ever discovered outside of Africa

In Africa the Australopithecines and early Homo represent two distinctive evolutionary paths sharing a common ancestor In Georgia the specimens with a brain half the size of anatomically modern humans were the smallest found until the discovery of Homo floresiensis on the island of Flores in 2003

There is a strong sexual dimorphism present with males being significantly larger than females This is a primitive trait less obvious in more modern humans in Europe

The small size of this species contrasts with the much larger size of Homo erectus H georgicus was the first species of Homo to settle in Europe some 800000 years before H erectus

Later four fossil skeletons were found showing a species primitive in its skull and upper body but with relatively advanced spines and lower limbs providing greater mobility They are now thought to represent a stage soon after the transition between Australopithecus and Homo erectus and have been dated at 18 million years before the present according to the leader of the project David Lordkipanidze The assemblage includes one of the largest Pleistocene Homo mandibles one of the smallest Lower Pleistocene mandibles a nearly complete subadult and a completely edentulous specimen

The Chicxulub crater is a very big crater Some scientists believe that the Chicxulub crater was made by the meteor that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs and many other animals It is near the Yucatn Peninsula in Mexico 

The Chicxulub crater is more than 180 km in diameter making it the third largest confirmed impact crater The bolide which formed the crater was at least 10 km in diameter

Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz a gravity anomaly and tektites in surrounding areas The age of the rocks and isotope analysis show that this impact structure dates from the end of the Cretaceous period roughly 65 million years ago The impact associated with the crater is implicated in causing the extinction of the dinosaurs Recent evidence suggests that the impactor may have been a piece of a much larger asteroid that broke up in a collision in distant space more than 160 million years ago

In March 2010 following analysis of the available evidence covering 20 years worth of data in the fields of palaeontology geochemistry climate modelling geophysics and sedimentology 41 international experts from 33 institutions reviewed available evidence and concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions during K T boundary including those of dinosaurs

Ruslan Ponomariov born 11 October 1983 is a Ukrainian chess player and former FIDE world champion

In 2002 he beat his fellow countryman Vassily Ivanchuk in the final of the FIDE World Championship 2002 by a score of 42 This made him FIDE world champion at the age of 18 the first teenager and youngest person to win this form of the title However he is not the youngest undisputed world champion because the traditional World Chess Championship was still held by Vladimir Kramnik 

In the same year he finished second in the very strong Linares tournament behind Garry Kasparov His result in the strong 2003 Corus tournament at Wijk aan Zee was not as good despite having the third highest rating he finished only joint eleventh out of fourteen players with 613 and at Linares the same year he finished only fifth out of seven with 512

There were plans for him to play a fourteen game match against Kasparov in Yalta in September 2003 the winner of which would go on to play the winner of a match between Kramnik and Pter Lk as part of the so called Prague Agreement to reunify the World Chess Championship However this was called off after Ponomariov refused to sign his contract without reservation 

Ponomariov remained FIDE champion until Rustam Kasimdzhanov won the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004

The Encyclopaedia Hebraica is an encyclopedia in Hebrew It was started in 1948

The encyclopedia was published by Bracha Peli who had already created another encyclopedia The man in charge was her son who was named Alexander

A committee decided the aims of the encyclopedia in 1944 Printing of the first part began in 1948 This was the year that Israel became a country The president of the encyclopedia project was also the President of Israel Professor Chaim Weizmann The first photograph in the encyclopaedia was of Israels Declaration of Independence

The first volume covered the entries for the letter Aleph to Australia

The introduction said  we will finish publishing all 16 volumes within five or six years 

The writing took more than thirty years The encyclopedia had thirty two volumes when it was finished An index was not printed until 1985 In 1995 there were large updates of entries dealing with the State of Israel

The supervisor was always Alexander Plai Its editors were Joseph Klausner Benzion Netanyahu Yeshayahu Leibowitz Nathan Rotenstreich Yehoshua Gutman and Joshua Prawer More than 2500 people wrote the encyclopedia

Some people felt it was very important to be included in the encyclopedia They would ask the editors to make sure they had an article about them Other articles caused arguments eg Adolf Hitler

The Schocken Publishing House has been working on a new edition of the encyclopedia

The Encyclopaedia Hebraica said it was about General Jewish and Israeli ideas The encyclopaedia covers all the general topics but the articles were larger on Judaism Jews and Israel The encyclopaedia includes the Jewishness of the person even when it is not important

Articles on countries and cities include their history and then a Jewish history For places which were under Nazi rule an account is given of the Jewish people during the Holocaust 

Writers of the encyclopaedia did not hide their Jewish views The Kingdom of Jordan was not in the first edition Instead Jordan was included in the article Land of Israel 

The letter Aleph contains the largest number of articles The longest article is Land of Israel which takes all of volume 6 Next in size is United States of America The large size of the aleph articles reflects the enthusiasm of the early editors It became clear that the encyclopaedia would never come to an end The plan was changed The final size of the encyclopaedia was smaller than planned

The woman who owned it was Bracha Peli She died in 1986 In 1997 the encyclopedia was sold to another company

Pollination in this genus is accomplished in an unusual manner as the pollen is grouped into pollen sacs The feet or mouthparts of flower visiting insects such as bees wasps and butterflies slip into one of the five slits in each flower formed by adjacent anthers The bases of the pollinia then mechanically attach to the insect pulling a pair of pollen sacs free when the pollinator flies off Pollination is effected by the reverse procedure in which one of the pollinia becomes trapped within the anther slit

Milkweeds have three defenses to limit damage by caterpillars and other insects hairs on the leaves toxins and latex fluids Some more recent milkweed species grow faster than older species They have the potential to grow faster than caterpillars can eat them Caterpillars which eat milkweeds and their adult butterflies may be protected by the foul taste of the milkweed chemicals Such butterflies and caterpillars usually show warning colours

Mesonychids were the first mammalian carnivores after the extinction of the dinosaurs 

These wolves on hooves are an extinct order of carnivorous mammals closely related to artiodactyls 

Mesonychids first appeared in the early Palaeocene with the genus Dissacus They went in decline at the end of the Eocene and became extinct in the early Oligocene

At the start of the Palaeocene there were no large carnivores on land The surviving mammals and birds evolved into many of the ecological niches previously occupied by dinosaurs and pterosaurs This process is called adaptive radiation The mesonychids were the first group to become larger carnivores

They soon had competition By the later Palaeocene there were several other groups of land carnivores The giant flightless bird Gastornis appeared in the Upper Palaeocene and the Creodonts had also evolved The Creodonts became an important order and would certainly have been serious competitors of the mesonychids

Most important of all the modern order Carnivora became significant in the Eocene They were a sister group to the mesonychids and started as small forms in the Palaeocene Once they increased in size they would have been direct competitors of the mesonychids

The broken up Gondwana gave rise to southern continents which the early placental mammals could not get to Africa and India eventually bumped into Eurasia and South America sometimes had land connection to North America All this lead to faunal interchange Australasia developed its own carnivores which became extinct only in modern times

 Size and habits  Large size was common The famous Andrewsarchus had a skull a metre long which is much larger than that of the modern Kodiak bear

Mesonychid teeth consisted of molars which were laterally compressed and often blunt and were probably used for shearing meat or crushing bones Many species are suspected of being fish eaters and the largest species may have been scavengers

Andrewsarchus mongoliensis was a mammalian Mesonychid predator

This large heavily built wolf like mammal lived during the Eocene about 45 to 36 million years ago It walked on four short legs and had a long body a long tail and feet with hoofed toes It had a long snout with large sharp teeth and flat cheek teeth that may have been used to crush bones 

Because Andrewsarchus is only known from a skull and a few other bones whether it was an active predator or merely a large scavenger is open to debate as is its exact time range

Homosocial is a term used in sociology which describes a same sex relationship which is not necessarily sexual in nature

For example a close relationship between two men such as George and Lennie in Of Mice and Men would be a homosocial relationship It can apply to single sex schools prisons monasteries but also to simple friendships

The relationship can be a sexual one but a homosocial relationship can occur between homosexuals heterosexuals or both

It is often used to describe the all male world of medieval knights or sailors While it can apply to both men or women it is most commonly used to refer to men

Rose surveyed males and females between the ages of 20 and 28 Rose asked men and women about how they felt about same and cross sex friendships Both men and women preferred same sex friendships Both men and women said that cross sex relationships were less helpful and less loyal than same sex friendships Friendship formation was found to be different between cross sex and same sex relationships as well 

Depending on the culture and family and social stuctures same sex preferences have been found to develop between 3 and 9 years old LaFreniere Strayer and Gauthier conducted a three year long study observing fifteen peer groups between the ages of 1 to 6 years old with 98 boys and 93 girls As they looked into sex segregation in childhood the researchers found that segregation rose with age and that most Western children exihibit these preferences around 3 4 years old However in a study by Harkenss and Super Kenyan children do not have sex preference in playmates until the ages of 6 to 9 years old Researchers observed 152 Kenyan children in rural settings and found that this change didnt occur until parental expectations and customary duties increased Just when and how such gender segration appears is the joint product of the individual and the culturally constructed niche

The social bias towards members of ones own sex can develop early in children Specifically studies have found that by the early age of 3 or 4 children prefer members of their own sex to members of the opposite sex That is young girls favor other females over males The findings are identical for young boys Also Carol Martin found that boys 45 years of age expressed significantly more dislike for a girl depicted as a tomboy than a boy depicted as a sissy whereas boys 85 years of age express more dislike for a boy depicted as a sissy This age difference suggests that children as young as 4 prefer their own sex regardless of gender incongruent behavior Around the age of 8 however boys begin to show malesdevaluing feminine behavior It has also been shown that children ages 10 12 prefer same sex socializing That is girls favored girls who socialized with other girls and boys liked boys who socialized with other boys

Homosociality by definition implies neither heterosexuality nor homosexuality For example a heterosexual male who prefers to socialize with men may be considered a homosocial heterosexual The term is often used by feminists to emphasize aspects of solidarity between males Feminists also identify a close link between female homosociality feminism and lesbian desire with Audre Lorde stating the true feminist deals out of a lesbian consciousness whether or not she ever sleeps with women

The first fossil a lone skull was thought to be a mesonychid but Gingerich and Russell recognized it as an early cetacean from characteristic features of the inner ear found only in cetaceans the large auditory bulla is formed from the ectotympanic bone only This suggests that it is a transitional species between extinct land mammals and modern cetaceans

Metamorphism in geology is the process of change in the structure texture or composition of rocks

The scientific study of rocks is called petrology

Rocks are commonly divided according to their origin into three major classesIgneous sedimentary and metamorphic They are caused by the effects of heat deforming pressure shearing stress hotchemically active fluids or a combination of these All of these changes occur while the rock remains essentially in the solid state In theory rocks are formed when the things surrounding them are in equilibrium with ambient physical conditions If the conditions are changed by movements in the earths crust or by igneous activity metamorphism occurs to reestablish equilibrium and changes the physical character of the rock mass

Parthenogenesis is a term in biology It means virgin birth It is an asexual form of reproduction found in females where growth and development of embryos occurs without fertilization by a male It occurs in both plants and animals and is much less common than sexual reproduction

Some plants and animals can reproduce either sexually or asexually A good example are the aphids which multiply parthenogenetically during the height of summer but turns to sexual reproduction as the weather gets worse

At different times of the year they can be viviparous or oviparous During spring and summer aphids usually produce live young parthenogenetically These female aphids may or may not have wings Males only appear in any number at the close of the season Females then give birth sexually during autumn laying eggs Therefore aphids are said to undergo cyclical parthenogenesis

The Santa Monica Mountains are a group of mountains in southern California in the United States

The range extends about 40 mi eastwest from the Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles to Point Mugu in Ventura County The mountains form a line between the San Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles Basin separating the Valley on the north and west central Los Angeles on the south The Santa Monica Mountains are parallel to Santa Susana Mountains on the north side the San Fernando Valley Beginning at the eastern end of the San Fernando Valley the mountains are bordered to the north by the Los Angeles River The river flows south after Elysian Park defining the easternmost edge of the mountains Mt Washington on the other side of the river has almost the same native plants and weather

Scientists who study rocks say that the northern Channel Islands are a westward extension of the Santa Monicas into the Pacific Ocean The range was created by the Raymond Fault which made the rocks push up and sink down over time This has made old volcano rock come to the surface Malibu Creek cuts the mountain range in two

The Santa Monica Mountains have dry warm to humid summers and wet mild to cool winters In the summer the weather is quite dry which makes the range prone to wildfires Snow is unusual in the Santa Monica Mountains since they are not as high as the nearby San Gabriel Mountains 

On January 17 2007 an unusually cold storm brought snow in the Santa Monica Mountains Malibu picked up three inches of snow the first measurable snow in five decades Snow was reported on Boney Peak in the winter of 2005 and in March 2006 snow also fell on the summit of the mountain

The mountains have more than 1000 places where people lived a long time ago including many places where Tongva and Chumash people lived 

Cahuenga Pass present day site of US Route 101 is the easiest pass through the range connecting the Los Angeles Basin to the San Fernando Valley In the 1800s two battles were fought there and the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed nearby In the heyday of Hollywood movie studios clustered on both sides of it Sepulveda Pass is the main northsouth pass to the west connecting the Westside to Sherman Oaks via the San Diego Freeway Farther west are Topanga Canyon Boulevard Malibu Canyon Road and Kanan Dume Road Mulholland Drive runs much of the length of the Santa Monica Mountains from Cahuenga Pass to Woodland Hills while the Mulholland Highway runs from Woodland Hills to Sequit Point The eastern end of the range located in the City of Los Angeles is more intensively developed than the western end of the range The city of Malibu runs between the coast and the leading mountain ridge from Topanga Canyon in the east to Leo Carrillo State Park in the west The term Malibu Ozarks is sometimes used derogatorily for the unincorporated part of Malibu beyond the leading mountain ridge and lacking an ocean view the term is often used synonymously with 818 Malibu

Much of the mountains are located within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Preservation of lands within the region are managed in part by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Over twenty individual state and municipal parks are in the Santa Monica Mountains including Topanga State Park Leo Carrillo State Park Malibu Creek State Park Point Mugu State Park Will Rogers State Historic Park Point Dume State Beach Griffith Park Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park Charmlee Wilderness Park Runyon Canyon Park and the Paramount Ranch

Places along the north slope of the mountains include

Places along the south slope of the mountains include

The southwestern headwaters of the Los Angeles River are in the Santa Monica Mountains The Los Angeles River also forms the northern boundary of the mountains from the easternmost part of the San Fernando Valley to Elysian Park where the river turns south thereby defining the easternmost part of the mountain range

Griffith Park and finally Elysian Park are the eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains Griffith Park is separated from the rest of the Santa Monica Mountains to the west by the Cahuenga Pass over which the 101 Freeway passes from the San Fernando Valley into Hollywood Elysian Park is the easternmost part of the mountains and is bordered by the Los Angeles River to the east

The Santa Monica Mountains are in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion and are covered by hundreds of local plant species some of which are very rare and others of which have become popular ornamentals The range is host to an immense variety of wildlife from mountain lions to the endangered steelhead The mountain lion population within the Santa Monica Mountains is severely depleted with only seven known living adult individuals The primary cause of the decline is due to a combination of traffic related mortality anti coagulants ingested from human poisoned prey and attacks by other more dominant mountain lions Snakes are common but only occasionally seen the Southern Pacific Rattlesnake Mountain Kingsnake California Kingsnake Gopher snake and Garter snake

Cha cha cha is the name of a Latin American music and dance of Cuban origin It is dance music introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jorrn in 1953 The rhythm was developed from a previous dance the danzn by a split fourth beat The name is derived from the shuffling of the dancers feet

Many consider the Orquesta Aragn and the orchestra of Jos Fajardo to have been particularly influential in the development of the cha cha cha Outside Cuba the big bands of Tito Puente and Prez Prado introduced the Cha cha cha to a much wider audience

Musically the Cha cha cha was perhaps not a great innovation However it became hugely popular because people found it easy to dance to Monsieur Pierre and his colleagues went to Cuba in the early 1950s to study it They came back to London and codified the dance It became a standard dance in Latin American ballroom dancing It is one of the five Latin dances in international competitions governed by the World Dance Council Today it is still popular as a dance and is still danced in Cuba

Parlour comes from the French word parloir from parler which means to speak The parlour is a room in a house where people could meet In Turkey it is called a kiosk The Bible talks about the summer parlour a small room built on the roof of the house with open windows to catch the breeze It has a door to the outside by which visitors can enter

In parts of Great Britain and the United States parlour is a common name for certain types of restaurants such as ice cream parlour and pizza parlour There are also Beer parlors wine parlors or in at least one case a spaghetti parlor The word parlour has even been used to describe a coffee shop as the coffee parlor It can also mean a special service business such as a tattoo parlour

The inner parlours in 1 Chronicles 2811 in the Bible were the small rooms or chambers which Solomon built all round two sides and one end of the Temple Some people think the inner parlours may have been the porch and the holy place

In medieval Christian usage the parlour was one of two rooms in a monastery The outer parlour was the room where the monks or nuns could meet a visitor and do business with people from outside the monastery It was generally in the west range of the buildings of the cloister close to the main entrance The inner parlour was found off the cloister next to the chapter house in the east range of the monastery Most religious orders wanted silence in the cloister which was the place where the monks studied The inner parlour was a place where the monks could talk without disturbing the others in the cloister

In modern use the parlour is a formal sitting room in a large house or mansion In the late 19th century it was often a formal room used only on Sundays or special occasions and closed during the week The family kept their best furniture works of art and other things on display in the parlour The body of someone who died would be put on show in the parlour while funeral was being organized During the 20th century architects and decorators have changed the use of the room In most homes the parlour has been replaced by the living room

Cuban music comes from the Caribbean island of Cuba Cuba has developed a wide range of musical styles which draw on its cultural origins in Europe and Africa Cubas music has been hugely popular and influential throughout the world It has been perhaps the most popular form of world music since the introduction of recording technology

The music of Cuba including the instruments and the dances is mostly of European and African origin Most forms of the present day are fusions and mixtures of these two great sources The original inhabitants of Cuba died out and little remains of their traditions

Large numbers of African slaves and European immigrants came to Cuba and brought their own forms of music to the island European dances and folk musics included the zapateo the fandango the paso doble the minuet the gavotte the contradanza and the waltz appeared among the urban whites 

The African slaves and their descendants made many percussion instruments and preserved rhythms they had known in their homeland The most important instruments were the drums Also important are the claves two short hardwood batons and the cajn a wooden box originally made from crates Claves are still used often and cajons were used widely during periods when the drum was banned

The great instrumental contribution of the Spanish was their guitar but even more important was the tradition of European musical notation and techniques of musical composition 

Fernando Ortz described Cubas musical innovations as arising from the interplay between African slaves settled on large sugar plantations and Spanish or Canary Islanders who grew tobacco on small farms 

The African beliefs and practices certainly influenced Cubas music Polyrhythmic percussion is an inherent part of African life music as melody is part of European music Also in African tradition percussion is always joined to song and dance and to a particular social setting It is not simply entertainment added to life it is life The result of the meeting of European and African cultures is that most Cuban popular music is creolized This creolization of Cuban life has been happening for a long time and by the 20th century elements of African belief music and dance were well integrated into popular and folk forms 

Cuban music has been immensely influential in other countries contributing not only to the development of jazz and salsa but also to Argentinian tango Ghanaian highlife West African afrobeat and Spanish Nuevo flamenco

The Cathedrals of the old capital Santiago de Cuba and Havana both employed fine musicians and choir masters They composed taught and directed This helped the development of all kinds of music In the 19th century Manuel Saumell was the father of Cuban criole musical development He helped transform the European contradanza by adding African rhythmical elements and had a hand in the habanera and the danzon two typically Cuban dance forms

During the middle years of the 19th century a young American musician came to Havana Louis Moreau Gottschalk whose father was a Jewish businessman from London and his mother a white creole of French Catholic background Gottschalk was brought up mostly by his black grandmother and nurse Sally both from Dominique He was a piano prodigy who had listened to the music and seen the dancing in Congo Square New Orleans from childhood His period in Cuba lasted from 1853 to 1862 with visits to Puerto Rico and Martinique squeezed in He composed many famous pieces which were genuinely Cuban as they drew on traditions of both whites and blacks 

In February 1860 Gottschalk produced a huge work La nuit des tropiques in Havana The work used about 250 musicians and a choir of 200 singers plus a drum group from Santiago de Cuba He produced another huge concert the following year with new material These shows probably dwarfed anything seen in the island before or since and no doubt were unforgettable for those who attended 

It was Ignacio Cervantes who was probably most influenced by Gottschalk Trained in Paris he did much to assert a sense of Cuban musical nationalism in his compositions Aaron Copland once referred to him as a Cuban Chopin because of his Chopinesque piano compositions Cervantes reputation today rests almost solely upon his famous forty one Danzas Cubanas of which Carpentier said occupy the place that the Norwegian Dances of Grieg or the Slavic Dances of Dvok occupy in the musics of their respective countries 

From the 18th century to modern times popular theatrical formats used and gave rise to music and dance In addition to staging some European operas and operettas Cuban composers gradually developed ideas which better suited their creole audience Recorded music was the way for Cuban music to reach the world The most recorded artist in Cuba up to 1925 was a singer at the Alhambra Adolfo Colombo Records show he recorded about 350 numbers between 1906 and 1917 

The first theatre in Havana opened in 1776 The first Cuban composed opera appeared in 1807 Musical theater was hugely important in the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century Radio which began in Cuba in 1922 helped the growth of popular music because it provided publicity and a new source of income for the artists

Zarzuela is a small scale light operetta format Starting off with imported Spanish content it developed into a running commentary on Cubas social and political events and problems A string of front rank composers such as Ernesto Lecuona produced a series of hits for the theatres in Havana Great stars like the vedette Rita Montaner who could sing play the piano dance and act were the Cuban equivalents of Mistinguett and Josephine Baker in Paris

Cuban Bufo theatre is a form of comedy ribald and satirical It uses stock types that might be found anywhere in the country Bufo had its origin around 18001815 Francisco Covarrubias the caricaturist was its creator Gradually the comic types threw off their European models and became more and more creolized and Cuban Alongside the music followed Slang from slave barracks and poor barrios found its way into lyrics

The guaracha is a genre of rapid tempo and with lyrics It originated in Bufo comic theatre and during the early 20th century was often played in the brothels of Havana The lyrics were full of slang and dwelt on events and people in the news 

The contradanza is an historically important dance It arrived in Cuba in the late 18th century from Europe The contradanza is a communal sequence dance with the dance figures in a set pattern The tempo and style of the music was bright and fairly fast The earliest Cuban composition of a contradanza is San Pascual bailon published in 1803 The Cubans developed a number of creolized version which is an early example of the influence of African tradition in the Caribbean Most of the musicians were black or mulatto even early in the 19th century there were many freed slaves and mixed race persons living in Cuban towns

The contradanza supplanted the minuet as the most popular dance until from 1842 on it gave way to the habanera a quite different style 

This the child of the contradanza was also danced in lines or squares It was also a brisk form of music and dance which could be in double or triple time This type of dance was eventually replaced by the danzn which was like the habanera much slower and more sedate 

The habanera developed out of the contradanza in the early 19th century Its great novelty was that it was sung as well as played and danced Its development was at least partly due to the influence of French speaking immigrants The Haitian revolution of 1791 led to many colonial French and their slaves fleeing to Oriente The cinquillo is one important rhythmical pattern which made its first appearance at this time

The dance style of the habanera is slower and more stately than the danza by the 1840s there were habaneras written sung and danced in Mexico Venezuela Puerto Rico and Spain Since about 1900 the habanera has been a relic dance but the music has a period charm and there are some famous compositions such as Tu versions of which have been recorded many times

The waltz arrived in Cuba by 1814 It was the first dance in which couples were not linked by a communal sequence pattern It was and still is danced in 34 time with the accent on the first beat It was originally thought scandalous because couples faced each other held each other in the closed hold and so to speak ignored the surrounding community The waltz entered all countries in the Americas The walz has another characteristic it is a travelling dance with couples moving round the arena In latin dances progressive movement of dancers is unusual but does occur in some

A typical dance of the Cuban campesino or guajiro A dance of pairs involving tapping of the feet mostly by the man Illustrations exist from previous centuries but the dance is now defunct

In the 19th century here grew up in Santiago de Cuba a group of itinerant musicians troubadors who moved around earning their living by singing and playing the guitar They were of great importance as composers and their songs have been used in all types of Cuban music

Pepe Snchez was the father of the trova and the creator of the Cuban bolero He had no formal training in music With remarkable natural talent he composed numbers in his head and never wrote them down As a result most of these numbers are now lost for ever though some two dozen or so survive because friends and disciples transcribed them He also created advertisement jingles before radio was born He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed him 

The first and one of the longest lived was Sindo Garay He was an outstanding composer of songs and his best have been sung and recorded many times Garay was also musically illiterate in fact he only taught himself the alphabet at 16 but in his case not only were scores recorded by others but there are recordings He broadcast on radio made recordings and survived into modern times He used to say Not many men have shaken hands with both Jos Mart and Fidel Castro 

Chicho Ibez was even longer lived than Garay Ibez was the first trovador to specialize in the Cuban son he also sung guaguancos and pieces from the abaku

Many of the early trovadores such as Manuel Corona composed and sung guarachas as a balance for the slower boleros 

This is a song and dance form quite different from its Spanish namesake It originated in the last quarter of the 19th century with the founder of the traditional trova Pepe Snchez He wrote the first bolero Tristezas which is still sung today The bolero has always been a staple part of the trova muusicians repertoire The bolero proved to be exceptionally adaptable and led to many variants Typical was the introduction of syncopation leading to the bolero son bolero mambo and bolero cha The bolero son became for several decades the most popular rhythm for dancing in Cuba and it was this rhythm that the international dance community picked up and taught as the wrongly named rumba

The European influence on Cubas later musical development is represented by danzn an elegant musical form that was once the most popular music in Cuba It is a descendent of the creollized Cuban contradanza The danzn marks the change which took place from the communal sequence dance style of the late eighteenth century to the couple dances of later times The stimulus for this was the success of the once scandalous walz where couples danced facing each other and independently from other couples not as part of a pre set structure The danzn was the first Cuban dance to adopt such methods though there is a difference between the two dances The walz is a progressive ballroom dance where couples move round the floor in an anti clockwise direction the danzn is a pocket handkerchief dance where a couple stays within a small area of the floor

The danzn was exported to popular acclaim throughout Latin America especially Mexico It is now a relic both in music and in dance but its highly orchestrated descendents live on

The son said Cristbal Daz is the most important genre of Cuban music and the least studied It can fairly be said that son is to Cuba what the tango is to Argentina or the samba to Brazil In addition it is perhaps the most flexible of all forms of Latin American music Its great strength is its fusion between European and African musical traditions Its most characteristic instruments are the Cuban guitar known as the tres and the well known double headed bong these are present from the start to the present day Also typical are the claves the Spanish guitar the double bass and early on the cornet or trumpet and finally the piano

The son arose in Oriente the eastern part of the island merging the Spanish guitar and lyrical traditions with African percussion and rhythms We now know that its history as a distinct form is relatively recent There is no evidence that it goes back further than the end of the nineteenth century It moved from Oriente to Havana in about 1909 carried by members of the Permanente who were sent out of their areas of origin as a matter of policy The first recordings were in 1918

There are many types of son Odilio Urf recognised these variants 

and one can certainly add

In addition the son has again and again changed the older danzn to make it more syncopated and creole in style starting in 1910 through the danzn mambo and the cha cha cha to complex modern arrangements which are almost impossible to categorize

The son varies widely today with the defining characteristic a syncopated bass pulse that comes before the downbeat giving son its distinctive rhythm this is known as the anticipated bass 

The history of jazz in Cuba was obscured for many years however it has become clear that its history in Cuba is virtually as long as its history in the USA

Much more is now known about early Cuban jazz bands though a full assessment is plagued by the lack of recordings Migrations and visits to and from the USA and the mutual exchange of recordings and sheet music kept musicians in the two countries in touch In the first part of the 20th century there were close relations between musicians in Cuba and those in New Orleans The orchestra leader in the famous Tropicana Club Armando Romeu Jr was a leading figure in the post WWII development of Cuban jazz The phenomenon of cubop and jam sessions in Havana and New York created genuine fusions which still influence musicians today

World wide interest in Cuban music was rekindled by a remarkable CD album entitled the Buena Vista Social Club An American guitarist Ry Cooder a British music producer Nick Gold and a Cuban musician Juan Marcos Gonzles worked together on a new venture They put together a group mostly of older Cuban musicians with the idea of recreating the Cuban music of the golden era of the 1950s The first album released in 1997 became a huge hit selling over five million copies and winning a Grammy in 1998 In 2003 it was listed by Rolling Stone magazine as 260 in their list of The 500 Greatest Hits of All Time A dozen more CDs have followed the first one mostly issued by Nonesuch Records or World Circuit 

A documentary film Buena Vista Social Club directed by Wim Wenders was released in 1999 It grossed 23 million worldwide by 2007 A younger generation had discovered why Cuban music was so popular

Natural units are ways of measuring things that depend on some basic characteristics of nature that do not change Which of these basic quantities to choose can depend on the physics problems being investigated and sometimes choosing one thing as a natural unit means that the size of something else does not become used as a natural unit in that system 

The old system of English measurements such as the pound are based on convenient objects in the natural world The grain is the smallest of these objects and originally it meant the weight of a grain of wheat or barley Each individual grain might be slightly larger or smaller than the next but the more grains were added together to make a larger measure the more these little differences would even out Even so these measure were not entirely precise and did not relate to other measures such as the inch or the foot

In order to make calculations simpler and units more precise it turned out that the mass of an electron or the mass of a proton were more useful standards to use for weight All electrons are believed to have the same mass and all protons are believed to have their own standard mass But there is no simple mathematical relationship between the two masses

The speed of light c is a constant So c is a very natural choice to use as a standard for measurement 

One choice for a standard of length is the Bohr radius The simplest atom hydrogen only has one electron and its smallest possible orbit that with the lowest energy is at a distance from the nucleus called the Bohr radius

With a standard for measuring distances and a standard for velocity it would be possible to derive one standard unit of time In practice there are several ways of defining units of time One of the most widely known ways to measure time by natural cycles is by using atomic clocks

Latino Moderne is a language that was developed by David Th Stark in the 1980s and first published on the internet in 1996 It represents a revision of the grammar of the IALAs language Interlingua using the IALAs vocabulary with little modification Applying the same principles that were used in developing the international vocabulary for Interlingua to developing a grammar LM restores personal endings on its verbs and has gender and number agreement between its nouns and their adjectives and articles The language also has an more clearly developed system for showing case distinctions in its pronouns This in effect frees LM from a dependence on word order as is found in Interlingua The changes in LM actually are very simple and easy to learn providing a much more poetic and free use of it for international communication Most of the changes that LM makes to the IALA language are actually suggestions that were set forth by the original deverlopers of the IALA project Properly speaking LM should be viewed as a continuation to the IALA project not as something in competition with it 

It is hoped that the spread and use of Latino Moderne may assist in solving some of the communication problems that exist in the European Union and throughout the modern world In this respect it shares the same goals as Interlingua Esperanto etc The developer of the language hopes that LM will be received and used as a suggested model language to help promote better international communication and friendship among nations

NO community is presently established for the Latino Moderne project Its developer David Th Stark welcomes any activity in this area by other interested parties The language Latino Moderne belongs to all those who desire to use it

BookCrossing is defined as the practice of leaving a book in a public place to be picked up and read by others who then do likewise The term comes from bookcrossingcom a free online book club which began in order to further the practice with the goal to make the whole world a library

The crossing or exchanging of books may take many different forms including wild releasing books in public direct swaps with other members of the website or book rings in which books travel in a set order to people who want to read that book The community aspect of BookCrossingcom has grown in ways that were not expected at the start in the form of blog or forum discussions mailing lists and yearly conventions all over the world 

Ron Hornbaker came up the idea for what is now known as BookCrossing in March 2001 About four weeks later on April 17 he started the website which has grown all over the world By April 2003 the website had over 113000 members and in 2004 the Concise Oxford Dictionary included the word bookcrossing In the same year BookCrossing was featured as a part of a storyline in the Australian soap opera Neighbours As of 30 September 2009 Bookcrossingcom had over 814000 members with over 5800000 registered books

In July 2007 Singapore became the first official BookCrossing country in the world 2000 locations within the country were designated as hotspots similar to Official BookCrossing Zones In 2008 BookCrossing was introduced to Abu Dhabi as part of a joint venture with the Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and Heritage

In May 2005 BookCrossingcom won two Peoples Voice awards in the Webby Awards for best community website and best socialnetworking website BookCrossing was also featured in a BBC Radio project broadcast as 84 Book Crossing Road which involved releasing 84 copies of Helene Hanffs book 84 Charing Cross Road around the world The show was produced by Tim Heffer and Alan Hall of Falling Tree Productions and was nominated for a Sony Radio Academy Award in 2006

Anyone who wishes to release books whether leaving it in a public place or passing it on to a friend must register on the BookCrossingcom website although there is the option to remain hidden when catching the find of a book BookCrossingcom users can go hunting where a member will go to the website to view a list of books that have just been released then go to the place it was left to catch it Books may also be left at Official BookCrossing Zones which are located in certain coffee shops cafes restaurants and other public places The purpose of these places is to get members in the area to leave books to share with the public This also promotes BookCrossing and creates more members

Bukit Timah is a hill in Singapore which stands at an altitude of 16363 metres and is the highest point in the city state of Singapore Bukit Timah is near the centre of Singapore island

The surrounding area is called Bukit Timah Bukit Timah is 10 kilometres from Singapores business district

Bukit Timah which means tin bearing hill in Malay was on the 1828 map by Frankin and Philip Jackson as Bukit Timah The hill was on the map as the eastern source of the Kranji River 

In December 1843 a road was built up to the hill The hill was an excellent sanatorium as the air was cooler and fresher than the plain producing an agreeable exhilaration of spirits

For some it is synonymous with the Singapore Turf Club where members and paying visitors flock on race days This course is closed to the public unlike the former course where the general public enjoyed watching the kings sport for free

The 25 km long Bukit Timah Road the longest road in Singapore running north and south of the island takes its name from this hill The road to Kranji was completed in 1845 Apparently the area was so infested with tigers that it constituted a serious threat to human life In 1860 nearly 200 people were reported to have been killed by tigers in and about the gambier and pepper plantations The first ride on horseback across the island was along Bukit Timah Road in 1840 it took four days and was made by Mr Thomson and Dr Little

Bukit Timah Road is known as tek kha kang a kinn in Hokkien which means the side of the stream in the tek kha district This only refers to the lower end of the Bukit Timah Road The Wayang Satu and Bukit Timah village parts are differently called The Hokkiens also refer to Bukit Timah as be chia lo bue meaning end of the horse carriage road

During World War II the British Army lost Bukit Timah to the Japanese on February 11th they knew they had little chance of winning the war as most of their food and supplies were stored there On 15 February 1942 the head of the Allied forces Lieutenant General AE Percival surrendered to Lieutenant General Tomoyuki Yamashita at the Ford Factory in Bukit Timah

During the Japanese Occupation the Japanese troops built a Syonan to Shinto shrine similar to the National Shinto in Japan but of a smaller size at Bukit Timah Hill Two war memorials dedicated to the Japanese war dead and surprisingly to the deceased British troops who died defending Singapore were built at the site Students Japanese commanders British POWs representatives would gather there regularly to commemorate the dead during the Occupation

It was only shortly before the Japanese surrender the Japanese forces hastily destroyed the Shinto Shrine on fears that returning British forces will demolish it in an bad manner The present site where the Shinto Shrine existed lied at a grey area between the Nature Reserve and Singapore Armed Forces restricted area Several historians have been down at the site and an episode from then Television Corporation of Singapore history documentary show Hey Singapore was on the mysterious Shinto Shrine Since then the Singapore Government has erected the place as Historical Site No plans have been indicated to restore the site on speculations of angry responses from the People Republic of China and abroad 

The Japanese war dead were brought back to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine while the remains of the British troops were instituted at the British Commonwealths Kranji War Memorial in Singapore Nothing of the Syonan to Shinto shrine remains except for the Holy Cleansing Pond and several Japanese stone pavements left at the site

After the Japanese Occupation the farms and plantations in Bukit Timah gave way to industrial buildings and high rise flats In the 1960s and 1970s Bukit Timah was a major industrial center Today these have been replaced with luxury bungalows terraces and condominiums making Bukit Timah Singapores premier residential district

The Bukit Timah area is a particularly prominent location with a high land value The area of Bukit Timah has an extensive flora and forest compared to the parts of Singapore and contains Bukit Timah Nature Reserve which is partially responsible for its high land value The nature reserve was established in 1883

The Bukit Timah Race Course a Thoroughbred horse racing facility was opened in 1933 and operated until 1999

The nearby area houses many bungalows traditionally expensive in land scarce Singapore as well as high rise condominiums Many expatriates and well heeled Singaporeans tend to stay in this region The rise in land prices has led to development of new condominiums For example the Copthorne Orchid Hotel in Dunearn Road is being redeveloped into condominiums for sale 

This region was later extended and Upper Bukit Timah was formed The Keretapi Tanah Melayu from Malaysia has a passing loop station here along its rail network from Johor Bahru to Tanjong Pagar

The Vikings were the people who came from Scandinavia around 793AD 1066AD and who traveled great distances in their longboats as traders settlers and warriors Many of the Vikings were tall and had red or blonde hair and beards Villages on or near any coast in early medieval Europe lived in great fear of Viking attacks Some of the countries most affected by Viking piracy were England Scotland Ireland Germany and France

Some words from the Scandinavian and Viking language entered the English language For example the words skirt and shirt came from the word skyrta meaning a tunic As English changed the semantics altered to give us the separate words skirt and shirt we know today Skin came from the Norse word skinn Some place names in the areas the Vikings conquered are still in use For example in Yorkshire places ending with thwaite meant a clearing and dale which meant a valley The word thorpe meant new village such as Scunthorpe The girls name Leah came from the word leya and was used for Viking girls

The Vikings traveled through Russia the Mediterranean Sea southern Europe northern Africa and south western Asia Some Vikings sailed across the Atlantic Ocean via Iceland and Greenland and even lived in North America for a while Native Americans whom they called Skraelings The ruins of a Viking settlement from 1100 AD have been found at LAnse aux Meadows Newfoundland

Europeans were frightened of the Vikings because of their strong weapons swift attacks and cruel fighting tactics They were known for their bad treatment of women children and monks in the places where they fought When the Vikings came to England the English kings paid them to leave the country but the Vikings took their money and sometimes fought them anyway These payments were called Danegeld From the 9th century to 1066 when the French Duke of Normandy who became King William I of England conquered it Danish and Norwegian Vikings ruled large parts of England

Digital media is electronic media that works on digital codes Today computing is based on the binary numeral system so the digital refers to the use of 0 and 1 to show data Computers are machines that use binary digital data as information Digital media like digital audio digital video and other digital content can be created referred to and distributed by digital information processing machines Digital media is a big change from media

The transformation of an Analog signal to Digital information by a Analog to digital converter is called sampling According to information theory sampling is a reduction of information Most digital media are based on turning analog data into digital data and vice versa

Compared to analog data digital data is easier to control and can be made into many copies without losing any quality Mathematical operations can be made into digital information regardless of its meaning Thus it is possible to use the same compression operation onto a text file or an image file or a sound file

However that being said I can not support you as an admin right now The first problem is easy I dont particularly want or need the tools If you can say that in all honesty then Im not sure I could support you regardless at the very least it would be a neutral comment explaining why I cant support If you dont want or need the tools there isnt any real reason to give them out The sysop tools are just that tools they arent needed by everyone giving them out as a reward for contributions is silly that isnt what they are for

The biggest problem though is that to be totally honest I cant find the trust to give you the tools I have seen time and time again not only a disregard for rules but a huge tendency to keep grudges and get overly uncivil and outright hostile towards other well meaning members of the community Even when I completely agree with most of your concerns and am out right frustrated or annoyed by the activity of those users I end up more frustrated at your hostility It is very difficult to cultivate good editors when you are going to spit in there face over and over again Part of the problem of course is your sysop actions in the past httpsimplewikipediaorgwindexphptitleSpecialLogtypeblockuserBluegoblin7pageUserBluegoblin7year2009month7 this is just absurd for example except under very very specific exemptions you should never unblock yourself it is the very definition of abuse of sysop powers and your edit sum and the fact that 30 minutes later you httpmetawikimediaorgwindexphptitleStewardrequestsPermissionsactionhistorysubmitdiff1541350oldid1541212 resignedmade it quite clear you knew that and didnt give a fuck Unfortunately I dont think youve changed comments like httpsimplewikipediaorgwindexphptitleWikipediaRequestsforadminshipGriffinofwalesdiffprevoldid1772450 are just unnecessary and you can occasionally get up to the point of outright public harassment on IRC to editors who are trying to do whats right even if they step on toes and do whats wrong occasionally Even now you still routinely go after editors who you dont like specifically targeting them to call them out on their mistakes and try to get them in trouble in the community Im sorry You are a great editor but I just cant be in anyway sure you wont abuse your admin tools again which I think youve done in the past This is already much longer then I wanted it to be so Ill cut it short here but let me know if you want more Jamesofur 0949 19 October 2009

Anderson died in Panama on the 8th March 1941 at the age of 64 He was buried in Marion Virginia The writing on his gravestone reads Life Not Death is the Great Adventure

The principle of Selectivity is based upon an analysis of several circuit breaker characteristics These include time current curves peak let through current and energy let through

The maximum selectivity level with two nominated breakers in series under short circuit conditions is often stated by vendors in Technical Reference manuals

Selectivity can be enhanced beyond the breaking capacity of the downstream breaker provided it is backed up by an appropriately selected upstream breaker which should not trip under the stated short circuit current 

Selectivity works as the upstream breaker heats up under fault conditions providing impedence in the fault circuit reducing the overall fault severity

Half staff or half mast describes a flag being displayed at halfway up a flagpole or a ships mast This is done in many countries as a symbol of respect mourning or distress or a form of honor

The flag does not always have to be flown at exactly the half way point sometimes it is acceptable to have the half mast flag at slightly lower or slightly higher than the middle of the flagpole or mast Originally half staff meant that the flag had to be flown one flag width from the top to allow for the invisible flag of mourning to be at the top

FileWaves in pacifica 1jpgthumbSimulating and calculating the dispersion and refraction of water waves is one area where the equations can be usedThe NavierStokes equations are mathematical equations that describe the motion of fluids The equations are named after Claude Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes The equations result from applying Newtons second law to fluid motion with the belief that the fluid stress is the sum of a diffusing viscous term plus a pressure term

They are very useful because they describe the physics of many things of academic and economic interest They may be used to model the weather ocean currents water flow in a pipe the airs flow around a wing and motion of stars inside a galaxy The NavierStokes equations in their full and simplified forms help with the design of aircraft and cars the study of blood flow the design of power stations the analysis of pollution and many other things Together with Maxwells equations they can be used to model and study magnetohydrodynamics

The NavierStokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense Somewhat surprisingly given their wide range of practical uses mathematicians have not yet proven that in three dimensions solutions always exist or that if they do exist then they do not contain any singularity These are called the NavierStokes existence and smoothness problems The Clay Mathematics Institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics and offered a US1000000 prize for a solution or a counter example

The NavierStokes equations dictate not position but rather velocity A solution of the NavierStokes equations is called a velocity field or flow field which is a description of the velocity of the fluid at a given point in space and time Once the velocity field is solved for other quantities of interest may be found This is different from what one normally sees in classical mechanics where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a broken wikt linkParticleparticle or broken wikt linkdeflectdeflection of a continuum Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid however for visualization purposes one can compute various trajectories

Note 1 this is different from a list of surnames that came from Russia as there are people living in there with very many ethnic roots Because of this there are surnames from many places of the ex USSR Europe and Asia This list also shows in the Simple English Wikipedia to show pages about family names that may need to be created If you or your relatives live in Russia add your surname to the list if it is not there This list is updated from time to time from its original place semi automatically using a computer program Note 2 it is also very possible on the Simple English Wikipedia that the spelled versions of the names can be the same as some equivalent common Slavic surnames of Ukranians Belorusians Bulgarians and others

Mary Toft also called Mary Tofts was an English woman from Godalming Surrey In 1726 she became the subject of a lot of dispute when she tricked doctors into believing that she had given birth to rabbits

Toft became pregnant in 1726 but later miscarried She had developed a strong interest in a rabbit she had seen while working and claimed to have given birth to parts of animals Local surgeon John Howard was called to see if it was true and upon delivering several animal parts he told other important doctors The event came to the attention of Nathaniel St Andr surgeon to the Royal Household of King George I of Great Britain St Andr checked further into the event and decided that Toft was telling the truth The king also sent surgeon Cyriacus Ahlers to see Toft but Ahlers did not believe it By now quite famous Toft was brought to London and was studied at length Under intense study and producing no more rabbits she eventually confessed to the hoax and was sent to prison as a fraud

The public learned of the fact that the doctors had been fooled and this created panic within the medical profession Several important surgeons careers were ruined and many works were made that made fun of the doctors each very critical of the affair William Hogarth was very critical of the medical profession Toft was eventually released without charge and returned to her home

Twitter is a website that gives users social networking and microblogging services through messages called tweets Users use mobile phones or computers to send and to read tweets Tweets can be up to 140 characters long They appear on the users profile page Tweets can usually be read by anyone but senders can also keep messages private Private tweets only go to their list of friends Users may subscribe to tweets from other people This is called following and subscribers are known as followers As of late 2009 users can also follow lists of authors

All users can send and receive tweets using the Twitter website They can also use other applications that work with Twitter on smartphones Twitter by Short Message Service is available in certain countries Using Twitter is free but sending or getting tweets by SMS may cost money The website is based in San Bruno California Twitter also has servers and offices in San Antonio Texas and Boston Massachusetts and soon in Salt Lake City Utah

Twitter has become very popular worldwide since Jack Dorsey created it in 2006 It now has more than 100 million users It is sometimes described as the SMS of the Internet

Twitter started at a podcasting company Odeo The company board members had a daylong brainstorming session During the meeting Jack Dorsey introduced the idea of one person using an SMS service to communicate with a small group At first they called this project twttr It fit the five character length of American SMS short codes and sounded like Flickr At first the developers planned to use 10958 as a short code Later they changed it to 40404 because it was easier to remember and type Dorsey sent the first Twitter message at 950 PM Pacific Standard Time March 21 2006 The first tweet was just setting up my twttr

The first version of Twitter was only for Odeo employees to use They opened the full version for anyone to use on July 15 2006 In October 2006 Biz Stone Evan Williams Dorsey and other members of Odeo started a new company called Obvious Corporation Obvious Corporation bought Odeo and all of its propertyincluding Odeocom and Twittercomfrom the investors and shareholders Twitter became its own separate company in April 2007

Twitter started becoming very popular after the 2007 South by Southwest festival During the event Twitter usage increased from 20000 tweets per day to 60000 The Twitter company set up two very large computer screens in the hallways at the conference These screens only showed Twitter messages Hundreds of people at the conference checked on what each other were doing by looking at the many tweets Panelists and speakers talked about Twitter Bloggers at SXSW described it to others in a very positive way

Reaction at the festival was very good Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter absolutely ruled SXSW Social software researcher Danah Boyd said Twitter owned the festival Twitter staff won the festivals Web Award prize They said wed like to thank you in 140 characters or less And we just did

On September 14 2010 Twitter changed the site design and added a new logo

On October 4 2010 Evan Williams announced that he would not be CEO any more Dick Costolo became the new CEO He had been COO of Twitter Williams will stay with the company and work on plans for the future of Twitter

Technology author Steven Johnson described the basic way Twitter works He called it remarkably simple Following is an important part of Twitter as a social network Users Twitter home pages show all of the tweets from people they follow The tweets appear from newest to oldest Johnson said 

People who use Twitter   Twitter is mainly used by older adults who might not have used other social sites before Twitter Jeremiah Owyang studies social media He said Adults are just catching up to what teens have been doing for years Only 11 of Twitters users were 12 to 17 years old in September 2009 This may be because Twitter first gained popularity in businesses and news media that attract more older people Many famous people such as Shaq Britney Spears and Ashton Kutcher became Twitter users      In June 2009 more women than men used Twitter53 women 47 men Only 5 of users made 75 of all tweets Also New York had the most Twitter users      This is a brief summary of Twitter users as of 3 September 2009   Total users 27 million   Age 63 of Twitter users were less than 35 years old   Race 60 of Twitter users were Caucasian 16 were African American That is higher than other Internet sites Hispanic users were 11   Income 58 of Twitter users had a total household income of at least 60K 

Twitter is one of the 10 most visited websites in the world

People can use software from other companies to access Twitter These programs are called third party applications The Twitter company changed the way this works on 31 August 2010 Now applications must use OAuth to connect to Twitter This method means that users do not have to give their passwords to the third party applications Changing the login system to OAuth did cause some problems Using OAuth had been optional and programs used to be able to ask for usernames and passwords However now third party applications that try to use a username and password do not work at all The Twitter company said that using OAuth will give users increased security and a better experience

On April 30 2009 Twitter changed the way it looks on the web They added a search bar and a space on the right side of the page with Trending Topics That space shows the most common phrases appearing in messages Biz Stone explained that all messages are instantly indexed and explained the results of the change The Trending Topics has made Twitter something unexpectedly important a discovery engine for finding out what is happening right now

Sometimes Twitter users experience a problem with the service and cannot access the website They cannot read or write tweets but only see the Fail Whale image created by Yiying Lu

Twitter worked well approximately 98 of the time in 2007 That is about six full days of no service The problems were particularly noticeable during events popular with the technology industry such as the 2008 Macworld Conference Expo keynote address

Twitter developed several software projects to improve their own service The company shared these as open source software Some of these software projects are related to databases such as the Gizzard Scala framework and a distributed graph database called FlockDB

tco is a service created by Twitter to make URLs shorter It can only be used for links that people post to Twitter It is not available for other uses Eventually all links on Twitter will use tco The company hopes that the service will protect users from harmful websites They will also use it to keep a record of people clicking on links in tweets

Twitter had used the services from other sites such as TinyURL and bitly They began trying their own way of making URLs shorter for direct messages in March 2010 They used the domain twttl before they bought the tco domain

The company is using these accounts to test the service on the main site TwitterAPI rsarver and raffi

On 2 September 2010 Twitter sent an email message to users to explain that they were starting to open the service to them

Twitter can also be used as an amateur and professional news source

A micro blog is a form of a blog where people send short messages of text or media These messages can be sent to a website and shown to either a small group or to the public A micro blogger could send their messages from different sources including cell phone text messages email instant messages or through a website 

A micro blog is usually different from a normal blog It has much smaller pieces A micro blog entry can be just one sentence or a link to an image or short video A person writing a micro blog can use many ideas from what am I doing now to Race cars or politics or information about their business or personal life

Micro blogs are in use in many ways on different websites They became popular with sites like Twitter where people send messages to each other with text comments or links to other media Newer sites are also available now which allow you to share media like videos pictures or sounds directly instead of sending a link 

Many social networking sites use a type of micro blogging using status updates where the person tells their friends what they are thinking or doing 

A Harvard Business School study found that while most social networking websites are more popular with women micro blogging like Twitter has been much more popular with men Both men and women followed more men this allows them to receive the messages that get sent out by the person they followed 

Micro blogs have also become new sources for news that just happened or is still happening such as the terrorist attacks on Mumbai in November 2008

A new idea for Micro blogging has been to turn it into a way to talk to other people about work It allows a person to give quick news or information to the people they work without sending a lot of emails and without the spam they get in their email account New companies such as Yammer have been started who want to help allow workers to talk to each other with about work and share what they need 

Omegle allows one to talk with one person anonymously and randomly The nicknames that are used are you and stranger It was started in late March of 2009 by an 18 year old Leif K Brooks who lives in Vermont

The website has started using a lot of new things in the chat One new thing is that people can chat using webcams Another new thing is that one person can ask something while watching the other two strangers talk about the thing the first person asked The asker doesnt get to talk only watch One really new thing that people can do is use Facebook Connect to find strangers who have liked the same things on Facebook

The website does not restrict users based on age or any other user characteristic The site never censors contributions through a profanity filter A user may encounter nudity or sexual content on camera K Brooks has acknowledged the questionable content of the site At one time he said he felt disappointment at the way in which the site has been used

Kowloon Walled City was a tiny Chinese enclave in Hong Kong 

It was a military fort for hundreds of years but later became a very dense settlement In 1980 the city had about 35000 people on about 20000 m of land making it one of the most densely populated places on earth It was torn down in 1993 and a park called Kowloon Walled City Park was built in 1994

The area where Kowloon Walled City was located is now called Kowloon City It is part of the Kowloon City District of Kowloon Hong Kong

Luncheon usually simply called lunch is a meal that is usually eaten around noon or in the early afternoon In most countries it is the second meal of the day after breakfast and before dinner A lunch can be cold or hot People that go to work or school during the day usually have lunch together with their coworkers or classmates Some people bring lunch to work or school in a brown paper bag or a lunchbox but you can also buy lunch at a restaurant In some countries lunch is the most important meal of the day

Ian Wallace was a British bass baritone opera and concert singer actor and entertainer

Ian Wallace was born in London and went to school at Charterhouse He soon became known at school as someone who was good at making people laugh He learned to sing lots of songs and accompanied himself on the banjolele

When he wanted to study at university he applied for a choral scholarship at Kings College Cambridge but he was not offered a place there so he went to Trinity Hall There he studied law and was known for the jokes that he played on people He also had singing lessons

Wallace wanted to go into music theatre but the war broke out and he joined the army Then he was ill with tuberculosis but it did not stop him from singing to the people in the hospital

He took a long time to get better Gradually he started working in music theatre and then he got a chance to sing in opera His voice was a bass baritone He sang with the New London Opera Company in operas such as La bohme and The Barber of Seville From 1948 to 1961 he regularly sang at Glyndebourne He usually sang comic parts  

In 1948 he married Patricia Black It was a long and happy marriage The couple adopted two children 

The Glyndebourne season took place in the summer so he had plenty of time to do other things the rest of the year He sang in operas in the BBC studios and often appeared in pantomimes Then he started to take part in a radio programme called My Music Together with Frank Muir Dennis Norden David Franklin and Steve Race he made this programme extremely popular It was a kind of lighthearted quiz programme with lots of stories and laughter Wallace was particularly known for singing a song called The Hippopotamus by Flanders and Swann

Wallace continued to sing in opera in the mid 1960s He sang the roles of Leporello and Pistol  He acted on television and in films and appeared at many charity events He was always very cheerful and friendly and he was liked by a lot of people

He wrote two autobiographies Promise Me Youll Sing Mud and Nothing Quite Like It

A bass baritone is a male singer whose voice is quite low like a deep baritone but not quite as low as really deep bass People started to describe some singers as bass baritones in the 19th century particularly when the composer Richard Wagner wrote operas which needed singers with that kind of heroic voice Wagners roles for bass baritone include the Dutchman in Der fliegende Hollnder WotanDer Wanderer in the Ring Cycle and Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger von Nrnberg Wagner called these roles Hoher Bass

Some bass baritones often sing baritone roles Others prefer to sing bass roles

Famous singers who have been or are described as bass baritone include Hans Hotter Jos van Dam Thomas Quasthoff Friedrich Schnorr John Shirley Quirk Bryn Terfel and Willard White

A number of problems from graph theory are called Minimum spanning tree In graph theory a tree is a way of connecting all the vertices together so that there is exactly one path from any one vertex to any other vertex of the tree If the graph represents a number of cities connected by roads one could select a number of roads so that each city can be reached from every other but that there is no more than one way to travel from one city to another

A graph can have more than one spanning tree just like there may be more than one way to select the roads between the cities

Most of the time graphs are weighted each connection between two cities has a weight It might cost something to travel on a given road or one connection may be longer than the other this means it takes more time to travel on that connection In the language of graph theory the connections are called edges 

A minimum spanning tree is a tree It is different from other trees in that it minimizes the total of the weights attached to the edges Depending on what the graph looks like there may be more than one minimum spanning tree In a graph where all the edges have the same weight every tree is a minimum spanning tree If all the edges have different weights there is exactly one minimal spanning tree 

It can be very simple to make an algorithm that will discover a minimum spanning tree

In this case safe means that including the edge does not form a cycle in the graph A cycle means starting at a vertex travelling to a number of other vertices and ending up at the starting point again without using the same edge twice

Czech scientist Otakar Borvka developed the first known algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree in 1926 He wanted to solve the problem of finding an efficient coverage of Moravia with electricity Today this algorithm is known as Borvkas algorithm Two other algorithms are commonly used today One of them was developed by Vojtch Jarnk in 1930 and put in practice by Robert Clay Prim in 1957 Edsger Wybe Dijkstra rediscovered it in 1959 and called it Prims algorithm The other algorithm is called Kruskals algorithm and was pulbished by Joseph Kruskal in 1956 All three algorithms are greedy and run in polynomial time 

The fastest minimum spanning tree algorithm to date was developed by Bernard Chazelle The algorithm is based on the soft heap an approximate priority queue Its running time is O where m is the number of edges n is the number of vertices and is the classical functional inverse of the Ackermann function The function grows extremely slowly so that for all practical purposes it may be considered a constant no greater than 4 thus Chazelles algorithm takes very close to linear time 

What is the fastest possible algorithm for this problem That is one of the oldest open questions in computer science There is clearly a linear lower bound since we must at least examine all the weights If the edge weights are integers with a bounded bit length then deterministic algorithms are known with linear running time For general weights there are randomized algorithms whose expected running time is linear

The problem can also be approached in a distributed manner If each node is considered a computer and no node knows anything except its own connected links one can still calculate the distributed minimum spanning tree

The WWE European Championship is a former championship for World Wrestling Entertainment It was first established as the WWF European Championship The first and longest reigning champion The British Bulldog became the first Champion after winning a tournament that was held over several shows in Germany culminating in a finals victory over Owen Hart When Shawn Michaels won the belt it made him the first Grand Slam Champion in WWE Michaels was and still is the only wrestler to have held both the WWF Championship and the European title at the same time The title was on a brief hiatus in 1999 due to then champion Shane McMahons wanting to retire an undefeated champion The WWE European Championship was retired in a ladder match on July 22 2002 when Rob Van Dam put his WWE Intercontinental Championship on the line along with Jeff Hardys European Championship in a winner take all type match When RVD won the match he merged the two titles together and continued to hold the Intercontinental Title RVDs title reign is not listed in the official European title history on WWEs official website and therefore he is not credited with being a Eurocontinental Champion but is mentioned in RVDs profile

Trouble is a song recorded by British alternative rock band Coldplay It was composed for their first album Parachutes The band wrote the song and produced it with British record producer Ken Nelson The word trouble is repeated many times in the lyrics of the song

The song was released on 26 October 2000 as a single It was the third single of the album It reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart This made it the bands second Top 10 single in the country Trouble did not chart on the main singles chart in the United States But the music press said it was almost as successful as Yellow Yellow was the single released before Trouble Two different music videos for the single were released

Chris Martin the vocalist of Coldplay said that inspiration for writing Trouble came from his own behaviour Martin said that there were some bad things going in our band the song is about behaving badly towards somebody you really love and I was certainly doing that to some members of the band The four members of Coldplay are credited as the co writers of Trouble But it was based on Martins idea

British record producer Ken Nelson and the band produced Trouble for their first album Parachutes The song was recorded four times before the band got the recording they liked most The band decided that the first three versions were not working The last take was recorded into Pro Tools with a shaker This was done to provide the rhythm to the track For the backing track Will Champion played the drums and Martin played the piano It was recorded in a little wooden room Guy Berryman recorded the bass and then guitarist Jonny Buckland added the guitar section In recording the piano section of the track the band used two microphones Nelson who wanted to keep the song simple chose the microphone which had a fuller sound for the mixing

Trouble was mixed in New York by American mix engineer Michael Brauer The first mixed version was sent back to the band and Nelson However it was not as good as they wanted and had to be mixed again Nelson found some problems in the version In spite of this he did not blame Brauer because he was not present during the mixing This was because they were recording the album at that time

Like in the song Yellow in this song the word trouble is used many times The songs lyrics have softer emotional themes This includes apologies and unrequited love and longing

Trouble was released on 26 October 2000 in the United Kingdom and on 18 December 2001 in the United States It was the third single of Parachutes A limited edition CD of the single was released It had a remix of the songs Yellow and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas Only 1000 copies were made It was given only to fans and journalists

Coldplay did not accept many offers to use Trouble for advertisements In 2004 the band rejected an offer from Diet Coke and Gap to use the song The offer was worth many million Euros American actor Sylvester Stallone wanted to use the song for the soundtrack of his 2001 film Driven But the band declined

Trouble was a commercial success It reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart This made it the bands second Top 10 single in the UK after Yellow Trouble was successful because the previous singles did very well Also the album Parachutes was very successful in the United Kingdom The British band Lost Witness made a remixed version of the song It was released and was successful

In the United States the singles chart performance was almost as good as Yellows It reached number 23 on the Billboard Adult Top 40 and 28 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks Martin has said the single had saved them from being a one hit wonder band The band thought it was not a great single They felt it would not do well in the United States

The original European version of the music video for Trouble was directed by British director Sophie Muller The video was shot in a Newhall California ranch Its theme was the Wild West

The music video also had a US version This was directed by Tim Hope who won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002 for the video It was also nominated for Breakthrough Video The video is similar to Dont Panic

Trichomes are structures on plant leaves They may look like hairs but they are not Trichomes are made of living cells They stick out from the surface of the leaf

Trichomes can look very different Some trichomes have one long cell Other trichomes are a long chain of cells Trichomes may have branches which make them look like a star Trichomes can be very long or very short

Trichomes help to shade the leaf from the sun They block too much wind from moving across the leaf surface This stops too much water from leaving the leaf Animals might not eat leaves with trichomes because they do not like the taste

Glandular trichomes have chemicals in them They break when the leaf is touched Then the chemicals come out For example trichomes on poison ivy leaves have a chemical that makes people itchy

A Quantum computer is a model of how to build a computer The idea is that quantum computers can use certain phenomena from Quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement to perform operations on data The basic principle behind quantum computation is that quantum properties can be used to represent data and perform operations on it A theoretical model is the quantum Turing machine also known as the universal quantum computer

The idea of quantum computing is still very new Experiments have been done In these a very small number of operations were done on qubits Both practical and theoretical research continues with interest and many national government and military funding agencies support quantum computing research to develop quantum computers for both civilian and national security purposes such as cryptanalysis

If large scale quantum computers can be built they will be able to solve some problems much faster than any computer that exists today Quantum computers are different from other computers such as DNA computers and traditional computers based on transistors Some computing architectures such as optical computers may use classical superposition of electromagnetic waves Without quantum mechanical resources such as entanglement people think that an exponential advantage over classical computers is not possible Quantum computers cannot perform functions that are not theoretically computable by classical computers ie they do not alter the Church Turing thesis They would however be able to do many things much faster and more efficiently

Balukas was thought of as a rare young talent She first earned some fame when she was six years old by appearing in a pool playing event held at New York Citys Grand Central Station She later appeared many times on television such as on CBSs popular evening television show Ive Got a Secret She was nine years old when she placed 5th in the 1969 US Open Straight Pool Championship She placed 4th and 3rd in the next two US Opens From that early start Balukas dominated womens professional pool during the 1970s and 1980s

Balukas won the US Open seven years in a row from 1972 through 1978 She won six world championship titles She had over 100 professional competition first place finishes 38 of those wins were in major events She had a streak of 16 first place finishes in womens professional tournaments Balukas was also the only woman to compete equally with men in professional play in her era She quit the sport in 1988 because of a dispute that happened in a match at the World Open Nine ball Championship that year

Jean Balukass father Albert Balukas and his business partner Frank McGown owned a forty eight table pool hall named the Ovington Lounge in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn New York Balukas began playing pool when she four years old She did not play at her fathers pool room Her first play was on a 4 by 9 foot pool table in the basement of her childhood home Her parents bought the table to keep her four brothers out of local pool rooms

Balukas played with a cue stick that had ivory details It was made just for her in 1965 by a cue stick maker George Balabushka When she was five and six years old she would practice a game called straight pool to 50 points after family dinners Her father supported her play

In 1966 McGown held a public billiards exhibition at New York Citys Grand Central Terminal With her parents permission he brought along the six year old Balukas Balukas participated in the exhibition This gained Balukas media attention Later in 1966 Balukas appeared on a television show called Wonderama Balukas and her younger sister Laura also appeared on CBSs television show Ive Got a Secret later that year

In 1967 Balukas was in an exhibition match at a pool hall called the Carom Club located Manhattan In advertisements for the match Balukas was described as the Little Princess of Pocket Billiards A reporter described her at the match as a little girl with honey blond hairwearing a short yellow dress and green leotardswho resembles a young Shirley Temple She beat her adult opponent Roland DeMarco with a final score of 50 to 42 

In 1969 at the age of nine she competed in her first Billiard Congress of America US Open Straight Pool Championship Balukas placed 5th in the competition All her opponents were adults In the next two US Opens in 1970 and 1971 she placed 4th and 3rd respectively By that time Balukas had appeared on other television programs with a number of billiard stars and other celebrities

On August 18 1972 when she was thirteen years old Balukas won the womens side of the US Open Straight Pool Championship For the win she beat five time champion Dorothy Wise The prize was 1500 Balukas was the US Opens youngest winner ever and by a large number of years She also beat in the finals Madelyn Whitlow of Detroit Michigan with a score of 75 to 32 in 44 innings Reporting on the competition The New York Times described her as a strong player throughout the tournament as she defeated six opponents with precision shooting and almost perfect strategy 

In 1973 at fourteen Balukas successfully defended her straight pool US Open title She beat runner up Donna Ries a psychologist from Kansas City Missouri with a final score of 75 to 72 in 42 innings In her longest turn she sank 26 balls in a row and won 2000 for first place Earlier in the tournament she beat Mieko Harada a housewife from Kyoto Japan Balukas score was much higher than Haradas 75 to 1 in 20 innings and sank 25 balls in a row In the 1974 US Open held at the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago Balukas defended her title again beating out Harada but by a much closer score 100 to 99 This was Balukass third US Open title in a row at the young age of fifteen The close scores at the end of the match were similar to the results on the mens side where Joe Balsis defeated Jim Rempe 200 to 199 

In 1975 Balukas beat Ries again in the US Open semi finals with a score of 75 to 15 in 15 innings She also beat Gail Breedlove of Ames Iowa 75 to 19 She then again played and beat Harada in the finals winning 3000 with a score of 100 to 63 in 39 innings In her longest turn she sank 23 balls In 1976 then 17 Balukas took her fifth US Open title in a row beating Gloria Walker of Cheyney Pennsylvania 75 to 46 in 39 innings and winning a 1700 prize Balukas would win the next two US Open straight pool championships for a total of seven wins in a row Her streak of wins ended after 1978 because the US Open itself was canceled not because she was beaten 

Balukas was not only talented at pool but also good at other sports From age sixteen to eighteen ABC TV asked her to be on a show called Superstars This event happened in Rotonda West Florida Top athletes from one sport competed in a different sports that they did not usually compete in In her first appearance in 1976 while a junior in high school Balukas placed second with 192 points She won titles in tennis and bowling The winner that year was speed skater Anne Henning Other competitors included diver Micki King tennis and golf pro Althea Gibson skier Kiki Cutter runner Wyomia Tyus and tennis champion Martina Navratilova The second place win was both good and bad for Balukas She won 13100 prize money so she lost amateur standing Afterwards she was banned from competing in high school sports Also she was not allowed to get a college athletic scholarship

Balukas has won many other pool titles including six at the World Open Pocket Billiard Championships At her first win in that tournament held at a convention hall in Asbury Park New Jersey on August 14 1977 she was described as the 18 year old prodigy from Brooklyn There she again beat Gloria Walker with a score of 100 to 57 and earned a 1001 prize Balukas has won more US Opens than any other player male or female The closest male is Steve Mizerak with four wins to Balukass seven Her ball average over the seven US Opens was far better than was her opponents Balukas averaged 344 in 1972 with the next best Gloria Walker having an average of 237 In 1975 she averaged 405 while no other player averaged even 3

By the late 1960s Balukas was playing in exhibition matches with top male players For example she played with Willie Mosconi and Irving Crane who were together considered between 1941 and 1956 the best in the world flat out In 1975 she again played Willie Mosconi on CBSs Challenge of the Sexes playing in games of eight ball and nine ball For the exhibition the rules were changed to allow Balukas to have an advantage Specifically Balukas always took the first shot Then she also took the next shot even if she did not put a ball in a pocket on the first shot Balukas beat Mosconi at both games She would later play Battle of the Sexes matches on television with Rudolph Wanderone in 1977 Ray Martin in 1979 and with Steve Mizerak in 1986

On August 6 1978 Balukas became the first women to qualify to play in the mens side of the World Open Pocket Billiards Championship This meant that Balukas would be competing in both the womens and mens sides of the tournament The tournament was to be held on August 12 of that year at the Biltmore Hotel in New York City 

Balukas played against men in several other competitions These included at least one first shown on TV on March 25 1979 between her and mens champion Ray Martin The match was described on the television schedule as part of a Challenge of the Sexes Other male female matchups in the series were between golfers Nancy Lopez and Andy North and co ed participants in a skateboarding challenge match During 1980 Balukas again competed in the mens side of the World Open Pocket Billiards championship That year it was played at New York Citys Roosevelt Hotel She was beaten in the second round by Steve Mizerak with a score of 150 to 93 Her final rank in the tournament was 22nd At the end 42 men were behind her She also played on the womens side and was the champion She beat Billie Billings also from Brooklyn with a score of 100 to 75

Balukas was entered in both the mens and womens divisions of the 1987 BC Classic a nine ball competition After controversy she competed only on the mens side There she beat Keith McCready 11 to 3 At that time McCready was the 17th ranked male player by money list Balukas finished the tournament by tying for 9th place

In August 1987 at the yearly BC Classic held at a Holiday Inn in Binghamton New York Balukas was scheduled to play in the mens and womens tournaments After arriving she found out that for the nighttime matches she would be required to wear formal clothing However she did not have suitable clothing with her The mens side had no similar dress code Thus Balukas did not buy clothes to follow the rule because she thought it was unfair 

The women held a vote on whether Balukas should be allowed to play The vote resulted in Balukas being banned from the womens tournament Some people said that the real reason other players voted her out was because they would have a better chance of winning the first place USD 5000 prize if Balukas did not play Balukas did not think so Balukas did compete on the mens side tying for ninth place

Soon after the dress code issue was reported on the president of the Womens Professional Billiard Association Belinda Bearden sent a letter to The New York Times Bearden wrote that the facts were different than reported The WPBA stated the dress code was decided by the women players for themselves They made the rules to improve the image of womens pool and to attract a larger audience and more press to the sport They said that Balukas was the only woman at the event who was not willing to follow the rule They also explained that Balukas first left from the womens division They said that she came back to play after the list of who would play who was already completed Another vote on whether she could play went 87 in Balukas favor However after they asked a player who was absent from the first vote Balukas withdrew from the womens division of the competition

In 1988 Balukas was playing another professional player named Robin Bell the Brunswick sponsored World Open Nine ball Championship The tournament was held at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas Nevada and shown on television Bell was Balukass best friend on the womens tour She had never beaten Balukas before However Bell had been playing very strongly in the tournament The terms of the match were that the winner would be whoever won nine games first In the game of nine ball there is a way to win the game very quickly The game is over and the first player wins if they put the 9 ball in a pocket when they take the first shot Early in the match the score was 2 games to 3 with Bell winning Then Bell sank the 9 ball on the first shot two games in a row so she won both games That made the score 5 to 2 very quickly without having to play a complete game Bell avoided having to match skill with Balukas on each turn

All television match players wore small microphones so that their words and the sounds of play could be heard by the audience Balukas quietly said to herself that Bell had gotten lucky The microphone let others hear what Balukas said The referee spoke to Balukas and told her not to continue talking about Bell They continued playing Balukas won the match with a final score of 9 to 5 According to an interview with Balukas by New York Woman magazine in 1991 Balukass exact words were Some world championship beat me with skill not luck Despite Bell and Balukass friendship after the match Bell made a formal complaint to the WPBA about the incident The WPBAs board of directors fined Balukas 200 for unsportsmanlike conduct

Balukas was angry about the fine She did not pay it She turned down offers by others to pay the fine for her Balukas explained that It wasnt the 200 Women pool players who were ranked three and six and five were the ones who decided I should be fined I felt it should have been done by an outside panel not by my competitors The sides were deadlocked Balukas refused to pay and the WPBA refused to cancel the fine They would not allow Balukas to play again until she paid Just because she was our premier player does not mean she was above the rules said Vicki Paski in 1992 then president of the WPBA Another professional named Loree Jon Jones was also interviewed Her feelings were more mixed Her not playing is I guess sad but she also said that without Balukas playing weve all learned how to win

Balukas had faced other problems before she stopped competing When she had tried to compete against men as the only woman she heard insults from some men For example one said Im gonna put on a dress and go play with the women Balukas heard many complaints from the men upon her entry to a Chicago tournament in 1988 They said it was not fair that she got to play on both the mens and womens side when the men could only play on their own side She agreed not to play However after she traveled to the tournament she learned she had been tricked I found out that the first and second place winners in the womens event were going to be invited to play in the mens event I was stabbed in the back

Balukas also admits to having been under great pressure much of it that she placed on herself After she reached the very top of her profession Thats when I started getting nervous thats when I started putting a lot of pressure on myself Playing against the men I learned to lose but losing hurt with the women because I was expected to win all the time Balukas later said that leaving the sport was a combination of many things including stress fatigue frustration and anger at the professional pool industry She said You know youre going to fine me Well see you later That was my excuse to finally say I need a break

New York State Route 308 is a short road in Dutchess County New York The highway is convert619mikm long It goes through mostly rural areas and is usually used as a shortcut from US Route 9 to New York State Route 9G The road passes several landmarks along its path The road began its history in about 1685 when a group of Native Americans built the Sepasco Trail This trail went from the Hudson River to Lake Sepasco and followed the same path that currently exists as Route 308 The trail was there until 1802 when part of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike was built over it Route 308 was officially formed in 1930

Part of NY 308 is in the Rhinebeck Village Historic District which is a convert1670acreha area that has 272 historical buildings It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 A well known attraction is the Beekman Arms Inn which is located at the corner of NY 308 and US 9 The inn was started in 1776 and says it is one of the oldest inns within the United States

The road begins at US 9 in the village of Rhinebeck which is convert200ftm above sea level To the south of here is a park a small lake and a cemetery At this point the Dutchess County Fairgrounds are north of Route 308 The highway goes to the east and is called East Market Street It soon leaves Rhinebeck while it runs next to a small creek sometimes known as the Landsman Kill 

The road intersects with County Route 101 and then turns to the north It also intersects with Route 9G before it turns to the east into a rural area In this area Route 308 carries about 6400 vehicles each day There are many small lakes around the road as it intersects with County Route 52 and turns to the northeast NY 308 then travels west of Sepasco Lake before turning east again It ends at NY 199 in the town of Milan

The earliest people that lived in northern Dutchess County were the Mohicans They were a Native American nation that came to the area about 3000 years ago There were around 8000 Mohicans during the time they first saw the Europeans However there were only 800 after the American Revolution Artifacts were found along the shore of Lake Sepasco which is a small lake near NY 308 The artifacts included very old arrowheads and are now being shown at a local museum 

A smaller group of these Native Americans were known as the Sepasco Indians This name was used for Native Americans in the Sepasco area which is now known as Rhinebeck The word Sepasco probably came from the tribes word for little river or stream which is sepuus After the Civil War only a few of the Sepasco were left The last Sepasco Indian died in 1867 in a hut near Lake Sepasco By 1685 a trail known as the Sepasco Trail was formed by the Sepasco people This trail started at the Hudson River and went east through the village of Rhinebeck It ended at Lake Sepasco Part of the trail from Rhinebeck to Lake Sepasco follows about the same path that is today taken by Route 308 

The trail was there until 1802 when a turnpike a type of road was built over it for improving and making a road from the west line of the Town of Salisbury in the State of Connecticut to the Susquehannahsic River at or near the Town of Jericho The part of the new turnpike east of the Hudson River was sometimes known as the Ulster and Salisbury Turnpike A plaque or a type of sign was made in November 1922 at the Beekman Arms Inn The sign marked the crossing of the Kings Highway and the Ulster and Salisbury Turnpike 

NY 308 itself was officially made during 1930 The path of the road was changed a bit in the 1960s

Grand Central Terminal often popularly called Grand Central Station or simply Grand Central is a terminal station at 42nd Street and Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan in New York City Built by and named for the New York Central Railroad in the heyday of American long distance passenger trains it is the largest train station in the world by number of railway platforms 44 with 67 tracks along them They are on two levels both below ground with 41 tracks on the upper level and 26 on the lower When the Long Island Rail Roads new station below the existing levels opens Grand Central will offer a total of 75 tracks and 48 platforms The terminal covers an area of 48 acres

The terminal serves commuters traveling on the Metro North Railroad to Westchester County New York Putnam County New York and Dutchess County New York in New York State and Fairfield County Connecticut and New Haven County Connecticut in the state of Connecticut

Although the terminal has been properly called Grand Central Terminal since 1913 many people continue to refer to it as Grand Central Station Technically Grand Central Station is the name of the nearby post office as well as the name of a previous rail station on the site and is also used to refer to a New York City subway station at the same location

Samuel P Taylor State Park is a state park located in Marin County California It contains approximately convert2700acrekm2 of redwood and grassland The park contains about convert600acrekm2 of old growth forest some of which can be seen along the Pioneer Tree Trail

Pedernales is a Dominican city and the head municipality of the Pedernales province in the southwest of the country near the border with Haiti

The name of Pedernales was given to the town when it was founded because that was the name of the river that now is the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic

Pedernales or silex is the name of a hard mineral that is common in the region

Before the conquest of the island by European people some native groups lived around the place where the city of Pedernales is now But soon those groups disappeared and very few people came to live here because it is a very dry region

When the French colony of Saint Domingue was created the River Pedernales was the southern border between that colony and the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo During those colonial times some soldiers came here for some time but almost nobody lived here for a long time

In 1927 the Dominican government brought farmers from other places of the country and made a town for them the new town was given the name of Pedernales and its first administrator was Scrates Nolasco who later became a well known writer

The city became in 1938 a municipal district of Enriquillo province of Barahona

When the Pedernales province was created in 1957 the city of Pedernales became the head municipality of the new province

The only rivers in the municipality and in the province are the Pedernales and its tributary Mulito

Sierra de Bahoruco is in the northern half of the municipality its highest mountain and the highest mountain of the province is Loma del Toro in the limits with the Independencia province

The municipality has a total area of 127467 km It has two municipal districts Jos Francisco Pea Gmez and Juancho

The municipality of Pedernales has the Independencia Province to the north the Barahona Province to the east the municipality of Oviedo to the southeast the Caribbean Sea to the south and Haiti to the west The city is at about half kilometre from the border with Haiti

Because Pedernales is on the border the trade with Haiti is important But the main economic activity is farming mainly on the mountains where coffee and beans are important products Potato cabbage and other vegetables are produced in the Sierra de Bahoruco

Fishing is also an important activity in the province mainly close to the Beata Island where lobster conch and several kind of fishes are caught

Tourism is becoming an important economic activity because there are several beautiful beaches with white sand like Cabo Rojo and Baha de las guilas There are two of the largest national parks of the country the Jaragua National Park and the Sierra de Bahoruco National Park

Mining of limestone to send to other countries and for a cement factory is another important economic activity in the municipality

Descriptive statistics is a branch of statistics Its aim is to summarize a set of statistical data The data are usually taken by sampling a population This means that the different items of data will be grouped and the groups will be described in some way That way a set of measurements can be described by giving a probability distribution the center of the values and the spread Another way might be to give a histogram A histogram shows how often certain values occur

Statistical inference is a branch of statistics that wants to use inference and random sampling to predict an unknown aspect of a population It is different from descriptive statistics 

Two schools of statistical inference are frequency probability and Bayesian inference

Gallups List of Widely Admired People is a poll of United States citizens to tell the names of the individuals whom they most admire It is a list made every year by The Gallup Organization In December 1999 they produced a list of 18 people from the 20th century who are most admired

The Flynn effect is the name given to a observed rise in average IQ scores since the beginning of measurements The observed rise in most industrialized countries is about three IQ points per decade In the year 1984 James R Flynn described this phenomenon which is named after him Other scientists verified the claims They found that the rise was mostly due to the test scores of those who scored an IQ below 100 The number of those who were classified as mentally handicapped diminished from year to year In contrast the test scores of those who scored more than 100 did not seem to be affected

IQ tests are re normalized periodically to hold the average score for an age group at 100 This normalization gave a first indication to Flynn that the IQ was changing over time The revised versions are standardized on new samples and scored with respect to those samples only The only way to compare the difficulty of two versions is to have a group of people take both tests This confirms IQ gains over time

The average rate of rise seems to be around three IQ points per decade Today children go to school for a longer time They have also become more familiar with testing It might therefore be expected that the biggest gains occur with school related content such as vocabulary arithmetic or general information Just the opposite is the case abilities such as these have experienced relatively small gains and even occasional declines over the years The largest changes attributed to the Flynn effect appear on general intelligence factor loaded tests such as Ravens Progressive Matrices instead For example Dutch soldiers gained 21 points in only 30 years or 7 points per decade between 1952 and 1982

Some studies focused on the distribution of scores have found that the Flynn effect mainly occurs with lower scores Teasdale and Owen for example found the effect primarily reduced the number of low end scores resulting in an increased number of moderately high scores with no increase in very high scores However Raven found that a lot of data must be re interpreted with respect to the date of birth Previously this data had been interpreted to show that many abilities decrease when people get older This data must now be interpreted to show that many abilities had in fact increased dramatically as Flynn predicted On many tests this occurs at all levels of ability Two large samples of Spanish children were assessed with a 30 year gap Comparison of the IQ distributions indicated that 

Some scientists believe these changes are very big One of them is Ulric Neisser In 1995 he was the head of a task force of the American Psychological Association charged with writing a statement on where intelligence research was He estimates that if American children of 1932 could take an IQ test normed in 1997 their average IQ would have been only about 80 In other words half of the children in 1932 would be classified as having borderline mental retardation or worse in 1997 Looking at Ravens Neisser estimates that if you extrapolate beyond the data which shows a 21 point gain between 1952 and 1982 an even larger gain of 35 IQ points can be argued Arthur Jensen warns that extrapolating beyond the data leads to results such as an IQ of 1000 for Aristotle

Most of the time the effect is associated with IQ rises A similar effect has been found with increases in semantic and episodic memory

William Franklin Graham Jr better known as Billy Graham is an Evangelical Christian minister and evangelist He is a member of the Southern Baptist Convention He has been a spiritual advisor to several US presidents Graham has preached in person to more people than anyone else who has ever lived Until 2002 Grahams lifetime audience with radio and television broadcasts was more than two billion people Graham has met every United States President since Harry Truman He has received many honors including the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom

Billy Graham has preached Christianity to nearly 215 million people in more than 185 countries and territories Graham has also preached to hundreds of millions more through television videos movie and webcasts He has been to over 41 evangelistic crusades since 1948 He began this ministry in 1947 and kept doing it until recently He would often use a big area such as a stadium park or a large street to speak at Groups of up to 5000 people would often sing in choir at his meetings Graham would preach the gospel and then invite people to come forward In 1992 one quarter of the 155000 in his Moscow audience came for Salvation upon his request

In politics Graham was a member of the Democratic Party but changed to Republican during the presidency of his friend Richard Nixon He is no party member because he says that Jesus did not have a political party Though he does not support people running on politics in general he has given his support in some cases over the years

Graham has met every United States President since Harry Truman He became close friends with Vice President Richard Nixon while on a golf course Dwight D Eisenhower asked to see Graham while on his deathbed Graham also worked with Lyndon B Johnson Gerald Ford Jimmy Carter Ronald Reagan Bill Clinton and the Bush family

Straight pool also called 141 continuous or simply 141 is a pocket billiards game It was the common sport of championship competition until faster playing games like nine ball and to a lesser extent eight ball became more popular This is the classic game from the history of pool The game was especially popular in the United States and was the subject of the classic 1961 film The Hustler

In straight pool the person shooting may attempt to pocket any ball on the table The aim of the game is to reach a set number of points The amount of points needed to win is agreed to before the game One point is scored for each ball pocketed legally A typical game might require a player to score 100 points This means that at least 100 balls must be pocketed to win In professional competition straight pool is usually played to 150 points Straight pool is a call pocket game This means that the player must call what pocket they mean to sink the ball into on every shot It does not matter how balls reach the pocket As long as no foul is involved and the balls goes into the pocket that is called a point is scored

Straight pool is well known in the United States Europe Japan and the Philippines but the game has become more obscure elsewhere Probably the all time greatest player Willie Mosconi holds the games record high run Here is what he saidcquoteOn March 19 in Springfield Ohio I ran 526 balls a record that still stands I was playing a two hundred point match against an amateur by the name of Earl Bruney in the East High Billiard Club He made three balls off the break then I ran two hundred and just kept going The run took two hours and ten minutes which means that over the span I averaged four balls a minute I finally missed a difficult cut shot but by that time I was weary it was almost a relief to have it come to an end There were about three hundred people in the audience and one of them was an attorney who prepared an affidavit attesting to the validity of my claim to a new record A few days later the BCA gave its stamp of approval

In the first rack in straight pool the fifteen object balls are racked in a triangular frame usually made from aluminum wooden or plastic The center of the ball at the top of the rack is placed over the a spot on the table called the foot spot Traditionally the 1 ball is placed at the racks right corner and the 5 ball is placed at the racks left corner Other balls are placed randomly All the balls must touch their neighbors However it is considered a courtesy by some players to place a striped ball at the front of the rack This is because the break is very important and it is believed that a striped ball is easier to hit very precisely

In most pool games pocketing a ball and spreading the balls is the aim on the break Straight pool is different In it the goal on the first break shot is to leave the opponent with a safety A safety means a situation where they opponent has no good shot The reason for this is because the call pocket rulethe rule discussed earlier requiring the player to call the ball they intend to pocketincludes the break shot For that reason if you break the balls hard and even if you pocket many balls you will not be able to go again unless you called one of those balls in a pocket and it goes into that pocket

Th perform a legal break either a ball must be pocketed in a called pocket or the cue ball and at least two additional colored balls must touch rails If you do not succeed at one of these two options the shot is a foul A foul on the first break results in a special penalty of a loss of 2 points In addition the opponent has the choice of either accepting the table as it was left or of having the balls re racked and requiring the person who fouled on the break to repeat it 

All other fouls during the game have a penalty of a one point deduction This includes fouling on an intragame rack However a third foul in a row at any time in a straight pool game results in a loss of 15 points When applying this rule a foul on the initial break though it is a loss of two points is not counted as two fouls The 15 point deduction is in addition to the one point loss for each foul Thus the first two fouls are a loss of one point each and the third foul in a row is a loss of 16 points 1 point for the foul and 15 points for it being the third foul in a row

Intragame racks refers to all racks after the first rack As noted previously straight pool is played to a specific number of points normally far more than the 15 total points that can be made in the first rack For this reason multiple intragame racks are necessary Intragame racking employs a separate set of rules from those in place at the games start on the first rack

To reach the point in time when an intragame rack is needed the balls are played until only the cue ball and only one object ball remain on the tables surface At that time if neither the cue ball or the fifteenth object ball remains in the rack area the fourteen pocketed object balls are racked with no ball placed at the top of the rack and the rack is placed so that if the top ball were in the rack its center would be placed over the tables foot spot Play then continues with the cue ball shot from where it rested and the fifteenth non racked object ball from where it rested prior to racking 

The name 141 continuous is named after this racking method That is that fourteen racked object balls and one separate colored ball are left at the end of each intragame rack The shooter will then normally try to pocket the unracked fifteenth colored ball and at the same time have the cue ball smash into the fourteen racked balls spreading them so that later shots are available and the player continue at the table

A number of rules detail what must be done when one or both of the cue ball and fifteenth object ball are either in the rack area at the time an intragame rack is neeeded or are so close to the intragame racking area that the racking of the 14 balls cannot be done without moving one of them The rules also vary depending on whether the cue ball or fifteenth object ball are resting on the tables head spot These rules are shown on the following chart Note that in the chart the use of the word kitchen refers to the area behind the tables head string

The General intelligence factor often shortened to g is a construct from psychology The idea is that there is a common factor in intelligence tests Simply speaking this can then be called intelligence 

Charles Spearman an early psychometrician found that schoolchildrens grades across unrelated subjects were positively correlated He then proposed that these correlations reflected the influence of a dominant factor which he called g for general intelligence He developed a model where all variation in intelligence test scores can be explained by two factors The first is the factor specific to an individual mental task the individual abilities that would make a person more skilled at one cognitive task than another The second is g a general factor that governs performance on all cognitive tasks

The accumulation of cognitive testing data and improvements in analytical techniques have preserved gs central role and led to the modern conception of g A hierarchy of factors with g at its apex and group factors at successively lower levels is espoused to be the most widely accepted model of cognitive ability Other models have also been proposed and significant controversy attends g and its alternatives

Humanitarianism is a way of behaving out of kindness to other people Someone who is a humanitarian is a person who helps to improve the lives of other people without thinking about their race belief or nationality

Humanitarianism is not the same thing as Humanism which is about not believing in a god 

A good example of Humanitarianism is the well known story from the New Testament in the Bible about the Good Samaritan who goes to help the poor man who has been robbed

Humanitarianism also means basic morality indispensable for human being And there are international laws called international humanitarian law considered to created out of humanitarianism of this mean Among them Geneva Conventions on the matter made at the time of wars are well known

The show was first hosted by radio and television personality Garry Moore After several months of an panel that kept changing the show settled down to include game show host Bill Cullen comedian Henry Morgan TV hostess Faye Emerson and actress Jayne Meadows In 1958 Emerson left the show to star in a play and was replaced by actress Betsy Palmer The following year Meadows moved to the West Coast to live with her husband Steve Allen and was replaced by former Miss America Bess Myerson Sometimes guest hosts substituted for Moore including panelists Morgan and Palmer Also other comedians and celebrities guested for the panel when they were away

Garry Moore left the show after the 1963 64 season after his comedy program The Garry Moore Show was canceled and he decided to retire from television to travel around the world with his wife Moore was replaced by Steve Allen on September 21 1964 Allen also hosted the show during the 1972 1973 revival Former panelist Bill Cullen hosted the show for its short 1976 CBS summer run The panelists on this revival were Richard Dawson Henry Morgan New York based entertainment critic Pat Collins and Elaine Joyce

The Oxygen channel version of the show was hosted by Stephanie Miller until August 2001 Panelists in the Oxygen version included Jim J Bullock Jason Kravits Amy Yasbeck and Teri Garr The GSN version was hosted by Bil Dwyer the panelists were Billy Bean Frank DeCaro Jermaine Taylor and Suzanne Westenhoefer

Each episode usually had two contestants After that a celebrity guest played Once in a while if there was extra time the celebrity was followed by a third regular guest

Each round was a guessing game The panel tried to figure out the contestants secrets The idea of a secret on the show was very broad Secrets were always intended to be unusual amazing embarrassing or broken wikt linkhumoroushumorous They often were about what happened to a person owning something or a job hobby success or skill

One or more broken wikt linkcontestantcontestants would walk on The host would tell the name the contestant or ask their name and where they were from He would then ask them to whisper your secret to me and well show it to the folks at home The contestant would then whisper their secret to the host while the audience and television viewers were shown the secret by writing printed on the television screen Then the host would give the panel a clue For example the secret concerns something that happened to Contestants Name The host would then choose a panelist to begin asking questions

When the show first started each panelist had 15 seconds of questioning of a guest Then this would repeat once Each 15 seconds that passed without the secret being correctly guessed won the contestant 10 However a guest could not win more than 80 In mid 1954 they changed to only one question period for each panelist They changed the money to 20 so that the top prize would stay at 80 Also the time limit for questions was no longer exact Instead a broken wikt linkbuzzerbuzzer went off to end the questioning and production staff decided when to use the buzzer This was partly because the program was shown live and this sometimes required the show to be longer or shorter to keep the show running on time In later times the panelists were sometimes buzzed when they were too close to the secret or at a point that would get a laugh

Following the guests secret being discovered the host sometimes asked the contestant more about their secret or if it made sense the contestant demonstrated their secret These demonstrations sometimes included the host and sometimes one or more of the panelists

A number of famous people appeared with secrets including Col Harland Sanders who founded Kentucky Fried Chicken Philo T Farnsworth Pete Best and an elderly man Samuel Seymour who was the last surviving eyewitness to Abraham Lincolns assassination

On each usual episode a celebrity guest came on the show with a secret The celebrity usually started the episode by coming out from the behind the curtain and saying my name is Name and Ive Got a Secret Sometimes though the celebrity would say and this is Ive Got a Secret In the beginning the celebrities would have a secret The secrets would sometimes be personal secrets similar to the other contestants Other times the secret would be about something they were there to do The guest part of the show often was really a was to show some new technology or product

Later in the show a common thing was for the celebrity to challenge the panel in some other game This later became the main use of the celebrity part of the show and they no longer pretended to have a secret Instead the celebrity would just come out with a challenge for the panel Several of these challenges later were the main idea used for other game shows For example a game in which Woody Allen challenged the panel to guess words by what children had said they meant which became the basis for Childs Play Or two challenges with Peter Falk and Soupy Sales in which the panel had to guess who a celebrity was after being show a photographs of them as a baby and others as the aged which later was used for the show Face the Music

Ive Got a Secret was more informal than its sister show Whats My Line The panel and host used each others first names As noted the time limit on questioning was removed early in the show and time limits were set more for entertainment The men on the panel always wore normal suits or even sport jackets though both Morgan and Moore sometimes chose bow ties over straight ties Until the later years of the series both Moore and members of the panel smoked cigarettes on the air The panel was introduced at the start of each episode by the host usually with a pun on their names

Only yes or no questions were supposed to be asked by the panel but this was often relaxed Unlike on Whats My Line the host offered hints and suggestions when the panel was quite lost or when an answer might make them lost Like on Whats My Line the panelists were not allowed to try to figure out secrets together but later in the series no one bothered the panelists when they whispered ideas to each other

The series began in black and white and only in 1966 switched to color When the show is seen in reruns though even episodes which were in color are in black and white as they did not record the color Much of the series had a commercial sponsor The opening of the show would have an advertisement for that company Signs on the set also promoted the products and on commercial breaks the product would be advertised Some sponsors provided samples of their products which were given to each contestant Late in the series sponsorship was stopped

An Australian version of the show was produced and aired in Brisbane on QTQ Channel 9 from 1967 until 1973 It was hosted by Newsreader Don Secombe Similar to the American version it had regular celebrity panelists including Ron Cadee Babette Stevens and Joy Chambers

The format of the 1970s revivals were very similar to the original series However celebrity secrets were back as opposed to challenges

On the Oxygen revival the contestant earned 200 and if no one on the panel guessed they earned a 1000 prize Stephanie Miller hosted this version The shows set was made to look like a fancy city apartment

On GSNs revival each panelist had 40 seconds for questioning with one conference allowed Stumping the entire panel won the contestant 1000 and dinner for 2 in Beverly Hills The fine print at the end of the show disclosed that contestants were also paid an appearance fee Losing contestants also received some unspecified parting gifts Several minor show business professionals demonstrated their performances on the show including piano juggler Dan Menendez Another element in the revival was that all the panelists were openly gay This was played upon as host Bill Dwyer was introduced as the straight man to the panel

As with Whats My Line early episodes from the original series first season in 1952 appear to have been lost From late 1952 until the 1967 cancellation most episodes appear to exist as a digital transfer of the original black and white kinescope films

GSN concluded its most recent airing of Ive Got A Secrets run on July 13 2008 at 330 AM paired with Whats My Line at 300 However they began their run in mid 2007 with episodes from late 1961 or early 1962 A good portion of the series is unlikely to be aired due to the shows longtime sponsorship by Winston cigarettes which remains an existing brand It is unclear whether this is mandated legally or simply a choice by GSN In addition the network skipped several episodes through its run which are known to have been skipped in previous runs of the show this may mean that other episodes are lost or in bad enough condition for GSN not to air them

All subsequent revivals of Secret exist in their entirety GSN has occasionally aired single episodes from the 1972 1973 season the latest being an episode featuring Bob Barker as the celebrity guest to commemorate his retirement from The Price Is Right in mid 2007 GSN also occasionally adds reruns of its 2006 revival to the regular schedule

The first theme music used on the show from 1952 1961 was Plink Plank Plunk by Leroy Anderson

The second theme used from 1961 1962 was an upbeat arrangement of the Theme to A Summer Place by Max Steiner

The third theme was used from 1962 1967 It was an upbeat spritely march featuring piccolo and xylophone composed by the shows musical director Norman Paris and played by a live studio combo It quoted a familiar melody widely associated with schoolyard taunts to which the words Ive got a secret might be sung by children in a teasing manner

In addition to being used as a tag for his entrance on CBS episodes he hosted Steve Allens composition This Could Be the Start of Something was used as the opening theme in 1972 The closing theme to the 1972 version was written by Edd Kalehoff The theme from the 1976 version with Bill Cullen was used one year later on the ABC game show Second Chance A remix of that theme was also used in the Australian version of Family Feud

Tim Mosher and Stoker are credited with the 2000 theme while Alan Ett and Scott Liggett contributed an up jazz theme for Bil Dwyers 2006 version of the show for GSN

Carrow Road is a British football stadium in Norwich England It is the home of Norwich City Football Club The stadium is located in the centre of the city near to Norwich railway station and the River Wensum The stadium is located on Carrow Road and is named after the road The stadium was built by Norwich City in 1935 Construction took just 82 days There has been a lot of work done to Carrow Road since 1935 Since 1990 the stadium has been an all seater The ground can accommodate 26034 today and the record attendance is presently 25522 The record attendance at Carrow Road before it became an all seater stadium was 43984 in 1963 The modern Carrow Road site has a club superstore catering facilities and a hotel

Norwich City FC played at Newmarket Road from 1902 to 1908 The record attendance at this time was 10366 in a match against Sheffield Wednesday in a second round FA Cup match in 1908 After a disagreement over the rent of the Newmarket Road ground Norwich City moved to a new home in 1908  a converted disused chalk pit in Rosary Road which became known as The Nest By the 1930s the ground was not big enough for the growing support Expansion of The Nest was not possible and there were safety problems with the existing structures The club began looking for another ground in 1926 Part of the pitch eventually collapsed The Football Association were not happy with Norwich Citys efforts to repair The Nest They eventually wrote to the club on 15 May 1935 saying The Nest was no longer suitable for large crowds and measures must be taken

With the new season just weeks away Norwich City were very concerned About half a mile south of The Nest they found a new site the home of the Boulton Paul Aircraft Sports Ground in Carrow Road On 1 June 1935 the club purchased the ground on a 20 year lease from its owners Colmans

The new stadium took its name from the street However the name Carrow originally referred to the former Carrow Abbey that once stood on the riverside Construction began quickly Ten days after buying the site work began

By 17 August most of the stands and terraces had been completed Finally after just 82 days on 31 August Carrow Road football ground was opened for the Second Division match v West Ham United

Norwich won the game 4 3 The attendance was 29779 at the time a new record crowd for Norwich home games The first competitive goal at the ground was scored by Norwichs Doug Lochhead

An aerial photograph from August 1935 shows three sides of open terracing and a covered stand with a Colmans Mustard advertisement painted on its roof visible only from the air The clubs association with Colmans has continued into the modern era in 1997 the club signed a shirt sponsorship deal with the company The mustard manufacturers original factory was located next to the stadium in Carrow Road and the ground was opened by Russell Colman the President of the club Inglis describes the early Carrow Road as comprising a Main Stand a covered end terrace and two large open banks The covered terrace was paid for by Captain Evelyn Barclay the vice president of Norwich City It was constructed in time for the opening of the 1937 38 season There is a stand named after Barclay in the modern stadium

At this time the grounds capacity was 38000 The new ground received a royal seal of approval on 29 October 1938 King George VI watched the home game versus Millwall This was the first time a ruling monarch had watched a Second Division match

Floodlights were erected at the ground in 1956 and the 9000 cost nearly sent the club into bankruptcy However Norwichs success in the 1959 FA Cup secured the financial status of the club and provided sufficient funds for a cover to be built over the South Stand In 1963 the record was set for attendance for Carrow Road a crowd of 43984 watched a sixth round FA Cup match against Leicester City and the South Stand was covered soon after

After a disaster at Glasgow Rangers Ground Ibrox in 1971 ground capacities had to be reduced to around 20000 people 

A two tier terrace was built at the River End Soon afterwards seats began to replace the terraces By 1979 the stadium had a capacity of 28392 with seats for 12675 A fire in 1984 partially destroyed one of the stands The damaged stand was eventually demolished completely In 1987 it was replaced by a new City Stand Chairman Robert Chase said that Coming to a football match within the City Stand is very much like going to the theatre the only difference being that our stage is covered with grass

After a disaster at Sheffield Wednesdays ground Hillsborough in 1989 and afterwards the outcome of the Taylor Report in 1990 the stadium was converted to all seater with the corners being filled Today Carrow Road is an all seater stadium with a capacity of 26034 with a record attendance for an all seated crowd of 25522 for the Premiership match against Manchester United in April 2005

The South Stand was replaced in 2003 when a new 7000 seat South stand subsequently renamed the Jarrold Stand was built in its place The club installed new electronic screenscoreboards at either end of the stadium in 2007 Located behind the goals they are full colour with scope for still and moving images They were first used in the 5 2 Carling Cup victory over Barnet FC in August 2007

The current stadium consists of four stands the Barclay the Norwich and Peterborough Stand the Geoffrey Watling City Stand and the most recent addition the Jarrold Stand

The previous River End stand was demolished in April 1979 A two tiered replacement costing 17m was completed in December 1979 Its name was changed to the Norwich Peterborough Stand in the 1990s due to a sponsorship deal with the Norwich Peterborough building society

This stand is named after Captain Evelyn Barclay a former vice president of the club who donated the roof costs for the original stand The Barclay is often incorrectly referred to as the Barclay Stand

The original Barclay was built in 1937 and demolished in 1992Citation neededdateJuly 2009 when a new two tier structure modelled on the River End was built at a cost of 28mCitation neededdateJuly 2009Citation neededdateJuly 2009

Floodlights are supported on both corners of the The Barclay and the Norwich Peterborough stands which are the ends behind the goals

The single tiered Geoffrey Watling City Stand was built following a severe fire on 25 October 1984 The fire was apparently caused by an employee of the club leaving a three bar electric fire switched on overnight The City Stand cost 17 million to build and was used for the first time on 30 August 1986 when City hosted Southampton It was formally opened by the Duchess of Kent on 14 February 1987 The stand was renamed in honour of Norwich City president Geoffrey Watling who died in 2004

The stand is the smallest of the four in terms of capacity but includes the Directors Box Press Area and various other hospitality suites

Where The Barclay extends around to meet the Geoffrey Watling City Stand is the Thorpe Corner infill affectionately dubbed The Snakepit by supporters a term that is even sometimes used in official club reportsCitation neededdateJuly 2009

The Jarrold Stand is on the former site of the South Stand which was named in honour of Sir Arthur South

The Jarrold Stand was partially opened for the game against Sheffield United on 31 January 2004 and fully opened for the next home match against West Ham United on 21 February 2004 This was a landmark for the stadium  it represented the final stand of the original ground to be replaced

The Jarrold Stand is sponsored by Jarrolds a local department store The original 4 year sponsorship deal has now been extended through to 2013 The stand is a cantilever single tiered all seated stand that can hold up to 8000 supporters The Jarrold Stand is unusual in having not one but three separate television gantries suspended beneath its largely perspex roof

In 2005 further work was undertaken on the stand and it reopened in 2006 The stand now extends around the Norwich and Peterborough Stand corner of the ground

Accommodation for visiting supporters is provided in the end of the Jarrold Stand closest to The Barclay 

The corner infill between the Jarrold and Norwich Peterborough stands is called the Aviva Community Stand which was originally built in 2005 and named after sponsors Norwich Union It seats up to 1500 fans and also provides extensive facilities for disabled supporters

The club had two options on how to fill the corner between the The Barclay and the Jarrold Stand The club decided not to fill this corner with seats as this would lead to away supporters being surrounded by home fans

It was therefore decided to complete the grounds corners with a hotel It was hoped that a hotel could offer greater financial rewards than ticket salesCitation neededdateJuly 2009 In 2005 a contract was signed with the Holiday Inn hotel chain in 2005 and construction commenced in 2006 The hotel opened in 2007 and allows customers with pitch facing rooms to watch matchesCitation neededdateJuly 2009

The club have in the past stated that they have plans to increase the capacity of the stadium should the club win promotion back to the Premier League using the increase in funds to finance the expansionCitation neededdateAugust 2009 Specifically these plans include building a second tier on the Jarrold Stand or the Geoffrey Watling City Stand The club have stated that the Geoffrey Watling stand has foundations designed to support a second tier and that the roof can be removed and replaced after a second tier is added At the time the original stand was built the inner ring road ran next to the ground and any extensions of an upper tier outside the existing footprint of the stand would have caused planning difficulties Since the road was re routed in the late 1990s an extension to the stand is less likely to raise planning objectionsCitation neededdateOctober 2009

Der Rosenkavalier is a comic opera by Richard Strauss The words were especially written for the opera by the German poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal

It was first performed in Dresden on 26 January 1911 and was an immediate success It continues to be a very popular opera in opera houses all over the world and has been performed more often than any other German language 20th century opera

The story is supposed to be happening in Vienna in the time of the Empress Maria Theresa The music and the words deliberately show the elegant life of aristocratic society of that time For example the title of the opera is about the silver rose which traditionally was sent by a bridegroom to his bride and was brought by a knight

Act I takes place in the Marschallins bedroom The Marschallin is an aristocratic lady aged 32 She has a lover a young boy aged 17 called Octavian  When the opera starts we first hear an orchestral prologue The music suggests that the Marschallin and Octavian are making love Then the curtain opens and we see the two together They hear a noise and the Marschallin thinks her husband is coming so Octavian hides It is not her husband but her cousin Baron Ochs Ochs is a very rude man with bad manners He marches in to the Marschallins room although the servants had asked him to wait Octavian manages to change his clothes and appears dressed as a maid called Mariandel Ochs thinks she is pretty and wants her to meet him Then he tells the Marschallin what he has come for he wants a young knight to deliver the silver rose to his bride Sophie He also needs a notary to sign the legal documents of the wedding Ochs sings about the fun of making love He wishes he were like Jupiter who was able to disguise himself in many ways

The morning leve begins This means the ceremony of the Marschallin getting up Several people come in They include an Italian tenor who sings an aria two Italian people called Valzacchi and Annina who are always spreading gossip and a notary When the notary tells Ochs that he needs to pay a dowry to his bride not the other way round Ochs is very angry

When the Marschallin is left alone she sings a song about how she is losing her youthful looks Octavian returns and cheers her up a bit but she feels sad when he says goodbye very politely and formally not even kissing her The Marschallin sends her little black pageboy to run after him with the silver rose

The story continues in the large room of the house of Herr von Faninal the father of Sophie whom Ochs wants to marry Sophie is waiting for the silver rose to arrive Octavian enters and gives her the rose The music at this moment is very beautiful and very famous The people in the room are talking then Baron Ochs enters rudely Sophie is shocked about his bad manners Ochs hums his favourite waltz then goes to the next room to sign a marriage contract Sophie sinks into Octavians arms When Ochs comes back Octavian tells him Sophie does not want him but Ochs will not listen Eventually Ochs takes his sword and starts to fight Octavian who wounds Ochs slightly Ochs is furious but calms down a little after he is given some wine

Octavian has fallen in love with Sophie and Sophie with him He wants to use Valzacchi and Annina to help him with a plan He writes a note to Ochs which is supposed to be from the maid Mariandel asking him to meet her He gets Annina to take the note to Ochs who is delighted when he reads it He sings his favourite waltz

The scene is an inn near Vienna Valzacchi and Annina now work both for Octavian and for Ochs They prefer working for Octavian because he pays them more money They are planning tricks on Ochs 

Ochs meets Mariandel He tries to get her drunk but she shyly sings Nein nein i trink kein Wein Ochs thinks she looks like Octavian Then strange figures of people appear at a window Then Annina comes in and says she is Ochss wife whom he has deserted Then some children come in and say that Ochs is their father Ochs is very embarrassed when Faninal comes in and says Mariandel is his fiance He tells the people he has never seen Faninal before Then the Marschallin appears and also the police The evening is a disaster for Ochs The Marschallin tells the police it is just a joke She sends Ochs away

The Marschallin Sophie and Octavian sing a beautiful trio Octavian is forgiven He is left alone with Sophie and they sing a duet together then go off hand in hand She has left a handkerchief on the floor The little black pageboy picks it up and runs after them

The language used by Hofmannsthal changes according to who is speaking The members of the nobility speak in very elegant language which is often old fashioned and always very polite When good friends speak to one another they often use the familiar For example Octavian and the Marschallin often use the familiar you but sometimes use when they are being more formal

Baron Ochs is always showing off and the words he uses show this When Octavian pretends to be the maid Mariandel he speaks in an Austrian dialect Valzacchi and Annina also speak in a dialect but their German is not perfect and often mixed with Italian 

All this makes it particularly difficult to sing the opera in any other language

It is believed that the name butterfly originated from a member of this family the Brimstone Gonepteryx rhamni It was called the butter coloured fly by early British naturalists 

The sexes are usually different often in the pattern or number of black markings

The caterpillars of a few of these species such as Pieris brassicae and Pieris rapae feed on brassicas They are commonly seen in gardens and are agricultural pests

Males of many species feed on salts from moist soil They do this in groups This behavior is known as mud puddling or puddling

The Pieridae have the radial vein on the forewing with 3 or 4 branches and rarely with 5 branches The fore legs are well developed in both sexes The tarsal claws are bifid

Like the Papilionidae Pieridae also have their chrysalids held at an angle by a silk girdle The girdle runs around the first abdominal segment unlike the thoracic girdle seen in the Papilionidae

The Pieridae are divided into the following four subfamilies

The Peterloo Massacre happened at St Peters Field Manchester England on 16 August 1819 It was when cavalry charged into a crowd of 60000 to 80000 gathered at a meeting to demand the reform of parliamentary representation

The end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had resulted in a time of famine and chronic unemployment This was exacerbated by the introduction of the first of the Corn Laws By the beginning of 1819 the pressure generated by poor economic conditions and the lack of suffrage in northern England had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism In response the Manchester Patriotic Union organised a demonstration to be addressed by the radical orator Henry Hunt The Manchester Patriotic Uniona was group agitating for parliamentary reform

Shortly after the meeting began local magistrates called on the military authorities to arrest Henry Hunt and several others with him and to broken wikt linkdispersedisperse the men Cavalry charged into the crowd with sabres drawn In the resulting confusion 15 people were killed and 400 to 700 were injured The massacre was given the name Peterloo in ironic comparison to the Battle of Waterloo which had taken place four years earlier

The rotifers are a phylum of tiny animals which are common in freshwater environments such as ponds and puddles Some rotifers are free swimming others move by inching along and some are fixed A few species live in colonies 

Rotifers were first described when early microscopes became available around 1700AD They are an important part of the freshwater zooplankton Also many species help decompose organic matter in soil Rotifers eat fish waste dead bacteria and algae They eat particles up to 10 micrometres in size A rotifer filters 100000 times its own volume of water per hour They are used in fish tanks to help clean the water to prevent clouds of waste matter

About 2200 species of rotifers have been described They are placed in the phylum Rotifera This phylum is subdivided into three classes Monogononta Bdelloidea and Seisonidea The largest group is the Monogononta with about 1500 species followed by the Bdelloidea with about 350 species There are only two known species of Seisonidea

Fossils of the species Habrotrocha angusticollis have been found in 6000 year old Pleistocene peat deposits The oldest known fossil rotifers have been found in Eocene Dominican amber

The front has a ring of cilia circling the mouth This gave the rotifers their old name of wheel animalules There is a protective lorica round its body and a foot Inside the lorica are the usual organs in miniturised form a brain an eye spot jaws stomach kidneys urinary bladder

Rotifers have a number of unusual features Biologists suppose that these peculiarities are adaptations to their small size and the transient nature of its habitats

Rotifers are specialists at living in habitats where water dries up regularly 

The Monogononta which have males produce fertilised resting eggs which can resist desiccation for long periods 

The Bdelloids who have no males contract into an inert form and lose almost all body water a process known as cryptobiosis Bdelloids can also survive the dry state for long periods the longest well documented dormancy is nine years After they have dried they may be revived by adding water In this and several other ways they are a unique group of animals

Rotifers are hatched with a standard number of cell nuclei exactly the same number for every rotifer in a species This is called eutely No cell division whatsoever takes place during adult life Not only that but the number of nuclei in each tissue is constant Furthermore most of the nuclei do not have cell walls rotifer tissue is largely or wholly a syncytium

The absence of cell division is probably one reason they are extraordinarily resistant to ionising radiation Also repairing DNA is one of the things they are known do after desiccation

In one of the classes the freshwater Bdelloid rotifers no males have ever been seen It is the largest group of wholly parthenogenetic species in the Animalia 

The females in this group produce eggs by parthenogenesis In some species these eggs develop into small juveniles before they are released from their parent The offspring are clones of their mother 

Cytological and molecular genetic studies have provided evidence that bdelloids evolved from a common ancestor which lost sexual recombination about 100 million years ago Research has also been done on the implications of parthenogenesis for speciation

Bdelloid rotifer genomes contain two or more divergent copies of each gene suggesting a long term asexual evolutionary history For example there are four copies of gene hsp82 Each is different and on a different chromosome This excludes the possibility of their origin by normal gene duplication which produces two or more near identical genes next to each other

There are genes in bdelloid rotifers that appear to have originated in bacteria fungi and plants This suggests they arrived by horizontal gene transfer The capture and use of exogenous genes may represent an important force in bdelloid evolution The team led by Matthew S Meselson at Harvard University has also shown that despite the lack of sexual reproduction bdelloid rotifers do engage in genetic transfer within a species or clade The method used is not known at present

The Acanthocephala a group of parasitic worms previously considered to be a separate phylum have been shown to be modified rotifers However the exact relationship to other members of the phylum has not yet been resolved

Contemporary architecture is generally speaking the architecture being made at the present time The term contemporary architecture is also applied to a range of styles of recently built structures and spaces which are optimized for current use

 Claus Philipp Maria Justinian Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg was a German army officer and Catholic aristocrat He was one of the leading members of the failed 20 July plot of 1944 to kill the German dictator Adolf Hitler and remove the Nazi Party from power in Nazi Germany Along with Henning von Tresckow and Hans Oster he was one of the central figures of the German Resistance movement within the Wehrmacht

The Fhrerbunker was under Hitlers New Reich Chancellery in Berlin Germany It was in this subterranean bunker where Adolf Hitler and his wife Eva Braun spent the last weeks of the war Both died there on April 30 1945 

The elaborate complex consisted of two separate levels the Vorbunker or forward bunker and the newer Fhrerbunker one level below They were both connected together by a stairway set at right angles The Fhrerbunker was about 82 meters beneath the garden of the old Reich Chancellery building at Wilhelmstrae 77 This is about 120 meters north of the new Reich Chancellery building which had the address Vostrae 6 The Vorbunker was under the large hall behind the old Reich Chancellery It was connected to the new Reich Chancellery The Fhrerbunker was somewhat lower than the Vorbunker and in the west of it The two bunkers were connected via sets of stairs set at right angles

The complex was protected by circa four meters of concrete and about 30 small rooms were distributed over two levels with exits into the main buildings and an emergency exit into the garden The complex was built in two distinct phases one part in 1936 and the other in 1943 The 1943 development was built by the Hochtief company as part of an extensive program of subterranean construction in Berlin that begun in 1940 The rooms of Hitler were in the newer lower section and by February 1945 had been appointed with high quality furniture taken from the Chancellery along with several framed oil paintings

Typhoon Tip was the biggest and strongest known tropical cyclone on record It was the 19th tropical storm and 12th typhoon of the 1979 Pacific typhoon season The typhoon formed out of a disturbance in a monsoon trough on October 4 near Pohnpei At first a tropical storm to the northwest prevented Tip from strengthening but after it moved further north the storm was able to gain more strength After passing near Guam it strengthened quickly and reached its highest winds of 305 kmh and a worldwide record low barometric pressure of 870 mbar on October 12 At its peak strength it was also the biggest tropical cyclone on record with a diameter of 2220 km Tip slowly weakened as it kept moving towards the west northwest and later turned to the northeast Tip made landfall on southern Japan on October 19 and became an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter

US Air Force Reconnaissance flew into the typhoon on 60 different times making Tip one of the most closely watched tropical cyclones Rainfall from the storm breached a wall that was used to stop flooding at a United States Marine Corps training camp in the Kanagawa Prefecture of Japan This eventually led to a fire which killed 13 Marines and hurt 68 Elsewhere in the country the typhoon caused lots of damage and 42 deaths and shipwrecks left another 44 killed or missing

Three low pressure areas formed the monsoon trough that extended from the Philippines to the Marshall Islands An area of disturbed weather to the southwest of Guam eventually strengthened into Tropical Storm Roger on October 3 Later on the same day the tropical system which would later become Typhoon Tip formed to the south of Pohnpei Because Roger was so close the storm that would become Tip was not able to strengthen much However it gradually organized as it moved towards the west The tropical disturbance moved slowly and broken wikt linkerraticallyerratically and slowly made a loop to the southeast of Chuuk A Reconnaissance Aircraft flight into the system late on October 4 confirmed the existence of a circulation center A bit later on October 5 the Joint Typhoon Warning Center called the system Tropical Depression Twenty Three

The tropical depression broken wikt linkintensifyintensified into Tropical Storm Tip but it did not organize significantly due to Tropical Storm Roger being so close After moving slowly for many days Tip began a steady northwest path on October 8 By that time Tropical Storm Roger had become an extratropical cyclone At first the storm was expected to continue moving northwestward and hit Guam However early on October 9 it turned to the west passing about 45 km south of the island Later that day Tip reached typhoon strength

As a result of certain weather conditions Typhoon Tip quickly strengthened in the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean Late on October 10 the typhoon reached Category 4 strength on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale and the next day it became a super typhoon The central pressure dropped 92 mbar from October 9 to 11 During this time the typhoon became extremely large reaching a record diameter of 2220 km The typhoon continued to gain strength and early on October 12 Reconnaissance Aircraft recorded a worldwide record low pressure of 870 mbar The typhoon had winds of 305 kmh while located about 840 km west northwest of Guam At the time the typhoons eye was only 15 km wide

After hitting its peak strength Tip weakened to a 230 kmh typhoon and stayed at that intensity for several days as it moved west northwest For five days 55 kmh winds extended over 1100 km from the center On October 17 Tip began to weaken and get much smaller The next day it curved towards the northeast because of a nearby trough After passing about 65 km east of Okinawa it sped up and was then moving at 75 kmh On October 19 Tip made landfall on the Japanese island of Honsh with winds of about 130 kmh The typhoon continued moving rapidly northeastward through the country and became an extratropical cyclone over northern Honsh What was left of the cyclone kept moving northeastward and slowly lost strength It was last observed near Alaska

The typhoon produced heavy rain while passing near Guam including a total of 231 cm an Air Force base The outer rainbands of Tip dropped moderate rain in the mountains of the Philippines

Heavy rainfall from the typhoon breached a wall used to stop flooding at Camp Fuji a training camp for the United States Marine Corps near Yokosuka Marines inside the camp during the storm stayed inside of huts near the bottom of a hill On top of the hill was a fuel farm The breach caused hoses to be torn from two rubber storage tanks letting large amounts of fuel flow down the hill The fuel was ignited by a heater used for warming a hut This started a large fire which killed 13 Marines hurt 68 others and caused damage to the camp The facilitys barracks were destroyed along with 15 huts and several other buildings Firemen from nearby areas arrived within two hours The barracks were rebuilt and a memorial was created for those who lost their lives to the fire

While passing offshore Typhoon Tip came within 65 km of Okinawa Sustained winds reached 72 kmh with gusts to 112 kmh Winds in mainland Japan are not fully known The typhoon did many millions of dollars in damage to farming and fishing industries of the country Eight ships were grounded or sunk by Tip leaving 44 fishermen dead or missing A Chinese freighter broke in half as a result of the typhoon Its crew of 46 people was rescued The rainfall led to over 600 mudslides across the mountains of the country flooded more than 22000 homes It is estimated that 42 people died with another 71 missing and 283 hurt Around 27 bridges were destroyed by the storm as well as about 105 dikes Following the storm at least 11000 people were left without a place to live Transportation in the country was also affected 200 trains and 160 domestic airline flights were canceled Tip was called the most severe storm to strike Japan in 13 years

Typhoon Tip was the largest tropical cyclone on record with a diameter of 1380 mi This is almost double the previous record of 700 miles set by Typhoon Marge in August of 1951 At its largest size Tip was nearly as big as half of the United States When Tip was at its peak strength the temperature inside the eye of was 30 C which is high for a tropical cyclone Also with 10 minute sustained winds of 160 mph Typhoon Tip is the strongest cyclone in the list of tropical cyclones by the Japan Meteorological Agency

The typhoon was also the most intense tropical cyclone in the world It had a minimum a pressure of 870 mbar which is 6 mbar lower than previous record set by Typhoon June in 1975 The records set by Tip still exists although because Reconnaissance Aircraft missions in the western Pacific Ocean stopped in August 1987 some people think there might be slightly stronger cyclones Three researchers found that two typhoons Angela in 1995 and Gay in 1992 had higher Dvorak numbers than Tip They believe that one or both of the two may have been stronger than Typhoon Tip Also Cyclone Monica of 2006 was rated at 869 mb by Dvorak classifications but this is not considered accurate data Because of this it is unknown if Tip still has the world record Despite its record intensity and severe damage the name Tip was not retired It was then reused in 1983 1986 and 1989

The 1979 Pacific typhoon season has no official limits it ran year round in 1979 but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between June and December 

28 tropical depressions formed this year in the Western Pacific of which 23 became tropical storms 14 storms reached typhoon intensity Four of these reached super typhoon strength

Western North Pacific tropical cyclones were named by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center The first storm of 1979 was named Alice and the final one was named Ben The name Alice was retired after this season and replaced by Andy

Wristcutters A Love Story is a movie directed by Goran Duki It was released in theaters in 2006

In the criminal common law of England and Wales a common scold was a type of public nuisance The term was applied to a woman who caused trouble and who disturbed the peace by arguing and fighting with her neighbours all the time The Latin language name for this type of woman was communis rixatrix This names grammar only applies to females This makes it clear that only women could commit this type of crime 

When British people first went to the North America they took this crime with them 

The crime was often punished by ducking Ducking meant that the offender was placed in a chair over a river or pond They were then lowered into the water until they were all in the water This was done several times Few people were actually convicted of being a common scold but it remained a crime listed on the law books of England and Wales until 1967 Because it applied only to women it was eventually banned in the United States This was because the US Constitution does not allow people to be treated differently from each other This comes from a section of the Constitution called the Equal Protection Clause

In the Commentaries on the Laws of England William Blackstone says of this crime Lastly a common scold communis rixatrix is a public nuisance to her neighbourhood For which offence she may be indicted and if convicted shall be sentenced to be placed in a certain engine of correction called the trebucket castigatory or cucking stool which in the Saxon language signifies the scolding stool though now it is frequently corrupted into ducking stool because the residue of the judgement is that when she is so placed therein she shall be plunged in the water for her punishmentCommentaries on the Laws of England IV1358 p 169 

The common punishment for being a common scold was forcing the woman found guilty under water over and over This was done using a piece of furniture called a cucking stool The cucking stool according to Blackstone later was called a ducking stool

Other writers disagree with Blackstone They say that the cucking stool and the ducking stool are really two different types of punishment devices The Domesday Book mentions the use of a cucking stool in the town of Chester The stool was also known as cathedra stercoris This Latin word translates to dung chair It is thought that the punishment involved letting everyone see the punished womans buttocks This type of chair was used to punish not only common scolds but also people who make beer and bakers who sold bad beer or bread Francois Maximilian Misson a French traveler and writer wrote down the way the ducking chair was used in England in the early 1700s The way of punishing scolding women is pleasant enough They fasten an armchair to the end of two beams twelve or fifteen feet long and parallel to each other so that these two pieces of wood with their two ends embrace the chair which hangs between them by a sort of axle by which means it plays freely and always remains in the natural horizontal position in which a chair should be that a person may sit conveniently in it whether you raise it or let it down They set up a post on the bank of a pond or river and over this post they lay almost in equilibrio the two pieces of wood at one end of which the chair hangs just over the water They place the woman in this chair and so plunge her into the water as often as the sentence directs in order to cool her immoderate heatFrancois Maximilian Misson

The ducking stool was not always tied down to one spot next to a river or pond Sometimes it had wheels on it The woman found guilty would be taken through the streets before punishment was done Another way of ducking was to use a device called a tumbrel The tubmrel was a chair on two wheels It had two long shafts on its axles The tumbrel would be pushed into the ducking pond and the shafts would be released This would tip the chair up backwards ducking the victim

A scolds bridle was another punishment device It was known in Scotland as a brank A scolds bridle was a metal mask that locked around a persons head For that reason it was sometimes called a head cage The scolds bridle had a tab that went into the victims mouth to make it difficult to talk Some people say that common scolds had to wear a scolds bridle to stop them from scolding Some say they were used only to punish No legal source known mentions the use of scolds bridals to punish a common scold However some less formal sources do tell of scolds being punished with scolds bridles In the United States scolds or people found guilty of similar crimes were sometimes punished using a cleft stick A cleft stick was similar to a scolds bride but they were easier to make The ducking stool was taken to the US when British people went to live there during colonial times

A piece of writing mounted on the Fye Bridge in Norwich England says it marks the place where a cucking stool had been in place from 15621597 It also says that strumpets and common scolds were ducked there In the Percy Anecdotes published in 1820 the authors state that How long the ducking stool has been in disuse in England does not appear The Anecdotes also suggest that the ducking stool stopped being used because it did not work well The text talks about a Mrs Finch It says of her that in about 1681 she had been found guilty of being a common scold for a third time Each time she was found guilty she was ducked When she was found guilty a fourth time the Kings Bench did not order her punished by ducking Instead they ordered her to pay a money fine and that she be imprisoned until she paid the fine 

The Percy miscellany also quotes a poem by John Gay who wrote that

and also a 1780 poem by Benjamin West who wrote that

These poems do not prove that the punishment took place at the time they were written However they do show that ducking had not been forgotten 

In a 1704 legal case called The Queen v Foxby 6 Mod 11 the lawyer for the person accused of being a scold said that he did not know of any law allowing the ducking of scolds Lord Chief Justice John Holt said this was not correct He said that it was better ducking in aTrinity than a Michaelmas term meaning it was better that a person be ducked in summer than in winter The way he said it however suggests that he thought the punishment was an old custom and something of a joke The last written record of stools being used for ducking involved a Mrs Ganble at Plymouth in 1808 and one Jenny Pipes from Leominster in 1809 In 1817 Sarah Leeke also from Leominster was sentenced to be ducked However the water in the pond was too low The authorities instead wheeled her around the town in the ducking chair 

The common law of Englandlaw made by court precedent rather than through legislationwas adopted by the United States in its early days The common law included the offence of being a common scold In 1829 a Philadelphia Pennsylvania court found American writer and journalist Anne Royall guilty of being a common scold Royall had objected to a firehouse built with federal money being used by a small church for their services She thought this violated the US Constitutions separation between church and state The local clergymen campaigned to have her punished as a common scold Hoping the court would sentence Royall to ducking sailors at the Navy Yard built a ducking stool However the Pennsylvania court ruled that the punishment was not to be used any longer They instead fined Royall ten dollars In 1972 in the case of State v Palendrano 293 A2d 747 New Jersey State prosecutors charged a woman with being a common scold for a disturbance she had caused The New Jersey Superior Court ruled that the law was improper because of it was too vague

In England and Wales the only parts of the United Kingdom where the law was in use no prosecutions of common scolds have occurred for a long time The lawyers in Sykes v Director of Public Prosecutions 1962 AC 528 described the offence as obsolete Section 13 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 did away with it 

The offence of being a common scold has also become obsolete in the United States because only women could commit it This was found to violate the US Constitutions Equal Protection Clause Many states have laws restricting public profanity loud noise in public and disorderly conduct None of these laws have any punishment similar to those traditionally used for the common scold

Tropical Storm Peter was a short lived tropical storm that formed after the end of the Atlantic hurricane season It formed from an extratropical storm and at first it was a subtropical cyclone However as it moved over warmer waters it began to gain strength On December 9 2003 it became a tropical cyclone An eye formed within the cyclone and Peter almost became a hurricane It reached its peak winds of 70 mph but wind shear and cooler waters quickly caused Peter to lose strength 

An extratropical cyclone developed on December 2 in the eastern Atlantic Ocean about 1430 miles southwest of the Azores islands It moved northwestward then turned to the north and developed gale force winds on December 4 after turning to the northeast Later that day it turned into a frontal low pressure system As high pressure existed across the northeast Atlantic Ocean the storm turned to the southeast The system turned to the south southwest on December 7 Later that day thunderstorms formed around the center and it is said that the system organized into a subtropical storm late on December 7 while located 835 miles south southwest of the Azores The storm moved to the southwest over warmer waters and the thunderstorms or convection around the storm continued to get stronger The convection became broken wikt linkcondensecondensed near the center as rainbands developed around the center Since the storm was gaining more strength the National Hurricane Center declared the system Tropical Storm Peter on December 9 while located 980 miles northwest of Praia in the Cape Verde islands

Several days before Peter formed forecasts anticipated the development of the storm As it became a tropical storm Peter was moving slowly so initial forecasts said the storm would quickly die out However an eye feature quickly developed and Peter strengthened to reach winds of 70 mph late on December 9 Although the presence of an eye along with Dvorak classifications of 75 mph would usually mean the storm is of hurricane strength Peter stayed as a strong tropical storm and quickly began to weaken It moved northward due to a cold front The combination of wind shear and cooler water temperatures quickly weakened the storm By December 10 Peter became a tropical depression As the system turned to the northeast Peter turned into an extratropical storm on December 11 Shortly afterward it was absorbed by the cold front

Peter stayed over the open Atlantic Ocean for its entire lifetime It did not affect land Because of this there were no deaths or damages The storm formed in the month of December which is rare since most storms in the Atlantic exist between June and November Another storm Odette also formed in December This made the 2003 season the first year since 1887 that two storms developed in the month of December Peter made 2003 the sixth most active Atlantic hurricane season The 235 days between the development of the first storm Tropical Storm Ana and the broken wikt linkdissipationdissipation of the last storm Peter made the 2003 season the longest since 1952 Peter is one of only four Atlantic tropical cyclones to reach the P name since the official naming of hurricanes began in 1950

Daryl Surat a contributor to Otaku USA suggests that many harem anime are built around one core fetish with other girls fulfilling sub fetishes1 There are also reverse harem anime in which a female protagonist is surrounded by gorgeous boys Ouran Host Club and The Wallflower being the best known

Some recent harem titles have experienced a backlash from some anime fans in the United States particularly from females due to recurring usage of female fan service in series with the genre designation prompting calls of sexism from some viewers However this is in spite of portrayals of male sexuality in anime being a fast growing trend in the US2

An ecological niche is the part of the environment into which a species fits and to which it is adapted A shorthand definition of niche in biology is how an organism makes a living in a place A niche can be occupied by different species all of which earn their living in roughly the same way Thus the bird of prey eating small mammals niche would in grasslands include the kestrel but in an oak wood it would by filled by the tawny owl

The word niche was first used in biology by naturalist Joseph Grinnell in 1917

Scientists who study the interactions between animals and their environment are called ecologists and their branch of science is called ecology A niche is a term which describes a position or opportunity into which some organism fits well Thus an ecological niche is a place in nature that is filled by an animal or plant because it is well suited to do so 

Once a niche is left open other organisms may or may not fill that position 

Also when plants and animals invade into a new land they sometimes take over the niches of native organisms The introduction of non native species to new territory often has consequences for the resident species

Degenerate art was the term used by the Nazi regime in Germany to describe nearly all modern art The Nazis banned the art because they said it was un German or was Jewish or Bolshevist in nature Artists who were labeled as degenerate were punished by the laws They were not allowed to teach they could not show or sell their art and some were even forbidden from creating any art all 

Degenerate Art was also used as the name for an exhibition put on by the Nazis in Munich in 1937 The exhibition was made up of modern artworks displayed badly with text labels making fun of the art This was meant to make people hate modernism The show traveled to several other cities in Germany and Austria

While modern styles of art were not allowed the Nazis liked paintings and sculptures that were very traditional and old fashioned They thought art should glorify Nazi ideas of the blood and soil values of racial purity militarism and obedience Music was also expected to be tonal and free of any jazz influences movies and plays were censored The censorship was done by the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda

The animals of New Zealand have an unusual history Humans arrived in New Zealand probably less than 1300 years ago At that time the country had no mammals at all except bats that flew there and those that swam there such as seals and sea lions This meant that all the ecological niches occupied by mammals in other lands were occupied in New Zealand by either insects or birds Because of this the country has an unusually large number of flightless birds including the Kiwi the Moa and the Kakapo Because of the lack of predators even the bats spend most of their time on the ground There are also about 60 species of lizard and four species of frog

Humans first arrived from the Pacific Islands at several different times at some time before 1300 They brought with them the Polynesian Rat and the domesticated dog Europeans later brought pigs ferrets stoats mice rats dogs cats sheep cattle and many other mammals Of these the rats ferrets cats stoats and dogs have all had serious effect on the original New Zealand animals They have driven many species to extinction Possums were later introduced from Australia for a fur industry and deer from Europe as animals to be hunted Both seriously damaged the forest habitat of many birds

In recent years successful efforts have been made to remove possums rats ferrets and other mammals from many offshore islands large and small This was done to return these places to something more closely resembling their original state For example an estimated 30 tons of dead possums were removed from Kapiti Island People are also trying to control these species on the mainland In some parts of the mainland mammals are being completely eliminated inside fenced areas to create ecological islands Examples are the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary in Wellington City from which about a ton of dead possums was removed after the installation of a mammal proof fence and the Maungatautari Restoration Project

Hurricane Grace was a short lived Category 2 hurricane that helped to create another cyclone known as the Perfect Storm Hurricane Grace formed on October 26 and at first it was a subtropical cyclone This means it was partially tropical and partially extratropical It became a full tropical cyclone on October 27 and later reached winds of 100 mph The storm had minor effects on the island of Bermuda as it passed to the south Another storm to the north caused Grace to turn eastward The hurricane was absorbed into the large circulation of the other low pressure system This storm became stronger while it fed off the warm air from the remnants of Grace and the cold air to the north and it became a powerful noreaster This noreaster caused extremely high waves and severe damage along the US East Coast 

Graces beginnings go back to a mid level area of low pressure that formed on October 23 to the south of Bermuda Reports from a ship said that it had become a low level system by October 25 At first the storm had subtropical characteristics and there were not a lot of thunderstorms around its center For a storm to gain strength strong thunderstorms need to build around it The system was called a subtropical storm on October 26 A separate area of clouds near Bermuda slowly became involved with the subtropical storm nearby Thunderstorms began to broken wikt linkpersistpersist near the center of the storm Because of this on October 27 the storm gained tropical storm status and was named Grace

Grace continued to organize and strengthen Based on satellite estimates of the storms intensity and reconnaissance reports it was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane This is the lowest level on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale The hurricane moved towards the northwest until October 28 when an extratropical cyclone formed along a cold front This storm quickly strengthened and became very large It eventually caused Grace to turn quickly to the east At around the same time an eye feature associated with Hurricane Grace began to show up on satellite pictures Grace sped up as it continued moving eastward It reached its peak strength at winds of 100 mph and a minimum central barometric pressure of 980 mbar making it a Category 2 on October 29 The center of the hurricane passed convert50mikmabbronlkon south of Bermuda without significantly affecting the island

Hurricane Grace turned northeast later that day The cold front quickly approached and overtook it It then lost its status as a tropical system Grace moved north along the front and merged with the large storm to the north The remnants of Grace were not visible anymore by the next day The noreaster became a very strong storm as it fed off the warm air from the remnants of Hurricane Grace and the cool air to the north

To prepare for the hurricane a tropical storm warning was issued for Bermuda on October 27 The next day about 10 hours before the storm passed by the island the tropical storm warning was made into a hurricane warning On October 29 the hurricane warning was lowered to a tropical storm warning This was changed to a gale warning shortly after Bermuda had some rain and wind from the storm The rain reached convert321inmmabbronlkon However no deaths or bad damage were reported A yacht a type of boat that was traveling from Bermuda to New York ran into strong winds and seas convert25ftmabbronlkonadjon high off the Virginia coast The nine people on the boat had to be rescued by Coast Guard helicopters

Because of its large size Grace caused large waves along the East Coast of the United States These waves reached at least convert15ftmabbronlkon high Despite minor beach erosion no bad property damage occurred However Carolina Beach North Carolina lost about convert1ftmabbron of sand Because the damage from the tropical cyclone was not very bad the name Grace was not retired It was reused during the 1997 Atlantic hurricane season

Even though the damage from Hurricane Grace was mostly small the noreaster it helped to form caused very bad damage along the coast This storm created extremely high seas as well as powerful wind Strong wind gusts were reported in New England The storm churned the ocean for several days and a wave convert101ftmabbron in height was reported by an offshore buoy Severe flooding occurred along the coast of the Mid Atlantic and Northeastern US and the storms effects were felt as far north as Newfoundland The noreaster eventually strengthened again to become another weak hurricane which hit Nova Scotia A ship known as the Andrea Gail was lost along with its six crew members during the storm

In chemistry paraffin is the common name for the alkane hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n2 Paraffin wax refers to the solids with n between 20 and 40 inclusive

The simplest paraffin molecule is that of methane CH4 a gas at room temperature Heavier members of the series such as that of octane C8H18 and mineral oil appear as liquids at room temperature The solid forms of paraffin called paraffin wax are from the heaviest molecules from C20H42 to C40H82 Paraffin wax was identified by Carl Reichenbach in 1830

Paraffin or paraffin hydrocarbon is also the technical name for an alkane in general but in most cases it refers specifically to a linear or normal alkane whereas branched or isoalkanes are also called isoparaffins It is distinct from the fuel known in Ireland Britain and South Africa as paraffin oil or just paraffin which is called kerosene in most of the US Australia and New Zealand

The name is derived from the Latin parum affinis with the meaning here of lacking affinity or lacking reactivity This is because alkanes being non polar and lacking in functional groups are very unreactive

The Kagyu school is one of the four main schools or lineages of Tibetan Buddhism 

The Kagyu teachings originated with the Indian mahasiddhas Tilopa and his student Naropa The Kagyu school was founded in Tibet by Naropas Tibetan follower Marpa his disciple Milarepa and Milarepas student Gampopa Gampopa was the first monk of the Kagyu school Gampopas own followers founded many monasteries which resulted in several sub schools or branches being established At one time there were more than twelve different branches Today there are four separate Kagyu sub schools

The teachings of each of these schools have come down through different successions of masters since the time of Gampopa However the teachings of all these Kagyu schools is essentially the same

The Kagyu school generally emphasises faith in the spiritual teacher or Lama and meditation practice over study They teach that without this faith it is impossible to achieve the benefits and realization of meditation However some basic study is also important One of the most important books of this tradition is The Jewel Ornament of Liberation which was written by Gampopa This book covers all the main teachings of Mahayana Buddhism in a step by step manner In particular it teaches 

The biographies and spiritual poems or songs of Kagyu saints in particular the Life of Milarepa and the 100000 Songs of Milarepa are also widely read books of this tradition

The special advanced meditation practices of the Kagyu tradition consist of two main teachings

The six yogas of Naropa involve complicated visualisation combined with yoga and breathing excercises These practices are generally only done by monks and nuns who remain in strict seclusion for at least three years They are called the six yogas or six doctrines of Naropa as they were originally taught by Naropa and consist of six main practices  

The Mahamudra meditation teachings are meditations of concentration and awareness which allow the practitioner to realise the nature of his or her mind A student must receive instructions on Mahamudra meditation directly by a master of this tradition

Queen Mab is a fairy referred to in Shakespeares play Romeo and Juliet In the play she is described by Mercutio as a tiny creature who drives a chariot across the faces of people while they are asleep causing them to dream of their wishes coming true She has also appeared in other books afterwards including Moby Dick and Sense and Sensibility

O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you

She is the fairies midwife and she comes

In shape no bigger than an agate stone

On the fore finger of an alderman

Drawn with a team of little atomies

Athwart mens noses as they lie asleep

Her wagon spokes made of long spinners legs

The cover of the wings of grasshoppers

The traces of the smallest spiders web

The collars of the moonshines watery beams

Her whip of crickets bone the lash of film

Her waggoner a small grey coated gnat

Not half so big as a round little worm

Prickd from the lazy finger of a maid

Her chariot is an empty hazel nut

Made by the joiner squirrel or an old grub

Time out o mind the fairies coachmakers

And in this state she gallops night by night

Through lovers brains and then they dream of love

Oer courtiers knees that dream on courtsies straight

Oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees

Oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream

Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues

Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are

Sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose

And then dreams he of smelling out a suit

And sometime comes she with a tithe pigs tail

Tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep

Then dreams he of another benefice

Sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck

And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats

Of breaches ambuscadoes Spanish blades

Of healths five fathom deep and then anon

Drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes

And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two

And sleeps again Fellows lets be reasonable 

Huh This is not the time or the place to perform 

Some kind of a half assed autopsy on a fish 

And Im not going to stand here and see that 

Thing cut open and see that little Kintner boy 

Spill out all over the dock This is that very Mab

That plaits the manes of horses in the night

And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs

Which once untangled much misfortune bodes

This is the hag when maids lie on their backs

That presses them and learns them first to bear

Making them women of good carriage

This is she

tienne Geoffroy Saint Hilaire was a French naturalist who established the principle of unity of composition He was a colleague of Jean Baptiste Lamarck and believed in the underlying unity of organismal design and the possibility of the change of species in time He collected evidence for his claims in comparative anatomy paleontology and embryology

Geoffroy was a deist which is to say that he believed in a God but also in a law like universe with no supernatural interference in the details of existence This kind of opinion was common in the Enlightenment and goes with a rejection of revelation and miracles and does not interpret the Bible as the literal word of God 

Geoffroys theory was not a theory of common descent but a working out of existing potential in a given type For him the environment causes a direct induction of organic change This opinion Ernst Mayr labels as Geoffroyism It is definitely not what Lamarck believed The direct effect of environment is not believed today by any main stream evolutionist even Sir William Lawrence knew by 1816 that climate does not directly cause the differences between human races

Williamstown is a suburb in Melbourne Victoria Australia only 8 km south west of the central business district In 2006 there were 12733 people living in Williamstown It is located on Hobsons Bay part of Port Phillip Bay at the mouth of the Yarra River

Williamstown is about 15 minutes by car from Melbourne using the West Gate Freeway or a 30 minute train journey from Flinders Street Station Ferries on the Yarra River from Melbournes Southbank take about 1 hour There is also a ferry across the bay from StKilda on weekends and holidays

The first people to live in the Williamstown area were the Yaluki willam clan of the Kulin people an Indigenous Australian people They lived and hunted along the coast from Werribee to Williamstown The Yalukit willam were part of the Bunurong a language group of six clans along the coast from the Werribee River to the Mornington Peninsula Western Port Bay and Wilsons Promontory They ate shell fish birds fish eels eggs snakes kangaroos and possums which were found across their lands They called Williamstown koort boork boork meaning many she oaks a native tree The head of the Yalikut willam tribe at the time of the arrival of the first white settlers was Benbow He became a guide to John Batman the first European to settle in Melbourne

The numbers of indigenous people went down quickly after 1835 because of diseases like typhoid With racism and loss of hunting lands it was impossible for them to keep up their traditional life style 

The first European to arrive at Williamstown was Acting Lieutenant Robbins who explored Point Gellibrand in 1803 The mouth of the Yarra River was later explored in May and June 1835 by John Batman He thought that the area now called Melbourne would be a good settlement site The site of Williamstown he named Port Harwood after the captain of one of his ships

In November 1835 Captain Robson Coltish of the barque Norval sailed from Launceston with a cargo of 500 sheep and 50 Hereford cattle Captain Coltish chose the area now known as Port Gellibrand as a goood place to unload his cargo Within weeks many ships began making their way across Bass Strait Because of the sheltered harbour many people decided to settle in the immediate area

Governor Richard Bourke and Captain William Lonsdale visited the new settlement at Port Phillip Bay in 1837 They both thought the main settlement would be at the river mouth They renamed it Williams Town after the king William IV It was Melbournes first harbour and port for the Port Phillip district until the late 19th century

Williams Town was named after the king and Melbourne was named after the British prime minister Lord Melbourne This made people believe that Williams Town was to be the capital of the new Colony The first streets of old Williams town were laid out in 1837 with that in mind But a lack of fresh water at Williams Town meant that it became necessary to change the city centre to the inland site of Melbourne

The first land sales took place in 1837 Convicts built a 30 metre stone jetty in 1838 This is where Gem Pier now stands That same year a ferry service between Melbourne and Williamstown was started The steamer Fire Fly carried passengers sheep and cattle from Tasmania By 1839 Williamstown had a pier and government stores built by convicts The main part of the town was centred on Nelson Place About 100 buildings were built including two hotels the Ship Inn and the Woolpack The first cemetery in Victoria was started at Point Gellibrand

The first lighthouse made of wood with an oil burning light at the top was built at Point Gellibrand in 1840 In that same year a water police superintendent was appointed to Williamstown

In 1841 the census said there were about 259 people living in Williamstown It is believed that there were many more There were three hotels in Williamstown by 1841 and most of the men worked at the port Being a busy port there were numerous lodging houses and a constantly changing population The years 1842 and 1843 there was an economic recession and Williamstowns population went down

In 1842 the arrival of the ship Manilus threw the small colony into a frenzy Forty five of the ships 243 passengers had died from yellow fever during the journey from Scotlands shores The sick were taken to a quickly built quarantine camp Those that died were buried in a makeshift graveyard

Also in 1842 St Marys School was started in a small timber chapel with a wood shingle roof Mr John Wilson was the first teacherprincipal The earliest records show there were six boys and eight girls in July 1844

In 1847 Steamboat Pier was built and a permanent customs house was set up The water police and customs officers remained here until the Melbourne Harbour Trust developed river channels closer to the Melbourne CBD in the 1890s

A bluestone lighthouse was built in 1849 50 to replace the wooden one It only operated as a lighthouse until 1860 when a Pile Light was built and anchored off Shelly Beach It was then used as a time ball tower

By that time Moore was recognizable for his cowboy characteristics He customarily wore cowboy boots a white Stetson hat and a string tie He kept his hair in a crew cut and was rarely seen without a cigar He was also known for his unusual form of stroke Moore employed a slip stroke This is a way of shooting in which a player releases his gripping hand briefly and re grasps the cue farther back on the butt just before hitting the cue ball Using the slip stroke Moore was deadly accurate but could also shoot with great power

In 1945 Moores purchased a home in Albuquerque New Mexico He would live there for the rest of his life with his wife Julie Chavez whom he married in 1949 They had seven children together sons Jamie Raymond and Tommy and daughters Pamela Nathan Kolma Moore Emily DiLorenzo and Linda Bates Soon after moving to Albuquerque he became co owner and operator of the U Cue Billiards Hall located in the City It was said that hustlers avoided going through Albuquerque just to avoid getting into a money game with Moore

Though Moore continued playing on the roadas he would for over 40 yearshe began competing and placing in top tier tournaments His tournament career was to be overshadowed by an enduring series of runner up finishes that would earn him the nickname pools underpaid prince in such publications as Esquire Magazine The name that stuck with him for life however was Cowboy According to Moore he became Cowboy Jimmy Moore when he appeared at the Commodore Hotel championships in New York City in the 1950s wearing the required tuxedo but nevertheless sporting cowboy boots and his signature white Stetson hat

The second place saga started in 1951 at the two week long double elimination round robin format World Championship tournament held that year in Boston At the competition Moore was defeated in his last match by Willie Mosconi His record was seven wins in nine matches including triumphs over future Billiard Congress of America Hall of Famers Irving Crane and Arthur Babe Cranfield

In 1952 he made a strong showing in the same competition held once more in Boston running 93 balls against Lassiter beating him 150 to 25 but again finishing behind Willie Mosconi this time sharing second place with Jimmy Caras and Joe Procita Moores match with Mosconi had an ending score of 150 to 58 in 19 innings Moore competed in the 1953 World Championship in San Francisco but did not place losing in his last match to Crane 150 56 in 7 innings 

The following year Moore took second place yet again in the World Championship held that year in Philadelphia The 1954 tournament was not sponsored and was unsanctioned by the BCA in its absence being organized by Irving Crane It was denominated by newspapers such as The New York Times as the Unofficial World Pocket Billiard Championship In a career highlight in the penultimate match there Moore was losing 148 to 8 to Irving Crane When Crane let him back to the table Moore ran 142 balls CueglossOutand out Despite this feat Moore was dispatched to second place by Lassiter with a final score of 150 to 95 sharing second place with Crane The defending champion Mosconi did not participate

Moores runner up streak continued in the 1956 World Championship held at Judices Academy in Brooklyn New York He clinched second place to Willie Mosconis now almost ubiquitous first with a 150 to 50 score over Al Coslosky of Philadelphia in 15 innings a win over Richard Riggie of Baltimore 150 to 121 with an inspired run of 107 balls but a loss to Lassiter 150 to 70 in 7 innings That same year Moore played Mosconi at a challenge match in Kinston North Carolina It was not Moores day as Mosconi posted a career highlight a perfect match150 balls in a row in one inning

In all Moore came in second at the World Championship five times but never took the crown He did however win the National Pocket Billiards Championship held in Chicago at Bensingers Billiards in 1958 The tournament was a challenge match marathon straight pool CueglossRacerace to 3000 points between Moore and Luther Lassiter It was a tight competition with Lassiter leading at one point 1800 to 1512 Moore battled back and eventually won with a final score of 3000 to 2634

Moore would eventually have ten second place finishes in world title competition Nevertheless he frequently competed with and beat all of the players whom he so often played second fiddle to in sanctioned tournament play In fact later in 1958 the same year he won the National Pocket Billiards Championship against Lassiter he roundly defeated Mosconi in a two day exhibition match in his home town of Albuquerque with a final score of 500 to 397 Moore and Mosconi would battle it out many times in unsanctioned but publicized play In addition to matches previously mentioned they vied at Albuquerques old Chaplin Alley on 1956 at the Highland Bowl in 1958 and later in matches in Winston Salem North Carolina Philadelphia Chicago and Johnston City at the Jansco Brothers Stardust Open where Moore would win the prize for all around honors

It was not until 1965 at the National Invitation Pocket Billiards Championship seven years after his last first place finish that he would repeat as champion in a sanctioned tournament At that contest held at the Riviera Terrace in New York City along the way to first place and the prize of 4000 Moore defeated Onofrio Lauri 150 to 117 Joe Balsis 150 to 3 Cisero Murphy 150 to 96 Champagne Edwin Kelly 150 to 83 in 3 innings and the ever present Luther Lassiter 150 to 41 in 4 innings The runner up in the tourney was Joe Balsis

In addition to competition Moore served as a technical adviser for billiard related scenes in television and film including My Living Doll starring Julie Newmar and Robert Cummings in 1964 and the Jerry Lewis movie The Family Jewels in 1965

Moore was inducted into the International Pocket Billiards Hall of Fame in 1982 the Billiard Congress of Americas Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Albuquerque Sports Hall of Fame in 1998 He remained competitive in tournament and match play well into his 70s In 1984 at age 74 Moore won the Legends of Pocket Billiards competition on ESPN Even in later years he was still deadly on a pool table running 111 balls three days after his 80th birthday Until the traffic accident I had about a year ago I was still playing my usual speed Moore said in July 1999 at the age of 89 However Moores health declined rapidly that same year He died on November 17 1999 of natural causes

The Right Hand Fist Rule is a convention in vector math Its used when you use a vector to talk about how something is rotating It is also seen when talking about magnetic fields that come from running current through a wire

It is related to the Right Hand Rule

You can do this in reverse by starting your thumb in the direction of the vector and see how your fingers curl to see the direction of rotation If you point your thumb in the direction of current in a wire the magnetic field that comes up around it is in the direction of your curling fingers

The Right Hand Rule is a convention in vector math It helps you remember direction when vectors get cross multiplied There is another rule called the Right hand fist rule that is used for magnetic fields and things that rotate

Hurricane Agnes was a Category 1 hurricane in the 1972 Atlantic hurricane season Agnes affected many states but the worst was in Florida Pennsylvania and New York The name Agnes was one of five Category 1 hurricanes to get its name retired At the time Hurricane Agnes was the costliest hurricane in the United States and the Atlantic Ocean Agnes killed 130 people and caused 3 billion in damage In 2009 that would have cost 157 billion As Agnes moved over the United States it caused a tornado outbreak About 28 tornadoes were seen

Because of the high damage and high number of people killed the name Agnes was retired There was no name to be used instead of Agnes because the list changed in 1979

As of 2009 there is a controversy in Switzerland about the construction of minarets A minaret is a tower like structure belonging to a mosque Its main use is to call the worshippers to prayer much like a belltower of a Christian church On 1st May 2007 the Swiss Peoples Party and the Federal Democratic Union launched a popular referendum They want to ban the construction of minarets in Switzerland The Swiss people voted in favor of the issue on November 29 2009 

There are two disputes that form the basis of the controversy

The Swiss Minaret controversy started in the Eastern part of Switerland in 2005 A Turkish cultural association applied for the permit to build a six metre high tower on the roof of the center where they met The residents around it did not like the idea They therefore formed an association to oppose it The people in this association were biased they had strong religious views Some of the members of the association were also in the committee that had to assess the building plans As a matter of course the plans were rejected The matter was taken to Court and the islamic community lost the case In 2009 the tower was built despite the previous loss

There are other communes where similar scenes happened

The two parties tried several motions at the cantonal level to ban minaret building This never came to the vote though because all cantonal parliaments found the motions unconstitutional

In 2007 the parties launched a motion at the federal level Unlike at the cantonal level intitiatives at the federal level cannot be reviewed and found unconstitutional The motion wants to ban the building of minarets in Switzerland The committees proposition reads The building of minarets is prohibited If it became law it would be written into Article 72 of the Swiss Federal Constitution

Polyploidy occurs in cells and organisms when there are more than two paired sets of chromosomes

Most organisms are normally diploid meaning they have two sets of chromosomes one set inherited from each parent Polyploidy may occur due to abnormal cell division It is most commonly found in plants but it does sometimes happen in animals Some estimates suggest that 30 80 of living plant species are polyploid and many lineages show evidence of ancient polyploidy in their genomes Huge increases in angiosperm diversity have coincided with the timing of ancient genome duplications shared by many species 15 of angiosperm and 31 of fern speciation events are accompanied by ploidy increase

Polyploid plants arise spontaneously in nature Many polyploids are fitter than their parental species and may display novel variation or morphologies that contribute to speciation and eco niche exploitation 

Polyploidy may occur in one generation and is an exception to the principle that evolution occurs gradually There may however be many genetic changes in the species after polyploidy has taken place 

The gametes of polyploids are unusual because they may carry several sets of chromosomes For example common wheat is a polyploid with six sets of chromosomes two sets coming originally from each of three different species So there are six sets of chromosomes in most cells and three sets of chromosomes in the gametes

Sex chromosomes are chromosomes which determine the sex of individual organisms In man for example there are 23 pairs of chromosomes and one of these pairs are sex chromosomes Females have two X chromosomes males have one X and one Y An egg always carries a single X while sperms carry either an X or a Y That is how sex is determined in humans

Not all organisms have their sex determined by chromosomes Those that do use the sex chromosome system have variations in how it happens The account above is generally true for mammals

Cytogenetics is the branch of genetics which deals with cell structure and function It includes the study of chromosomes chromosome bands karyotypes and cell division especially meiosis Cytogenetic studies have also been used to study evolution in natural populations

All the cells in the body of an organism are somatic cells except for the haploid gametes and other cells involved in reproduction 

Somatic cells are usually diploid except where there is polyploidy Either way somatic cells have double the number of chromosomes that gametes in the same organism have Somatic cells divide by mitosis and make identical copies of themselves while gametes are made when germ cells divide by meiosis

In humans somatic cells have 46 chromosomes 

Analyzing a group of people to determine genetic susceptibility to a particular disease

Haploid is the term used when a cell has only one set of chromosomes A normal eukaryote organism is composed of diploid cells one set of chromosomes from each parent However after meiosis the number of chromosomes in gametes is halved That is the haploid condition

In man the diploid number of chromosomes is 46 The number in haploid cells is 23 Some whole groups of animals are haploid such as male hymenoptera

The Kingsway tramway subway is a cut and cover tunnel in central London It was built for The London County Council to join two tramway systems called the North Side and South Side The tunnel opened for use in 1906 It originally was used by single deck tramcars only but an upgrade between 1928 and 1931 meant that double deck trams could use it The subway was closed in 1952 Part of the subway is now the Strand underpass but the rest is largely untouched and still has tram tracks inside it It is now a Grade II Listed structure 

The London County Council had two tramway systems called the North Side and South Side For a long time they wanted to join the two together This would allow them to send trams from the North Side to the Central Repair Depot in Charlton in South East London for overhauls In 1898 it was decided to demolish the slum districts in the Holborn area and rebuild them This gave a chance to use the new streets for a tramway In 1902 the Council decided to build a tramway that was under the ground The subway went from Theobalds Road in the north to the Embankment underneath Waterloo Bridge to the south From there a line that was not underground would continue over Waterloo Bridge

However there were legal problems and these delayed the permission that was needed to build the subway and tram route Permission to build the subway was not given until 1906 and they were still not allowed to build the tram line over the bridge The tunnel would also only be able to have single deck trams in it This was because of a sewer at the northern end of the tunnel and the District Railway at the southern end When the trams left the subway at the southern end they could turn right along the Embankment to Westminster Bridge or left on a service from Bloomsbury to the Hop Exchange This latter service was short lived and the tracks were removed in 1930

At the north end the approach near Southampton Row was an convert170ftm0 open cutting with a 1 in 10 slope The tracks passed through cast iron tubes underneath the Fleet sewer They then rose slightly to enter Holborn tramway station From here up to Aldwych tramway station the subway was built with a steel roof Because it was not planned to run a public service south of here at first the tracks leading towards the Strand were used as a depot with appropriate equipment and inspection pits

The first public tram through the subway ran on 24 February 1906 It ran from The Angel Islington to Aldwych The chairman of the Highways Committee held an opening ceremony The first journey took 10 minutes to go to Aldwych and 12 minutes to get back This was also allowing for the horse drawn vehicles that were using the roads on the overground part of the route On the 16 November of the same year the routes were extended north from The Angel to Highbury station The route used special trams built from materials that could not catch fire Wooden trams like those used on other routes were not allowed to go through the subway

In the parliamentary session of 1905 plans were submitted for another station at the south end of the tunnel The station would be underneath Wellington Street The opening of the new tramway along the Embankment meant it was decided to link up with this route instead and the station was never built A new sharp curve was built under Lancaster Place to alllow an exit through the western side wall of Waterloo Bridge A triangular junction with the through line was constructed The eastern side of this junction leading to Blackfriars was removed as part of the 1930s upgrade

Through services started on 10 April 1908 They ran from Highbury station to Tower Bridge and to Kennington Gate There was a procession of six cars that went south from the Holborn through to Kennington They then diverted to Elephant and Castle in order to return through the subway to Angel The Kennington service was not commercially viable and services were diverted to operate to Queens Road in Battersea Due to a low bridge this service could only be operated with single deck vehicles Drivers of the trams recorded difficulty in climbing the ramp north from Holborn tramway station and would sometimes roll all the way back to the station Drivers on routes through the tunnel had to have at least two years experience on other services to be considered for these routes

The services continued to change for many years especially when the tram lines over Blackfriars Bridge opened on 14 September 1909 During the 1920s the LCC also realised that for the subway to remain profitable it would need to be able to take double deck trams In 1929 it was then decided that the headroom of the tunnel would be increased to convert16ft6inm2 This would be done by raising the roof or deepening the tunnel as appropriate Work started on 11 September 1929 The work resulted in the replacement of the cast iron tubes with a new steel girder supported roof The sewer was also diverted In some places the trackbed was lowered by convert5ftm2 This meant that the walls had to be underpinned with concrete After the last service ran on 2 February 1930 the tunnel was closed It did not re open until 14 February 1930 which was the formal re opening Tram number 1931 was used on the new route 31 Public services started on the next day As well as the whole tunnel being rebuilt the two tramway stations were as well Services now ran from Hackney to Wandsworth or Tooting Leyton to Westminster Highbury to Waterloo or Norbury and Archway to Kennington

A weekend service was introduced between Highgate and Downham via Brockley This route closed in 1932 It was convert16mikm2 long This made it the longest tram route operated entirely within the County of London

In 1937 Waterloo Bridge was re built This meant that the side entrance to the tramway had to be moved A new entrance was built in a position centrally underneath the bridge This opened on 21 November of that year

In 1933 the London Passenger Transport Board was formedThey took over the London County Council trams Soon after this takeover the LPTB decided to replace all of the trams in London by more modern vehicles The abandonment programme began in 1935 The trams in the South West West North West North and East London were mostly replaced with trolleybuses This programme carried on quickly until 1940 In 1940 the last tram conversion took place before the Second World War This left only the South London trams and subway routes 31 33 and 35 running The subway routes were the only trams to run into North London during the war

Prototype Kingsway trolleybus number 1379 was built to test the use of trolleybuses through the subway The trolleybus had exits on both sides to allow this However the tests were unsuccessful This was because the trolleybuses would have had to run on battery power through the subway They would have had to have used battery power because headroom restrictions made it impossible to use overhead current collection

In 1946 it was decided to replace all of Londons remaining trams as soon as possible This time though the replacement would be by diesel buses instead of trolleybuses The first subway route to be closed was route 31 It closed on 1 October 1950 Routes 33 and 35 were closed at the end of service on Saturday 5 April 1952 The last public services through the subway were specials which ran on the Sunday shortly after midnight During the early hours of the next morning all of the remaining trams north of the subway were driven through the subway to the depots south of the Thames

The trams in London stopped running on 5 July 1952 After this the tracks on the street were lifted However those in the subway mostly remained in place In 1953 London Transport used the tramway to store 120 unused buses and coaches This was in case they were needed for the Coronation However proposals to convert the tramway subway to a car park or a film studio failed and it was leased out as a storage facility from October 1957

In June 1958 the London County Council proposed to use the tunnel for light traffic coming from Waterloo Bridge This would reduce traffic congestion at its junction with Strand In April 1962 the go ahead was given for part of the southern end of the subway to be used in this way Construction began in September of the same year The subway opened to road traffic as the Strand Underpass on 21 January 1964

The southern section of the abandoned tunnel between the Embankment and the Strand Underpass has been converted into a branch of the Buddha Bar chain of bars and restaurants This involved the demolition of the pedestrian subways under Waterloo Bridge and extensive construction in the bridges undercroft

The MacBook Air is a kind of Macintosh laptop computer designed by Apple known as the worlds thinnest notebook It is positioned as the most portable in Apples MacBook family and was introduced at the Macworld Conference Expo on January 15 2008 The MacBook Air was the first laptop to implement Apples precision aluminum unibody enclosure

The MacBook Air has been updated four times since the original release The first revision introduced better performance a bigger hard drive and a Mini DisplayPort for peripheral monitors The second update introduced with the MacBook Pro series featured a lower price better performance and a longer lasting battery It was revised once again in October 2010 with a complete redesign of the outside container and the addition of a smaller 116 inch screen laptop

The MacBook Air made for thinness weighs convert3lbkg was the first MacBook produced using a single piece of aluminum with Apples unibody technique The computer has a glossy LED backlit screen and a backlit keyboard as well as a large trackpad that responds to iPhone like Multi Touch gestures such as pinching swiping and rotating With the release of Mac OS X Snow Leopard the Airs multi touch trackpad also supports handwriting recognition of Chinese characters

A hatch that flips down on the right side shows the ports on MacBook Air a USB port a Mini screenPort and a stereo earphone jack The left side of the computer has a MagSafe adapter for power and there is an iSight webcam and microphone above the screen

The MacBook Air was the first compact laptop sold by Apple since the full featured 12 PowerBook G4 was stopped in 2006 It was also Apples first computer with an optional solid state storage drive ArsTechnica found moderate performance improvements of the 64 GB solid state drive of the first generation Air over the standard 80 GB hard drive in tests On October 14 2008 new models were announced boasting improved capacities of 128 GB and 120 GB The Air comes standard with 2 GB non upgradable RAM The CPU on the original Air was an Intel Core 2 Duo chip especially designed to be 40 percent the size of the standard Core 2 Duo chip The current model has a low voltage small form factor Core 2 Duo Penryn with 6 MB of cache running on a 1066 MHz bus MacBook Air has no user replaceable parts The hard drive memory and battery are enclosed within the casing with memory soldered directly to the logicboard MacBook Airs battery is enclosed within the case but can be replaced using normal screwdrivers though it is unclear whether this process would void the notebooks warranty As part of the out of warranty service Apple offers to replace the battery for a fee

Apple incorporated several features in the design of the MacBook Air such as the reduction of toxic chemicals like lead to make it more environmentally friendly MacBook Air contains no BFRs and PVC wiring meets Energy Star Version 50 requirements has a recyclable enclosure and is rated EPEAT Gold its screen is made from arsenic free glass and does not contain mercury To reduce the computers size and weight several features were sacrificed It is Apples first notebook since the PowerBook 2400c without a built in removable media drive It also omits a FireWire port Ethernet port line in media card slots and a Kensington Security Slot

To regain the features of an optical drive users can either use a separately available external USB SuperDrive or the bundled Remote Disc software to access the optical drive of another computer However this method only allows for disk browsing or software installation DVD movies or CDs cannot be watched or listened to The Remote Disc capability is achieved by the computer wirelessly accessing the optical drive of another Mac or Windows PC that has the Remote Disc program installed It can also be used to reinstall the system software from the included installation DVD Remote Disc supports netbooting so MacBook Air can boot from its installation DVD in another computers drive This feature requires Remote Install Mac OS X to be running on the remote computer The software does not allow the playback or information of DVDs or CDs nor does it allow the installation of Microsoft Windows For these features an external USB drive is required A single speaker located under the keyboard is included for mono sound

The MacBook Air includes Mac OS X Snow Leopard pre installed along with Apples iLife multimedia suite Apples iWork work suite similar to Microsoft Office is also available with the purchase of the computer with an extra charge

With the 2008 changes to the notebook wired Ethernet connectivity required a separately available USB to Ethernet adapter However for the 2009 revision the adapter is included in the box Additionally in the 2008 revision the hard drive graphics front side bus processor memory battery and port connections were upgraded

The MacBook Air was greeted with mixed reception when it was introduced The portability of the MacBook Air was praised in reviews however the compromise in features was criticized The full sized keyboard weight of three pounds thinness and Multi Touch trackpad were appreciated in reviews while the limited configuration options slow speed non user replaceable battery small hard drive and price were criticized

Dan Ackerman of CNET commented on the original models the design and engineering that went into MacBook Air is extraordinary but its certainly a much more specialized product than the standard 13 inch MacBook Ackerman disliked the limited internet connectivity slow speed small hard drive battery and the price of SSD hard drive option however appreciated the thinness sturdiness and the MultiTouch gestures Macworlds Jason Snell praised the portability however commented that the decision about whether the MacBook Air is a product worth having can be answered by 1 question How much are you willing to compromise

The flip down hatch on the side of MacBook Air is a tight fit for some headphone plugs and USB devices requiring users to purchase an extension cable Apple has removed the flip down hatch on the Late 2010 model in favor of open connection ports as on other Macbooks Since the release of the first generation product some MacBook Air users have complained of overheating that caused CPU lockup The effect can be seen at CPU temperatures as low as convert150FC and worsens with higher temperatures Apple released a software update in early March 2008 to fix the problem with mixed results the deactivation of 1 CPU core appears to have been corrected however the runaway kernel problem remains for at least some users The problem is aggravated by system intensive tasks such as video playback or video chatting

Boatengs mother is German his father was from Ghana He began to play football at Tennis Borussia Berlin and came to the youth teams of Hertha BSC Berlin in 2002 On 31 January 2007 he had his first Bundesliga match against Hannover 96 His half brother Kevin Prince Boateng played also for Hertha BSC at that time

In 2007 Boateng came to Hamburger SV In season 2008 09 he played with them in the semi finals of DFB Pokal and UEFA Cup but lost both times against SV Werder Bremen 

Boateng was a member of the German Under 21 team who won the UEFA Under 21 European Championship in June 2009 On 10 October 2009 he had his first match in Germanys senior football team against Russia There he had to leave the football field when he saw his second yellow card after 69 minutes

Hertha BSC is a German football club based in Berlin They started in 1892 Hertha Berlin was one of the founding clubs of the DFB in Leipzig in 1900

BFC Hertha 92 was formed in 1892 Its name and team colours were taken from a steamship with a blue and white funnel One of the men who founded the club had taken a day trip on this ship with his father Hertha is a variation on the name Nerthus a Germanic fertility goddess

Hertha always played well but were not financially successful They won the first Berlin championship final in 1905 Because of money troubles in 1920 Hertha merged with the richer Berliner Sport Club to form Hertha Berliner Sport Club The new team was still successful but never the best Hertha BSC was in the German championship final every year from 1926 to 1930 but were only able to win in 1930 Hertha and BSC split in 1930 and Hertha won the championship again in 1931

Hertha was Germanys second most successful team during the inter war years

German football was re organized under the Third Reich in 1933 into sixteen top flight divisions which saw Hertha playing in the Gauliga Berlin Brandenburg The club continued to be successful in their division regularly finishing in the upper half of the table and capturing the divisional title in 1935 1937 and 1944 However they did not do well nationally and never got past the early rounds of the national championshipships

After World War II occupying Allied authorities banned most organisations in Germany including sports and football clubs Hertha restarted at the end of 1945 as SG Gesundbrunnen and resumed play in the Oberliga Berlin  Gruppe C The thirty six teams of the first season of the postwar Oberliga Berlin were reduced to just 12 the next year and the club found itself out of first division football and playing in the Amateurliga Berlin By the end of 1949 they had become Hertha BSC Berlin again

In the 194950 season the Soviets would not allow Hertha to play against East German teams because they had signed some players and a coach who had left the Dresden club SG Friedrichstadt for West Berlin A number of sides from the eastern half of the city were forced from the Oberliga Berlin to the newly established DDR Liga beginning with the 1950 51 season

Throughout the 1950s there was a rivalry with Tennis Borussia Berlin but the idea of the two merger between the two clubs in 1958 was rejected

Hertha was a founder of the Bundesliga in 1963 and was Berlins reigning champion But Herth was demoted after the 1964 65 season because the club had tried to bribe players to play in the city after the Berlin Wall had been built and players did not want to move to the city To keep a Berlin team in the Bundesliga Tasmania 1900 Berlin were promoted instead Tasmania were the worst side ever in the Bundesliga history Hertha returned to the Bundesliga in 1968 69 and became Berlins favourite side

Hertha had to sell the teams former home ground in 1974 when investigations about the match fixing scandal of 1971 showed that the club was 6 million DM in debt

The team continued to enjoy a fair measure of success during the 70s but gradually slipped down into the third tier Amateur Oberliga Berlin where they spent two seasons

After two turns in the Bundesliga Hertha was immediately relegated after poor performances Herthas amateur side was more successful getting to the final of the German Cup in 1993 where they lost 01 to Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen

By 1994 Hertha BSC was 10 million DM in debt More land had to be sold and a new sponsor and management team were found By 1997 Hertha got back into the Bundesliga The y were the first Berlin club in 10 years to be in the top division Since then they have generally finished in the top third of the Bundesliga

Most recently bright spots for the side have been a continuous string of appearances in international play in the UEFA Cup and the UEFA Champions League beginning in the 1999 season and the signing of players such as Sebastian Deisler and Brazilian international Marcelinho named the Bundesligas player of the year in May of 2005 Hertha has also invested heavily in its own youth football academy which has produced several players with Bundesliga potential

The team was close to relegation in the 2003 04 season but managed to finished 4th the following season Hertha only missed out on the Champions League after they were held to a draw on the final day by Hannover 96 which saw Werder Bremen over take them for the spot on the final day As a thank you gesture Werder sent the Hannover squad ninety six bottles of champagne In 2005 06 the Herthaner finished 6th and qualified for the UEFA Cup by defeating FK Moskva in the Intertoto Cup

Hertha BSC plays its matches in Berlins Olympiastadion It is biggest stadium in Germany except for Borussia Dortmunds Westfalenstadion

The Olympiastadion hosts the annual German Cup final and was the site for six matches of the 2006 FIFA World Cup as well as the tournament final

From 1904 to 1963 Herthas home ground was the Plumpe in Weddings Gesundbrunnen district A new stadium was built there in 1923 BSC left that site when it joined the Bundesliga in 1963 It was the sale of the Plumpe site in 1974 helped the club avoid bankruptcy

The Mandelbrot set named after Benot Mandelbrot is a famous example of a fractal It begins with this equation zn1 zn2 c where c and z are complex numbers and n is zero or a positive integer Starting with z00 c is in the Mandelbrot set if the absolute value of zn never exceeds a certain number however large n gets An equivalent definition of the M set is the set of all complex numbers c such that the Julia Set of c is connected

For example if c 1 then the sequence is 0 1 2 5 26 which goes to infinity Therefore 1 is not an element of the Mandelbrot set

On the other hand if c is equal to the square root of 1 also known as i then the sequence is 0 i i i which does not go to infinity and so i belongs to the Mandelbrot set 

When graphed the Mandelbrot set is very pretty and recognizable

A generalization of Mandelbrot sets allows any exponent zn1 znd c These sets are called Multibrot sets The Multibrot set for d 2 is the Mandelbrot set

Heredity is the passing of traits from parents to offspring In biology the study of heredity is called genetics With most living things heredity is analysed by breeding often in a laboratory But with humans heredity is studied in other ways Family pedigrees identical twins and DNA genome analysis all provide clues

A trait which may be inherited is heritable

Variation in biology usually refers to the heritable differences within a species This is important in genetics and the study of evolution in natural populations Heritable variation is ultimately caused by mutations of genes and chromosomes and shuffled by recombination Outcrossing maintains and inbreeding reduces heritable variation

Variation is a also term used in biodiversity for the variety of life forms in a given ecosystem

Robert Remak was a PolishGerman embryologist physiologist and neurologist born in Posen Prussia Dr Remak obtained his medical degree from Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin in 1838 specializing in neurology He worked on embryology and also discovered unmyelinated nerve fibres and the nerve cells in the heart sometimes called Remaks ganglia He studied under Johannes Muller at the University of Berlin 

Remak discovered that the origin of cells was by the division of pre existing cells 

Despite his accomplishments because of his Jewish faith he was repeatedly denied full professor status until late in life and even then was denied the usual benefits of the position

Oscar Hertwig was a German zoologist and professor who also wrote about the theory of evolution over 55 years after Charles Darwins The Origin of Species 

Oscar Hertwig was a leader in the field of embryology He discovered fertilization of sea urchins he recognized the role of the cell nucleus during inheritance and chromosome reduction during meiosis In 1876 he found that fertilization includes the penetration of a spermatozoon into an egg cell He thought correctly that the vectors of hereditary traits resided in the nuclei of the egg and sperm

His work on the development of sea urchin eggs was fundamental and lasting his work on evolution was not He was opposed to chance as he thought was Charles Darwins theory He wrote Das Werden der Organismen eine Widerlegung der Darwinschen Zufallslehre

Hertwig was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1903

Walther Flemming was a German biologist and a founder of cytogenetics

Making use of dyes he was able to find a structure which he named chromatin He identified that chromatin was correlated to threadlike structures in the cell nucleus the chromosomes Edouard Van Beneden had also observed them independently 

Flemming investigated the process of cell division and the distribution of chromosomes to the daughter nuclei a process he called mitosis from the Greek word for thread However he did not see the splitting into identical halves the daughter chromatids He studied mitosis both in life and in stained preparations using as the source of biological material the fins and gills of salamanders These results were published first in 1878 and in 1882 in the seminal book Zellsubstanz Kern und Zelltheilung On the basis of his discoveries Flemming surmised for the first time that all cell nuclei came from another predecessor nucleus

Flemming was unaware of Gregor Mendels work on heredity so he did not make the connection between his observations and genetic inheritance Two decades would pass before the significance of Flemmings work was truly realized with the rediscovery of Mendels rules His discovery of mitosis and chromosomes is considered one of the 100 most important scientific discoveries of all times and one of the 10 most important discoveries in cell biology

Eduard Adolf Strasburger was a Polish German professor who was one of the most famous botanists of the 19th century

In 1868 he taught at the University of Warsaw In 1869 Strasburger was appointed professor of botany at the University of Jena After 1881 he was head of the Botanisches Institut at the University of Bonn 

Strasburger was a founder of the famous Lehrbuch der Botanik fr Hochschulen which first appeared in 1894 He was the first to provide an accurate description of the embryonic sac in gymnosperms and angiosperms along with demonstrating double fertilization in angiosperms He came up with one of the modern laws of plant cytology New cell nuclei can only arise from the division of other nuclei and originated the terms cytoplasm and nucleoplasm

At about the same time as Walther Flemming and Edouard van Beneden he worked out chromosome movement during mitosis in plant cells His work on the upward movement of tree sap proved that the process was physical and not physiological

He was awarded the Linnean Societys prestigious Darwin Wallace Medal in 1908

Edouard Joseph Marie Van Beneden cytologist and marine biologist He was professor of zoology at the University of Lige He contributed to cytology and genetics by his work on the roundworm Ascaris In this work he discovered how chromosomes combined during meiosis during the production of gametes

Beneden discovered with Walther Flemming and Eduard Strasburger the essential facts of mitosis In contrast to meiosis the double set of chromosomes in daughter cells is identical to those in the parent cells Excepting rare accidents there is no change in the genetic apparatus

In meiosis only one set of chromosomes ends up in each gamete a condition called haploid

Genetic linkage occurs when alleles at different loci do not segregate at random Mendels second law is thus broken 

Genes are linked when they are on the same chromosome They then tend to stay together during meiosis Alleles for genes on different chromosomes are usually not linked due to independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis 

There is some crossing over of DNA during meiosis when the chromosomes segregate So alleles on the same chromosome can be separated and go to different daughter cells There is a greater probability of this happening if the alleles are far apart on the chromosome as it is more likely that a cross over will occur between them The relative distance between two genes can be calculated using the offspring of an organism showing two linked genetic traits The percentage of offspring where the two traits do not run together is noted The higher the percentage of offspring showing both traits the closer on the chromosome the two genes are 

This was the first technique used for mapping genes on chromosomes By working out the number of recombinants it is possible to obtain a measure for the distance between the genes This distance is called a genetic map unit or a centimorgan and is defined as the distance between genes for which one product of meiosis in 100 is recombinant A recombinant frequency of 1 is equivalent to 1 mu A linkage map is created by finding the map distances between a number of traits that are present on the same chromosome ideally avoiding significant gaps between traits to avoid the possibility of multiple crossovers

Wilhelm Roux was a German zoologist and pioneer of experimental embryology

For ten years he worked in Breslau becoming director of his own Institute of Embryology in 1879 He was professor at Innsbruck Austria from 188995 then accepted a professorial chair at the Anatomical Institute of the University of Halle a post he retained until 1921

Rouxs research was based upon the notion of Entwicklungsmechanik or developmental mechanics His methodology was to interfere with developing embryos and observe the outcome Rouxs investigations were performed mainly on frogs eggs to research the earliest structures in amphibian development His goal was to show Darwinian processes at work on the cellular level

In 1888 Roux published the results of a series of defect experiments in which he took 2 and 4 cell frog embryos and killed half of the cells of each embryo with a hot needle He reported that they grew into half embryos and surmised that the separate function of the two cells had already been determined This led him to propose his mosaic theory after a few cell divisions the embryo would be like a mosaic each cell playing its own unique part in the entire design 

After a few years Rouxs theory was refuted by the studies of his colleague Hans Driesch and later with more precision Hans Spemann showed that as a rule Drieschs conclusions were correct but that results like Rouxs may be obtained after intervention in certain planes Despite this early lapse Rouxs pioneering mechanical methodology was to prove most fruitful in 20th century biology

In a remarkable paper Roux realised the significance of the linear structure of chromosomes Their splitting into two equal longitudinal halves assured each daughter cell got the same chromosome complement Therefore chromosomes were the bearers of heredity This was a significant event in cytogenetics

The Synod of Dort was a national council that took place in 1618 1619 in the town of Dordrecht in the Netherlands The Dutch Reformed Church held the meeting in order to discuss a very important issue in the Dutch churches that begin with the teachings of Jacobus Arminius and the rise of Arminianism The first meeting was on November 13 1618 and the last meeting which was the 154th took place on May 9 1619 

Members from the Reformed churches in eight different countries were also invited to this meeting The name Dort is the English name for the Dutch town of Dordrecht and is still used as the pronunciation of the name today This synod or meeting is usually called the Synod of Dordt or the Synod of Dordrecht

The reason that this meeting was called was to settle an issue that had just been brought up in the Dutch churches after the spread of Arminianism After Jacob Arminius died people that believed the same way that he did objected to the Belgic Confession and the teachings of John Calvin and Theodore Beza Arminiuss followers published their problems with the Confession in a paper called The Remonstrance of 1610 The followers of the things listed in this document were called Remonstrants Calvinists who followed the teachings of John Calvin became known as Contra Remonstrants

In The Remonstrance and some later writing the Arminians wrote about an alternative to the Calvinist Belgic Confession and mentioned several things that they disagreed with They taught election on the basis of God knowing who would have faith a universal atonement resistible grace and the possibility of walking away from grace Simon Episopius was the speaker for the 13 members of the Remonstrants who were called to the Synod in 1618

The meetings concluded with the views of the Remonstrants being rejected and set out the Reformed doctrine on each of the points These are sometimes called the Five points of Calvinism and are remembered by the five letters TULIP

The Decision of the Synod of Dort on the Five Main Points of Doctrine in Dispute in the Netherlands known as the Canons of Dort is the reasoning behind the decisions made by the Synod 

The Canons are not supposed to be an absolute explanation of the Reformed doctrine but only explain the five points of doctrine that were being argued over

Jacobus Arminius is the Latin name of the Dutch theologian Jakob Harmenszoon He is also known by the names of Jacob Arminius or James Arminius Arminius was a professor of theology at the University of Leiden from 1603 until he died in 1609 He wrote many books and papers on theology which is the study of God and his views became the basis for the Dutch Remonstrants

After he died his views on theology were most widely known for being the opposite of the five points of Calvinism though Arminius only objected to three unconditional election limited atonement and irresistible grace and he doubted the perseverance of the saints His view on total depravity agreed with John Calvin only changing the view held by Calvinists a little bit

Arminius was born at Oudewater Utrecht His father Herman died when Arminius was a baby leaving his wife as a single mother with small children Theodorus Aemilius a priest adopted Jacobus and sent him to school at Utrecht His mother was killed by the Spanish in Oudewater in 1575 About that same year the kindness of his friends allowed him to go study theology at the University of Leiden

Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev was a Russian writer most famous for his novel Fathers and Sons

Turgenev was born into a rich land owning family in Oryol Russia on 9 November 1818 His father died when Turgenev was sixteen He and his brother Nicholas were brought up by their mother She did not treat them well

Turgenev went to the University of Moscow for one year and then moved to the University of Saint Petersburg where he studied Classics and Russian Literature In 1838 he went to the University of Berlin to study Philosophy and History Turgenev liked Germany and thought Russia should change their social system to be more like Germanys

The 1840s and 1850s were hard times for writers and artists in Russia The political system did not allow them to express themselves as they wanted to Many intelligent Russians left the country and went to England France and Germany In 1852 Turgenev himself was put in prison for a month for praising Nikolai Gogol a famous Russian writer who had been criticised by the ruling powers in the country In 1854 Turgenev moved to Western Europe and started writing his novel Rudin which complained about the Russia of the 1840s and 1850s 

The political system in Russia changed in 1855 when Alexander II took over power from his father Nicholas I Writers and artists had more freedom from this time In 1860 one of Turgenevs most famous novels First Love was published

In 1862 Fathers and Sons Turgenevs most famous novel appeared Many people did not like the novel which upset Turgenev and he began to write less

Smoke was published in 1867 but again was not popular in Russia 

In 1879 he received an honorary degree from the University of Oxford in England

In later life Turgenev did not live in Russia much He lived either at Baden Baden or Paris often near the singer Pauline Viardot who he was having an affair with He never married but he did have a daughter with one of his familys servants

Turgenev died near Paris on 3 September 1883 On his deathbed he told Leo Tolstoy to start writing again

Turgenev had an awkward relationship with two other famous Russian writers Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky Tolstoy and Dostoevsky criticised Turgenev for liking Western Europe and its literature more than Russian literature Turgenev was also close to the French writer Gustave Flaubert

Hogar CREA is a group started in Puerto Rico in 1968 by Javier Garcia Rios CheJuan It spread to several Latin American countries and to the US in the early 80s but is on the decline in the US 

CREA is based on the idea of who to better treat drug addiction than an addict Many people believe that it is a money making scam

Photorespiration or photo respiration is a process in plant metabolism A sugar has oxygen added to it by the enzyme instead of carbon dioxide during normal photosynthesis This process reduces efficiency of photosynthesis

Photorespiration can occur when carbon dioxide levels are low for example when the stomata are closed to prevent water loss during drought In most plants photorespiration increases as temperature increases Photorespiration produces no ATP and leads to a net loss of carbon and nitrogen slowing plant growth

Boogey Ball is an electronic toy made by Hasbro in 1999 The game is similar to Bop It but it does not contain any inputs It uses 3 different colored LED lights orange green and red When the game is turned on a recorded voice says You turn me on baby lets boogey Whats your game baby the game also has a yellow button and it is pressed to choose a game select number of players and when everyone is ready to start playing 

There are six diffrent types of games in boogey ball One of them is where you have to chase the yellow light which can move if is not found in a number of seconds The game lasts up to 30 seconds folloewd by two short symbols and one long symbol There are other games where you have to avoid the red light chase the yellow light and avoid the red following his commands and following the pattern

Friedrich Leopold August Weismann was a German evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr ranked him the second most notable evolutionary theorist of the 19th century after Charles Darwin Weismann is much admired today Ernst Mayr judged him to be one of the great biologists of all time

Weismann advocated the germ plasm theory according to which inheritance only takes place by means of the germ cellsthe gametes such as egg cells and sperm cells Other cells of the bodysomatic cellsdo not function as agents of heredity The effect is one way germ cells produce somatic cells and more germ cells the germ cells are not affected by anything the somatic cells learn or any ability the body acquires during its life Genetic information cannot pass from soma to germ plasm and on to the next generation This is referred to as the Weismann barrier This idea if true rules out the inheritance of acquired characteristics as proposed by Lamarck

The idea of the Weismann barrier is central to the Modern evolutionary synthesis though it is not expressed today in the same terms In Weismanns opinion the largely random process of mutation which must occur in the gametes is the only source of change for natural selection to work on Weismann was one of the first biologists to deny the inheritance of acquired characters entirely Weismanns ideas preceded the rediscovery of Gregor Mendels work and though Weismann was cagey about accepting Mendelism younger workers soon made the connection 

Weismanns work on the demarkation between germ line and soma can scarcely be appreciated without considering the work of German biologists during the second half of the 19th century This was the time that the mechanisms of cell division began to be understood Eduard Strasburger Walther Flemming and the Belgian Edouard Van Beneden laid the basis for the cytology and cytogenetics of the 20th century Strasburger the outstanding botanical physiologist of that century coined the terms nucleus and cytoplasm He said new cell nuclei can only arise from the division of other cell nuclei Van Beneden discovered how chromosomes combined at meiosis during the production of gametes Walther Flemming the founder of cytogenetics named mitosis and pronounced omne nucleus e nuclei The discovery of mitosis meiosis and chromosomes is regarded as one of the 100 most important scientific discoveries of all times and one of the 10 most important discoveries in cell biology

Meiosis was discovered and described for the first time in sea urchin eggs in 1876 by Oscar Hertwig It was described again in 1883 at the level of chromosomes by Van Beneden in Ascaris eggs The significance of meiosis for reproduction and inheritance however was first described in 1890 by Weismann who noted that two cell divisions were necessary to transform one diploid cell into four haploid cells if the number of chromosomes had to be maintained Thus the work of the earlier cytologists laid the ground for Weismann who turned his mind to the consequences for evolution which was an aspect the cytologists had not addressed All this took place before the work of Mendel had been rediscovered

His work with sea urchins showed that it was necessary to have all chromosomes present in order for proper development of the embryo to take place This discovery was an important part of the Boveri Sutton chromosome theory His other significant discovery was the centrosome which he described as the especial organ of cell division Boveri also discovered the phenomenon of chromatin diminution during embryonic development of the nematode Parascaris 

19021904 Boveri in a series of papers drew attention to the correspondence between the behaviour of chromosomes and the results obtained by Mendel He said that chromosomes were independent entities which retain their independence even in the resting nucleus What comes out of the nucleus is what goes into it

In 1903 Walter Sutton suggested that chromosomes which segregate in a Mendelian fashion are hereditary units EB Wilson who was Suttons teacher called this the SuttonBoveri hypothesis

Boveri reasoned that a cancerous tumor begins with a single cell in which the make up of its chromosomes becomes scrambled causing the cells to divide uncontrollably

It was only later that researchers such as Thomas Hunt Morgan showed that Boveri was correct

Sir Fred Hoyle was an English astronomer He is noted mainly for being the first man to think of the idea that nuclear fusion might happen in stars like our Sun In addition to his work as an astronomer Hoyle was a writer of science fiction including a number of books co written with his son Geoffrey Hoyle Fred Hoyle gave the Big Bang theory that name

Edmund Beecher Wilson was a pioneering American zoologist and cell biologist He wrote one of the most famous textbooks in the history of modern biology The Cell

Wilson graduated from Yale in 1878 He earned his doctorate at Johns Hopkins in 1881 He was a lecturer at Williams College in 188384 and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 188485 He served as professor of biology at Bryn Mawr College from 1885 to 1891 

He spent the balance of his career at Columbia University where he was successively adjunct professor of biology professor of invertebrate zoology and professor of zoology 

Wilson is credited as Americas first cell biologist In 1898 he used the similarity in embryos to describe evolutionary relationships By observing spiral cleavage in molluscs flatworms and annelids he concluded that the same organs came from the same group of cells and concluded that all these organisms must have a common ancestor 

He also discovered the chromosomal XY sex determination system in 1905that males have XY and females XX sex chromosomes Nettie Stevens independently made the same discovery the same year

In 1907 he described for the first time the additional or supernumerary chromosomes now called B chromosomes

Professor Wilson published many papers on embryology and served as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1913 

The American Society for Cell Biology annually awards the EB Wilson Medal in his honour

19021904 Theodor Boveri a German biologist in a series of papers drew attention to the correspondence between the behaviour of chromosomes and the results obtained by Mendel He said that chromosomes were independent entities which retain their independence even in the resting nucleus What comes out of the nucleus is what goes into it

In 1903 Walter Sutton suggested that chromosomes which segregate in a Mendelian fashion are hereditary units Wilson who was Suttons teacher called this the SuttonBoveri hypothesis

Reginald Crundall Punnett FRS was a British geneticist He became Professor of Biology and then Professor of Genetics at the University of Cambridge

He co founded with William Bateson the Journal of Genetics in 1910 Punnett is probably best remembered today as the creator of the Punnett square a tool still used by biologists to predict the probability of possible genotypes of offspring His Mendelism is sometimes said to have been the first textbook on genetics it was probably the first popular science book to introduce genetics to the public

Reginald Punnett was born in 1875 in the town of Tonbridge in Kent England While recovering from a childhood bout of appendicitis Punnett became acquainted with Jardines Naturalists Library and developed an interest in natural history 

Attending the University of Cambridge Punnett earned a degree in zoology in 1898 and a masters in 1902 Between these degrees he worked as a demonstrator and part time lecturer at the University of St Andrews Natural History Department However by 1902 Punnett was back at Cambridge working in zoology primarily the study of nematode worms It was during this time that he and William Bateson began a research collaboration which lasted several years

When Punnett was an undergraduate Gregor Mendels work on inheritance was largely unknown and unappreciated by scientists However in 1900 Mendels work was rediscovered William Bateson became a proponent of Mendelian genetics and had Mendels work translated into English It was with Bateson that Reginald Punnett helped establish the new science of genetics at Cambridge He and Bateson co discovered genetic linkage through experiments with chickens and pea plants

In 1908 unable to explain how a dominant gene would not become fixed and ubiquitous in a population Punnett introduced his problem to the mathematician G H Hardy with whom he played cricket Hardy went on to formulate what became known as the HardyWeinberg law

In 1910 Punnett became professor of biology at Cambridge and then the first Arthur Balfour Professor of Genetics when Bateson left in 1912 In the same year Punnett was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society He received the societys Darwin Medal in 1922

During World War I Punnett successfully applied his expertise to the problem of the early determination of gender in chickens Since only females were used for egg production early identification of male chicks which were destroyed or separated for fattening meant that limited animal feed and other resources could be used more efficiently Punnetts work in this area was summarized in Heredity in Poultry

Punnett squares are used by biologists to determine the probability of offspring having a particular genotype

If B represents the allele for having black hair and b represents the allele for having white hair the offspring of two Bb parents would have a 25 probability of having two white hair alleles 50 of having one of each and 25 of having only black hair alleles The phenotype of the offspring would depend on whether and to what extent one of the alleles was dominant

The Canons of Dort also called the Canons of Dordrecht is the ruling of the National Synod that took place in the Dutch city of Dordrecht from 1618 1619 Dordrecht is often called Dort in English

Today the Canons of Dort are part of the Three Forms of Unity which is one of the confession standards of many of the Reformed churches around the world The Reformed churches continued use of the Canons as a standard keeps the Reformed churches from being in full harmony with the followers of Jacob Arminius the Remonstrants and the Dutch Reformed Churches who disagree with the Canons

The Canons are not supposed to be an absolute explanation of the Reformed doctrine but only explain the five points of doctrine that were being argued over These Canons introduced the Five Points of Calvinism

The Three Forms of Unity is the name that is given to the Belgic Confession the Canons of Dort and the Heidelberg Catechism These three works that are about the doctrinal concerns of Continental Calvinism are considered official statements of Church doctrine by many of the Reformed churches

From 1618 to 1619 the Dutch government acting for the Dutch Reformed Church called a series of meetings that would come to be called the Synod of Dort Members from the Netherlands and twenty seven members from eight other countries met at this Synod to discuss and come to an agreement on their views This agreement is known as the Canons of Dort

This meeting then added the Canons of Dort to two other documents the Belgic Confession and the Heidelberg Catechism which were both commonly used by the Dutch Church at this time 

The reasons that they chose to do this were

The different forms each serve different things

Total depravity is a theological teaching that comes from Augustines teachings on original sin It is the teaching that since the Fall of Man every person who has been born into the world is a slave of sin and without the irresistible grace of God it is not possible for man to choose to follow God or accept salvation as He freely offers it

Total depravity is taught by many Protestant confessions of faith including Lutheranism and Methodism Arminianism and Calvinism

The Dordrecht Confession of Faith is a statement of faith that was created by Dutch Mennonite leaders at a meeting in Dordrecht Netherlands on April 21 1632 It has 18 articles of faith that talk about the importance of salvation through Jesus Christ baptism nonviolence feet washing and not taking oaths

It was a very important part of the Radical Reformation and is still a very important document to many Anabaptist groups today such as the Amish In 1725 Jacob Gottshalk with with sixteen other ministers from Pennsylvania and together they created the Dutch Mennonite Dordrecht Confession of Faith

Xerophytes are plants which are adapted to drydesert areas To survive these harsh conditions they have special features For example a cactus has white hairs which help to prevent water loss Another example are Manzanita plants which have a thick waxy coating and keep their leaves vertical to the sun

Some Xerophytic plants sit out a drought They can still extract water from soil They may have very salty cell sap and therefore a very low water potential in the roots they may have very extensive or deep roots or may pick up the slightest dew and survive on that

Others have special features about their shape or structure Thick waxy cuticle hairy surfaces dense packing of leaves reduced leaf size reduced density of stomata pitted and grooved position of stomata Water storage in stem and tubers etc They may also protect this water store from animals by spines and chemicals

Hansa Rostock is a football club from Rostock Mecklenburg Vorpommern The club plays in German 2 Bundesliga

The club was founded on 1 November 1954 multi sport Sportclub Empor Rostock Because it was not possible to find enough players for the football team the team of Empor Lauter was transferred to Rostock This was common in the German Democratic Republic Rostock took the place of Lauter in the first league The re organization of East German sports in 1965 led to the associations football department becoming independent as Fuball Club Hansa Rostock The new club was named Hansa to remember northern Europes Hanseatic League Rostock was an important member there 

After the reunification of Germany Hansa played together with Dynamo Dresden in the German Bundesliga They were relegated but came back Their best result in the Bundesliga was 2 times a 6th place

FC Red Bull Salzburg is a football club which plays in Austrias top league the Austrian Bundesliga The club was known as SV Austria Salzburg until 2005 when the club was bought by the Red Bull Company They renamed the club and changed the colours from the traditional violet to red and white Also the companys logo was added The club runs two academies in Ghana and in Brazil The homeground of the club is the EM Stadion Wals  Siezenheim which was built for the European Championship 2008

The football club was started on September 13 1933 by the unification of the two clubs FC Rapid Salzburg and FC Hertha Salzburg Background was to form a second club from Salzburg which was able to play successfully in the newly formed league with Upper Austria During the time of the Nazi occupation of Germany the club was able to compete with SAK 1914 As Salzburgs champion they played for the promotion to the Gauliga Ostmark the highest class then But they failed During the Second World War they formed together with 1 Salzburger SK 1919 and SAK 1914 the Fuballgemeinschaft Salzburg After the end of the waar they started again as SV Austria Salzburg

195253 they reached for the first time the A Liga the name of the highest division of Austrian football then beating Kapfenberger SV in the play offs Three seasons they played there but came back 1959 To stay in the league they signed Erich Probst who was the second best scorer in the FIFA World Cup 1954 In only 20 matches he scored 14 goals so Austria stayed in the league He was also the first player of SV Austria who played for the Austrian national football team The next years were characterized by ups and downs The first success was the second place in the 197172 season The same year they made the Lehener Stadion to their homeground

The best years of the club were between 1990 and 1997 In these years the club reached the championship three times and played in the UEFA Cup final 199394 versus Inter Mailand In 2005 the Red Bull Company bought the club because the owners were having problems with money Some traditional fans left the club and started a new club under the old name SV Austria Salzburg Ever since 2005 the club has been named FC Red Bull Salzburg

One of the aims of the new owners was to form a team which can play in the UEFA Champions League regularly This was not reached but the new club was nevertheless successful In the national league they reached three titles and were three times second In the 200910 UEFA euro League the club won the group stage with 6 victories over FC Villarreal Lazio Rom and Lewski Sofia In the Round of 32 they lost versus Standard Lttich Also the next two Euro League group stages were reached In the 201112 Euro League they reached the second place in the group stage behind Atletico Bilbao

In UEFA matches the club is called FC Salzburg due to sponsorship reasons

Curt Stern was a German American geneticist Born in Hamburg Germany he studied zoology at the University of Berlin receiving his PhD in 1923 at the age of 21 He was selected for a fellowship to study at Columbia University then the site of Thomas Hunt Morgans famous drosophila fly room

 Early career  Stern accepted an appointment at the University of Berlin after his fellowship ended In 1931 he was the first to demonstrate crossover of homologous chromosomes in Drosophila melanogaster only weeks after Barbara McClintock and Harriet Creighton had done so with maize

Stern eventually returned to the United States in 1932 He became an American citizen in 1939 From 1933 to 1947 he taught at the University of Rochester From 1947 until his retirement in 1970 he was a professor at the University of California Berkeley where he had numerous doctoral students 

In 1936 he demonstrated that recombination can also take place in mitosis resulting in somatic mosaics organisms that contain two or more genetically distinct types of tissues He later demonstrated that there were multiple genes on the Drosophila Y chromosome and described the mechanism of dosage compensation 

During World War II he led research for the American government on low dose radiation safety His laboratory group concluded that there is no safe threshold below which radiation is not harmful 

After the war his research focused on human genetics pioneering in what is now known as gene regulation Although not a physician he engaged in clinical work in human genetics In 1943 he began teaching a course in human genetics to medical students at the University of Rochester The first edition of Sterns pioneering textbook The Principles of human genetics was published in 1949 Both his teaching and his textbook were instrumental in re founding human genetics on a non racist basis in contrast with pre war German and American traditions in the subject Stern was a signatory of the 1950 UNESCO statement The Race Question a statement by leading scientists in many fields that questioned the validity and scientific foundations of racism

The Curt Stern Award established by the American Society of Human Genetics in 2001 recognizes a scientist who has made major scientific achievements in human genetics during the previous 10 years

Following the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance in 1900 Morgans research moved to the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster In his famous Fly Room at Columbia University Morgan was able to show that genes are carried on chromosomes and are the mechanical basis of heredity These discoveries formed the basis of the modern science of genetics 

He was given the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1933 It was the first one given for genetics for his discoveries concerning the role played by the chromosome in heredity The prize was not shared with the labs main researcher Alfred Sturtevant

Morgans early work with Drosophila was on the associations known as coupling and repulsion discovered by English workers in 1909 and 1910 using the Sweet Pea These were in reality the same phenomenon which was later called linkage Morgans first papers dealt with the demonstration of sex linkage of the gene for white eyes in the fly the male fly being heterogametic 

During his distinguished career Morgan wrote 22 books and 370 scientific papers and as a result of his work Drosophila became a major model organism in genetics The Division of Biology he started at the California Institute of Technology produced seven Nobel Prize winners

Alfred Henry Sturtevant was an American geneticist Sturtevant made the first genetic map of a chromosome in 1913 In his career he worked on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster with Thomas Hunt Morgan 

Morgan was both a help and a hindrance to Sturtevant Morgan supported him through the early part of his career but took much of the credit for the research Morgans Nobel Prize in 1933 was not shared with Sturtevant who was the labs main researcher

Later in his career Sturtevant had another important relationship this time with Theodosius Dobzhansky The research was into the genetics of natural populations of Drosophila This relationship too became uneasy and they split up after a few years Sturtevant was one of the most outstanding genetics researchers not to get a Nobel Prize In 1967 Sturtevant received the National Medal of Science

Hermann Joseph Muller generally known as HJ Muller was an American geneticist educator and Nobel laureate He was best known for his work on the physiological and genetic effects of radiation as well as his outspoken political beliefs Muller frequently warned of the long term dangers of radioactive fallout from nuclear explosions

Mullers life was as extraordinary as could be imagined Born in New York City he got his PhD at CalTech in Morgans Drosophila fly lab He next worked at Rice University and then spent twelve years at the University of Texas Then he moved to Berlin in 1932 then to Leningrad and then to Moscow In all these places he organised a genetics lab and sometimes taught as well Then arose the scientific charlatan Lysenko who saw to it that genuine genetics scientists came under the disapproval of Stalin Once again Muller moved this time to Edinburgh with 250 strains of Drosophila then finally back to the United States in 1940 where he became an advisor to the Manhattan Project He became Professor of Zoology at Indiana University

Mullers Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1946 was for the discovery that mutations can be induced by X rays By then the real interest lay in the same effects caused by gamma rays from nuclear testing Muller was a wholehearted enthusiast for eugenics socialism atheism and other relatively unpopular ideas but his real contribution was to genetics One reputable source writes of him

Alice Ivers better known as Poker Alice was a famous poker player Her family moved from Devon England where she was born to Virginia United States where she went to school and was raised As an adult Ivers moved to Leadville Colorado where she met her husband Frank Duffield Duffield was responsible for getting Ivers interested in poker but he was killed a few years after they got married Ivers made a name for herself by winning money from poker games in places like Silver City New Mexico and even working at a saloon that was owned by Bob Ford the man who killed Jesse James 

Poker Alice Ivers was born on February 17 1851 in Devon England to Irish Immigrants Her family moved to Virginia when Alice was 12 As a young woman she went to boarding school in Virginia to become a refined lady While in her late teens her family moved to Leadville a city in the Colorado Territory

It was in Leadville that Alice met Frank Duffield whom she married at a young age Frank Duffield was a mining engineer who played poker in his spare time After just a few years of marriage Duffield was killed in an accident while resetting a dynamite charge in a Leadville mine

Ivers was known for splurging her winnings as when she won a lot of money in Silver City and spent it all in New York After all of her big wins she would travel to New York and spend her money on clothes She was very keen on keeping up with the latest fashions and would buy dresses to wear to play poker

Alice met her next husband around 1890 when she was a dealer in Bedrock Toms saloon in Deadwood South Dakota When a drunken miner tried to attack her fellow dealer Warren G Tubbs with a knife Alice threatened him with her 38 After this incident Tubbs and Ivers started a romance and were married soon after

Alice Ivers and Warren Tubbs had 4 sons and 3 daughters together Tubbs and Ivers did not want their children to be influenced by the world of poker so they moved to a house just northeast of Sturgis on the Moreau River in South Dakota Tubbs was not only a dealer but a housepainter as well It was most likely this house painting that caused him to fall sick with tuberculosis Warren Tubbs died in 1910 in of pneumonia during a blizzard To pay for his funeral Alice had to pawn her wedding ring which led her back to the poker world

Alices third husband was George Huckert who worked on her homestead taking care of the sheep Huckert was constantly proposing to Ivers yet for a while she did not agree Eventually however Ivers owed Huckert 1008 so she married him figuring that it would be cheaper than paying his back wages Huckert died in 1913

First husband Frank Duffield introduced Alice to poker when she accompanied him to his poker games in Leadville For a while she just attended watching and observing but eventually she started to play and gamble along with the men However it wasnt until after her first husband died that she started to play poker seriously

Alice was in a tough financial position and after failing in a few different jobs including teaching she turned to poker to support herself financially Alice would make money by gambling and working as a dealer Ivers made a name for herself by winning money from poker games in places like Silver City New Mexico even working at a saloon that was owned by Bob Ford the man who killed Jesse James

By the time Ivers was given the name Poker Alice she was drawing in large crowd to watch her play and men were constantly challenging her to play Saloon owners liked that Ivers was a respectable woman who kept to her values These values included her refusal to play poker on Sundays

As her reputation grew so did the amount of money she was making Some nights she would even make 6000 an incredibly large sum of money at the time Alice claimed that she won 250000 which would now be worth over three million dollars

Ivers used her good looks to distract men at the poker table She always had the newest dresses and even in her 50s was considered a very attractive woman She was also very good at counting cards and figuring odds which helped her at the table

Alice was known to always be carrying a gun with her preferably her 38 She was also known to smoke a lot

In 1910 Ivers opened Pokers Palace a saloon in Fort Meade South Dakota which offered gambling and liquor downstairs and prostitution upstairs The saloon was always closed on Sundays due to Ivers religious beliefs However in 1913 some drunken soldiers disobeyed Ivers no work on Sunday rule and started to get unruly chaotic and destructive of the house It was then that Ivers shot her gun supposedly to quiet the soldiers down The shot ended up killing one of the soldiers and injuring another resulting in Ivers arrest along with the arrest of six of her girls

Ivers time spent in jail was short but she got through it with the help of reading the bible and smoking cigars At the trial she claimed self defense and was acquitted After the trial her saloon was shut down

While in her 60s Alice Ivers was arrested several times after the Poker Palace incident for being a madam a gambler and a bootlegger as well as her drunkenness She would comply with the law and pay her fines but keep her business still In 1928 she was arrested again for bootlegging and her repeated offenses of holding a brothel Despite this sentence to prison Ivers did not end up having to stay because she was pardoned by then Governor Bulow of South Dakota who did so because of her old age

After being forced to retire by the anger of the military and other people who were upset with her blend of religious elements at her house in Sturgis Alices health began to fail her Alice Ivers died on February 27 1930 in Rapid City after a gallbladder operation at the age of 79 Ivers was buried at the St Aloysius Cemetery in Sturgis South Dakota

Some people feel very strongly about abortion People who think that abortion is wrong and that the law should not allow it are called pro life People who think think the law should let women choose to have abortions are called pro choice 

People who are pro life believe that all humans including embryos and fetuses have a right to life For this reason they believe abortion is wrong sometimes comparing it to murder They think the law should make abortion a crime in order to protect embryos and fetuses However though pro life people think abortion is wrong there are special cases in which they will sometimes support allowing an abortion to happen like if the pregnancy puts the womans life at risk or if she got pregnant from rape Pro life people think women who are pregnant and do not want to raise a child should give the baby up for adoption instead of having an abortion They have started advocacy groups like the American Life League to try to convince more people to think abortion is wrong and to try to get governments to make laws to restrict abortion Sometimes people who are against abortion have used violence to try to stop abortions from happening like bombing the clinics that do abortions or shooting the people who work inside them However most people who are against abortion do not do such things and believe that they are wrong and so they try to stop abortions from happening through peaceful activism like protesting with signs outside of clinics or talking to people about abortion and why they think it is wrong

Boards of Canada are a Scottish electronic music duo of two brothers Mike Sandison and Marcus Eoin They are signed with Warp Records and have released several works on that label with little advertising and few interviews while also having a secret privately released back catalogue of albums on their self run Music70 label They have also recorded four tracks under the alias Hell Interface

Boards of Canadas music is part like the warm analog sounds of 1970s media and contains themes of childhood nostalgia and the natural world Mike and Marcus have mentioned the documentary films of the National Film Board of Canada from which the groups name is derived as a source of inspiration

Growing up in a musical family brothers Mike and Marcus Eoin began playing instruments at a young age They experimented with recording uses at around the age of 10 using tape machines to layer cut up samples of found sounds over compositions of their own In their teens they went in a number of amateur bands however it was not until 1986 when Marcus was invited to Mikes band that Boards of Canada was born By 1989 the band had gone down just to Sandison and Eoin In the early 1990s a number of collaborations took place and the band put on small shows among the Hexagon Sun collective

In early 2000 the website for the band Music70com removed the early discography of Boards of Canada although some information has been preserved by fans Early tape releases by Boards of Canada include Play By Numbers Acid Memories Hooper Bay and the earliest known release by the band is titled Catalog 3 None of the material from those days is readily available and since official Boards of Canada sources deny the existence of these albums there seems to be little chance for this early material ever to be seen publicly

William Bateson was a British zoologist a Fellow of St Johns College Cambridge University He was the first person to use the term genetics to describe the study of heredity and the chief populariser of the ideas of Gregor Mendel after their rediscovery in 1900 by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns

Bateson became famous as a mutationist who believed evolution took place by jumps Later Ronald Fisher and JBS Haldane showed that discrete mutations were compatible with gradual evolution see the modern evolutionary synthesis

Bateson was the first to suggest the word genetics to describe the study of inheritance in a letter to Adam Sedgwick dated April 18 1905 Bateson first used the term genetics publicly at the Third International Conference on Plant Hybridization in London in 1906 Although this was three years before Wilhelm Johannsen used the word gene to describe the units of hereditary information De Vries had introduced the word pangene for the same concept already in 1889 and etymologically the word genetics finds its origin in Darwins concept of pangenesis

Bateson co discovered genetic linkage with Reginald Punnett and he and Punnett founded the Journal of Genetics in 1910 Bateson also coined the term epistasis to describe the genetic interaction of two independent traits So important from 1900 to 1910 he was almost a bystander for the next ten years because he refused to accept the role chromosomes played in genetics At last in 1921 a visit to TH Morgans fly lab convinced him but by then he could no longer recover his influence

Wat Phrasri Rattana Sasadaram or Wat Phra Kaew the Temple of the Emerald Buddha is one of the most sacred Buddhist temples in Thailand It is in the grounds of the Grand Palace It is the only temple in Bangkok that does not have monks This temple is famous for the statue of Buddha which is really made from jade not emerald The king of Thailand is the only person allowed to go near the Emerald Buddha The king changes the clothes on the Buddha three times every year In summer the Buddha is dressed in a crown and jewelry in winter he wears a golden shawl and in the rainy months he wears a gold robe and headdress 

The temple was started in 2325 BE during the reign of King Rama I and finished in 2327 BE The temple was built to hold the Buddha statue which is believed to have been made in Thailand in the 14th century Captured by the Cambodians in 1552 the statue was kept in Laos for 214 years until King Rama I recaptured it He brought it with him when he moved his capital to Bangkok in 1784 The design of this temple was copied from Wat Phrasrisanphet in the Ayudhaya period Because Wat Phrasri Rattana Sasadaram is important it is renovated every 50 years

The Colossal Squid Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni is the biggest squid in the world 1214 metres long 

The Colossal Squid is bigger than a giant squid Its body is reddish brown and it lives up to 2000m below the surface of the Southern Ocean It is the main food eaten by sperm whales The Colossal Squid has ammonium chloride in its body so it tastes bad for humans

It is believed to feed on prey such as chaetognatha large fish like the Patagonian toothfish and other squid in the deep ocean using bioluminescence 

The Colossal Squid is thought to have a slow metabolic rate requiring only around 30 g of prey daily Estimates of its energetic demands suggest that it is a slow moving ambush predator using its large eyes primarily for predator detection rather than active hunting

The eye is 27 cm wide with a lens 12 cm across This is the largest eye of any known animal These measurements are of the partly collapsed specimen when living the eye was probably 30 to 40 cm across

The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa is displaying this specimen in an exhibition which opened in 2008 A website on the squid specimen is also available

Traits are characteristics of living things It is a term used mostly in biology 

Every living thing from tiny organisms like bacteria to plants animals and humans has some things that make it special Biologists call those traits The living thing is built in a certain way this is its anatomy its structure or body The physical structure works in a certain way this is its function the way its body works An animal also acts in a certain way this is its behaviour 

The way that a living thing is structured the way its body works and the way that it acts are all traits The basic traits are shared by all the members of the group that is why they are put in the same group Other traits are only shared by a small number of the group 

For example 

Traits are heritable they can be passed on from one generation to the next by genes Mendels work involved the inheritance of traits on pea plants The whole group of traits of an organism is its phenotype

Crossing over is a basic concept of genetics and cell biology often called recombination It occurs during meiosis 

Crossing over involves the exchange of chromosome segments between non sister chromatids during the production of gametes The effect is to assort the alleles on parental chromosomes so that the gametes carry combinations of genes different from either parent This has the overall effect of increasing the variety of phenotypes present in a population

By suitable means the process can be observed directly in stained cells and indirectly by the presence or absence of genetic markers on the chromosomes The visible crossovers are called chiasma which is Greek for a cross FA Janssens was the first to suggest what chiasmata meant

The large scale effect of crossing over is to spread variation through a population This is thought to be the main advantage of sexual reproduction over non sexual modes of reproduction

 Chromatids are the daughter strands of a duplicated chromosome which are joined by a single centromere When the centromere divides the chromatids become separate chromosomes

Each of the two daughter chromatids contains the same DNA and chromatin protein as its original chromosome But in meiosis crossing over take place between two of the non sister chromatids This has profound consequences it produces genetic recombination and increases the variability of gametes

From late 1687 to early 1698 Charpentier was matre de musique to the Jesuits Soon he stopped composing big works such as oratorios and concentrated on smaller works for church worship which were sometimes played by a large number of players He also was music teacher to the Duke of Chartres

In 1698 he was made matre de musique at the Sainte Chapelle in Paris This was one of the top musical jobs in France He kept this job until his death in 1704 After his death nearly all the works he wrote for the Chapel were destroyed This was the usual procedure when a matre de musique died  His famous Mass Assumpta Est Maria has survived Perhaps that is because it was not composed for the Chapel 

Charpentiers compositions include oratorios masses operas and many smaller works He also wrote a lot of music for plays  Many of his smaller works for one or two voices and instruments he called air srieux or air boire if they are in French but cantata if they are in Italian

Russian roulette is a deadly game where there is only one bullet in one of the six cylinder slots of a revolver The person then closes the cylinder spins it places it against their head or sometimes inside their mouth and pulls the trigger It is done either as bravado boredom suicide or other reasons It sometimes fictionally used in interrogations where the interrogator asks the suspect if he wants to play a game of Russian roulette and palms the bullet

The song Russian Roulette by Rihanna is not about the lethal game but about how love can be compared to it The game is also featured in a scene in the video game Call of Duty Black Ops

Trisomy 18 also known as Trisomy E and Edwards syndrome is a trisomy It is a genetic disorder People with trisomy 18 have three copies of chromosome 18 Normal people have two copies of the chromosome It is named after John H Edwards who first described the syndrome in 1960 It is the second most common autosomal trisomy after Down Syndrome that carries to term 

It is estimated that about one in 3000 live births are affected The incidence increases as the mothers age increases The syndrome has a very low rate of survival People with Edwards syndrome often have heart abnormalities kidney malformations and other internal organ disorders 

About 95 of the babies with Edwards syndrome die before they are born About half of all babies born with the condition will reach two months of age and only 5 10 will survive for a year The median life span is five to fifteen days One percent of children born with this syndrome live to age ten typically in cases of the less severe mosaic Edwards syndrome

Clever Hans was a horse that was supposed to be able to do lots of difficult mathematical sums and solve complicated problems Later it was discovered that the horse was giving the right answers by watching the reactions of the people who were watching him

Hans was a horse that lived in Germany in the early 20th century He belonged to a man called Herr Wilhelm von Osten Van Osten was a teacher who taught maths at a school He was an amateur horse trainer

This was a time when people were becoming interested in how intelligent animals were This was largely because of what Charles Darwin had been writing about 

Von Osten taught Hans to add subtract multiply divide work with fractions tell the time and date read and spell and to understand German If he asked the horse a question such as What is 12 plus 12 the horse would tap its hoof 24 times Von Osten travelled round the country with Hans showing off his clever horse to the public

Scientists became interested in Clever Hans The pyschologist Carl Stumpf got a group of people together to study what was happening They found that the horse almost always gave the right answer when he could see his owner He also gave the right answer if someone else asked him a question This showed that Von Osten was not deliberately giving him secret signs

However when the horse was blindfolded so that he could not see the person asking him the question he did not get the answers right Also the horse did not get the answer right if the person asking the question did not know the answer himself 

When the horse could answer the question it started to tap more slowly when it got near to the right answer Then it stopped when it got to the right answer This showed that the horse was watching the person asking the question and it could sense when the person was expecting him to stop Von Osten probably did not realize that he was giving the horse signals just by looking at him The horse was indeed very clever to guess what was wanted of him but of course it did not understand the mathematics

This effect is often called the Clever Hans effect It is used in psychology to describe when an animal or a person senses what someone wants them to do even although they are not deliberately being given signals It is important to take this effect into account when testing animals intelligence or human intelligence An animal may need to be separated from its trainer if their true intelligence is to be observed On the other hand an animal may be upset when it cannot see its trainer so it might not give the right answer This problem can often be solved by creating a situation in which the trainer does not know the right answer

The Clever Hans effect is famous and has been used in popular culture For example there is an episode of The Simpsons in which Lisa Simpson becomes jealous of her baby sister Maggie because Maggie seems to be even more intelligent than Lisa Then it is discovered that Maggie has been watching Lisa so carefully that she could sense what the answers were Lisa is relieved to discover this

Howard William Morenz was a Canadian professional ice hockey player He played centre for three National Hockey League teams the Montreal Canadiens the Chicago Black Hawks and the New York Rangers Before joining the NHL Morenz was a very good player in the junior Ontario Hockey Association where his team played for the Memorial Cup the championship for junior ice hockey in Canada In the NHL he was one of the best players in the league and set several league scoring records A strong skater Morenz was called the Stratford Streak and Mitchell Meteor because he was very fast

Considered one of the first stars of the NHL Morenz played 14 seasons in the league He was a member of a team that won the Stanley Cup three times all of them being the Canadiens During his NHL career he was in the top 10 leading scorers ten times For seven seasons in a row Morenz led the Canadiens in both goals scored and points Three times in he was named the most valuable player of the league and he led the league once in goals scored and twice in points scored He was named to the NHL All Star Team three times

Morenz died from problems with a broken leg an injury he suffered in a game After his death the Canadiens stopped using his jersey number the first time the team had done so for any player When the Hockey Hall of Fame opened in 1945 Morenz was one of the first 12 people to be added In 1950 the Canadian Press named him the best ice hockey player of the first half of the 20th century

The atomic radius of an element is the distance between the nucleus and the edge of the electron cloud 

The atomic radius is rather hard to define because it is impossible to know where all of the electrons are at a given time 

In the periodic table of the elements the atomic radius tends to increase as you move down a group because the number of electrons is greater and so the radius of the circle of electrons in the element is bigger As you move to the right across a period the atomic radius tends to decrease due to the shielding effect

In construction underpinning is the process of strengthening and stabilizing the foundation of an existing building or other structure Underpinning may be needed for a many of reasons 

Epistasis is the interaction between genes at different loci It was a term invented by William Bateson in 1909

When Gregor Mendel did his experiments on the sweet pea he chose seven characteristics such as round vs wrinkled peas and tall vs short plants He found the plants had pairs of factors which controlled their appearance However one pair of factors never affected the other pairs But with epistasis the action of one gene does affect another gene even one on a different chromosome 

Use of the term has varied somewhat Its original meaning was quite narrow for instance a gene for no wings in Drosophila will obviously mask genes for any other aspect of the wings In general however epistasis denotes any departure from independence of the effects of different genetic loci

Holborn tramway station was a tram stop underneath Kingsway in central London It was part of the Kingsway tramway subway route When the station opened opened it was named Great Queen Street

Services from Angel Islington to Aldwych started on 24 February 1906 Services rom Highbury station to Tower Bridge and from Highbury station to Kennington Gate started on 10 April 1908

The station closed just after 1230am on 6 April 1952 Much of the station remains in the disused tunnel but there is no public access

In biology the term epigenetics refers to changes in phenotype or gene expression caused by mechanisms other than changes in the DNA sequence Another definition is the study of the mechanisms by which genes bring about their phenotypic effects

These changes in gene activity may remain for the remainder of the cells life and may also last for many generations of cells through cell divisions However there is no change in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism instead non hereditary factors cause the organisms genes to behave differently

The best example of epigenetic changes in eukaryotes is the process of cell differentiation During morphogenesis generalised stem cells become the cell lines of the embryo which in turn become fully differentiated cells In other words a single fertilized egg cell the zygote changes into the many cell types including neurons muscle cells epithelium blood vessels etc as it continues to divide It does so by activating some genes while inhibiting others This is gene regulation

DNA and histones make up what is called chromatin Epigenetic modifications to the chromatin are heritable across cell divisions Epigenetics can be contrasted with the more familiar genetic changes such as mutation of the DNA Genetic mutations change the primary DNA sequence They may occur in any cells but are only inherited by the offspring if they occur in the cell line leading to a fertilised egg

Meiosis cancels epigenetic changes and resets the genome to its baseline state so the process unfolds in each new generation There are some exceptions to this rule but none of these exceptions involve changes to DNA base pair sequences

In developmental biology cellular differentiation is the process by which a less specialized cell becomes a more specialized cell type Different tissues have different kinds of cells 

Differentiation occurs many times during the development of a multicellular organism as the organism changes from a single zygote to a complex system of tissues and cell types Differentiation is a common process in adults as well adult stem cells divide and create fully differentiated daughter cells during tissue repair and during normal cell turnover 

Differentiation dramatically changes a cells size shape metabolic activity and responsiveness to signals These changes are largely due to highly controlled modifications in gene expression With a few exceptions cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the DNA sequence itself It does involve switching off many genes not needed in a particular tissue Thus cells in different tissues may have very different physical characteristics despite having the same genome 

A cell that is able to differentiate into many cell types is known as pluripotent Such cells are called stem cells in animals and meristematic cells in higher plants A cell that is able to differentiate into all cell types is known as totipotent In mammals only the zygote and early embryonic cells are totipotent while in plants many differentiated cells can become totipotent with simple laboratory techniques

Morphogenesis is the biological process that causes an organism to develop its shape 

It is one of three fundamental aspects of developmental biology along with the control of cell growth and cellular differentiation 

The process controls the organized spatial distribution of cells during the embryonic development of an organism Morphogenetic responses may be induced in organisms by hormones by substances produced by other organisms or by mechanical stresses induced by spatial patterning of the cells Morphogenesis can take place in an embyro a mature organism in cell culture or inside tumor cell masses

Gastrulation is a phase early in the development of most animal embryos In it the embryo is dramatically restructured by cell migration 

Gastrulation varies in different phyla It is followed by organogenesis when individual organs develop within the newly formed germ layers

The Gastrula is the double walled stage of the embryo resulting from invagination of the blastula During gastrulation some of the cells migrating inward contribute to the mesoderm an additional layer between the endoderm and the ectoderm

Among animals sponges show the simplest organization having a single germ layer Cnidaria and ctenophores show an increase in complexity having two germ layers the endoderm and ectoderm All higher animals possess a mesoderm as well as ectoderm and endoderm 

The purpose of gastrulation is to position the 3 embryonic germ layers the endoderm ectoderm and mesoderm These layers later develop into certain bodily systems

Fitness in biology is the relative ability of an organism to survive and pass on its genes to the next generationp160 It is a central idea in evolutionary theory Fitness is usually equal to the proportion of the individuals genes in all the genes of the next generation 

Like all terms in evolutionary biology fitness is defined in terms of an interbreeding population which might or might not be a whole species If differences in individual genotypes affect fitness then the frequencies of the genotypes will change over generations the genotypes with higher fitness become more common This is the process called natural selection

An individuals fitness is caused by its phenotype and passed on by its genotype The fitnesses of different individuals with the same genotype are not necessarily equal It depends on the environment in which the individuals live and on accidental events However since the fitness of the genotype is an averaged quantity it reflects the reproductive outcomes of all individuals with that genotype

Fitness measures the number of the copies of the genes of an individual in the next generation It doesnt really matter how the genes arrive in the next generation For an individual it is equally beneficial to reproduce itself or to help relatives with similar genes to reproduce as long as similar amount of copies of individuals genes get passed on to the next generation Selection which promotes this kind of helper behaviour is called kin selection

Our closest relatives share on average 50 of our genes One step further removed are grandparents With each of them we share on average 25 of our genes That is a measure of our relatedness to them Next come first cousins We share 125 of their genesp100

Fitness costs and benefits are measured in fecundity

Inclusive fitness is a term which is essentially the same as fitness but emphasises the group of genes rather than individuals 

Biological fitness says how well an organism can reproduce and spread its genes to its offspring The theory of inclusive fitness states that the fitness of an organism is also increased by the fact that this organism cares for others helping them survive

The British social philosopher Herbert Spencer coined the phrase survival of the fittest in his 1864 work Principles of biology to mean what Charles Darwin called natural selection The original phrase was survival of the best fitted

Didcot is a town in Oxfordshire about convert10mikm south of Oxford Till 1974 it was part of Berkshire

During the Roman Empire the Romans digged a ditch that runs north through what is now known as the Ladygrove area north of the town near Long Wittenham

Didcot first appears in historical records in the 13th century as Dudcotte Berkshire Parts of the original village still exist in the Lydalls Road area and part of All Saints Church dates back to the 11th century 

The Great Western Railway designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel reached Didcot in 1839 In 1844 the Didcot railway station was opened The original station burnt down in the later part of 19th century 

Didcot is junction of the routes to London Bristol Oxford and to Southampton That meant that the town had strategic importance to military logistics in particular during the First World War campaign on the Western Front and the Second World War preparations for D Day 

The Didcot Power Stations supply electricity to the National Grid The power station has also proved a popular man made object for local photographers

After the Russian Civil War Mikhail and his brothers went to the Caucasus in Western Russia Mikhail worked as a journalist Many members of Bulgakovs family left Russia for Western Europe Bulgakov was not allowed into other countries however as he had a disease called typhus

The injuries Bulgakov received in the First World War continued to cause him a lot of pain To ease the pain he started injecting himself with morphine He eventually became addicted to morphine He wrote a book about this period called Morphine which was finally released in 1926

Jack Haldane was a communist atheist and a writer of popular science books and articles for the Daily Worker His major professional work was his contribution of mathematical papers on the theory of evolution which assisted the modern evolutionary synthesis

Between 1919 and 1922 he was a Fellow of New College Oxford University then moved to Cambridge University where he accepted a Readership in Biochemistry at Trinity College and taught there until 1932 During his nine years at Cambridge Haldane worked on enzymes and genetics particularly the mathematical side of genetics Haldane wrote many popular essays on science that were eventually collected and published in 1927 in a volume entitled Possible Worlds 

He then accepted a position as Professor of Genetics and moved to University College London where he spent most of his academic career Four years later he became the first Weldon Professor of Biometry at University College London

Haldanes move to India initially to the Indian Statistical Institute was influenced by a number of factors Officially he stated that his chief political reason was in response to the Suez Crisis He wrote Finally I am going to India because I consider that recent acts of the British Government have been violations of international law His interest in India was also because of his interest in biological research belief that the warm climate would do him good and that India offered him freedom and shared socialist dreams At the ISI he headed the biometry unit and spent time researching a range of topics and guiding other researchers around him

William Donald Hamilton FRS was a British evolutionary biologist whom Richard Dawkins praised as one of the greatest evolutionary theorists of the 20th century

Hamilton became famous through his theoretical work expounding a rigorous genetic basis for the existence of kin selection and altruism an insight that was a key part of the development of a gene centered view of evolution Therefore he may be seen as one of the forerunners of sociobiology as popularized by EO Wilson He was certainly a big influence on Dawkins Hamilton also published important work on sex ratios and the evolution of sex From 1984 to his death in 2000 he was the Royal Society Research Professor at Oxford University He died of malaria contracted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

Hamilton started to publish his collected papers starting in 1996 with short essays giving each paper context He died after the preparation of the second volume so the commentaries for the third volume came from his coauthors

John Maynard Smith FRS was a British theoretical evolutionary biologist and geneticist Originally an aeronautical engineer during the Second World War he then took a second degree in genetics under the well known biologist JBS Haldane Maynard Smith was instrumental in the application of game theory to evolution and theorized on other problems such as the evolution of sex and signalling theory

He won most of the awards available to scientists

A cave is a natural underground hollow space that is completely dark The entrance area of caves are home to many creatures such as snakes mice spiders porcupines Only a few animals are found deep in caves Bats often live in caves Another common creature found in caves are cave crickets Caves consist of narrow passageways and chambers 

Caves are usually formed when underground acidic water corrodes away softer stones such as limestone leaving only the hard rock such as granite left They can also be formed during natural catastrophes such as earthquakes or by ice and glaciers

People in the past are known to have lived in caves and even today caves can provide shelter for trekkers Many European caves have been inhabitated already in the Stone Age and some caves have beautiful paintings on the walls

Caves can have beautiful formations in them such as stalagmites and stalactites These are made over thousands of years by water dripping on them and leaving mineral deposits

People who explore caves are called cavers They go into caves for fun exercise and to see the different formations This can be a dangerous sport because caves sometimes have deep pits Cavers also have to climb and crawl through the passages 

Cavers usually go into caves with four or more people Each person has 2 or 3 light sources One light is attached to each helmet People go into caves to try and explore more about the world

The study of caves is called Speleology

A car is a vehicle used to transport passengers Cars usually have four wheels and an internal combustion engine

Some small city cars carry only four people and have very little luggage space Other types are able to carry many passengers or heavy loads For example family station wagons or estate cars carry from 6 to 9 people or fewer people with lots of luggage A van or pickup truck is a car like vehicle made for carrying medium sized loads for example of goods for delivery or plumbers and builders tools and materials 

In order for a car to work it must have fuel The most common fuel is petrol which is sometimes called gasoline A car can also run on diesel Other less common fuels are natural gas or electricity Many car making companies are also now trying to build vehicles that run successfully using hydrogen fuel cells which are as convenient as petrol or diesel fuelled cars but do not give out any polluting exhaust gases

The earliest automobiles recorded were actually steam engines attached to wagons This was invented by Nicolas Joseph Cugnot in the late 1700s The steam engines were heavy and therefore the wagon was very slow and hard to control Cugnot was the very first person to get into a motor vehicle accident when he crashed his wagon into a wall

Also there were cars in the 1830s that were powered by electricity but these were also very slow and heavy so they were eventually left behind 

The internal combustion engine changed the way automobiles were to be powered The engine used either gasoline diesel or kerosene to work When the gas is exploded in a cylinder it pushes the piston down and turns the wheel 

Although many people tried to make a good car that would work well and sell well people say that Karl Benz invented the modern automobile He used a four stroke type of internal combustion engine to power his car He began to sell his production vehicles in 1888 

In North America the first modern car was made by the Duryea Brothers in Springfield Massachusetts The Duryea Brothers car also won the first ever car race in 1895 competing against cars made by made by Benz The race was in Chicago Illinois and 53 miles long Duryea then began production of the first commercial automobiles in 1896 That year they made 13 cars by hand in Springfield Massachusetts

Benz may have invented the first modern car and Duryea the first commercial car but Henry Ford is the man who sold the most cars to the most people In 1910 he began making and selling his Model T which was a huge success Many people could afford this car not just the rich Ford mass produced his Model T meaning he made a lot of them in a short time in a factory People say that the Model T is the car that put America on wheels The Model T was the most popular car of the time because it was so cheap but it was still a good quality car that everyone could own

Since then many different kinds of cars have been designed and built from minivans to sports cars

Cars are faster than walking or riding a bike if you are going a long way can carry more than one person and a large amount of luggage Depending on local public transport quality they can also be faster and far more convenient than using buses cycles or trains and can often go where public transport cannot 4 wheel drive offroad vehicles are particularly good at reaching places difficult for any other wheeled transport allowing provision of goods emergency services transport of disabled or infirm passengers and faster and safer journeys for able bodied passengers over long distances and harsh terrain where this may otherwise have been impossible

Another good thing is that if its raining heavily it is better to use a car than a bicycle or motorcycle or walking because driving a car in these conditions can be less dangerous and keeps passengers and possessions dry as most cars are enclosed Modern cars are often safer in accidents in any conditions as they have added safety features such as seat belts airbags crumple zones and side impact protection that would be expensive or impossible on two wheeled or light 3 wheeled vehicles or most buses

Buying and running a car needs a lot of money even more for a good quality one that is not too old There are a lot of things to pay for  the car itself fuel parts maintenance repairs insurance to cover the cost of crashes or theft parking charges and road tolls andor any tax or licensing fees charged by government

If two cars crash they can hurt the people inside or around them Traffic jams happen when there are too many cars trying to go the same way They can cause pollution if too many are used in a small area like a city and the combined pollution of the worlds cars is thought to be partly to blame for climate change Many places where lots of people live have public transportation such as buses trains trams and subways These can help many people get to different places very quickly often faster and less expensive than by car when traffic jams are a problem Some of these problems can be fixed for example by carpooling which is putting many people who may not normally travel together in one car to share costs use less fuel and create less pollution and traffic

If many cars try to travel around an older or badly built town that was not designed for cars this can make these problems worse and cause danger to other road users for example people riding bicycles or walking But designing a town layout where everything is made for cars as the main transport can cause other problems These include even more pollution and traffic as everyone has to drive Communities are divided up and separated with roads People walking are in danger by expressways with too few foot bridges small road bridges or other crossings Designers now understand these problems and try to build more balanced systems

The Kingsway tramway subway is a cut and cover Grade II Listed tunnel in central London In 1898 it was decided to demolish the slum districts in the Holborn area and rebuild it This gave a chance to use the new streets for a tramway that would connect the lines in the north and south This new tramway was built by the London County Council who decided to build the route as an underground connection The tunnel originally opened for use by single deck tramcars only but an upgrade between 1929 and 1931 meant that double deck trams could later use it The subway was closed in 1952 Part of the subway is now the Strand underpass but it is largely untouched and still has tram tracks inside it

The London County Council had two tramway systems called the North Side and South Side For a long time they wanted to join the two together This would allow them to send trams from the North Side to the Central Repair Depot in Charlton in South East London for overhauls In 1902 the Council decided to build a tramway that was under the ground The subway went from Theobalds Road in the north to the Embankment underneath Waterloo Bridge to the south From there a line that was not underground would continue over Waterloo Bridge

le de la Tortue is a Caribbean island that forms part of Haiti off the northwest coast of Hispaniola Its Tano name was Baynei

During the 17th century the island was an important centre for Caribbean piracy where pirates traded their stolen goods from ships and towns and stayed for days before going out to try to capture other ships

In geology it is considered as the western end of the region of the Cordillera Septentrional of the Hispaniola island even if Tortuga Island is separated from the main island

Tortuga Island is separated of the north coast of Haiti by an 89 to 15 km strait called the Canal de la Tortue The island is 375 km long and about 7 km wide with an area of 193 km There are not high mountains but most of the land is between 240 and 300 metres high the highest point is Morne La Visite

The island is a commune in the Nord Department It is part of the Port de Paix arrondissement part of a department like a district

In 2004 there were 30000 people living in the Tortuga Island There are only small towns Aux Palmistes in the southeast is the biggest town in the island

Christopher Columbus saw this island on 6 December 1492 and visited it on 14 December He called the island La Tortuga Spanish for The Turtle because it has the shape when seen from the sea of a turtle

Spanish people were not interested in Tortuga Island because they were trying to form a colony in the big Hispaniola island And so this island was without people for most of the 16th century

People from different European countries mainly from England came to live in this island In 1625 French people came to this island from the Saint Kitts island They lived on the southern part of the island where there are flat lands and tried to grow some crops like tobacco They also went to Hispaniola which they called la Grande Terre to hunt wild cows and pigs and because they used a Tano cooking technique with smoke known as boucan they were known as boucaniers They sold the smoked meat and leather to those ships that came to the island

The Spanish tried to get those people out of the island and they invaded the island several times but each time they went back to the Hispaniola and the Tortuga Island was taken again In 1640 a French engineer named Jean La Vasseur was sent to govern Tortuga He built Fort de Rocher 1640 La Vasseur opened the port to outlaws of all nations

From Tortuga Island people began to move to the northern part of the Hispaniola mainly in the areas around the big plains founding towns such as Port de Paix Cap Franais and Fort Dauphin Then Tortuga Island lost its importance and very few people have lived here after those years including today

There is several good beaches in Tortuga Island Point Saline at the western tip is considered by many to be the best beach of the island

At Basse Terre on the southeastern coast there are still some rests of the Fort de la Roche built in 1630 by the French

There are several interesting caves such as La Grotte au Bassin La Grotte de la Galerie and others

Intel Core i7 is a name that the company Intel uses for the computer processors it makes for desktop and laptop computers  Intel uses this name for the fastest processors that they think will be used to build computers for consumers instead of business people Intel started to use this name in 2008 From 2008 until now all Core i7 processors have used the Intel Nehalem microarchitecture Before 2008 Intel used the name Core 2 for this kind of processor There are different types of Core i7 processor The name does not name a type Instead it is the name for all of the fast processors that Intel thinks should be sold to consumers Intel uses two other names for its processors for consumers Core i5 and Core i3 Intel uses the Core I5 name for processors that are not quite so fast as the Core i7 processors The Core i5processors can do everything that most people want to do except for playing some types of computer games Intel uses the Core i3 name for processors for computers that are even slower than Core i5 computers Core I3 can do most simple things for most people 

Intel uses a different name Xeon for processors that Intel makes for server computers for businesses Some of the Core i7 processors are almost the came as some of the Xeon processors But each of the Xeon processors is a little bit different than the Core i7 processor because a server computer is not the same as a consumer computer Intel also makes other Xeon processors that are not the same as any Core i7 processor

Population genetics is the branch of genetics which studies the genetic composition of populations It brings together genetics evolution natural selection breeding statistics and mathematics Mathematical and computer models are produced and field research is done to test the models

Starting perhaps with G Udny Yules paper in 1902 population theorists tackled key issues in genetics and evolution GH Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg showed that if a population had random mating no selection migration or mutation then the proportion of alleles would remain the same generation after generation This was the HardyWeinberg law the first great result of this new field of research

Population genetics made great progress from 1918 to 1937 During this period Ronald Fisher JBS Haldane and Sewall Wright worked on the connection between evolution and genetics using new mathematical techniques such as statistical probability EB Ford and Theodosius Dobzhansky did field research on the genetics of natural populations of lepidoptera and Drosophila respectively Broadly speaking this work proved that the newly rediscovered Mendelian genetics could be reconciled with Darwinian evolution This laid the groundwork for the modern evolutionary synthesis which took place in the following years from about 1937 to 1953

In the second half of the 20th century population geneticists tackled a range of complex evolutionary problems such as the evolution of sex sexual selection kin selection mimicry and molecular evolution The key figures included John Maynard Smith Motoo Kimura and William Hamilton Techniques developed for population genetics help to decide what contribution heredity and environment make in developmental biology

The HardyWeinberg law was developed independently by an English mathematician GH Hardy and a German doctor Wilhelm Weinberg This concept is also known as the HardyWeinberg equilibrium HardyWeinberg theorem or HardyWeinberg principle Sometimes Weinbergs name is placed first 

The law is a foundation of population genetics and it is still taught to students today It states that the proportions of alleles of all genes in any population will remain the same unless perturbed That applies to all loci on all chromosomes in the population Possible perturbations are

It follows that any systematic change in the frequency of alleles in a population must be due to the effect of one or more of these causes Of course like all aspects of Mendelian inheritance the expected proportions of alleles are probabilities It was for that reason that statistical tests of significance such as standard errors were developed

Although all changes must be due to perturbations not all perturbations lead to changes The classic case is balancing selection such as heterozygote advantage Heterosis the heterozygote at a locus is fitter than either homozygote Balancing selection leads to an equilibrium population with HardyWeinberg proportions

The law permits the prediction of genotype frequencies from a knowledge of gene frequencies 

Thus equations can be written in terms of allele frequencies and hypotheses about how phenotypes are inherited can be tested from population data 

Godfrey Harold Hardy FRS was a famous English mathematician He investigated number theory and mathematical analysis

Hardys classic text A course of pure mathematics was first published in 1908 and has been in print ever since He wrote A Mathematicians Apology in 1940 It is considered a good work for people who are not mathematicians to understand the beauty of mathematics

In 1908 unable to explain how a dominant gene would not become ubiquitous in a population Reginald Punnett introduced his problem to Hardy with whom he played cricket Hardy went on to formulate what became known as the HardyWeinberg law

Hardy had a long collaboration with JE Littlewood which resulted in a partial solution to a famous unsolved problem in number theory

Hardy discovered the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan who was a brilliant student Hardy saw his extraordinary intelligence and they worked together on many mathematical subjects In an interview given to Paul Erds Hardy said that the discovery of Ramanujan was his greatest contribution to mathematics and that their collaboration was the one romantic incident in my life

White Vine is a species of plant It is also known as White Twinevine It belongs in the subfamily Asclepiadoideae It is native to southeastern United States and Texas

Wilhelm Weinberg was a German Jewish physician who became an important geneticist He was a obstetrician and gynecologist practising in Stuttgart In 1908 he expressed the principle which would later come to be known as the HardyWeinberg law Weinberg is also credited as the first to explain the effect of ascertainment bias on observations in genetics

Weinberg was born in Stuttgart and studied medicine at Tbingen and Munich receiving an MD in 1886 He returned to Stuttgart in 1889 where he remained running a large practice as a gynecologist and obstetrician until he retired to Tbingen a few years before his death in 1937 Much of his academic life was spent studying genetics especially on applying the laws of inheritance in populations

Weinberg developed the principle of genetic equilibrium independently of British mathematician GH Hardy He delivered an exposition of his ideas in a lecture on 13 January 1908 about six months before Hardys paper was published in English His lecture was printed later that year in the societys yearbook 

Weinbergs contributions were unrecognized in the English speaking world for more than 35 years Curt Stern a German geneticist who immigrated to the United States before World War II pointed out in a brief paper in Science that Weinbergs exposition was both earlier and more comprehensive than Hardys

Weinberg pioneered studies of twins and developed techniques to analyse phenotypic variation His aim was to partition this variance into genetic and environmental components In the process he recognized that ascertainment bias was affecting many of his calculations and he produced methods to correct for it 

Weinberg observed that proportions of homozygotes in familial studies of classic recessive genetic diseases generally exceed the expected Mendelian ratio of 14 and he explained how this is the result of ascertainment bias In his work with albino children he recognized that in some families where both parents carry a recessive mutation by chance no albino child occurs He reasoned that many carrier couples were not being counted and he demonstrated methods for correcting results to produce the expected Mendelian ratios 

He discovered the answer to several seeming paradoxes caused by ascertainment bias For example he explained that the reason that parents as a whole are more fertile than their children is because children must necessarily come from fertile parents 

By the same token he recognized that ascertainment was responsible for a phenomenon known as genetic anticipation the tendency for a genetic disease to manifest earlier in life and with increased severity in later generations Weinberg recognized that this was because those later generations were the offspring of that selected group of earlier carriers that had successfully reproduced

Additional contributions by Weinberg to statistical genetics included the first estimate of the rate of twinning Realizing that identical twins would have to be the same sex while non identical twins could be either same or opposite sex Weinberg derived the formula for estimating the frequency of MZ and DZ twins from the ratio of same and opposite sex twins to the total of maternities Weinberg also estimated that the heritability of twinning itself was close to zero

The National Hockey League is a professional ice hockey league with of 30 teams founded in 1917 Each team can select a captain who has the sole privilege of discussing with the Referee any questions relating to interpretation of rules which may arise during the progress of a game Each team is also allowed to pick alternate captains who work when the captain is not on the ice Captains have to wear the letter C on their uniform to show who they are alternate captains wear the letter A Both letters are convert3incm in height

Some teams in the NHL do not have a captain because they do not want one or from injury to the captain Rule 62 of the 200809 Official NHL Rulebook says that only when the Captain is not in uniform the Coach shall have the right to designate three Alternate Captains This must be done prior to the start of the game The Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens theough they are the oldest franchises do not have any captains instead they have three alternate captains Many NHL teams with a captain select more than two alternate captains and change who wears the A for different games during the season

Goaltenders are not allowed to be captains during games This rule was made in 1948 after teams did not like that it took Montreal Canadiens goaltender Bill Durnan too long to skate to talk with the officials and back to his crease However Vancouver Canucks goaltender Roberto Luongo is the teams current captain but because of the NHL rule against goaltender captains the league does not allow Luongo to act as captain on ice Because of this the Canucks are allowed to have three alternate captains in games instead of two that most teams have Two alternate captains take care of Luongos on ice work Willie Mitchell talks to the officials Luongo is not allowed to wear the C on his jersey but it is part of the artwork on the front of his mask Other than Durnan and Luongo five other goaltenders have been captain o their team John Ross Roach of the Toronto St Patricks George Hainsworth of the Montreal Canadiens Roy Worters of the New York Americans Alex Connell of the Ottawa Senators and Charlie Gardiner of the Chicago Black Hawks

Jonathan Toews captain of the Chicago Blackhawks is the third youngest player to be named captain of a team in NHL history Only Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins and Vincent Lecavalier of the Tampa Bay Lightningboth NHL captains right nowwere younger than Toews when first named as captain In 1984 Brian Bellows was named temporary captain of the Minnesota North Stars when Craig Hartsburg was hurt and is the youngest player to captain a team in NHL history However because he was only the temporary captain Sidney Crosby is the youngest permanent captain in NHL history

Outcrossing is a term used in genetics for the mating of unrelated individuals in a population or species It was originally used for the crossing of an inbred strain with the wild type 

Outcrossing leads to random mating whereas mating of relatives leads to inbreeding

Spider monkeys belong to the New World monkey group They are small monkeys that are well suited to living in trees In fact they rarely come down to the ground These monkeys move quickly through trees by swinging and jumpinging from branch to branch

Spider monkeys are found in rainforests in southern Mexico to the northern part of South America Spider monkeys live in groups or bands of 10 to 40 monkeys Every band lives in its own territory and one band of monkeys will not enter the territory of another band Spider monkeys have one offspring per year They live between 12 to 45 years

Spider monkeys eat fruit nuts leaves and small vertebrates eggs They will eat meat as well as plants and usually the leader female of the whole group is responsible for finding and gathering all the food for the rest of the group When there is not enough food they sometimes eat bark or honey or sometimes insects 

Spider monkeys are extremely quick and they have long thin fingers with almost no hair at all Unlike other monkeys they use their tail much more than their fingers and their tails are longer than their bodies These tails can grasp and pick up things

The Asian Boyz is a street gang in Los Angeles California that formed after an attack by the Tiny Raskal Gang that killed four people At first the gang was made up of young Cambodian refugees The gang wears navy blue colors The age of the Asian Boyz is between age 10 40 years of age Their enemies are the Tiny Raskal Gang Latin gangs and all of the blood gangs The Urban Dictionary lists the Asian Boyz as being the second biggest gang of Asian people and the 12th biggest gang in the USA 

In 1995 the Asian Boyz killed at least five people including three teenagers who died in a car crash on the freeway after being shot at by the gang In 1998 one of the gang members Truong Dinh gave evidence in court about several murders by the gang To try and stop Dinh from talking in court the gang shot dead his father on the day before the trial

Field research is research done in natural surroundings It is used in biology to contrast with research done in the laboratory

Edmund Brisco Ford FRS was a British ecological geneticist He was a leader among those British biologists who investigated the role of natural selection in nature As a schoolboy Ford became interested in lepidoptera the group of insects which includes butterflies and moths He went on to study the genetics of natural populations and invented the field of ecological genetics Ford was awarded the Royal Societys Darwin Medal in 1954 Later in 1968 he was awarded UNESCOs Kalinga Prize for the popularisation of science

Specialising in genetics he was appointed Oxford University Reader in Genetics in 1939 and was the Director of the Genetics Laboratory 19521969 and Professor of Ecological Genetics 19631969 Ford was one of the first scientists to be elected a Fellow of All Souls College since the seventeenth century 

Ford had a long working relationship with RA Fisher By the time Ford had developed his formal definition of genetic polymorphism Fisher had got accustomed to high selection values in nature He was most impressed by the fact that polymorphism concealed powerful selective forces Like Fisher he continued the natural selection versus genetic drift debate with Sewall Wright whom Ford believed put too much emphasis on genetic drift It was as a result of Fords work as well as his own that Dobzhansky changed the emphasis in the third edition of his famous text from drift to selection

Ford predicted that human blood group polymorphisms might be maintained in the population by providing some protection against disease Six years after this prediction it was found to be so and furthermore heterozygous advantage was decisively established by a study of AB x AB crosses His magnum opus was Ecological genetics which ran to four editions and was widely influential He laid much of the groundwork for subsequent studies in this field and was invited as a consultant to help set up similar research groups in several other countries

Amongst Fords many publications perhaps the most popularly successful was the first book in the New Naturalist series Butterflies Ford also went on in 1955 to write Moths in the same series one of only a few to have authored more than one book in the series

EB Ford worked for many years on genetic polymorphism Polymorphism in natural populations is frequent the key feature is the occurrence together of two or more discontinuous forms of a species in some kind of balance So long as the proportions of each form is above mutation rate then selection must be the cause As early as 1930 Fisher had discussed a situation where with alleles at a single locus the heterozygote is more viable than either homozygote That is a typical genetic mechanism for causing this type of polymorphism The work involves a synthesis of field research taxonomy and laboratory genetics

Aster is a genus of flowering plants It belongs in the family Asteraceae The genus once had nearly 600 species in Eurasia and North America After morphologic and molecular research on the genus during the 1990s it was decided that the North American species are better treated in a series of other related genera After this split there are about 180 species within the genus

Here is a list of some common species

Here is a list of some common North American species that are no longer in the genus Aster

They are mostly native to Eurasia and northern Africa There are about 60 species in North America

Most species are considered weeds Cirsium vulgare is listed as a weed in nine US states Some species are planted in gardens for their beauty and to attract butterflies

Oblast is a type of administrative division in Slavic countries and some countries of the former Soviet Union The word oblast is used in English as well but it is often translated as area zone province or region The last translation may lead to confusion because the subdivision of oblast is called raion which can be translated as region or district as well

Oblasts are a type of administrative division of Belarus Bulgaria Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Russia Ukraine and the no longer existing Soviet Union Official terms in successor states of the Soviet Union differ but some still use a cognate of the Russian term eg voblast is used for provinces of Belarus and oblys for provinces of Kazakhstan

Since 1997 Bulgaria has been divided into 28 oblasti usually translated as provinces Before the country was divided into nine bigger units also called oblast

In the Russian Empire oblasts were considered to be administrative units and were included as parts of Governorates General or krais The majority of then existing oblasts were on the periphery of the country or covered the areas where Cossacks lived

In the former Soviet Union oblasts were one of the types of administrative divisions of the union republics As any administrative units of this level oblasts were composed of districts and citiestowns directly under oblasts jurisdiction 

The names of oblasts did not usually correspond to the names of the historical regions as they were created as purely administrative units With a few exceptions Soviet oblasts were named after their administrative centers

The oblasts in other post Soviet countries are officially called

Viloyat and welayat come from the Arabic language term wilya

According to the Constitution of Russia oblasts are considered to be subjects of the Federation which is a higher status than that of administrative units they had within the Soviet Union The federal subject status gives the oblasts some degree of autonomy and gives them representation in the Federation Council

Oblasts were administrative units of the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes between 1922 and 1929 During that period the country was divided into 33 oblasts In 1929 oblasts were replaced with larger administrative units known as banovinas

During the Wars that split Yugoslavia several Serbian Autonomous Oblasts were formed in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina These oblasts were later merged into the Republic of Serbian Krajina and the Republika Srpska

Fullers Teasel is a species of plant It is also known as Wild Teasel It belongs in the teasel family 

It is native to Eurasia and Africa and has been naturalized in the Americas southern Africa Australia and New Zealand This species grows to a height of 210 feet The flowers are small and lavender colored They are arranged in an oval flower head which also contains many small leaves These are hard and have a hooked and pointed tip 

In ancient times this plant was grown in gardens because its dry flower heads were used to prepare wool for spinning This was done by combing the raw wool with the flower heads so that the fibres were arranged neatly The people who prepared wool were called fullers which is the origin of the plants English and scientific names Fullers Teasel was also used in folk medicine for example against skin infections

A medical illustrator or medical artist is an artist that broken wikt linkprofessionallyprofessionally works to use art to help to explain and record knowledge related to biology and medicine They dont only make these things but they can also work as consultants or administrators in the field of biocommunication They make medical pictures using original and modern ways of doing things These pictures appear in textbooks and advertisements about medicine as well as professional journals and videos made to help instruct people in various medical procedures

Medical pictures or diagrams have been made for hundreds of years or longer Many of these pictures or diagrams look different than the ones that we see today because they were based on the studies of the scholars of that period in time rather than observing the thing that they wanted to draw broken wikt linkdirectlydirectly

The Treaty of Maastricht was a treaty signed between European countries in the Dutch town of Maastricht in 1992 This treaty made possible further integration between European states and made possible the existence of the European Union doing better than previous treaties such as the Treaty of Rome European integration went even further with the Treaty of Lisbon which was signed in 2007 and becomes effective on December 1 2009

The Treaty of Lisbon was signed in 2007 between 27 European states that are members of the European Union It became effective on December 1 2009 It is now the document that defines the Union but it is not a constitution It gives a common set of rules that the members states have agreed to use on subjects where they have decided to work together It does better than previous treaties such as the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Maastricht It gives the European Union such new things as

The President of the European Council is a position that was created by the Treaty of Lisbon The first President was in December 1st 2009 by M Herman Van Rompuy The President is the chairman of the European Council which is the meeting of the leaders of all the member states

Its a very diplomatic figure and its not like a head of state the President does not have any power to make decisions about the European Union The Union has several other presidents such as the president of the European Parliament and the president of the European Commission But the President of the European Council casually but wrongly known as The President of Europe is the face by which the European Union is known to the rest of the world The more practical aspects of this task are the responsibility of the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy the Commissioner responsible for external affairs

The High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy is a position created by the Treaty of Lisbon starting December 1 2009 The position is part of the European Commission The first person to be appointed is Cathy Ashton Baroness Ashton of Upholland but she has not yet been approved by the European Parliament

Her duty is to be the face of European Union to the rest of the world along with the President of Europe

The job is sometimes known casually a the European Foreign Minister but this is not correct because she is not a member of any government

Catherine Margaret Ashton Baroness Ashton of Upholland is a British labour politician In November 2009 she was appointed to be the first European Foreign Minister She was born in Lancashire England

Herman Van Rompuy is a Belgian politician In November 2009 he was appointed the first permanent President of the European Council which is the meeting of the heads of government of all of the member states of the European Union

The Swahili are a people and culture found on the coast of East Africa mainly the coastal regions and the islands of Kenya and Tanzania and north Mozambique The Swahili number is at around 1328000 The number of Swahili speakers on the other hand numbers at around 90 million people The name Swahili comes from the Arabic word Sawahil and means coastal dwellers Swahili is official language only in Tanzania Swahili speakers who live elsewhere in East Africa also have to use the official languages of their respective countries English in Kenya Portuguese in Mozambique and French in Comoros Only a small part of those who use Swahili are first language speakers and even fewer are ethnic Swahilis This point is often obscured by the Swahili linguistic tradition in which those who speak the language are often called Swahili regardless of their actual ethnic origins In other words the term Swahili can mean those who speak Swahili or it can mean ethnic Swahili people

The Swahili are unique Bantu inhabitants of the East African Coast mainly from Kenya Tanzania and Mozambique They are mainly united by culture and under the mother tongue of Kiswahili a Bantu language There are Arab Persian and other migrants who reached the coast some believe as early as the 7th 8th c CE and mixed with the local people there that are regarded as Swahili now Because of this influence the Swahili language contains many loan words from Arabic and Persian Archaeologist Felix Chami thinks that Bantu settlements at the East African coast existed already at the beginning of the 1st millennium From the 6th century onward they became more important as there was an increase in trade population growth and further centralized urbanization So the Swahili City States developed

Islam came to the East African coast around 1012 AD when the traders from the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula continued to journey to these parts during monsoon seasons and to have contact with the local people through trade marriage and an exchange of ideas Because of this interaction most of the Swahili today are Muslim The Swahili follow a very strict and orthodox form of Islam

For centuries the Swahili depended greatly on trade from the Indian Ocean The Swahili have played a vital role as middle man between east central and South Africa and the outside world Trade contacts have been noted as early as 100 AD by early Roman writers who visited the East African coast in the first century Trade routes extended across Tanzania into modern day Zaire Along these goods were brought to the coasts and were sold to Arab Indian and Portuguese traders and even reached as far as China and India Materials of this trade were also found at Great Zimbabwe During the middle ages ivory and slaves became a substantial source of income Many slaves who were sold in Zanzibar ended up in Brazil which was then a Portuguese colony Swahili fishermen of today still rely on the ocean to supply their primary source of income Fish is sold to their inland neighbors in exchange for products of the interior

The Tudor period usually refers to the period between 1485 and 1603 specifically in relation to the history of England This was the period when the Tudor dynasty ruled in England Its first monarch was Henry VII The term is often used more broadly to include Elizabeth Is reign although this is often treated separately as the Elizabethan era

Following the Black Death and the agricultural depression of the late 14th century population grew bigger again The export of woollen products to mainland Europe helped the economy rather much Henry VII got favourable trading conditions in 1496

The high wages and abundance of available land seen in the late 14th century and early 15th century were replaced with low wages and a land shortage Various inflationary pressures perhaps due to influx of New World gold and rising population meant that the gap between the rich and poor widened This was a period of significant change for the majority of the rural population because enclosure started

Impact of Dissolution

The Tudor Government raised a huge amount of revenue from the dissolution of the monasteries The clerical income from First Fruits and Tenths which previously went to the Pope now went to the King 

Partly because of the new revenue raised from the dissolution of monasteries Cromwell created revenue courts to allot the royal income properly to various departments These were the six courts or departments of state each fully organised with its own specialised officials equipped with seals and habitat and responsible for a particular kind of revenue 

The Role of Winchester

The growing number of departments meant that the number of officials involved increased which made the management of revenue troublesome and expensive There were further financial and administrative difficulties of the years 1540 58

Impact of War

Henrys war with France and Somersets war with France and Scotland cost England huge sums of money The royal Mint was used to generate revenue by producing coins with less quality

In 1487 Henry VIIs enemies from the House of York had crowned a pretender and landed a small army off the coast of Cumbria with the intention of stealing the crown Henry VII defeated them at East Stoke This was perhaps the last battle in the Wars of the Roses

This was perhaps the most significant series of events which took place during the Tudor period It began as a result of Henry VIIIs quarrel with Pope Clement VII regarding his refusal to grant a divorce 

Beginning in 1549 this was to be the largest popular uprising during the Tudor period It was at first intended as a demonstration against enclosures of common land The leader Robert Kett was hanged for treason 

About a third of the population lived in poverty with the wealthy expected to give alms to assist the impotent poor Tudor law was harsh on those unable to find work Those who left their parishes in order to find work were called vagabonds and could be punished by whipping

The idea of the workhouse was first suggested in 1576

Average life span was 35 High rates of childhood mortality saw only 33 50 of the population reaching the age of 16

Although home to only a small part of the population the Tudor municipalities were overcrowded and unhygenic Most municipalities were unpaved although this differed in larger towns and cities

There were no sewers or drains and rubbish was simply abandoned in the street Animals such as rats thrived in these conditions In larger towns and cities such as London common diseases arising from lack of sanitation included smallpox measles malaria typhus diphtheria Scarlet fever and chickenpox

Outbreaks of the Black Death pandemic occurred in 1498 1535 1543 1563 1589 and 1603 The reason for the speedy spread of the disease was the increase of rats infected by fleas carrying the disease

The food consumed by the dinvery rich in this period consisted largely of venison and often of blackbirds and larks However potatoes had not reached the table to any great extent because farmers had only just begun growing them although explorers such as Sir Walter Raleigh had brought them to Britain

The majority of the population lived in small villages Their homes comprised as in earlier centuries of thatched huts with one or two rooms Furniture was basic with stools being commonplace rather than chairs

Mansions had many chimneys for the many fireplaces required to keep the vast rooms warm These fires were also the only way of cooking food The very large houses were often designed in symmetrical shapes such as E and H

Poorer children never went to school Children from better off families had tutors to teach them reading and French However boys were often sent to schools which belonged to the monasteries and there they would learn mainly Latin in classes of up to 60 boys Schools were harsh and caning was not unheard of

The rich used to go hunting to kill deer and wild boar for their feasts They also enjoyed fencing and jousting contests Most rich people watched bear fighting

So this is a request for comment on two separate things First off Kennedy has brought up an explicit concern that Christianrocker90s user page is a violation of his probation as decided upon by the community here While I do not believe this is the case I also think it is something that is fair to discuss and it is better to do so here then on his talk page For my part I dont particularly love his user page I do not think it is to a point that it is abusive or out of line for user space

I would also like to request comment on what I think is an extremely inappropriate attitude by Kennedy His method of accusation and his comments seem far more biased to me then Christianrocker90s and reek of an assumption of bad faith and a specific grudge held that he will not let go and quite possibly distinct trolling to try and get Christianrocker to respond badly Jamesofur 0102 11 November 2009 PSIf we want to separate these two discussions Im more then fine with that Jamesofur 0102 11 November 2009

I was wondering if I could operate an IRC bot logged in as me and operated by me only that helps to block persistant block evading vandalisers that you see sometimes here at Simple Its using the enUserAntiAbuseBot open source code It will be logged on IRC as the nick MrFishBot

Things it cannot and will not do

Sorry for asking but I thought it would be a responsible thing to do  Bsadowski1 0314 8 December 2009

Like Djsasso said if you make a mistake with it it will then be your fault and not the bots or anyone elses Griffinofwales 1924 8 December 2009

Yeah its not really a bot if you are doing it on your account and you are manually approving the blocks its really just a script like huggle or whatever So as long as you take responsibility for any mistakes you make then all is cool in my opinion DJSasso 1957 8 December 2009

I also agree with Djsasso As long as you do the blocks on your main account you are responsible for the blocks If you do a lot of mistakes you have to life with the result If you do a good job I have no worries  Barras 2003 8 December 2009

DYK is a process for promoting mainspace articles to the main page Ive removed this policy violation twice already and placed a note on the talk Ive asked for BG7 to get consensus to reinsert the policy violation This was an administrative call Since BG7 and I have had prior involvement I am averse to using the block tool or issuing a warning for disruptive editingpolicy violations Please may an uninvolved administrator look into this Many thanks NonvocalScream 1940 26 November 2009 Yes we might give undue weight to a Christian holiday on that holiday If you look at that argument more closely there is nothing wrong with having a Wicca feast related hook on a Wicca feast day or an Islam related one on an Islamic holiday If you look at it more closely though you will find out that most non Christian religion related articles are in a very poor state DYK that DYK topics can only be picked form content that is actually there  Eptalon 2056 26 November 2009

following a post by an IP I unprotected User talkTharnton345 and I left a respective message there Tharnton was community banned earlier this year I think what he wanted to suggest is that we do a review much like we did with CR90 Anyway we can lose little as it is if it gets out of hand we simply re protect that page FYI the user does not have an email address set  Eptalon 1645 13 December 2009

Please see WikipediaRequests for checkuserCentral United Church Sarnia There now appears to be sockpuppetry going on Mythdon User talkMythdontalk SpecialContributionsMythdonchanges 2323 27 December 2009

Mythdon I know you mean well but Im going to ask you to step back for a moment there are multiple administrators trying to help the user understand the concerns of the community As you can see on the new users talk page Bsadowski1 is trying to explain to them the problem with the username and hopefully it will work out well To many chefs in the kitchen can cause problems and to many edits crying wolf can make it so that less people will look when something happens down the road I do appreciate your concern and assistance but I encourage you to remember that when you are able to see multiple administrators editing messages on this board tend to be counterproductive and just lead to more drama James 2332 27 December 2009

Hi i think a sentence at the WikipediaProposed good articles need to be changed as it doesnt really tell how to nominate properly I needed to go back and see how other people have done it to see what i needed to do Is this sentence im referring toTo propose an article for Good Article Status just add it to the top of the list using a Level Three heading Proposals run for three weeks and after this time the article will be either promoted or not promoted depending on the consensus reached in the discussion This is not a vote so please do not use comments such as Support or Oppose etc Its not really telling the correct way of nominating an article in my opinion More suggestions and input on this issue thanks Sinbad 1858 28 December 2009

User UserHuik01 has in my opinion stepped over a certain line of how to behave on Simple Wikipedia With many quite rude comments to Mythdon and other users who is just trying to help the user Something needs to be done Need more input from other users to Sinbad 2259 27 December 2009

I think talk page protection is warranted for comments like this Also please see this warning I gave Huik01 prior toaround the block Mythdon User talkMythdontalk SpecialContributionsMythdonchanges 2303 27 December 2009

As usual we tend to try and take it in steps if he continues to be a problem after his time is up he will quickly be reblocked for longer up to and including indefinitely if it continues Concerning your comment Mythdon administrators are here and looking into the situation I do appreciate both of you trying to bring this to our attention and you are right in that the behavior exhibited is a distractionJames 2307 27 December 2009

For those who want the remark diff For those who want the VIP diff Ive also given Huik01 my final warning Mythdon User talkMythdontalk SpecialContributionsMythdonchanges 1927 29 December 2009

  I have removed the final warning Mythdon put up The issue was already discussed on that page hours before and giving him a threatening final warning about something after this has been done does nothing to help the matter and can greatly worsen it I of course encourage you to report any problems you see but PLEASE PLEASE look at the discussions going on before you make new problems or warnings yourself I will also be watching him but we would like to KEEP editors if at all possible if he continues he will be reblocked I said that before and I say it again James 1936 29 December 2009

I find the above username inappropriate because of the word death and bunny combined The combination of the word death and bunny seem to amount to the meaning of a bunny that murders I find it an offensive username Mythdon User talkMythdontalk SpecialContributionsMythdonchanges 0655 30 December 2009

Ummm First of all death does not equal murder Second the name is meant to be somewhat ironic because bunnies are usually assumed to be prey animals The inspiration for the name one Ive been using for a long time actually is the white rabbit in Monty Python The one who lives peacefully until attacked Third the name is also meant to create irony in other ways because in general people usually associate death with the males and bunny with females By using the two conflicting terms people usually have to argue with my facts first rather than assuming a gender and disregarding what I have to say Finally I like the bunny in the movie have no desire to hurt anyone but do willingly defend myself when subject to assault I have no criminal convictions for violence and no tendency toward violence Thank you Deathbunny 1832 30 December 2009

Hi i thought it was time that also Simple Wikipedia had a portal for Current events So i started one but please help improving it and i also think it would be nice it the portal got a place on Simple Wikipedias front page something in style with the the same portal on Wikipedia Sinbad 1243 31 December 2009 IMO a current events could be feasible as it is now though the current DYK are updated about twice a month If thats current enough then fine BTW Are there any Wikinews editors willing to contribute  Personally I am not sure that by ourselves we have the manpower we are struggling with DYK as it is  Eptalon 1131 4 January 2010

Creating a thread here as im getting a little worried about the above user and the way that things are going on the Wikipedia

It seems to me that ONaNcle is coming across fairly offensive and picking fault with everything even when there is none to find His views are also fairly radical and I feel that they are detrimental to the wiki  however thats not why im posting this because that would be unfair to control someones beliefs

Im struggling to phrase what I mean but I think others will know what I am on about

In my honest opinion after watching this user for the past couple of weeks I am confident when I say that I dont think that this user is mature enough to edit the Simple English Wikipedia Starting a form of the Guestbook that we used to have on his talk page shows that he does not cope with the fact that Wikipedia is not a friend gathering and meeting place but rather a place where people volunteer to build an encyclopedia His vote on Jamess RFCU was also immature at the time and overall I dont think that this user is a good match with Wikipedia Razorflame 2025 28 December 2009

Personally Im more concerned about his use of the flood flag Purplebackpack89 1708 29 December 2009

Administrators

I draw to your discussion the indefinite semi protection of Nigger by Katerenka and the ensuing discussion here

In summary Purplebackpack saw fit to request a semi protection after a raft of vandalism from one user in one day Brian protected it for a few hours during that day however Kate came along and added an indef semi for no apparent reason

As you should all know the Protect tool is meant to be preventative not punative and this action was clearly unsolicited when the amount of vandalism points only to a block of the IP editor involved

As discussing at that page has brought nothing up im bringing it to the wider administrator community for further discussion and action

I maintain my views set out in the discussion that it was an inappopriate protection and misuseage of the Administrator tools

Regards

Goblin 1705 4 January 2010 I Kennedy

Have to agree with BG here In the case of single editors pages should not be protected Instead users should be blocked I believe there is even a policy somewhere stating it Protection as BG said is not supposed to be proactive only reactive DJSasso 1837 4 January 2010 FYI Protection changed 1 week semi protection When it expires I propose we handle this the same we do the other pages that is block the offenders protect page for short periods only  Eptalon 2324 4 January 2010
