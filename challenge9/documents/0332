The Whitehurst Son Sundial was produced in Derby in 1812 by the nephew of John Whitehurst It is now in the Derby Museum and Art Gallery This is a precise sundial which tells not only local apparent time but also local mean time using a scale on it It is accurate to the nearest minute

The Whitehurst family was known in Derby as skillful mechanics John Whitehurst was born in Congleton but came to Derby where he became a watch and clock maker He moved to London to assume the post of Inspector of Weights His nephew continued the business under the name of Whitehurst Son The family business was known for their turret clocks

To construct a sundial one must understand the geometry of the solar system and particularly how the sun will cast a shadow onto a flat surface in this case a horizontal surface Each day over a yearly cycle the shadow will be different from the day before and the shadow is specific to the location of the dial particularly its latitude The dial is designed to tell local apparent time so the longitude is not important In this case noon will be at the point when the sun is highest in sky and due south and standard time would be when the sun was due south at another point such as the Royal Observatory at Greenwich Derby is at 1 28 462 West of Greenwich so the sun is approximately 5 mins and 5205 s later in reaching noon And also when telling the time we must consider the equation of time That is to say as the earth moves around the sun in a slight ellipse day length slightly varies everyday For example the difference from the average becomes up to 16 minutes in November and February This equation of time had been really unknown for a long time until people started comparing sundials with mechanical clocks If a clock ignores this difference it measures average time If a clock is re balanced each day to make them correspond with the natural cycle it measures local mean time A fixed noon and fixed day are essential for railways timetabling so Greenwich Mean Time was adopted In the case of Midland Railway it was by January 1848

This particular bronze sundial is marked Whitehurst and SonDerby1812 and is thought to have been made for George Benson Strutt for his home Bridge Hill House in Belper This has the precise location of 53 1 4908 north and 1 29 2688 West of Greenwich which is slightly different from those of Derby at 52 55 00 north a difference of 6 49 The Longitude is almost same and gives only a 2 second time difference

The dial is stoutly made and has one thick style The dial plate is not one complete circle but two semicircles separated by the thickness of the style In this design of sundial the angle of the style to the dial plate is exactly the same as latitude which is 53 1 49 The dial plate will be perfectly horizontal there In case it is placed at different location slight adjustment for latitude is required by slanting the dial plate As the dial is now 0 6 49 or about 110th of a degree south the nose of the gnomon needs to be raised by that amount

where is the sundials geographical latitude is the angle between a given hour line and the noon hour line on the plane and t is the number of hours before or after noon

This generates these results

The hours before noon are exactly the same because the dial is symmetrical so the other lines are mirror images of those above In the same manner the half hours and the minute lines would be calculated As noon is set exactly on the north south line and not 5 and 54 to one side we can tell that this dial is telling Belper time and not Greenwich time

Significantly on the plate we can see a pair of scales that help the observer make the equation of time correction One scale gives the date in months and days Along side of it another scale is engraved with the minutes on that day that the watch would be running faster or slower Here it is labeled Watch Slower Watch Faster The 15th April is one day when no conversion needs to be made This dial can be used both to read solar time shown by sundials and also the mean time that is favoured by clocks with the practical purpose that observers can use the dial to calibrate their pocket watches which in 1812 would not always run true By 1820 watches manufacture had improved and the Lever escapement had become popular so frequent calibration was no longer needed

Another Whitehurst sundial dated around 1800 sold for 1850 in 2005 in Derby

A chimney is a structure used to ventilate hot flue gases or smoke from a boiler stove furnace or fireplace to the outside atmosphere Most chimneys are vertical or almost vertical to make sure that the gases flow easily drawing air into the combustion in what is known as the stack or chimney effect The space inside a chimney is called a flue Chimneys may be found in buildings steam locomotives and ships In the United States the term smokestack is also used when talking about locomotive chimneys or ship chimneys the word funnel can be used too

The Height of a chimney is really important when higher chimneys dispersion of pollutants will not cause too much influence on surrounding areas Tall chimneys also allow chemicals to self neutralize in the air before they reach the ground

A Home appliance is any electrical machine use to complete some household task such as cooking or cleaning Home appliances can be classified into

Stephen Jay Gould was an American paleontologist evolutionary biologist taxonomist and historian of science 

He was also one of the most influential and widely read writers of popular science of his generation

Gould spent most of his career teaching at Harvard University and working at the American Museum of Natural History in New York In the latter years of his life Gould also taught biology and evolution at New York University near his home in SoHo

Goulds greatest contribution to science was the theory of punctuated equilibrium which he developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972 The theory proposes that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability which is punctuated by rare instances of branching evolution The theory was contrasted against the idea that evolutionary change is marked by a pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record

Most of Goulds empirical research was based on the snail genera Poecilozonites and Cerion He also contributed to evolutionary developmental biology and has received wide praise for his book Ontogeny and Phylogeny In evolutionary theory he opposed strict selectionism sociobiology as applied to humans and evolutionary psychology He campaigned against creationism

Many of Goulds Natural History essays were reprinted in collected volumes

Topoisomerase is an enzyme that unwinds and winds DNA in order to help the creation of DNA structures 

DNA is in a helixspiral which helps make the structure of DNA strong and stable However when undergoing DNA replication the spiral needs to be untwisted and when spirals are being untwisted knots and breaks can happen When studying the structure of DNA James D Watson and Francis Crick knew that there was need for an enzyme to overcome this problem 

Topoisomerase binds to either side of the DNA strands and allows the DNA to be untangled or unwound

Lionel Cranfield Sackville 1st Duke of Dorset PC was an English politician and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland

Dorset was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland twice First from 1731 to 1737 and then again from 1751 to 1755 

The Christmas Raid or Magazine fort raid happened on the 23 December 1939 The Irish Republican Army stole a lot of weapons and ammunitions from the Irish Army Although the theft from the Magazine Fort building in Phoenix Park was succesful most of what was stolen was recovered by the Irish Army a few days later Several IRA volunteers were arrested

The reason for the raid was that the IRA had many Thompson submachine guns They found it hard to get the 45 ACP bullets used in these guns in Europe Because the Irish Army also used the Thompson and had large supplies of bullets the IRA decided to steal some 

Around 2030 the gate bell rang and the Military Police officer on guard opened the gate a little for a civilian who said he had a parcel to deliver to the officer in charge The unidentified man told the MP to open the gate fully and put his hands up At this point the IRA team appeared from both inside and outside the fort confiscating the weapons of the sentry and MP

The two hostages were then forced to act as human shields for the two intruders to the guardroom where the remaining soldiers were caught by surprise and gave up without a fight The captives heard many heavy lorries coming and going from the depot At 2210 hrs the IRA locked the prisoners in the so called C Magazine area which the raiders had completely emptied 

It was 2250 by the time a party of soldiers was sent from Portobello Barracks to find out what was happening at the fort They managed to catch two of the raiders 

A total of 1084000 rounds of ammunition had been taken and removed in thirteen lorries with no casualties

Over the next three to four days a large nationwide hunt was organised to find the stolen items

On 1 January 1940 it was reported that almost three quarters of the ammunition had been found a total of 850000 rounds 

In addition some IRA volunteers who were caught storing the ammunition were arrested

The raid was not good for the IRA The massive hunt to find what was stolen turned up all and more It caused IRA Volunteers to be arrested 

The day after the raid the Irish Minister for Justice Gerald Boland at an emergency meeting of the Dil introduced the Emergency Powers bill to allow internment Military Tribunal and executions for IRA members It became the Emergency Powers Act

Vestigial organs are organs of the body which are smaller and simpler than those in related species They have lost or almost lost their original function

Vestigiality is evidence for evolution since they only make sense if evolution has occurred They were one of the puzzles of pre Darwinian natural history The puzzle vanished once biologists realised they once were working adaptations in the ancestors of present day animals

They occur in animals which have changed their style of life from their ancestors Thus snakes lost their legs as their system of movement changed But one type of snake the boas have vestigial rear legs and pelvis The human vermiform appendix is another example That was much larger and stored microbes which produced cellulase to break down plant cell walls Leaves are the main diet of apes

An unused organ usually degenerates and becomes smaller or vanishes altogether Thus amphibia living in dark caves lose their sight and their body colour Mutations pile up All structures need energy for their development maintenance and weight This and the risk of disease in the part provide some selection for the removal of parts which no longer help an organisms fitness 

The human appendix had selection against it because of deaths from appendicitis Appendicitis was untreatable until modern times The selection pressure was probably weak because most cases occur after the age of peak fertility

Observations on the cave dwelling amphipod Gammarus minus showed active selection against their vestigial eyes When mating the males remain on their females for a week or so after fertilisation guarding them against other males The eye sizes of paired males were compared with those of unpaired males The eye sizes of paired males were smaller than the unpaired ones Obviously on average the paired males would have higher fertility than the unpaired males The selection gradient was estimated as 030 which means the selection for small eyes was quite strong The researchers supposed that the loss of sight freed more of the nervous system to process other sensory inputsp310

Occasionally selection turns vestigial organs to a new function Thus the mammalian ear ossicles were once bones in the jaw of early proto mammals the Therapsida The halteres of flies is a perfect example The word exaption was coined for this phenomenon

Boscastle is a village and fishing port on the north coast of Cornwall United Kingdom and 14 miles south of Bude and 5 miles north east of Tintagel 

The name of the village derives from Bottreaux Castle a 12th century fortress of which little survives There is no church in Boscastle but there are churches at Forrabury and Minster Boscastle harbour is a natural inlet protected by two stone harbour walls built in 1584 by Sir Richard Grenville The oldest part of Boscastle surrounds the harbour more modern residential building extends up the valleys of the Rivers Valency and Jordan

A flash flood on 16 August 2004 caused extensive damage to the village Residents were trapped in houses and elsewhere as the roads turned into rivers In the largest peacetime rescue operation ever launched in the UK a total of 91 people were rescued and there were no deaths

Sir Richard Grenville was an English sailor sea captain and explorer He took part in the early English attempts to settle the New World He was in the fight against the Spanish Armada He died in 1591 at the Battle of Flores fighting against overwhelming odds and refusing to surrender his ship the Revenge to the far more numerous Spanish

Sir Richard Grenville was a British naval commander He was born of an old Cornish family in about 1541 His grandfather Sir Richard was a marshal of Calais during the time of Henry VIII Richard Grenvilles father commanded and lost his life in the Mary Rose in 1545 At an early age Richard Grenville served in Hungary under the emperor Maximilian against the Turks

Tintagel formerly Trevena is a civil parish and village on the Atlantic coast of Cornwall United Kingdom It is about 5 miles from Boscastle and 6 miles from Camelford The population of the parish is 1820 people The village and nearby Tintagel Castle are associated with the legends surrounding King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table The village has in recent times become attractive to tourists from many parts of the world and is one of the most visited places in Britain The modern day village of Tintagel was known as Trevena until the Post Office decided to call it Tintagel in the mid 19th century

In the village is the Old Post Office which dates from the 14th century It became a post office during the 19th century and is now owned by the National Trust There are three churches in Tintagel the Anglican church of St Materiana on the cliffs and Methodist and Roman Catholic churches in the village

Scholars have found it hard to explain the origin of Tintagel as a name the most likely one to be correct is from Norman French rather than from Cornish

Camelford is a small town in north Cornwall United Kingdom in the River Camel valley northwest of Bodmin Moor The town is about ten miles north of Bodmin and is governed by a town council

One Unit was the title of a scheme launched by the federal government of Pakistan to merge the four provinces of West Pakistan into one homogenous unit as a counterbalance against the numerical domination of the ethnic Bengalis of East Pakistan The One Unit policy was announced by Prime Minister Muhammad Ali Bogra on 22 November 1954

The province of West Pakistan was created in 14 October 1955 by the merger of the provinces states and Tribal Areas of the western wing The province was composed of twelve divisions and the provincial capital was established at Lahore The province of East Pakistan consisted of East Bengal was renamed East Pakistan with the provincial capital at Dacca The federal government moved the countrys capital in 1959 from Karachi to Rawalpindi whilst the federal legislature moved to Dacca

West Pakistan formed a single and united political entity but with marked linguistic and ethnic distinctions The One Unit policy was regarded as an administrative reform that would reduce expenditure and help eliminate ethnic and parochial prejudices However with the military coup of 1958 trouble loomed for the province when the office of Chief Minister was abolished and the President took over executive powers for West Pakistan The province of West Pakistan was dissolved on July 1 1970 by President General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan

Ethno nationalists were against the unity and amalgamation of the federating units as West Pakistan The actual author of the plan is alleged to be General and later President Ayub Khan

Bodmin Moor is a granite moorland in northeastern Cornwall United Kingdom It is convert208km2sqmi in size and originally dates from the Carboniferous period of geological history 

Bodmin Moor is one of five granite plutons in Cornwall 

The name Bodmin Moor is fairly recent invented in 1813 It was formerly known as Fowey Moor after the River Fowey which rises within it Since the mid 18th century Bodmin Moor has been crossed by the trunk road now known as the A30

Dramatic granite tors rise from the rolling moorland the best known are Brown Willy the highest point in Cornwall at convert417mftabbron and Rough Tor at convert400mftabbron Considerable areas of the moor are poorly drained and form marshes The rest of the moor is mostly rough pasture or overgrown with heather and other low vegetation

The Moor contains about 500 farm holdings with around 10000 beef cows 55000 breeding ewes and 1000 horses and ponies Most of the moor is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and has been officially designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty as part of Cornwall AONB

Bodmin Moor is the source of several of Cornwalls rivers they are mentioned here anti clockwise from the south 

Inland waters on the moor include Dozmary Pool and three reservoirs Colliford Lake Siblyback Lake and Crowdy reservoir which supply water for a large part of the countys population

The Amphipods are an order of malacostracan crustaceans They have no carapace 

The name amphipoda means different footed Unlike isopods where all the legs are alike amphipods have different appendage types 

Of the 7000 species 5500 are classified into one suborder the Gammaridea The rest are in two or three other suborders 

Amphipods range in size from convert1to340mmsigfig2 and are mostly detritivores or scavengers They live in almost all aquatic environments 750 species live in caves and the order also includes terrestrial animals and sandhoppers such as Talitrus saltator

Mature females bear a marsupium or brood pouch which holds her eggs while they are fertilised and until the young are ready to hatch As a female ages she produces more eggs in each brood Mortality is around 2550 for the eggs There are no larval stages the eggs hatch directly into a juvenile form and sexual maturity is generally reached after 6 moults 

A converter is a chemical reactor which turns raw iron into steel 

Raw iron called pig iron which is the product of blast furnace contains up to 4 of carbon It is too hard and brittle for meaningful use The carbon must first be burned off the iron to produce steel This process is called conversion and the reactor converter

The first converter was invented by Sir Henry Bessemer in 1856 He built a pear shaped large vessel with nozzles for air in the bottom Hot molten pig iron from blast furnace was poured in the converter and then air was pumped in at the bottom with high pressure The result was a loud noise and a flame of up to 20 metres off the mouth of the converter After ten minutes all the pig iron had become steel The Bessemer converter was the first successful reactor on converting pig iron into steel and the era of steel began Steel was now plentiful and cheap

However steel becomes better if only oxygen is blown in Air contains nitrogen which is harmful for some steel grades A modern converter called basic oxygen furnace uses pure oxygen instead of air It was invented 1949 in Austria

The modern basic oxygen converter is a large pumpkin shape vessel which is made from steel and lined with refractories such as calcium oxide and magnesium oxide line so the vessel can withstand the high temperature of molten metal 

Molten pig iron and scrap are loaded in the converter The scrap usually is rusty and contains oxygen so some of the rust reacts with the pig iron burning the carbon away and creating heat which melts the scrap Once all scrap has melted a special pipe called oxygen lance is lowered in the pig iron and a very fast and sharp blow of oxygen is blasted in The oxygen burns all the carbon away and mixes the liquid steel thoroughly Once all carbon has been burned away some extra carbon is inserted to raise the contents to desired level The result is liquid steel which is then tapped away and taken to rolling mill to produce steel products

A cylinder is one of the most basic curved geometric shapes with the surface formed by the points at a fixed distance from a given line segment known as the axis of the cylinder The shape can be thought of as a circular prism Both the surface and the solid shape created inside can be called a cylinder The surface area and the volume of a cylinder have been known since ancient times

In differential geometry a cylinder is defined more broadly as any ruled surface which is spanned by a one parameter family of parallel lines A cylinder whose cross section is an ellipse parabola or hyperbola is called an elliptic cylinder parabolic cylinder or hyperbolic cylinder respectively

In common use a cylinder is taken to mean a finite section of a right circular cylinder ie the cylinder with the generating lines perpendicular to the bases with its ends closed to form two circular surfaces as in the figure If the cylinder has a radius mathr and length h then its volume is given by

and its surface area is

Therefore without the top or bottom the surface area is

With the top and bottom the surface area is

For a given volume the cylinder with the smallest surface area has math1h 2r For a given surface area the cylinder with the largest volume has math1h 2r ie the cylinder fits in a cube

Cylindric sections are the intersections of cylinders with planes For a right circular cylinder there are four possibilities A plane tangent to the cylinder meets the cylinder in a single straight line Moved while parallel to itself the plane either does not intersect the cylinder or intersects it in two parallel lines All other planes intersect the cylinder in an ellipse or when they are perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder in a circle

This equation is for an elliptic cylinder a generalization of the ordinary circular cylinder Even more general is the generalized cylinder the cross section can be any curve

The cylinder is a degenerate quadric because at least one of the coordinates does not appear in the equation

An oblique cylinder has the top and bottom surfaces displaced from one another

In projective geometry a cylinder is simply a cone whose apex is at infinity

This is useful in the definition of degenerate conics which require considering the cylindrical conics

A tuning fork is a sound resonator which is a two pronged fork The prongs called tines are made from a U shaped bar of metal This bar of metal can move freely It resonates at a specific constant pitch when set vibrating by striking it against an object It sounds a pure musical tone after waiting a moment to allow some high overtone sounds to die out The pitch depends on the length of the two prongs Its main use is as a standard of pitch to tune other musical instruments and in some tests of hearing

The tuning fork was invented in 1711 by British musician John Shore He was the Sergeant Trumpeter to the court who had musical parts written for him by the composers George Frideric Handel and Henry Purcell

The fork shape produces a very pure tone Most of the vibrational energy is at the fundamental frequency with very few overtones This is not the case with other resonators The reason for this is that the frequency of the first overtone is about 5222 254 6 times the fundamental By comparison the first overtone of a vibrating string is only one octave above the fundamental So when the fork is struck little of the energy goes into the overtone modes they also die out correspondingly faster leaving the fundamental It is easier to tune other instruments with this pure tone when listening to compare with the tone of each other instrument

Another reason for using the fork shape is that when it vibrates in its principal mode the handle vibrates up and down as the prongs move apart and together There is a node at the base of each prong  The handle motion is small allowing the fork to be held by the handle without damping the vibration but it allows the handle to transmit the vibration to a resonator which amplifies the sound of the fork Without the resonator the sound is very faint The reason for this is that the sound waves produced by each fork prong are 180 out of phase with the other so at a distance from the fork they interfere and largely cancel each other out If a sound absorbing sheet is slid in between the prongs of a vibrating fork reducing the waves reaching the ear from one prong the volume heard will actually increase due to a reduction of this cancellation

Commercial tuning forks are normally tuned to the correct pitch at the factory but they can be retuned by filing material off the prongs Filing the ends of the prongs raises the pitch while filing the inside of the base of the prongs lowers it

The most common tuning fork sounds the note of A 440 Hz This is the standard concert pitch used as tuning note by some orchestras It is the pitch of the violins second string the first string of the viola and an octave above the first string of the cello all played open Tuning forks used by orchestras between 1750 and 1820 mostly had a frequency of A 4235 Hz although there were many forks and many slightly different pitches Standard tuning forks are available for all the musical pitches within the central octave of the piano and other pitches Well known manufacturers of tuning forks include Ragg and John Walker both of Sheffield England

Forks have traditionally been used to tune musical instruments although electronic tuners are replacing them in many applications Tuning forks can be driven electrically by placing electromagnets close to the prongs that are attached to an electronic oscillator circuit so that their sound does not die out

A number of keyboard musical instruments using constructions similar to tuning forks have been made the most popular of them being the Rhodes piano which has hammers hitting constructions working on the same principle as tuning forks

The Accutron an electromechanical watch developed by Max Hetzel and manufactured by Bulova beginning in 1960 used a 360 hertz steel tuning fork powered by a battery as its timekeeping element The fork allowed it to achieve greater accuracy than conventional balance wheel watches The humming sound of the tuning fork could be heard when the watch was held to the ear

Tuning forks usually C 512 are used by doctors to check a patients hearing Lower pitched ones are also used to check vibration sense as part of the examination of the peripheral nervous system

Tuning forks are also used in alternative medicine such as sonopuncture and polarity therapy

Medical Tuning Fork 128 Hz

A radar gun used to measure the speed of cars or balls in sports is usually calibrated with tuning forks Instead of the frequency these forks are labeled with the calibration speed and radar band for which they are calibrated

Doubled and H type of tuning forks are used for tactical grade Vibrating Structure Gyroscopes like QuapasonTM and different types of MEMS

St Neot is a parish and village in Cornwall United Kingdom It is between the towns of Bodmin and Liskeard The parish is named after the Saxon monk Saint Neot On the northern side the parish includes part of Bodmin Moor and hamlets in the parish include Draynes Ley and Pantersbridge

During the English Civil War St Neot was staunchly Royalist To commemorate this each year on Oak Apple Day an oak branch is mounted on the top of the church tower

The early medieval church building must have been smaller than the one in existence today and the church was rebuilt in granite in the 15th century The fine stained glass windows are from about 1500 The stained glass is partly original and partly from a restoration done by John Hedgeland ca 1830

Lombes Mill was the first successful silk throwing mill in England It was built in an island on the River Derwent in Derby John Lombe visited Piedmont in 1717 and studied details of the Italian silk throwing machines the filatoio and the torcitoio Then he returned to England with some Italian craftsmen and built the mill George Sorocold designed the building

Lombes Mill was built next to Thomas Cotchetts 1704 mill on the west bank of the River Derwent in Derby At this point a weir had been constructed across the river and the mill was built on an island downstream which separated the river from the tail race of three corn mills Derby was an important place because the river had a fast flow and A6 road crossed the river here

This mill is significant as it was the first successful silk throwing mill in England and probably the first fully mechanized factory in the world 

Thomas Cotchett built the first mill in Derby in 1704 but it was unsuccessful So John Lombe visited Piedmont in 1716 to see the successful silk throwing mill there This was an early example of industrial spying He returned to Derby with the knowledge and a group of Italians He and his half brother Thomas Lombe instructed George Sorocold to build a mill to his design and fitted it with the new machines It was built to the south of Cotchetts Mill Thomas Lombe was given a 14 year patent to protect the design of the throwing machines he used This displeased the King of Sardinia and he stopped exporting suitable raw silk It is speculated that he was responsible for John Lombes mysterious death six years later in 1722 His elder brother Thomas Lombe took over the business When the patents lost effect in 1732 other mills were built in Stockport and Macclesfield To the north of the powered Italian Works an unpowered Doubling Shop was built this happened before 1739 The mill was sold in 1739 to Thomas Wilson and an inventory of this time is still exists

Most of the building was rebuilt in after years and little of the original mill remain It is known from written sources that it was five storeys high rectangular in plan It was 17m high 335m long and 12m wide The roof was slightly sloped It was built of brick in flemish bond on a series of stone arches that allowed the waters of the River Derwent to flow through The throwing machines were two storeys high and fastened on the first floor The winding machines were placed on the top three floors All the machines were powered by Sorocolds external undershot water wheel It was 7m in diameter and 2m in width Its stem entered the mill through a hole at first floor level It drove a vertical shaft which was 045m square This drove a line shaft that ran the length of the mill The torcitoios and filatoios took their power from this shaft The vertical shaft was extended to a further vertical shaft that reached the top 3 floors to drive the winding machines The mill needed to be heated in order to process the silk and this was explained in the 1718 patent It was reported in 1732 that Lombe used a fire engine to pump hot air round the mill The stair column was 195m high but its layout is unknown There is no information on how materials were carried up and down between the floors

The main range was three storeys high 424m by 55m Each floor was used for doubling and there were 306 doubling machines

In 1700 the Italians were the most technologically advanced in silk throwing in Europe and they had developed two machines capable of winding the silk onto bobbins while putting a twist in the thread They called the throwing machine a filatoio and the doubler a torcitoio There is an illustration of a circular handpowered throwing machine with 32 spindles The first evidence of a externally powered filatoio comes from the thirteenth century and the earliest illustration from around 1500 Filatorios and torcitoios contained parallel circular frames that revolved round each other on a central axis The speed of the relative rotation determined the twist Silk would only cooperate in the process if the temperature and humidity were high in Italy the temperature was elevated by sunlight but in Derby the mill had to be heated and the heat evenly distributed

The mill then passed through several hands and has been rebuilt several times but the modified structure still exists and has been restored to house the Derby Industrial Museum A Bas relief sculpture of John Lombe may be found at the nearby Exeter Bridge

Binary adders are devices used to add binary numbers They are used in computers They take two binary numbers and put them together to get a sum In its most basic form it uses two XOR gates two AND gates and an OR gate These gates figure out what the numbers being sent in mean and if the digit needs to be turned on or not When solving this example 1001 1100 it would need five single bits to give an answer The first digits in each number would go to one adder 1 and 0 It would calculate that 1 0 1 so that first digit would be 1 The second digits from each are 0 and 0 and 0 0 0 so the second digit is 0 the third digit from each are 1 and 0 and 1 0 1 so the third digit is 1 The fourth digit in each are 1 and 1 and 1 1 10 but because this is a 2 digit number it holds the first digit and send the second digit to the next adder The next adder sees 1 and 1 1 so the fith digit is 1 If we take the sum digits in order they come out as 10101 so 1001 1100 10101

The precision of a numeric value describes the number of digits that are used to show that value In a scientific setting this would be the total number of digits or less commonly the number of fractional digits or decimal places This second definition is useful in financial and engineering applications where the count of digits in the fractional part has particular importance

In both cases the term precision can be used to describe the position at which an inexact result will be rounded For example in floating point arithmetic a result is rounded to a given or fixed precision which is the length of the resulting significand In financial calculations a number is often rounded to a given number of places

As an example the decimal quantity 12345 can be expressed with various numbers of significant digits or decimal places If insufficient precision is available then the number is rounded in some manner to fit the available precision The following table shows the results for various total precisions and decimal places rounded to the nearest value using the round to even method

Note that it is often not appropriate to display a figure with more digits than that which can be measured For instance if a device measures to the nearest gram and gives a reading of 12345 kg it would create false precision if the measurement were expressed 1234500 kg with 2 extra zeroes at the end

The representation of a positive number x to a precision of p significant digits has a numerical value that is given by the formula

For a negative number the numerical value is minus that of the absolute value The number 0 to any precision can be taken to be 0

Rounding is often done on purpose to obtain a value that is easier to write and handle than the original It may be done also to indicate the accuracy of a computed number for example a quantity that was computed as 123456 but is known to be accurate only to within a few hundred units is better stated as about 123500

On the other hand rounding can introduce some round off error in the result Rounding is almost unavoidable in many computations especially when dividing two numbers in integer or fixed point arithmetic when computing mathematical functions such as square roots logarithms and sines or when using a floating point representation with a fixed number of significant digits In a sequence of calculations these rounding errors generally accumulate and in certain ill conditioned cases then they may make the result meaningless

Accurate rounding of transcendental mathematical functions is difficult because the number of extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether to round up or down cannot be known in advance This problem is known as the table makers dilemma

Rounding has many similarities to the quantization that occurs when physical quantities must be encoded by numbers or digital signals

Typical rounding problems are

The most common type of rounding is to round to an integer or more generally to an integer multiple of some increment such as rounding to whole tenths of seconds hundredths of a dollar to whole multiples of 12 or 18 inch to whole dozens or thousands etc

In general rounding a number x to a multiple of some specified increment m entails the following steps

For example rounding x 21784 dollars to whole cents entails computing y xm 21784001 21784 then rounding y to the integer q 218 and finally computing z qm 218001 218

When rounding to a predetermined number of significant digits the increment m depends on the magnitude of the number to be rounded

The increment m is normally a finite fraction in whatever numeral system that is used to represent the numbers For display to humans that usually means the decimal numeral system For intermediate values stored in digital computers it often means the binary numeral system

The abstract single argument round function that returns an integer from an arbitrary real value has at least a dozen distinct concrete definitions presented in the rounding to integer section The abstract two argument round function is formally defined here but in many cases it is used with the implicit value m 1 for the increment and then reduces to the equivalent abstract single argument function with also the same dozen distinct concrete definitions

The most basic form of rounding is to replace an arbitrary number by an integer All the following rounding modes are concrete implementations of the abstract single argument round function presented and used in the previous sections

There are many ways of rounding a number y to an integer q The most common ones are

The first four methods are called directed rounding as the displacements from the original number y to the rounded value q are all directed towards or away from the same limiting value

If y is positive round down is the same as round towards zero and round up is the same as round away from zero If y is negative round down is the same as round away from zero and round up is the same as round towards zero In any case if y is integer q is just y The following table illustrates these rounding methods

Where many calculations are done in sequence the choice of rounding method can have a very significant effect on the result A famous instance involved a new index set up by the Vancouver Stock Exchange in 1982 It was initially set at 1000000 and after 22 months had fallen to about 520 whereas stock prices had generally increased in the period The problem was caused by the index being recalculated thousands of times daily and always being rounded down to 3 decimal places in such a way that the rounding errors accumulated Recalculating with better rounding gave an index value of 1098892 at the end of the same period

Rounding a number y to the nearest integer requires some tie breaking rule for those cases when y is exactly half way between two integers that is when the fraction part of y is exactly 05

The following tie breaking rule called round half up is widely used in many disciplines That is half way values y are always rounded up 

For example by this rule the value 235 gets rounded to 24 but 235 gets rounded to 23

This is one of two rules generally taught in US elementary mathematics classesCitation neededdateMarch 2009

If it were not for the 05 fractions the roundoff errors introduced by the round to nearest method would be quite symmetric for every fraction that gets rounded up there is a complementary fraction that gets rounded down by the same amount When rounding a large set of numbers with random fractional parts these rounding errors would statistically compensate each other and the expected value of the rounded numbers would be equal to the expected value of the original numbers

However the round half up tie breaking rule is not symmetric as the fractions that are exactly 05 always get rounded up This asymmetry introduces a positive bias in the roundoff errors For example if the fraction of y consists of three random decimal digits then the expected value of q will be 00005 higher than the expected value of y For this reason round to nearest with the round half up rule is also known as asymmetric rounding

One reason for rounding up at 05 is that only one digit need be examined When seeing 1750000 for example the first three figures 175 determines that the figure would be rounded up to 18 If the opposite rule were used then all the zero decimal places would need to be examined to determine if the value is exactly 175

One may also use round half down as opposed to the more common round half up

For example 235 gets rounded to 23 and 235 gets rounded to 24

The round half down tie breaking rule is not symmetric as the fractions that are exactly 05 always get rounded down This asymmetry introduces a negative bias in the roundoff errors For example if the fraction of y consists of three random decimal digits then the expected value of q will be 00005 lower than the expected value of y For this reason round to nearest with the round half down rule is also known as asymmetric rounding

The other tie breaking method commonly taught and used is the round half away from zero namely

For example 235 gets rounded to 24 and 235 gets rounded to 24

This method treats positive and negative values symmetrically and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability However this rule will still introduce a positive bias for positive numbers and a negative bias for the negative ones

It is often used for currency conversions and price roundings as it is easy to explain by just considering the first fractional digit independently of supplementary precision digits or sign of the amount

One may also round half towards zero as opposed to the more common round half away from zero

For example 235 gets rounded to 23 and 235 gets rounded to 23

This method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability However this rule will still introduce a negative bias for positive numbers and a positive bias for the negative ones

A tie breaking rule that is even less biased is round half to even namely

Thus for example 235 becomes 24 225 becomes 22 225 becomes 22 and 235 becomes 24

This method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability In addition for most reasonable distributions of y values the expected value of the rounded numbers is essentially the same as that of the original numbers even if the latter are all positive However this rule will still introduce a positive bias for even numbers and a negative bias for the odd ones

This variant of the round to nearest method is also called unbiased rounding convergent rounding statisticians rounding Dutch rounding Gaussian rounding or bankers rounding This is widely used in bookkeeping

This is the default rounding mode used in IEEE 754 computing functions and operators

Another tie breaking rule that is very similar to round half to even namely

Thus for example 225 becomes 23 215 becomes 21 215 becomes 21 and 225 becomes 23

This method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability In addition for most reasonable distributions of y values the expected value of the rounded numbers is essentially the same as that of the original numbers even if the latter are all positive However this rule will still introduce a negative bias for even numbers and a positive bias for the odd ones

This variant is almost never used in most computations except in situations where one wants to avoid rounding 05 or 05 to zero or to avoid increasing the scale of numbers represented as floating point so that a non infinite number would round to infinite or that a small denormal value would round to a normal non zero value Effectively this mode prefers preserving the existing scale of tie numbers avoiding out of range results when possible

Another unbiased tie breaking method is stochastic rounding

Like round half to even this rule is essentially free of overall bias but it is also fair among even and odd q values On the other hand it introduces a random component into the result performing the same computation twice on the same data may yield two different results Also it is open to unconscious bias if humans are randomly deciding in which direction to round

One method more obscure than most is round half alternatingly

This suppresses the random component of the result if occurrences of 05 fractional parts can be effectively numbered But it can still introduce a positive or negative bias according to the direction of rounding assigned to the first occurrence if the total number of occurrences is odd

In some contexts all the rounding methods above may be unsatisfactory For example suppose that y is an accurate measurement of an audio signal which is being rounded to an integer q in order to reduce the storage or transmission costs If y changes slowly with time any of the rounding method above will result in q being completely constant for long intervals separated by sudden jumps of 1 When the q signal is played back these steps will be heard as a very disagreeable noise and any variations of the original signal between two integer values will be completely lost 

In practice when rounding large sets of sampled data the accumulation of roundoff errors is most frequently used with a simple predictive rounding of the modified values because it will still preserve the hyperbolic convergence towards zero of the overall mean roundoff error bias and of its standard deviation This enhancement is frequently used in image and audio processing

The effective propagation of accumulated roundoff errors may depend on the discrete dimension of the sampled data to round when sampling bidimensional images including colored images or tridimensional videos or on polyphonic audio data it may still be preferable to propagate this error into a preferred direction or equally into several orthogonal dimensions such as vertically vs horizontally for bidimensional images or into parallel color channels at the same position andor timestamp and depending on other properties of these orthogonal discrete dimensions In those cases several roundoff error accumulators may be used or a dimension vector of accumulators

In some of these cases the discrete dimensions of the data to sample and round may be treated non orthogonally for example when working with colored images the trichromatic color planes data in each physical dimension could be remapped using a perceptive color model so that the roundoff error accumulators will be designed to preserve lightness with a higher probability than hue or saturation instead of propagating errors into each orthogonal color plane independently and in stereophonic audio data the two rounded data channels may be rounded together to preserve their mean value in priority to their effective difference that will absorb most of the remaining roundoff errors in a balanced way around zero

In some contexts it is desirable to round a given number x to a neat fraction that is the nearest fraction z mn whose numerator m and denominator n do not exceed a given maximum This problem is fairly distinct from that of rounding a value to a fixed number of decimal or binary digits or to a multiple of a given unit m This problem is related to Farey sequences the Stern Brocot tree and continued fractions

This type of rounding which is also named rounding to a logarithmic scale is a variant of Rounding to a specified increment but with an increment that is modified depending on the scale and magnitude of the result Concretely the intent is to limit the number of significant digits rounding the value so that non significant digits will be dropped This type of rounding occurs implicitly with numbers computed with floating point values with limited precision but it may be used more generally to round any real values with any positive number of significant digits and any strictly positive real base

For example it can be used in engineering graphics for representing data with a logarithmic scale with variable steps or in statistical data to define classes of real values within intervals of exponentially growing widthsCitation neededreasonsounds like made up name Rounding to a given number of significant places as described above is as much as Ive come across Note this may be named differently with several synonyms such as logarithmic scaled rounding but the principles are effectively used in floatting point notations but not only logarithmic scales are very common in engineeringdateAugust 2010

This type of rounding is based on a logarithmic scale defined by a fixed non zero real scaling factor s and a fixed positive base b1 and a fixed integer number n0 of significant digits in that base

The primary argument number is first represented in exponential notation x sambc such that the sign s is either 1 or 1 the absolute mantissa a is restricted to the half open positive interval 1b1 and the exponent c is any integer In that representation all significant digits are in the fractional part of the absolute mantissa whose integer part is always zero

If the source number is 0 the absolute mantisssa a is defined as 0 the exponent c is fixed to an arbitrary value and the sign s may be arbitrarily chosen between 1 or 1

A scaled exponential representation as x asbc may also be used equivalently with a signed mantissa a either equal to zero or within one of the two half open intervals and this will be the case in the algorithm below

The steps to compute this scaled rounding are generally similar to the following

For the abstract round function this type of rounding can use any one of the rounding to integer modes described more completely in the next section but it is most frequently the round to nearest mode

For example

Finished lumber writing paper capacitors and many other products are usually sold in only a few standard sizes

Many design procedures describe how to calculate an approximate value and then round to some standard size using phrases such as round down to nearest standard value round up to nearest standard value or round to nearest standard value

When a set of preferred values is equally spaced on a logarithmic scale Choosing the closest preferred value to any given value can be seen as a kind of scaled rounding Such rounded values can be directly calculated The Java language was changed to allow different results where the difference does not matter and require a strictfp qualifier to be used when the results have to conform accurately

It is possible to use rounded arithmetic to evaluate the exact value of a function with a discrete domain and range For example if we know that an integer n is a perfect square we can compute its square root by converting n to a floating point value x computing the approximate square root y of x with floating point and then rounding y to the nearest integer q If n is not too big the floating point roundoff error in y will be less than 05 so the rounded value q will be the exact square root of n In most modern computers this method may be much faster than computing the square root of n by an all integer algorithm

William Kahan coined the term The Table Makers Dilemma for the unknown cost of rounding transcendental functions

The IEEE floating point standard guarantees that add subtract multiply divide square root and floating point remainder will give the correctly rounded result of the infinite precision operation However no such guarantee is given for more complex functions and they are typically only accurate to within the last bit at best

Using the GelfondSchneider theorem and LindemannWeierstrass theorem many of the standard elementary functions can be proved to return transcendental results when given rational non zero arguments therefore it is always possible to correctly round such functions However determining a limit for a given precision on how accurate results needs to be computed before a correctly rounded result can be guaranteed may demand a lot of computation time

There are some packages around now that offer full accuracy The MPFR package gives correctly rounded arbitrary precision results IBM has written a package for fast and accurate IEEE elementary functions and in the future the standard libraries may offer such precision

It is possible to devise well defined computable numbers which it may never be possible to correctly round no matter how many digits are calculated For instance if Goldbachs conjecture is true but unprovable then it is impossible to correctly round down 05 10 n where n is the first even number greater than 4 which is not the sum of two primes or 05 if there is no such number This can however be approximated to any given precision even if the conjecture is unprovable

The concept of rounding is very old perhaps older even than the concept of division Some ancient clay tablets found in Mesopotamia contain tables with rounded values of reciprocals and square roots in base 60 Rounded approximations to the length of the year and the length of the month are also ancient

The Round to even method has served as the ASTM standard since 1940 The origin of the terms unbiased rounding and statisticians rounding are fairly self explanatory In the 1906 4th edition of Probability and Theory of Errors Robert Simpson Woodward called this the computers rule indicating that it was then in common use by human computers who calculated mathematical tables Churchill Eisenharts 1947 paper Effects of Rounding or Grouping Data indicated that the practice was already well established in data analysis

The origin of the term bankers rounding remains more obscure If this rounding method was ever a standard in banking the evidence has proved extremely difficult to find To the contrary section 2 of the European Commission report The Introduction of the Euro and the Rounding of Currency Amounts suggests that there had previously been no standard approach to rounding in banking and it specifies that half way amounts should be rounded up

Until the 1980s the rounding method used in floating point computer arithmetic was usually fixed by the hardware poorly documented inconsistent and different for each brand and model of computer This situation changed after the IEEE 754 floating point standard was adopted by most computer manufacturers The standard allows the user to choose among several rounding modes and in each case specifies precisely how the results should be rounded These features made numerical computations more predictable and machine independent and made possible the efficient and consistent implementation of interval arithmetic

Most programming languages provide functions or special syntax to round fractional numbers in various ways The earliest numeric languages such as FORTRAN and C would provide only one method usually truncation This default method could be implied in certain contexts such as when assigning a fractional number to an integer variable or using a fractional number as an index of an array Other kinds of rounding had to be programmed explicitly for example rounding a positive number to the nearest integer could be implemented by adding 05 and truncating

In the last decades however the syntax andor the standard libraries of most languages have commonly provided at least the four basic rounding functions The tie breaking method may vary depending the language and version andor may be selectable by the programmer Several languages follow the lead of the IEEE 754 floating point standard and define these functions as taking a double precision float argument and returning the result of the same type which then may be converted to an integer if necessary Since the IEEE double precision format has 52 fraction bits this approach may avoid spurious overflows in languages have 32 bit integers Some languages such as PHP provide functions that round a value to a specified number of decimal digits eg from 43215678 to 432157 or 4300 In addition many languages provide a printf or similar string formatting function which allows one to convert a fractional number to a string rounded to a user specified number of decimal places On the other hand truncation is still the default rounding method used by many languages especially for the division of two integer values

On the opposite CSS and SVG do not define any specific maximum precision for numbers and measurements that are treated and exposed in their Document Object Model and in their Interface description language interface as strings as if they had infinite precision and do not discriminate between integers and floating point values however the implementations of these languages will typically convert these numbers into IEEE 754 double floating points before exposing the computed digits with a limited precision

Some disciplines or institutions have issued standards or directives for rounding

In a guideline issued in mid 1966 the US Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology determined that weather data should be rounded to the nearest round number with the round half up tie breaking rule For example 15 rounded to integer should become 2 and 15 should become 1 Prior to that date the tie breaking rule was round half away from zero

Some meteorologists may write 0 to indicate a temperature between 00 and 05 degrees that was rounded to integer This notation is used when the negative sign is considered important no matter how small is the magnitude for example when rounding temperatures in the Celsius scale where below zero indicates freezingCitation neededdateJuly 2009

St Dennis is a parish and village in Cornwall United Kingdom The village is on the B3279 road between Newquay and St Austell

St Dennis had a population of 2696 in the 2001 census The village is famous for its church built on the site of an Iron Age hillfort The area is full of tips and clay pits of china clay mining but St Dennis village itself is designated an island settlement which prevents encroachment by the china clay industry Much of the parish is up to 500 feet above sea level and the countryside is moorland with small fields enclosed by Cornish hedges

The church is on top of a hill overlooking the village and has views to the sea at Newquay It stands on the site of an Iron Age fort The tower is the oldest part of the church and the newer church has been repaired after being destroyed by fire in 1985 The village also has a strong history of Methodism and once had three Methodist chapels two of these are still in use

Illogan is a village and parish in Cornwall United Kingdom It is two miles northwest of Redruth and had a population of 5585 in the 2001 census 

Originally a rural area supporting itself by farming and agriculture Illogan shared in the general prosperity brought about by the 19th century mining boom which was experienced by the whole Camborne Redruth area

The church is dedicated to Saint Illogan of whom little is known Illogan was the birthplace of engineer and inventor Richard Trevithick

There are two Illogan parishes

St Keverne is a parish and village on the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall United Kingdom The population of the parish was 2107 in the 2001 census

The Cornish Rebellion of 1497 started in St Keverne The leader of the rebellion Michael An Gof was a blacksmith from St Keverne and is commemorated by a statue in the village

The parish is a large one and includes some 10 miles of coast from Nare Point at the mouth of the Helford River to Kennack Sands and the Manacles offshore Settlements on the coast include Porthallow Porthoustock and Coverack Inland the parish includes the hamlets of Zoar Laddenvean Traboe Trelan and Gwenter The eastern part of Goonhilly Downs is also in the parish

St Keverne was in the Middle Ages the site of an important monastery The church is dedicated to St Akeveranus The church is very large for a village church and in its present form is 15th century

The Cornish Rebellion of 1497 was a popular uprising by the people of Cornwall in the far southwest of Britain Its primary cause was the peoples response to the raising of war taxes by King Henry VII to pay for a campaign against Scotland Tin miners were angered as the scale of the taxes overturned previous rights granted by Edward I of England to the Cornish Stannary Parliament which exempted Cornwall from all taxes of 10ths or 15ths of income

In reaction to King Henrys tax levy Michael Joseph a blacksmith from St Keverne and Thomas Flamank a lawyer from Bodmin persuaded many of the people of Cornwall to revolt against the King An army of 15000 marched into Devon attracting support in terms of provisions and recruits as they went Apart from one isolated incident at Taunton their march was not accompanied by any violence or looting From Taunton they moved on to Wells where they were joined by the seventh Baron Audley an able soldier 

After issuing a declaration of grievances the army left Wells and marched to Winchester via Bristol and Salisbury remarkably unopposed as they progressed across the south of England At this point having come so far there seems to have been some questioning of what exactly should be done Flamank proposed that they should head for Kent the classic soil of protests the home of the Peasants Revolt of 1381 and Jack Cades rebellion to rally the volatile men of Kent to their banner Having failed to attract support in Kent part of the army abandoned the march and returned home while the rest turned towards Surrey

Moving back west by Tuesday 13 June 1497 the Cornish army arrived at Guildford Although shocked by the scale of the revolt Henry VII had not been idle The army of 8000 men assembled for Scotland was recalled The same day that the Cornish arrived at Guildford Lord Daubeney and his army took up position upon Hounslow Heath and were cheered by the arrival of food and wine dispatched by the Lord Mayor of London

The Crown decided to take the offensive and test the strength and resolve of the Cornish forces Lord Daubeney sent out a force of 500 mounted spearmen and they clashed with the Cornish at Gill Down outside Guildford on Wednesday 14 June 1497

The Cornish army left Guildford and moved via Banstead and Chussex Plain to Blackheath where they pitched their final camp looking down from the hill onto the Thames and City of London Somehow An Gof held his army together but faced with overwhelming odds some Cornish deserted and by morning there remained only some 9 10000 Cornish stalwarts left in arms

The Battle of Deptford Bridge took place on 17 June 1497 on a site in present day Deptford south east London near the River Ravensbourne and was the climax of the Cornish Rebellion Henry VII had an army of some 25000 men and the Cornish lacked the supporting cavalry and artillery arms essential to the professional forces of the time After carefully spreading rumours that he would attack on the following Monday Henry moved against the Cornish at dawn on Saturday The Royal forces were divided into three battles two under Lords Oxford Essex and Suffolk to wheel round the right flank and rear of enemy whilst the third waited in reserve When the Cornish were duly surrounded Lord Daubeney and the third battle were ordered into frontal attack

At the bridge at Deptford Strand the Cornish had placed a body of archers to block the passage of the river Here Daubeney had a hot time of it before his spearmen eventually captured the crossing with some losses Through ill advice or inexperience the Cornish had neglected to provide support for the men at Deptford Strand bridge and the main array stood well back into the heath near to the top of the hill Lord Daubeney and his troops poured across in strength and engaged the enemy with great vigour Daubeney himself was so carried away that he became isolated from his men and was captured Astoundingly enough the Cornish simply released him and he soon returned to the fray

The two other Royal divisions attacked the Cornish precisely as planned and as Bacon succinctly put it being ill armed and ill led and without horse or artillery they were with no great difficulty cut in pieces and put to flight Estimates of the Cornish dead range from 200 to 2000 and a general slaughter of the broken army was well under way when An Gof gave the order for surrender He fled but only got as far as Greenwich before being captured The less enterprising Lord Audley and Thomas Flamank were taken on the field of battle

By 2pm Henry VII had returned to the City in triumph knighting deserving parties on the way to accept the acclamation of the Mayor and attend a service of thanksgiving at St Pauls

In due course severe monetary penalties extracted by Crown agents pauperised sections of Cornwall for years to come Prisoners were sold into slavery and estates were seized and handed to more loyal subjects The remaining rebels that escaped went home ending the rebellion

An Gof and Flamank were both executed at Tyburn London on 27 June 1497 An Gof is recorded to have said before his execution that he should have a name perpetual and a fame permanent and immortal Thomas Flamank was quoted as saying Speak the truth and only then can you be free of your chains Audley as a peer of the realm was beheaded on the 28th June at Tower Hill London

In 1997 a statue depicting the Cornish leaders Michael An Gof and Thomas Flamank was unveiled at An Gofs home village of St Keverne and a commemorative plaque was also unveiled on Blackheath Common

Thomas died of food poisoning while working at Pennys Pleasure Inn in Detroit Michigan 

A shuttle is a tool designed to neatly and compactly store weft yarn while weaving Shuttles are thrown or passed back and forth through the shed between the yarn threads of the warp in order to weave in the weft

The simplest shuttles known as stick shuttles are made from a flat narrow piece of wood with notches on the ends to hold the weft yarn More complicated shuttles incorporate bobbins or pirns

Shuttles are often made of wood from the Flowering Dogwood because it is so hard resists splintering and can be polished to a very smooth finish

Originally shuttles were passed back and forth by hand However John Kay invented a loom in 1733 that incorporated a flying shuttle This shuttle could be thrown through the warp which allowed much wider cloth to be woven much more quickly and made the development of machine looms much simpler

St Just in Penwith is a town and parish in the far west of Cornwall United Kingdom The parish includes the town of St Just and the nearby settlements of Trewellard Pendeen and Kelynack it is bounded by the parishes of Morvah to the north east Sancreed and Madron to the east St Buryan and Sennen to the south and by the sea in the west The town of St Just is the most westerly town in mainland Britain and is about eight miles west of Penzance along the A3071 road St Just parish has a population of 4690 The parish church is a fine 15th century building 

St Just is one of the most ancient mining districts in Cornwall and remains of ancient pre industrial and more modern mining activity have had a considerable impact on the nearby landscape The area was during the 19th century one of the most important mining districts in Cornwall both for copper and tin Mines within the area included Levant Mine Botallack and Geevor Tin Mine It was announced in July 2006 that the St Just mining district and the rest of the historic mining areas of Cornwall had become the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site

The River Fal flows through Cornwall United Kingdom rising on the Goss Moor and reaching the English Channel at Falmouth The River Fal separates the Roseland Peninsula from the rest of Cornwall The Fal estuary is a classic ria or drowned river valley caused by rising sea levels

The origin and meaning of the name of the river are unknown The earliest occurrences of the name are in documents of 969 and 1049 AD Falmouth a town which was known by another name until the 17th century is named after the River Fal

The catchment of the Fal is predominantly Devonian slates shales and grits with granite in the upper reaches Land use is mainly agricultural with some woodland

Tributaries of the River Fal include the River Truro River Kennal River Penryn and River Carnon Several tidal creeks discharge into the River Fal including the Helford River Mylor Creek Pill Creek Penpol Creek and Restronguet Creek

The river is crossed by the historic and scenic King Harry Ferry a vehicular chain ferry that links the villages of Feock and Philleigh

Laser tag what is now considered a game started out as a military training excersize In the beginning laser guns and the laser targets worn on the soldiers bodies were not connected this means that the soldiers were able to continue firing the gun even if they had been tagged One other problem was that they could just reboot the packs essentially getting their second life which does not happen on the battle field

Laser tag does not actually use lasers for the actual tagging device it utilizes infrared leds that are focused with mirrors

Once cyclamates were banned American producers turned to saccharin Saccharin alone was often criticized for having a bitter taste and chemical aftertaste Some manufacturers such as Coca Cola with Tab attempted to rectify this by adding a small amount of sugar In 1977 the FDA was petitioned to ban saccharin too as a carcinogen but a moratorium was placed on the ban until studies were conducted The ban was lifted in 1991 but by that time virtually all diet soda production had shifted to using aspartame Perhaps the most notable holdout is Tab which nevertheless also uses some aspartame in its formula

Recently two other sweeteners sucralose and acesulfame potassium have come into growing use particularly by smaller beverage producers Diet Rite is the non aspartame diet soda brand with the highest sales today it uses a combination of sucralose and acesulfame potassium

Advocates say drinks employing these sweeteners have a more natural sugar like taste than those made just with aspartame and do not have a strong aftertaste The newer aspartame free drinks can also be safely consumed by phenylketonurics because they do not contain phenylalanine Critics say the taste is not better merely different or note that the long term health risks of all or certain artificial sweeteners is unclear

The widespread though not universal agreement that the newest formulations taste much more normal than the older diet sodas have prompted some producers such as Jones Soda to abandon the diet label entirely in favor of sugar free soda implying that the taste is good enough to drink the soda even when not trying to lose weight

In 2005 the Coca Cola Company announced it would produce a new formulation of Diet Coke sweetened with sucralose to be called Diet Coke with Splenda but it would continue to produce the aspartame version as well There were also rumors that a sugar free version of Coca Cola Classic also sweetened with sucralose was being formulated as well This formulation was eventually called Coca Cola Zero though it is sweetened with aspartame in conjunction with acesulfame potassium

The beginning of the diet soda or refreshment era was in 1952 when Kirsch Bottling in Brooklyn New York launched a sugar free ginger ale called No Cal It was designed for diabetics not dieters and distribution remained local Royal Crown Cola placed an announcement in an Atlanta newspaper in 1958 announcing a diet soda product Diet Rite In 1962 Dr Pepper released a diet version of its soda although it sold slowly due to the misconception that it was meant solely for diabetic consumption In 1963 the Coca Cola Company joined the diet soda market with Tab which proved to be a huge success Tab was originally sweetened with cyclamates and saccharin

Tab Diet Rite and Fresca were the only brand name diet refreshments on the market until Pepsi released Diet Pepsi in the 1960s Diet 7 Up was also released in 1963 under the name Like It was discontinued in 1969 due to the US government ban of cyclamate sweetener After reformulation it was reintroduced as Diet 7 Up in 1970 It was renamed Sugar Free 7 Up in 1973 then back to Diet 7 Up in 1979 Coca Cola countered by releasing Diet Coke in 1982 After the release of Diet Coke Tab took a backseat on the Coca Cola production lines Diet Coke could be more easily identified by consumers as associated with Coca Cola than Tab Additionally a study was released claiming that saccharin was a possible carcinogen leading to Coca Colas decision to decrease production of Tab Prompted by the rising popularity of soft drinks in the mid 1980s some of those in the alcohol industry began to follow their lead with some beer companies putting sugar free beer on the market

By the early 1990s a wide array of different companies had their own diet refreshments on supermarket shelves Tab made a comeback during the late 1990s after new studies demonstrated that saccharin is not an important factor in the risk of cancer Nevertheless the Coca Cola Company has maintained its 1984 reformulation replacing some of the saccharin in Tab with NutraSweet

By 2002 some soda companies had diversified to include such flavors as vanilla and lemon among their products and diet sodas were soon being produced with those flavors as well By 2004 several alcohol companies had released sugar free or diet alcoholic products too

Along with possible health concerns of sugar substitutes and caffeine overuseCitation neededdateFebruary 2011 the effectiveness of diet soda as a weight loss tool should also be considered

Changing the food energy intake from one food will not necessarily change a persons overall food energy intake or cause a person to lose weight One study at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio reported by Sharon Fowler at the ADA annual meeting actually suggested the opposite where consumption of diet soda was correlated with weight gain While Fowler did suggest that the undelivered expected calories from diet soda may stimulate the appetite the correlation does not prove that consumption of diet soda caused the weight gain The ADA has yet to issue an updated policy concerning diet soda

An independent study by researchers with the Framingham Heart Study in Massachusetts has turned up results which indicate that the consumption of diet soda correlates with increased metabolic syndrome Of the 9000 males and females studied findings stated that 48 of the subjects were at higher risk for weight gain and elevated blood sugar The researchers also acknowledged that diet soda drinkers were less likely to consume healthy foods and that drinking diet soda flavored with artificial sweeteners more than likely increases cravings for sugar flavored sweets

A preliminary abstract presented by the University of Miamis Hannah Gardener linked daily consumption of diet soda to a 61 higher incidence of vascular events such as strokes and heart attacks although Gardener acknowledged that these results could not be conclusively linked to harmful effects of diet soda itself and may be the result of other behaviors The author stated confirmation was required prior to drawing conclusions These studies were published as abstracts and presented at a conference These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer reviewed journal

Among individuals who drink several regular sodas per day diet soda may be a better choice according to a website on dieting Studies have also indicated that body mass gain is an unlikely consequence of artificial sweetener consumption

Animal studies suggest that artificial sweeteners cause body weight gain theoretically because of a faulty insulin response at least in cattle and rats Rats given sweeteners have steadily increased caloric intake increased body weight and increased adiposity Adding saccharin to the food of calves increases their body weight as well

In some countries outside the United States and Canada the term light is often used instead of diet

In an effort to cash in on the surging popularity of low carbohydrate diets in 2004 both Coca Cola and Pepsico released reduced calorie versions of their flagship sodas that contain approximately half the sugar of the regular version The Pepsi variant Pepsi Edge is sweetened with sucralose and corn syrup The sweetening of the Coca Cola variant Coca Cola C2 is a combination of corn syrup aspartame acesulfame potassium and sucralose Pepsi discontinued Edge in 2005 citing lackluster sales Coca Cola soon followed suit

Half the sugar of a can of regular cola is still more sugar than many people on popular low carbohydrate diets are permitted to have in a day It is possible that these sodas are targeted instead at so called carb conscious consumers who are paying attention to but not trying to drastically reduce their carbohydrate intake

Most of the time changing the i or u prefix to the e prefix changes the meaning like this In some cases like with Durban the name changes too

The Zulu name for the language is isiZulu The isi prefix means language For example isiNgisi means English isiXhosa means Xhosa isiBhunu means Afrikaans and isiJalimane means German

When the word Zulu has a prefix that is not isi it means a lot of different things This is a table that shows how the meanings of the word changes

Some people like to call Zulu isiZulu in English This is like calling Spanish Espaol or Polish Polski when talking in English

Madison Avenue is a north south avenue in the borough of Manhattan in New York City which carries northbound one way traffic It runs from Madison Square to the Madison Avenue Bridge at 138th Street In doing so it passes through Midtown Manhattan the Upper East Side Spanish Harlem and Harlem It is named after Madison Square which is itself named after James Madison the fourth President of the United States Since the 1920s the streets name has been synonymous with the American advertising industry

Madison Avenue was not part of the original New York City street grid established in the Commissioners Plan of 1811 and was carved between Park Avenue and Fifth Avenue in 1836 due to the effort of lawyer and real estate developer Samuel B Ruggles Ruggles was a graduate of Yale University who had previously purchased and developed New Yorks Gramercy Park in 1831 who was in part responsible for the development of Union Square and who also named Lexington Avenue

Madison Avenue carries one way traffic uptown from 23rd Street to 135th Street with the change from two way traffic having taken place on January 14 1966 at which time Fifth Avenue was changed to one way downtown

The term Madison Avenue is often used to mean advertising Madison Avenue became identified with the advertising industry after the quick growth along the avenue during the 1920s

According to The Emergence of Advertising in America by the year 1861 there were twenty advertising agencies in New York City In 1911 the New York City Association of Advertising Agencies was founded as years ahead of the establishment of the American Association of Advertising Agencies

Among various depictions in popular culture the portion of the advertising industry which centers on Madison Avenue serves as a backdrop for the AMC television drama Mad Men which focuses on industry activities during the 1960s

In recent decades many agencies have left Madison Avenue with some moving further downtown and others moving west Today only a few agencies are still located in the old business cluster on Madison Avenue including Young Rubicam StrawberryFrog TBWA Worldwide and Doyle Dane Bernbach However the term is still used to describe the agency business as a whole and the large New Yorkbased agencies in particular

Madison Avenue has a partial lane of the avenue which is limited to turns made by city buses or taxicabs at some hours of the day Based on Section 4 12 of the New York City Traffic Rules driving a vehicle other than a bus is prohibited in the bus lane on Madison Avenue to turn right during the restricted hours specified by sign between 42nd Street and 59th Street All vehicles are allowed at 60th Street but a taxicab carrying a passenger may use the bus lane to turn right at 46th Street

Her husband abdicated the throne of Spain in 1808 and together with Maria Luisa and Godoy spent the rest of his life in exile When Napoleons army invaded the country several pamphlets blamed her for that Maria Luisa spent some years in France and then in Rome Italy Both Maria Luisa and her husband died in Italy in early 1819

Hells Kitchen also known as Clinton and Midtown West is a neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City It covers the area on the West Side between 34th Street and 59th Street from 8th Avenue to the Hudson River

The neighborhood provides transportation hospital and warehouse infrastructure support to the Midtown Manhattan business district Its gritty reputation held back real estate prices in the area compared to much of the rest of Manhattan until the early 1990s

The rough and tumble days on the West Side figure heavily in Damon Runyons stories and the childhood home of Marvel Comics Daredevil Various Manhattan ethnic conflicts formed the basis of the 1957 musical and 1961 film West Side Story

Once a center of poor and working class Irish Americans over the last three decades of the 20th century and into the new millennium Hells Kitchen has undergone change as a result of its location at Midtown The 1969 edition of the Plan for New York City book authored by the City Planning Commission stated that people of modest means were being driven from the area by development pressures due to the Midtown location Today many actors live in the neighborhood due to its closeness to the Broadway theaters and Actors Studio training school

Hells Kitchen generally refers to the area from 34th to 59th streets southwest of Central Park Starting west of 8th Avenue city zoning regulations limit buildings to 6 stories high As a result most of the buildings are older often walk ups For the most part the neighborhood covers the ZIP codes 10019 and 10036 The post office for 10019 is known as Radio City Station the original name for Rockefeller Center on Sixth Avenue

Several different explanations exist for the original name An early use of the phrase appears in a comment Davy Crockett made about another notorious Irish slum in Manhattan Five Points According to the Irish Cultural Society of the Garden City Area

According to an article by Kirkley Greenwell published online by the Hells Kitchen Neighborhood Association

Local historian Mary Clark adds a story when she states the name

Today most residents of the area and most New Yorkers in general refer to the area as Hells Kitchen with Clinton being the name favored by the municipality gentrifiers and eager real estate agents

Jackson used the spoils system a lot when he was president He rewarded his supporters and promised future jobs if local and state politicians joined his team He believed in the theory of rotation in office where people would only remain in a position for a short time He believed that this would keep the civil service from becoming corrupt Other leaders of the Democratic Party wanted to give civil service jobs to friends and loyal party members In total Jackson dismissed less than twenty percent of the original civil service 

As president Jackson encouraged the use of the spoils system It became an important part of the Second Party System and the Third Party System The spoils system was ended in the 1890s

Cornish Dialect is the dialect of the English language spoken in Cornwall 

A long time ago people in Cornwall spoke the Cornish language This is a language similar to Welsh and Breton After a while people speaking English came into Cornwall and the Cornish people started to learn English They didnt speak in exactly the same way as the people they learned English from instead they spoke in a distinct way the Cornish dialect of English Eventually they forgot how to speak the original Cornish language by about the year 1800

Cornish people also spoke Cornish dialect when they went abroad to America and Australia and other places 

The Cornish dialect changes between the west and east of Cornwall In the east it is more like how people in Devon speak

Sometimes Cornish people use different words to people who speak proper English They might also say the words in a different order when they speak Cornish dialect from when they speak proper English which is a difference in grammar between Cornish dialect and proper English Other times they say the same words in a different way using different vowel sounds from proper English

When Cornish people started to go to school in the late 19th century teachers told them to speak proper English not dialect A lot of people thought that people who spoke the dialect were not as intelligent and educated as those who spoke proper English so people spoke the dialect less and the dialect declined In the 20th century a lot of people moved into Cornwall from the south east part of England near London These people did not speak the Cornish dialect and found it hard to understand Cornish people who spoke it The Cornish people spoke the dialect less because they did not want people not to be able to understand them

As fewer people spoke the Cornish dialect other people such as people in the Old Cornwall Society wrote down the dialect and made audio recordings so the dialect wouldnt be lost

People have written books short stories and poetry in Cornish Dialect

Antlers are the usually large branching structures on the heads of deer

Only deer have antlers on males Only reindeer have antlers on the females and these are normally smaller than those of the males 

While an antler is growing it is covered with highly vascular skin called velvet which supplies oxygen and nutrients to the growing bone 

Antlers are one of the most striking cases of male secondary sex characteristics in the animal kingdom They grow faster than any other mammal bones Growth occurs at the tip and is initially cartilage which is mineralized to become bone Once the antler has achieved its full size the velvet is lost and the antlers bone dies This dead bone structure is the mature antler The antlers fall off at some point 

To re grow antlers each year uses up nutrition so they are honest signals of food gathering capability

The principle means of evolution of antlers is sexual selection which operates by two mechanisms Malemale competition and female mate choice 

Malemale competition can take place in two forms First they can compete when males use their antlers as weapons to compete for mates second they can compete where males present their antlers to display their strength and fertility Males with the largest antlers are more likely to obtain mates and achieve fertilization success

Joseph Whittaker was a British Botanist who visited South Australia in 1839 300 plants in Kew Gardens are the collection which Whittaker made during that trip And 2200 pressed British plants in Derby Museum and Art Gallery are also Whittakers

Whittakers exact birth date is not known He was christened at Quarndon near Derby on 8 February 1813 His father was also named Joseph and was a labourer who married to Sarah The son is sometimes reported as being born in Breadsall in 1815

In 1838 Whittaker went on a voyage to Austratia as gardener His new employer was Lt Col George Gawler who had recently been appointed as the second Governor of South Australia Whittaker seven other employees from Derbyshire Gawler and his wife and children arrived on the Pestonjee Bomanjee on 12 October 1838 in Adelaide They had traveled for four months via Rio de Janeiro When Whittaker and Gawler arrived they found poor conditions so gardening was not important

Whittaker collected plants around Adelaide in South Australia in 1839 40 Whittaker traveled to places within South Australia where he collected a wide range of plant samples These included Mount Lofty range Mount Jagged River Torrens River Murray and the Hindmarsh River Whittaker was the first person to collect from the mountainous district of the Fleurieu Peninsula Encounter Bay and Mount Barker 

Whittaker stayed in South Australia for nineteen months before sailing home on the Katherine Stuart Forbes which left from Port Adelaide on 11 April 1840 On the way home his boat stopped four times at Kangaroo Island Mauritius St Helena and Corvo Island in the Azores Whittaker collected further plant samples while the boat was in these harbours

Whittaker arrived back in England on 23 September 1840 and by 1844 had begun collecting plants again His activity peaked in 1851 and 52 ceasing sometime after 1867 He collected from many parts of Derbyshire but he occasionally traveled outside the county including Bulwell Nottinghamshire Rhyl and Denbigh in Wales

By 1846 he was living at Breadsall in Derbyshire where he was a teacher at Breadsall Boys School From here he exchanged letters with Sir William J Hooker Director of the Kew Botanic Gardens Because Whittaker had planed to write a number of books on British botany and needed to exchange some of his Australian and related samples for that Whittaker collected about 300 plants that were eventually acquired by Kew Whittakers collections from outside the UK are now in Kew Gardens Whittaker had the species of sundew Drosera whittakeri named after him

In February 1847 Whittaker became a member of the Botanical Society of London and he swapped plant samples between 1849 to 1853 with its members He then joined the Botanical Exchange Club and finally the Botanical Locality Record Club By 1847 he had enough information to publish a list of rare plants found in the neighbourhood of Breadsall Derbyshire This contained a mixture of both rare and relatively common species and gives a good information of the botanical variety of the area at that time In 1857 he was the schoolmaster of ninety children at Breadsall in Derbyshire a village whose inhabitants included the naturalists Rev Henry Harpur Crewe and Francis Darwin The school was funded by the Harpur Crewe family

Whittaker lived in the small village of Morley near Derby in the late 1850s He lived with his wife Mary in the house named Ferriby Brook He continued to teach there taking up to twelve scholars into his classes usually after they had left the local school and were between eight and eighteen years of age He eventually established a large collection of living plants Local gardener groups reported that he was growing over 1300 different species In 1864 he was publishing works refering the local extinction of the Ladys Slipper Orchid Cypripedium calceolus with the Rev Henry Harpur Crewe By 1871 he quitted a schoolmaster and became a seedsman and florist By 1881 successfully became a nurseryman and farmer He lived with two servants and twenty year old William Whitehead in his house Whitehead was to eventually become a partner in their market gardening venture

Whittakers plant collecting activities began to decline around 1863 around the time his botanical partner Henry Harpur Crewe moved away to become the Rector of Drayton Beauchamp in Buckinghamshire In the following year they cooperated in the production of a manuscript list of the principal flowering plants and ferns of Derbyshire His partnership with Crewe lasted for at least eighteen years and was very productive The Harpur Crewes family lived nearby Calke Abbey and they had funded the school at Breadsall

In the late 1880s Joseph Whittaker gave valuable assistance and supplied a range of plant samples to Rev WHPainter who was preparing to publish a book on the Flora of Derbyshire Many of Whittakers samples and records were also used by William Richardson Linton vicar of Shirley in a further Flora of Derbyshire in 1903 

Whittaker died on 2nd March 1894 By popular subscription a memorial reading desk and engraved brass inscription were built for St Matthews Church Morley where he was a church warden and where he was buried

Whittakers collection at Kew Gardens is from his trip to Australia and from ports where he stayed shortly during the way home He also left a collection of 2200 pressed plants in 79 volumes mostly from Derbyshire which are now held in the herbarium at Derby Museum and Art Gallery They provide important evidential samples for local studies on the flora of Derbyshire Due to his participation in botanical exchanges clubs there are now Whittaker samples in many UK museum collections including those at Bolton Birmingham Gloucester and Manchester The Wisbech and Fenland Museum also has a small collection

The carnivorous sundew species was scientifically described by the French botanist Jules mile Planchon in 1848 This is commonly known as the Scented Sundew or Whittakers Sundew

Cooper Creek is one of the most famous rivers in Australia It is sometimes called the Barcoo River after one of its tributaries It is one of three major Queensland river systems that flow into Lake Eyre The water flow in Cooper Creek comes from monsoonal rains falling months earlier and many hundreds of kilometres away in eastern Queensland At convert1300km in length it is the second longest inland river system in Australia after the Murray Darling system

Charles Sturt named the river in 1845 after Charles Cooper the Chief Justice of South Australia The explorers Burke and Wills died from starvation in 1861 on the banks of Cooper Creek John King survived the expedition with help from the Aborigines Only ten years after the explorers deaths homesteads were being built along the creek A station at Innamincka was the first permanent settlement in the area

By 1880 the reliable water source had attracted many settlers The whole area was taken up and stocked with cattle This pushed the local Aborigines from their traditional lands By 1900 their population was just 30 only 10 of the original number as influenza and measles took their toll

The creek starts west of the Great Dividing Range as two rivers the Thomson from near Longreach and Charters Towers and the Barcoo in the area around Barcaldine about convert500km inland from Rockhampton 

Cooper Creek spreads out into a vast area of channels making its way south into the far south west corner of Queensland before turning west into South Australia towards Lake Eyre In most years the water soaks into the earth fills channels and waterholes or simply evaporates without reaching Lake Eyre In very wet years however it can flood the entire Channel Country and reach Lake Eyre after flowing through the Strzelecki Desert Sturt Stony Desert and the Tirari Desert Although the Cooper carries much more water than the Diamantina and the Georgina it does not flow into Lake Eyre as often as those rivers One reason is that much more water is lost than with the Diamantina or Georgina During a flood Cooper Creek may be as wide as convert40km

Most of the land around the Cooper is used for sheep and cattle grazing on natural grasslands The rainfall is not reliable enough to grow crops The soils are quite fertile though generally heavy in texture and often crack when they dry out

Irving Crane nicknamed the Deacon was an American pool player from Livonia He was frequent champion and leading player in the sport He is most well known for his skill at the game of straight pool He won six world billiards titles in this game 

Crane became very interested in billiards when he was 11 years old He started play on a toy pool table his brother received as a Christmas gift His parents soon replaced their dining room table with a 4 by 8 pool table Soon Crane started to play in public at a local pool room Crane could play all day and never get bored He couldnt wait to get home from school and start to play pool

Though he taught himself to play at age 14 he ran 89 balls in straight pool at a local pool room He called each shot in advance His parents replaced the smaller table with a full size tournament table Over the next ten years some of the best players including Willie Hoppe and Andrew Ponzi came to practice with Crne Despite consistent play throughout his teenage years Crane did not enter any tournaments until he was 23 years old

In February 1939 at age 26 Crane sank 150 balls in a row against his opponent in an exhibition straight pool match The game was played on a difficult 5 by 10 table in Layton Utah This was impressive But the crowd cheered him and he continued to play He finally put 309 consecutive balls thus shattering the previous world record of 244 consecutive balls

He won his first world title in 1942 Over the next thirty years Crane won almost two dozen major championships including the World Crown in 1946 1955 1966 1968 1970 and 1972 the Ballantine International Championship in 1965 the International Roundrobin championship in 1968 and the World Series of Billiards in 1978 at age 65 At the 1966 World Crown tournament he ran 150 and out in the finals He never let his opponent back to the table after an early safety battle No other player has ever done this Crane also holds the record for the most runner up finishes for the World Crown with 13

Crane found it hard to make a living only by playing pool even though he was very skilled In 1957 he began working as a Cadillac salesman at a dealership in Rochester New York He continued there for 17 years At Rochesters annual auto show his dealerships exhibit had a pool table Crane would run balls while answering questions Working at a regular job was not Cranes first choice In an interview with Sports Illustrated in 1969 he said If I had to make a choice between selling cars and playing pool Id choose pool The only time Ive ever been really happy is when I was at a pool table

He was tall lean man with the imperial bearing of the headmaster of Eton Crane got the nickname The Deacon because of his gentlemanly ways his very cautious approach to the game and his careful style of clothing He always wore a conservative suit when he played 

The Los Angeles Times interviewed Cranes wife Althea They were married 64 years She said A lot of people if it was a hot day and there was no air conditioning theyd take off their coat to play But not Irving Crane Minnesota Fats once said Irv Crane would have been the only guy to notice the horse under Lady Godiva Willie Mosconi criticized Crane for his cautious style He wrote in his 1993 autobiography Willies Game that Crane wouldnt take a shot unless his grandmother could make it 

Crane became a member of the Billiard Congress of Americas hall of fame in 1978 In 1999 Crane was number eight on Billiard Digests fifty greatest players of the century In 1980 Crane retired from professional play He stopped playing entirely in about 1996 On 17 November 17 2001 four days after entering a nursing home Crane died of natural causes He was 88 years old

Euglena is a large genus of unicellular protists which have both plant and animal characteristics

All are motile by means of a flagellum Most have chloroplasts

Euglenids are believed to descend from an ancestor that took up green algae by secondary endosymbiosis

Over 1000 species of Euglena have been described and there are more to be discovered Marin et al revised the genus to include several species without chloroplasts formerly classified as Astasia and Khawkinea 

When acting as a heterotroph the Euglena surrounds a particle of food and consumes it by phagocytosis When acting as an autotroph the Euglena uses chloroplasts to produce sugars by photosynthesis 

The number and shape of chloroplasts within Euglena varies greatly Euglena are able to move through aquatic environments by using a large flagellum for locomotion To detect light the cell has an eyespot a primitive organelle that filters sunlight into light detecting photo sensitive structures at the base of the flagellum allowing only certain wavelengths of light to hit it 

This photo sensitive area detects the light that is able to be transmitted through the eyespot When such light is detected the Euglena may shift its position to get better photosynthesis 

The motility of Euglena also allows hunting Most Euglena are considered mixotrophs autotrophs in sunlight and heterotrophs in the dark Euglena do not have plant cell walls but have a pellicle instead The pellicle is made of protein bands that spiral down the length of the Euglena and lie beneath the plasma membrane

Euglena can survive in fresh and salt water In low moisture conditions Euglena forms a protective wall around itself and lies dormant as a spore until environmental conditions improve Euglena can also survive in the dark by storing paramylon granules inside the chloroplast

Euglenas reproduce asexually and there has been no evidence of sexual reproduction Reproduction includes transverse division and longitudinal division which both occur in the active and encysted forms

Euclids Elements is a large set of math books about geometry written by the ancient Greek mathematician known as Euclid in Alexandria circa 300 BC The set has 13 volumes or sections and has been printed often as 13 physical books rather than one large book It has been translated into Latin with the title Euclidis Elementorum It is the most famous mathmetical text from ancient times

Euclid collected together all that was known of geometry in his time His Elements is the main source of ancient geometry Textbooks based on Euclid have been used up to the present day In the book he starts out from a small set of axioms Euclid then shows the properties of geometric objects and of whole numbers based on those axioms 

The Elements also includes works on perspective conic sections spherical geometry and possibly quadric surfaces Apart from geometry the work also includes number theory Euclid came up with the idea of greatest common divisors They were in his Elements The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the greatest number that can divide evenly into both of the two numbers

The geometrical system described in the Elements was long known simply as geometry and was considered to be the only geometry possible Today that system is referred to as Euclidean geometry to distinguish it from other so called non Euclidean geometries which mathematicians discovered in the 19th century

Occasionally in ancient times writings were attributed to celebrated authors but were not written by them It is in this way that the apocryphal books XIV and XV of the Elements were sometimes included in the collection The spurious Book XIV was probably written by Hypsicles on the basis of a treatise by Apollonius of Perga The book continues Euclids comparison of regular solids inscribed in spheres The chief result is that the ratio of the surfaces of the dodecahedron and icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes

The spurious Book XV was probably written at least in part by Isidore of Miletus This book covers topics such as counting the number of edges and solid angles in the regular solids and finding the measure of dihedral angles of faces that meet at an edge

Gene duplication is any duplication of a region of DNA that contains a gene

Gene duplication is important in supplying raw genetic material new genes to biological evolution This has been recognized since the 1930s Recent genomic sequence data show that duplicated genes are common in all organisms surveyed 

In classical genetics it may occur as an error in crossing over during meiosis or the duplication of an entire chromosome

In non classical genetics it may happen by a retrotransposition event 

The second copy of the gene is often relatively free from selective pressure Mutations of it have no deleterious effects to its host organism Thus it accumulates mutations faster than a functional single copy gene over generations

A duplication is the opposite of a deletion Duplications arise from unequal crossing over that occurs during meiosis between misaligned homologous chromosomes The product of this recombination are a duplication at the site of the exchange and a reciprocal deletion

Gene duplication is believed to play a major role in evolution this idea was first suggested 100 years ago Susumu Ohno was one of the most famous developers of this theory in his classic book Evolution by gene duplication Ohno argued that gene duplication is the most important evolutionary force since the emergence of the last universal common ancestor

Major genome duplication events are not uncommon It is believed that the entire yeast genome underwent duplication about 100 million years ago Plants are the most prolific genome duplicators For example wheat is hexaploid meaning that it has six copies of its genome

The duplication of a gene results in an additional copy that is free from the kind of selection which reduces variability This freedom from consequences allows for more mutations to be carried in the population Some of these might increase the fitness of the organism or code for a new function 

The two genes that exist after a gene duplication event are called paralogs and usually code for proteins with a similar function andor structure By contrast orthologous genes are ones which code for proteins with similar functions but exist in different species and are created from species splitting

Gladstone is a small town in South Australia about 200 km north of Adelaide In 2006 the population was 629

It is in the middle of a farming area that grows wheat and raises sheep but Gladstone is important because it has lots of very big buildings to store wheat barley durum wheat peas faba beans and fiesta beans All together these buildings store the biggest amount of grains in the Southern Hemisphere in a place not by the sea

The railways are important to Gladstone so the grains can be moved to the sea and put on ships The nearest place where this happens is Port Pirie 

The railways are also important to move the grains to the big cities in Australia Gladstone is on the biggest railway line in Australia that goes between Sydney in the east and Perth in the west Railway lines also go south to Adelaide and north to other small towns Now all of the railway lines are 4 ft 8 12 in apart This is called standard gauge Before 1970 the railway lines going north were 3 ft 6 in apart and the railway lines going south were 5 ft 3 in apart All three gauges joined together in Gladstone Look at the photo to see this This is very rare Before 1970 there were only three places in the whole world where this happened

Broadcasting House is the headquarters and registered office of the BBC in Portland Place and Langham Place London

Broadcasting House is home to BBC Radio 3 BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 4 Extra and also houses the BBC Radio Theatre where music and speech programmes are recorded in front of a studio audience It is also the headquarters of the BBC itself and contains the offices of key figures within the organisation such as the Director General

The Original Construction of Broadcasting House took place in 1932 and opened on the 14 May 1932 8 years after the corporation was created and was built as a housing for all their current operations of offices and radio operations Architect George Val Myer designed the building in collaboration with the BBCs civil engineer M T Tudsbery The original interiors were the work of the Australian Irish architect Raymond McGrath He set up and directed a team that included Serge Chermayeff and Wells Coates and designed the vaudeville studio the associated green and dressing rooms and the dance and chamber music studios in a flowing Art Deco style It was later said of his efforts that the designs for the BBC gave the first real fillip to industrial design in England

The building was designed with the radio elements such as the studios in a central location constructed of Portland stone The remainder of the building was steel framed and faced with Portland stone on the outside These areas housed the offices so that they could be both away from the noise of the radio operations and have access to daylight Issues with local residents also caused the structure to be changed The east side of the building blocked out the light to local residents and after complaints and seeking the right of ancient lights the building was changed so that the East side of the building had a sloped roof The building also faced issues with the fact that both the Bakerloo and the Victoria lines of the London Underground as well as sewers 100 years old ran under the site

The building also incorporated other elements the ground floor of the building was fitted with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the street as it was believed that to finance such a project they would need to rent out the ground floor as a retail unit This however never occurred as the Corporation expanded so quickly the space was needed by the BBC

Althea Gibson was a World No 1 American sportswoman who became the first African American woman to be a competitor on the world tennis tour and the first to win a Grand Slam title in 1956 She is sometimes known as the Jackie Robinson of tennis for breaking the color barrier Gibson was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority

Althea Gibson was born at 900 am EDT on August 25 1927 in Silver Clarendon County South Carolina to Daniel and Annie Bell Gibson Althea had two siblings a brother Daniel Jr and a sister Mildred   

Gibson played tennis while going to school for an education In 1946 she moved to Wilmington North Carolina to work on her tennis game with Dr Hubert A Eaton and enrolled at Williston High School

In 1958 Gibson retired from amateur tennis Before the open era of tennis began there was no prize money other than an expense allowance and no endorsement contracts To begin earning prize money tennis players had to give up their amateur status As there was no professional tour for women Gibson was limited to playing in a series of exhibition tours

According to Lance Tingay of The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail Gibson was ranked in the world top ten from 1956 through 1958 reaching a career high of No 1 in those rankings in 1957 and 1958 Gibson was included in the year end top ten rankings issued by the United States Tennis Association in 1952 and 1953 and from 1955 through 1958 She was the top ranked US player in 1957 and 1958 In 1957 Althea became the first African American woman to win Wimbledon She won again in 1958 In 1958 she appeared as the celebrity challenger on the TV panel show Whats My Line

In retirement Gibson wrote her autobiography and in 1959 recorded an album Althea Gibson Sings as well as appearing in the motion picture The Horse Soldiers In 1964 she became the first African American woman to play in the Ladies Professional Golf Association However she was too old to be successful and only played for a few years

In 1971 Gibson was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame and in 1975 she was appointed the New Jersey state commissioner of athletics After 10 years on the job she went on to work in other public service positions including serving on the governors council on physical fitness In later years she suffered two cerebral aneurysms and in 1992 a stroke A few years later Gibson called her former doubles partner Angela Buxton and told her she was considering suicide as she was living on welfare and unable to pay for rent or medication Buxton arranged for a letter to appear in a tennis magazine Buxton told Gibson nothing about the letter but the latter received nearly US1 million from around the world

Gibson was married twice Her first marriage to William Darben took place on October 17 1965 but the couple was divorced in 1976 eleven years later Darben died in 1995 She was also married to Sydney Llewellyn on April 11 1983 and was divorced from him in 1988

On September 28 2003 at the age of 76 Gibson died in East Orange New Jersey due to circulatory failure She was buried there in the Rosedale Cemetery at Orange New Jersey 

On the opening night of the 2007 US Open the 50th anniversary of Gibsons victory at the US Championships in 1957 Gibson was inducted into US Open Court of Champions She was a 1994 inductee of the Sports Hall of Fame of New Jersey and 2009 inductee of the New Jersey Hall of Fame In September 2009 the City of Wilmington NC named its new community tennis complex the Althea Gibson Tennis Center

Gibson became the first African American woman to join the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour in 1964 Her best finish on the tour was a tie for second after a three way playoff at the 1970 Len Immke Buick Open Gibson retired from professional golf at the end of the 1978 season

In evolutionary biology a group of organisms have common descent if they have a common ancestor There is strong quantitative support by a formal test for the theory that all living organisms on Earth are descended from a common ancestor

Charles Darwin proposed the theory of universal common descent through an evolutionary process in On the Origin of Species saying There is a grandeur in this view of life with its several powers having been originally breathed into a few forms or into onep490

The last universal ancestor that is the most recent common ancestor of all currently living organisms is believed to have appeared about 39 billion years ago

In the 1740s Pierre Louis Maupertuis made the first known suggestion that all organisms may have had a common ancestor and that they had diverged through random variation and struggle for existence In Essai de Cosmologie Maupertuis noted

Could one not say that in the fortuitous combinations of the productions of nature as there must be some characterized by a certain relation of fitness which are able to subsist it is not to be wondered at that this fitness is present in all the species that are currently in existence Chance one would say produced an innumerable multitude of individuals a small number found themselves constructed in such a manner that the parts of the animal were able to satisfy its needs in another infinitely greater number there was neither fitness nor order all of these latter have perished The species we see today are but the smallest part of what blind destiny has produced

All known forms of life are based on the same fundamental biochemical organisation

Genetic information is encoded in DNA and transcribed into RNA then translated into proteins by ribosomes with ATP NADH and others as energy sources etc 

The similarities include the energy carrier adenosine triphosphate and the fact that all amino acids found in proteins are left handed 

Furthermore the genetic code is nearly identical for all known lifeforms from bacteria to humans 

The universality of this code is generally regarded by biologists as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent Analysis of the small differences in the genetic code has also provided support for universal common descent A statistical comparison of various alternative hypotheses has shown that universal common ancestry is significantly more probable than models involving multiple origins

Another important piece of evidence is that it is possible to construct detailed phylogenetic trees mapping out the proposed divisions and common ancestors of all living species In 2010 an analysis of available genetic data mapping them to phylogenetic trees gave firm quantitative support for the unity of life there is now strong quantitative support by a formal test for the unity of life

Traditionally these trees have been built using morphological methods such as appearance embryology etc Recently it has been possible to construct these trees using molecular data based on similarities and differences between genetic and protein sequences All these methods produce essentially similar results That phylogenetic trees based on different types of information agree with each other is strong evidence of a real underlying common descent

The CategoryWeather measurements is an index of pages about the measurement of weather such as the temperature

In the fields of science engineering industry and statistics the accuracy and precision of numbers have special meanings The accuracy of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantitys actual value In contrast the precision of a measurement system is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results Although the two words can be synonymous in colloquial use they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method The word precision also refers to how fine the measurement is made as the resolution of the measurement such as to the nearest meter centimeter or yard foot inch or nanometer

A measurement system can be accurate but not precise precise but not accurate neither or both For example if an experiment contains a systematic error then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracy The end result would be a consistent yet inaccurate set of results from the flawed experiment Eliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precision

A measurement system is designated valid if it is both accurate and precise Related terms include bias and error

The terminology is also applied to indirect measurements that is values obtained by a computational procedure from observed data

In addition to accuracy and precision measurements may also have a measurement resolution which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurement

In the case of full reproducibility such as when rounding a number to a representable floating point number the word precision has a meaning not related to reproducibility For example in the IEEE 754 2008 standard it means the number of bits in the significand so it is used as a measure for the relative accuracy with which a number can be shown

The humidex is a temperature index used by Canadian meteorologists to describe how hot the weather feels to a person by adding the effect of heat and humidity For example if the temperature is convert30CF and the calculated humidex is 40 then that means the humid heat feels like a dry temperature of convert40CF The index is widely used in Canadian weather reports during summer to give the discomfort level

According to the Meteorological Service of Canada a humidex of at least 30 causes some discomfort at least 40 causes great discomfort and above 45 is dangerous When the humidex hits 54 then heat stroke is very near

The current formula for getting the humidex was developed by JM Masterton and FA Richardson of Canadas Atmospheric Environment Service in 1979 The humidex differs from the heat index used in the United States in being derived from the dew point rather than the relative humidity

The record highest humidex in Canada occurred on July 25 2007 when Carman Manitoba hit 530 That number broke the previous record of 521 set during 1953 in Windsor Ontario

When the temperature is 30 C and the dew point is 15 C the humidex is 34 Note how humidex is a dimensionless number but it indicates an approximate temperature in C If the temperature remains 30 C and the dew point rises to 25 C the humidex rises to 42 The humidex tends to be higher than the US heat index at equal temperature and relative humidity

The humidex formula is as follows

The heat index is a measurement which combines air temperature and relative humidity as being the human perceived equivalent temperature how hot it feels The result is also known as the felt air temperature or apparent temperature For example when the temperature is convert90FC with very high humidity the heat index can be about convert105FC

The human body normally cools itself by perspiration or sweating which evaporates and carries heat away from the body However when the relative humidity is high then the evaporation rate is reduced so heat is removed from the body at a lower rate causing it to retain more heat than it would in dry air Measurements have been taken based on subjective descriptions of how hot subjects feel for a given temperature and humidity allowing an index to be made which relates one temperature and humidity combination to another at a higher temperature in drier air

The heat index was developed in 1978 by George Winterling as the humiture and was adopted by the National Weather Service a year later It is derived from work carried out by Robert G Steadman Like the wind chill index the heat index contains assumptions about the human body mass and height clothing amount of physical activity thickness of blood sunlight and ultraviolet radiation exposure and the wind speed Large deviations from the typical values will result in heat index values which do not accurately reflect the perceived temperature

In Canada the similar humidex is used in place of the heat index The humidex differs from the heat index in using the dew point rather than the relative humidity

The heat index is defined so as to equal the actual air temperature when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to a baseline value of 16 kPa At standard atmospheric pressure this baseline corresponds to a dew point of 14 C and a mixing ratio of 001 This corresponds to an air temperature of 25C and relative humidity of 50 in the sea level psychrometric chart

At high temperatures the level of relative humidity needed to make the heat index higher than the actual temperature is lower than at cooler temperatures For example at approximately 27 C the heat index will agree with the actual temperature if the relative humidity is 45 but at about 43C any relative humidity reading above 17 will make the Heat Index higher than 43C

The heat index is calculated only if the actual temperature is above 27 C dew point temperatures greater than 12 C and relative humidities higher than 40 The heat index and humidex figures are based on temperature measurements taken in the shade and not the sun so extra care must be taken while in the sun

Sometimes the heat index and the wind chill are denoted collectively by the single terms apparent temperature or relative outdoor temperature

Blue Velvet is a 1986 mystery movie by David Lynch The cast include Dennis Hopper Laura Dern and Kyle MacLachlan This film was originally detested by certain film critics although it is now widely acclaimed It was controversial at the time of its 1986 release and has since become a cult favorite

Manhunter is an American movie It is based on a book by Thomas Harris called Red Dragon The movie was written and directed by Michael Mann It stars Brian Cox William Petersen Dennis Farina and Tom Noonan It tells the story of a serial killer and the detectives who are trying to find him

Manhunter shows the way police can be similar to the people they chase It also shows the science that police use to find criminals This film was not the first film made from a book by Thomas Harris Black Sunday The Silence of the Lambs Hannibal Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising were also made from his books 

Manhunter did not get very good reviews when it came out It did not make a lot of money in cinemas It took 15 million to make Manhunter but the movie only made 86 million in the United States Today the movie gets better reviews and is seen by more people It is thought of as a cult movie

Will Graham is a policeman who worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation He retired after he caught a killer named Hannibal Lecktor Graham is asked by Jack Crawford to help with a new police case Crawford is trying to find a killer named The Tooth Fairy Graham goes to the house of the killers victims He finds The Tooth Fairys fingerprints there

Graham goes to a prison to meet Hannibal Lecktor again Lecktor is very good at understanding how other people think Graham asks him for help It is very clear that Graham is afraid of Lecktor Later on a prison guard finds a letter that belongs to Lecktor The letter is from The Tooth Fairy Graham and Crawford find out that The Tooth Fairy is talking to Lecktor through advertisements in a newspaper Graham asks the writer of the newspaper to help him make a false advertisement to trap The Tooth Fairy The plan does not work The writer of the newspaper is caught by The Tooth Fairy The Tooth Fairy kills the writer 

The Tooth Fairy whose real name is Francis Dollarhyde works with pictures He is attracted to a woman he works with called Reba McClane Reba is blind Dollarhyde drives her home one night They start a relationship with each other This stops Dollarhyde from killing more people One night Dollarhyde sees Reba with another man He thinks she is having an affair but he is mistaken Dollarhyde kills the other man and takes Reba to his house

Graham has found out how The Tooth Fairy finds his victims The Tooth Fairy uses the home movies brought to his job to pick a family to kill Now that he knows this Graham is able to find out who The Tooth Fairy is He goes to Dollarhydes house with several policemen Dollarhyde uses a shotgun to kill some of the policemen Graham kills Dollarhyde and rescues Reba

The movie was going to be named Red Dragon because this was the name of the book The name was changed because it sounded like a karate movie It was also changed because a movie named Year of the Dragon did very badly in cinemas 

William Petersen worked with policemen in Chicago and with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to learn more about his part Michael Mann took three years to write the movie and he also spoke to policemen to learn about their jobs Because of this books have said the movie is very true to real life

Tom Noonan started getting ready for the film by reading about other serial killers He did not like this idea when he started He changed his mind and acted his own way instead He said he wanted The Tooth Fairy to seem like he was doing this out of love Joan Allen played Dollarhydes blind girlfriend She went to the New York Institute for the Blind to learn about blind people She walked with a mask on to learn about being blind 

Actors John Lithgow Mandy Patinkin William Friedkin and Brian Dennehy were all asked to play Hannibal Lecktor Brian Cox played the part instead Cox read about a Scottish serial killer named Peter Manuel to learn about his part William Petersen played Will Graham He was chosen because Michael Mann liked his film To Live and Die in LA Richard Gere Mel Gibson and Paul Newman were also asked to play the part Tom Noonan says he was asked to act his part because Michael Mann thought he was very scary in real life

Dante Spinotti who filmed the movie made use of strong colors Parts of the movie with Will Graham and his wife use a romantic blue Parts that show The Tooth Fairy use an ugly green or purple color 

When the move was being made Tom Noonan asked that nobody saw him Those people who could saw him called him Francis because he pretended to be his character the whole time This made the other actors afraid of him The first time Noonan met William Petersen was when Petersen jumped through a large window while making the last part of the film At first actor Tom Noonan wore a fake tattoo of a dragon on his chest The parts of the movie that showed this were made again without the tattoo This is because Michael Mann and Tom Noonan thought it did not look right

The Great White Spot also known as Great White Oval on Saturn is a name given to storms that are large enough to be seen by telescope from Earth The spots appear to be white and the name was based on Jupiters Great Red Spot The spots can be several thousands of kilometers wide Currently a large band of white clouds called the Northern Electrostatic Disturbance has covered Saturn since 2010 and the Cassini orbiter is tracking the storm Cassini information shows a loss of acetylene in the white clouds an increase of phosphine and an unusual temperature drop in the center of the storm In April 2011 the storm had a second eruption Scientists believe the white spots are made from ammonia ice pushed up by warmer gas through the tops of the planets cloudsrp211 12

The spots happen every 285 Earth years This is the solstice when Saturns northern hemisphere tilts most toward the Sun The following is a list of recorded sightings years with spots that are part of the cycle are 1876 1903 1933 1960 and 1990

Why there were no spots recorded before 1876 is a mystery It is like the break in sightings of the Great Red Spot in the 18th and early 19th centuries The 1876 Great White Spot was very large and could be seen even with small telescopes Was the earlier record simply poor or was the 1876 GWS truly a first for the telescopic era Some believe that neither scenario is likely

Mark Kidger has described three important Great White Spot patterns

Kidger predicts that the next Great White Spot will happen in the NTZ in 2016 and will probably be less spectacular than the 1990 Great White Spotrp180

A classic Great White Spot is a spectacular event Very bright white storms light up Saturns usually dull atmosphere All the major ones have happened in the planets northern hemisphererp178 They usually begin as separate spots but then rapidly get bigger in longitude as the 1933 and 1990 Great White Spots did In 1990 the Great White Spot grew to circle the whole planetrp187 9

Parentheses are the curved punctuation marks used in text They are noted as leftright the left parenthesis is They are also called round brackets curved brackets oval brackets or colloquially parens 

Parentheses have several different meanings such as

There are also other uses for parentheses

Parentheses enclose text which could be left out without destroying or altering the meaning of a sentence In most writing overuse of parentheses is usually a sign of a badly structured text A milder effect may be obtained by using a pair of commas around the text although if the sentence contains commas for other uses then visual confusion may result

Parentheses may be used in formal writing to add more information such as in

This essay WPAvoiding POV funnels advises to avoid limiting topics as being constrained by a point of view funnel which limits the possible range of related viewpoints into an overly narrow range Sometimes there is a need to have more than one page about a topic to avoid a single article from restricting the coverage about notable topics

Within an article page the particular wording of a section header can overly limit the allowable text of the section For example the header Media criticism of aardvark film pre supposes a negative viewpoint that the news media disliked the film whereas the alternative header Media response to aardvark film allows a balance for either negative or positive views in the section and does not limit the text into a POV funnel which would restrict the contents Some words such as criticisms or scandals have loaded meanings and should be avoided in headers or titles

Many topics directly relate to other major topics and a single article page cannot adequately cover all the information in a balanced manner because some topics would have far more detail than others within the same page In some cases details have been suppressed or even removed in an effort to artificially balance all aspects within a single article Instead per WPFORK an article could be split into content forks Although POV forks are discouraged content forks are commonly used to split articles into major notable sub topics

For example a renowned scientist might have made a scientific development perhaps as an invention or scientific theory which has independent notability as a separate topic outside the article about the scientist Any attempts to limit the related text about that development to being only a section of the scientists bio page article would be an example of a POV funnel The scope of details needed to adequately describe or explain the particular development could be considered as being an WPUNDUE level of details if included within the scientists bio page

However when the scientific development is described in a separate article there would be ample space to expand the necessary details plus examples diagrams or charts to fully describe the major aspects A similar example would be a separate article for a concert tour of a notable musician rather than trying to describe the concert tour inside the musicians bio page The extent of concert details would likely be overwhelming to the remainder of the bio page when fully describing the concert themes and set designs plus the typical song play list and list of cities toured More commonly every major album as released by a recording artist is given a separate article and thereby avoids cluttering the text of the musicians bio page article

By having separate articles for albums concert tours scientific inventions then POV funnels can be avoided in other articles such as the bio page articles of musicians scientists etc

In some extreme cases a POV funnel might be used to purposely restrict what text sections or images are allowed within an article The situation can be seen as a trap deliberately intending to restrict the information allowed in Wikipedia 

Often there might be claims that other text are WPUNDUE details beyond the scope of the narrowed article page However per policy WPNOTCENSORED articles cannot omit information even if considered offensive to some peoples religion moral code or an organizations bylaws The goal of Wikipedia is to write the encyclopedia not to thwart it or suppress it

Never the less some arguments to omit information as being WPUNDUE clutter can be very persuasive and hence a POV funnel is typically an effective way to suppress information or justify axing large sections of text from an already overly long article Consequently some violent debates have arisen as to what is allowed in each article or section and there have been storms of edit wars or WPANI sanctions sought to prevent users from adding text Instead users should be reminded that even WPFA featured articles are often quite long and the appropriate way to shorten a long article would be to split into subarticles or move text into previous articles which could be expanded

The term multiple independent sources in journalism criminal justice science and general research are two or more unconnected people organizations or objects which provide a given set of information or samples For example two separate people who see a traffic accident at the spot could be considered independent sources However if one person saw the accident and told the other one about it then they would not be independent since one would depend on the other for their information Also if two witnesses to an event discuss what they saw before they are asked about it and agree to tell the same story then they are also no longer independent As another example two scientific devices could be considered independent sources of measurement data unless they shared the same wiring or electrical power supply

Consulting multiple independent sources is a common technique for detecting errors and deception as any divergences or contradictions between statements or data samples would likely indicate one of these

Famously the New York Times minimal standard for reporting a fact not otherwise attributed to a single speaker is that it be verified by at least two independent sources

Circular reporting is a situation where multiple sources appear to be independent but in reality originate from a single source Because circular reporting can happen inadvertently in many situations extra care must be taken to ensure that multiple sources actually are independent rather than interconnected in an obscure manner

Secret sharing is used as a term to refer to ways of sharing a secret among many people Each person knows part of the secret that is shared but a number of people need to cooperate to rebuild the secret The knowledge of one person alone is not enough to reconstruct the secret Adi Shamir and George Blakley developed the method independently of each other in 1979

One example where secret sharing is used is the RSA crytosystem It uses a secret key If this key is distributed among many people no single person can make a signature Even if the part of one person is revealed or lost a number of them can still make a signature This is often used is areas where security is very important such as banks or the military

The dealer hands each player their part of the secret In an easier setup the parts of the players can be combined to form the secret but with each part there is extra information Say that a secret needs five parts and three parts are known In this setup guessing the two parts that are missing will be easier than guessing the secret awhen no parts are known The other setup is said to be secure from the point of view of information theory because knowing part of the required number of player parts will not change how difficult it is to guess the secret 

There are different methods of secure secret sharing techniques

In this method any t out of the n shares may be used to recover the secret The idea is that a polynomial of degree t 1 is defined by t points on the polynomial It takes two points to define a straight line three to define a quadratic curve four for a cubic and so on It takes t points ot define a polynomial of degree t 1 That way it is possible to build a polynomial the first ocefficient is the secret there are n randomly picked coefficients Each player receives one of the n coefficients If there are at least t players they can rebuild the original curve and get the secret

A Zero knowledge proof or Zero knowledge protocol is a protocol used in cryptography In such a protocol two parties are communicating The task of one party is to convince the other that it knows some secret but without revealing the secret An real world example of such a protocol is the Feige Fiat Shamir Identification Scheme

 There is a well known story presenting some of the ideas of zero knowledge proofs first published by Jean Jacques Quisquater and others in their paper How to Explain Zero Knowledge Protocols to Your Children It is common practice to label the two parties in a zero knowledge proof as Peggy and Victor

In this story Peggy has uncovered the secret word used to open a magic door in a cave The cave is shaped like a circle with the entrance on one side and the magic door blocking the opposite side Victor says hell pay her for the secret but not until hes sure that she really knows it Peggy says shell tell him the secret but not until she receives the money They devise a scheme by which Peggy can prove that she knows the word without telling it to Victor

First Victor waits outside the cave as Peggy goes in They label the left and right paths from the entrance A and B Peggy randomly takes either path A or B Then Victor enters the cave and shouts the name of the path he wants her to use to return either A or B chosen at random Providing she really does know the magic word this is easy she opens the door if necessary and returns along the desired path Note that Victor does not know which path she has gone down

However suppose she did not know the word Then she would only be able to return by the named path if Victor were to give the name of the same path that she had entered by Since Victor would choose A or B at random he would have a 50 chance of guessing correctly If they were to repeat this trick many times say 20 times in a row her chance of successfully anticipating all of Victors requests would become very small 

For this reason if Peggy reliably appears at the exit Victor names he can conclude that she is very likely to know the secret word

The Capacitance Electronic Disc was a type of video disc It was made in 1964 by the company RCA The CED is similar to a record because it stores the video and sound as small groves on a black disk Because of this the CED is an analog disc format instead of a digital format like a CD The CED is stored inside a plastic case so you can not touch the disk as it is very easy to damage On the plastic case is a label that has the name of the Movie on the disc as well as other information such as a summary of the movie

The first CED was made in 1964 but were not available for purchase until 1981 About 200 movies were made available on CED Each movie that was on CED was about 15 to 35 depending on the length of the movie The CED did not sell well this is because you could not record on the disc like you could with a video tape The production of the CED stopped in 1986

CEDs are conductive vinyl platters that are 300 cm in diameter To avoid using the metric system to name their discs they were called 12 inch discs even though they were actually slightly smaller Each side of the disc has grooves that are about 19 miles long and are 37 times smaller than the grooves on a regular phonograpg record When the disc is playing it spins at about 450 times per minute and each rotation of the disc contained several frames of audio and visual information 

To read the disc a titanium needle was placed very lightly on the outer edge of the disc A small electric current was then passed thru the center of the needle where it would touch the bottem of the groove and read the audio information which was stored in small holes The needle would read these by detecting how much air was between the needle and the pit and then the electronics of the player would convert these into audio The visual information was stored in the grooves and were read like a regular phonograph record As the needle passed over the grooves it would vibrate and the player would convert the vibrations into the pictures

A periodic comet is a comet which orbits around the Sun A short period comet will complete its orbit in less than 200 years A long period comet will take more than 200 years to orbit In most cases the comets are named after the person who first discovered them The Shoemaker Levy comets were named after Eugene Shoemaker Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy A few comets are named after the person who calculated the orbits such as 2PEncke and 27PCrommelin It is very difficult to work out the orbit of a long period comet because of the effect of planets or the release of gas or material from the comet itself Short period comets can be predicted with a lot of accuracy

Periodic comets sometimes have the same name for example there are nine Shoemaker Levy comets and twenty four NEAT comets The Minor Planet Center a part of the International Astronomical Union gives comets a different number prefix or uses the full title such as 181PShoemaker Levy and 192Shoemaker Levy which are both Comet Shoemaker Levy Sometimes an informal numbering system is used for periodic comets so 181P is Comet Shoemaker Levy 6 and 192P is Comet Shoemaker Levy 1 Because non periodic Shoemaker Levy comets are included in the number sequences there appear to be gaps in the numbers for example C1991 B1 is between Shoemaker Levy 2 and 3 C1991 T2 is between 5 and 6 C1993 K1 and C1994 E2 after Shoemaker Levy 9

In naming a comet the letter before the is

Some lists keep the C prefix for comets of with orbits longer than about 30 years until their return is confirmed

The tapestry tells the story of the Norman conquest of England The two combatants are the Anglo Saxon English led by Harold Godwinson recently crowned as King of England and the Normans led by William the Conqueror

The tapestry is regarded as one of the greatest examples of Anglo Saxon art because though ordered by a Norman it was made by English artisans It is also extremely important as a historical document

FilePeterboroughChroniclefirstpagejpgthumb228pxrightThe initial page of the Peterborough Chronicle

Translation of this scanned page 

The Anglo Saxon Chronicle is a collection of annals in Old English chronicling the history of the Anglo Saxons The annals were initially created late in the 9th century probably in Wessex during the reign of Alfred the Great Multiple manuscript copies were made and distributed to monasteries across England and were independently updated In one case the chronicle was still being actively updated in 1154

Nine manuscripts survive in whole or in part though not all are of equal historical value and none of them is the original version The oldest seems to have been started towards the end of Alfreds reign while the most recent was written at Peterborough Abbey after a fire at that monastery in 1116 

Almost all of the material in the chronicle is in the form of annals by year the earliest are dated at 60 BC and historical material follows up to the year in which the chronicle was written at which point contemporary records begin These manuscripts collectively are known as the Anglo Saxon Chronicle

The Chronicle is not unbiased there are occasions when comparison with other medieval sources makes it clear that the scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one sided versions of stories there are also places where the different versions contradict each other 

Taken as a whole the Chronicle is the single most important historical source for the period in England between the end of Roman rule in Britain and the decades following the Norman Conquest Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere In addition the manuscripts are important sources for the history of the English language in particular the later Peterborough Chronicle is one of the earliest examples of Middle English in existence

Seven of the nine surviving manuscripts and fragments now reside in the British Library The remaining two are in the Bodleian Library at Oxford and the Parker Library of Corpus Christi College Cambridge

This essay WPBlanking sections violates many policies is an explanation of why article sections should be discussed beforehand with the original author before being removed on a page Beyond blanking of the text the total rewrite of a section is a similar removal of text Think of the notion as similar to going to another employees work area or desk then grabbing items to throw away Even if they dont own those items they are typically answerable for why those items are missing

There are several policies which reject the wholesale blanking of sections from within an article page Hence consider the action of deleting an article section to be a potential severe violation of more than 9 Wikipedia policies or guidelines

Article sections which require special discussion before rewordingdeletion should be more than 20 words in length To avoid any attempts to use a dummy section in claiming protection for a rogue sentence it is necessary to identify a minimum size for a section as being a good faith effort to provide broad coverage in the section This exemption for size is just as a sanity check and a user could still create a larger section to foster rogue ideas but that notion of deliberately creating invalid text as a separate section cannot be determined without a wider discussion with other users

The focus is to discuss the potential deletion or rewriting of an entire section rather than the editing of a few phrases scattered in an article

Rare emergencies There are several policies which support the removal of sections and other content in rare cases The WikipediaEditing policy discusses the various circumstances where content can and sometimes should be removed if it cant be improved Among the other policies which support the removal of content in some circumstances are WikipediaCopyright WikipediaVandalism WikipediaWhat Wikipedia is not and the core policies of WikipediaNeutral point of view WikipediaVerifiability and WikipediaOriginal research The WikipediaLibel and WikipediaBiographies of living persons policies also describe when it is policy to remove certain content

The Atlantic Wall was an extensive system of Coastal fortifications built by Nazi Germany between 1942 and 1944 along the western coast of Europe as a defense against an anticipated Allied invasion of the mainland continent from Great Britain 

On March 23 1942 Fhrer Directive Number 40 called for the official creation of the Atlantic Wall After the St Nazaire Raid on April 13 1942 Adolf Hitler ordered naval and submarine bases to be heavily defended Fortifications remained concentrated around ports until late in 1943 when defences were increased in other areas

Organisation Todt which had designed the Siegfried Line along the Franco German border was the chief engineering group responsible for the design and construction of the walls major fortifications Thousands of forced laborers were impressed to construct these permanent fortifications along the Dutch Belgian and French coasts facing the English Channel

Early in 1944 Field Marshal Erwin Rommel was assigned to improve the Walls defences Rommel believed the existing coastal fortifications were entirely inadequate and he immediately began strengthening them Under his direction a string of reinforced concrete pillboxes were built along the beaches or sometimes slightly inland to house machine guns antitank guns and light artillery Mines and antitank obstacles were planted on the beaches themselves and underwater obstacles and mines were placed in waters just off shore The intent was to destroy the Allied landing craft before they could unload

By the time of the invasion the Germans had laid almost six million mines in northern France More gun emplacements and minefields extended inland along roads leading away from the beaches In likely landing spots for gliders and parachutists the Germans emplaced slanted poles with sharpened tops which the troops called Rommelspargel Low lying river and estuarine areas were permanently flooded as well

Rommel firmly believed that Germany would inevitably be defeated unless the invasion could be stopped at the beach

Although the defensive wall was never completed the Walls existence has served to explain away concerns of the Soviet Union for why the Second Front was not opened until June 6 1944 The Wall primarily consisted of batteries bunkers and minefields which during 19421944 stretched from the French Spanish border to Norway Many bunkers still exist for example near Scheveningen Den Haag Katwijk and in Normandy In Oostende Belgium the public may visit a well preserved part of the defences That section consists of emplacements of the Saltzwedel neu battery and the Sttzpunkt Bensberg consisting of several mens quarters and the necessary facilities These constructions were used by a unit of German military engineers who were in charge of bunker construction 

The Channel Islands were heavily fortified particularly the island of Alderney which is closest to France Hitler had decreed that 10 of the steel and concrete used in the Atlantic Wall go to the Channel Islands because of the propaganda value of controlling British territoryCitation neededdateNovember 2007 Despite the mooting of Operation Constellation et al the Allies bypassed the islands and did not try to liberate them when they invaded Normandy The islands German garrisons did not surrender until 9 May 1945 one day after the German armed forces on the mainland The German garrison on Alderney did not surrender until 16 May 

Walcheren Island was considered to be the strongest concentration of defences the Nazis had ever constructed

The Atlantic Wall was not a single organisation except in the administration of its building Militarily it was divided into eight commands

Many major ports and positions were made part of the Atlantic wall and received heavy fortifications Hitler ordered them all to fight to the end and some of them remained in German hands until the unconditional surrender of Axis Forces on May 8 1945 Several of the port fortresses were resupplied by submarine after being surrounded by Allied forces The defenders of these positions included Slavic soldiers and SS troops

Dave Murray is one of the three guitarists in the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden Murray has been with Iron Maiden since 1980

Murray is considered the second original member of Iron Maiden along with the founder Steve Harris He has played on every album since its debut in 1980 However Murray joined in 1976 just two months after they formed in 1975 He was forced to leave the band that year by the vocalist Dennis Wilcock but returned months later His solos are characterized for being fluid and clean making rapid progress note after note through techniques that use the right hand using especially a lot of Hammer and tapping based on the legato technique A characteristic in live performance is the vocalization which makes while playing fast parts as if singing at the same time than playing his Fender Stratocaster

David Michael Murray was born on December 23 1956 in Edmunton England Daves mother often worked part time at a bar because his father was at a young age retired consequence of a disease The money for the maintenance of the house came irregularly The frustration and poverty took their parents to a continuous fighting which caused her mother to take him together with her sisters to the nearest army refuge where they used to spend weeks protected from the occasional attacks of fury of his father

During his adolescence Dave was interested in music so he developed an cardboard electric guitar to mimic the Beatles records also that he risked playing with the piano of a bar that was located in the bottom of a residential complex in which they lived for some time In 1970 his family finally rented a more comfortable house in the county of Clapton and thats how the future partner of Steve Harris like many other teens in that time shaved his head

The moment that completely changed the life of Dave and took him to a career which seemed impossible in his time and those who followed the style of skinhead occurred at the age of 15 when heard for the first time the song Voodoo Child of Jimi Hendrix on the radio then it started to listen to bands like Thin Lizzy Deep Purple Black Sabbath UFO Queen Free Judas Priest and Wishbone Ash

Daves love for rock understood everything he was referring to the rock culture so he grew his hair too much which caused him problems with his skinhead friends He Adopted hippie clothes and began to read the newspaper Melody Maker which spoke of the rock of that time which also began to frequent shows and come out with a new group of friends being the closest Adrian Smith

In terms of sound he used a super distortion humbucker made by Dimarzio who was replaced for a compact hot rails humbucker of the firm Seymour Duncan both in bridge position

Together with Steve Harris Dave was the only irremovable member of Iron Maiden since its founding He has participated in all records and has been a key piece to define the sound of the group although it has not participated much in the compositions of letters he composed the rhythm guitar to most of the compositions of Steve Harris

Between their compositions are the songs Charlotte the Harlot from the first album Still Life from the album Piece of Mind Deja Vu from the album Somewhere In Time Chains Of Misery and Judas Be My Guide from the album Fear of the Dark Brave New World The Nomad and The Thin Line between Love and Hate from the album Brave New World Rainmaker and Age of Innocence from the album Dance of Death and the Reincarnation of Benjamin Breege from the album A Matter of Life and Death

In politics the use of agriculture or agricultural products to influence the outcome of decisions is called Food Power Several nations with crude oil have organised themselves and founded a cartel called OPEC Through this cartel they can fix the price at which they will sell oil Food power works in much the same way Nations usually do what is best for their citizens who usually want food 

Food power is part of food politics Embargoes can also be used to put pressure on a nation In order for a nation to make use of food power effectively the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity supply concentration demand dispersion and action independence The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the United States Canada Australia and New Zealand The US does appear to use food power for punishment Some African countries have used food power in internal conflicts on a smaller scale

The Arecibo message was a short radio message sent into space to celebrate the remodeling of the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico in 1974 It was aimed at the globular star cluster M13 about 25000 light years from Earth M13 was chosen because it was the right size and was in the sky at the right time and place for the ceremony 

Dr Frank Drake then at Cornell University and creator of the famous Drake equation wrote the message with help from Carl Sagan among others The message was in seven parts which show

It will take 25000 years for the message to reach the stars and at least another 25000 years to get any reply This means the Arecibo message was a show of human technological achievement not a real attempt to talk to extraterrestrial life The stars of M13 that the message was aimed at will no longer be in that location when the message arrives Cornell University said on November 12 1999 the real purpose of the message was not to make contact but to show the power of the new equipment

The message consisted of 1679 binary digits about 210 bytes It was transmitted at a frequency of 2380 MHz and modulated by shifting the frequency by 10 Hz with a power of 1000 kW The ones and zeros were transmitted by frequency shifting at the rate of 10 bits per second The total broadcast was less than three minutes

The cardinality of 1679 was chosen because it is a semiprime It can be arranged as a rectangle of 73 rows by 23 columns The other arrangement 23 rows by 73 columns does not produce a meaningful result The message forms the image shown on the right or its inverse when translated into graphics characters and spaces

In 2009 the band Boxcutter made an album called the Arecibo Message which has a lot of short songs

The Shire is a fictional location is part of the legendarium created by the British author J R R Tolkien and appears in their novels The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings 

It is a region in the northwest of Middle earth one of the continents of the fictional world of Arda where elapses the most part of J R R Tolkiens legendarium It is in turn within the great region of Eriador where previously existed the kingdom of Arnor Is inhabited only by hobbits a race similar to the men and characterized by their short stature Founded in the middle of the Third Age their known history is small and with little significants events because the peaceful nature of its inhabitants with the exception of the events that took place during the War of the Ring

Even if is not mentioned as such in the novel The Hobbit J R R Tolkien already was then an idea of what was the Shire was created officially during the composition of the first chapter of The Lord of the Rings and inspired principally in the neighborhood of Sarehole Birmingham where the author lived during his childhood

Hobbits sometimes call it Sza or Szat terms that have their origin in the Rohirric the language of Rohan with which they came in contact before colonizing the Shire On the other hand in the Elvish language Sindarin they call it i Drann It is also called Four frames the name refers to their territorial division

According to Tolkien the Shire measured 40 leagues from the Far Downs in the west to the Brandywine Bridge in the east and 50 leagues from the northern moors to the marshes in the south This is confirmed in an essay by Tolkien on translating The Lord of the Rings where he describes the Shire as having an area of 18000 square miles

The Shire was densely populated with many towns and few cities but still had large areas of forests and wetlands It is described as a small land but beautiful and fruitful beloved by its inhabitants Their location gives it a natural fertility and therefore the hobbits have an extensive farming system being able to find many supplies such as cereals fruits wood and pipe weed However its economy is almost self sufficient and hobbits typically consume all the products of their crops or reserve them for gifts

The climate in the Shire was primarily temperate maritime or ocean depending on the area In general temperatures are slightly warmer in the south than in the north and seasonal changes of temperature are lightly more pronounced in the extreme east than the extreme west The rainfalls are moderate throughout the whole year and especially in the Northframe Can snow during the occasional visits of polar air from the north

The Shire is populated exclusively by hobbits and in the time of the War of the Ring the whole race except a few who lived in the nearby town of Bree was there The hobbits are characterized by short stature between 60 and 120 centimeters and the abundant hairs grow them on the tops of the feet

Although there were various branches of hobbits all ended by unite when the Albos founded the Shire mixing thus their physical characteristics The residents of marshes descended of the Fortsare the only ones that can differ slightly from the rest hobbits because to them grow fuzz on his chin while the rest have absolutely no beard In Marish had also lived the family Gamoviejo before moving to Buckland and change his last name to Brandybuck

Between the known families are the TookHandbagBolgerGamgeeBrandybuckSackvilleCornetBoffinProudfootBurrowDachshund and Round Each family usually have a land or town in which usually sits and takes his name or any derivative for example Gamgyi come from Town of Gamwich and Took live mostly on the Took Land in Green Hills

A Globular cluster is a collection of stars that orbits a galactic center The force of gravity holds such clusters together and gives them a spherical shape Towards the center such clusters have large star densities there are many stars in a relaticely small space The name of this category of star cluster is derived from the Latin globulusa small sphere A globular cluster is sometimes known more simply as a globular

Globular clusters are found in the halo of a galaxy and in its disk Those in the halo contain many more stars and are much older than the less dense galactic or open clusters in the disk Globular clusters are fairly common there are about 150 to 158 currently known globular clusters in the Milky Way with perhaps 10 to 20 more still undiscovered Large galaxies can have more Andromeda for instance may have as many as 500 Some giant elliptical galaxies particularly those at the centers of galaxy clusters such as M87 have as many as 13000 globular clusters These globular clusters orbit the galaxy out to large radii 40 kiloparsecs or more

Every galaxy of sufficient mass in the Local Group has an associated group of globular clusters and almost every large galaxy surveyed has been found to possess a system of globular clusters The Sagittarius Dwarf and Canis Major Dwarf galaxies appear to be in the process of donating their associated globular clusters to the Milky Way This demonstrates how many of this galaxys globular clusters might have been acquired in the past

Although it appears that globular clusters contain some of the first stars to be produced in the galaxy their origins and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear It does appear clear that globular clusters are significantly different from dwarf elliptical galaxies and were formed as part of the star formation of the parent galaxy rather than as a separate galaxy However recent articles by astronomers suggest that globular clusters and dwarf spheroidals may not be clearly separate and distinct types of objects

Boomerang coasters have sometimes stalled often in the cobra Roll element As a precaution many Boomerang coasters are built with an access platform just under the cobra roll Also sometimes the train gets stuck on the second lift hill

Ecological genetics is the study of genetics and evolution in natural populations 

This contrasts with classical genetics which works mostly on crosses between laboratory strains and DNA sequence analysis which studies genes at the molecular level 

Research in ecological genetics is on traits related to fitness which affect an organisms survival and reproduction Examples might be flowering time drought tolerance polymorphism mimicry avoidance of attacks by predators 

Research usually involve a mixture of field and laboratory studies Samples of natural populations may be taken back to the laboratory for their genetic variation to be analysed Changes in the populations at different times and places will be noted and the pattern of mortality in these populations will be studied Research is often done on insects and other organisms that have short generation times

Although work on natural populations had been done previously it is acknowledged that the field was founded by the English biologist EB Ford in the early 20th century Ford was taught genetics at Oxford University by Julian Huxley and started research on the genetics of natural populations in 1924 Ford also had a long working relationship with RA Fisher By the time Ford had developed his formal definition of genetic polymorphism Fisher had got accustomed to high natural selection values in nature This was one of the main outcomes of research on natural populations Fords magnum opus was Ecological genetics which ran to four editions and was widely influential 

Other notable ecological geneticists would include Theodosius Dobzhansky who worked on chromosome polymorphism in fruit flies As a young researcher in Russia Dobzhansky had been influenced by Sergei Chetverikov who also deserves to be remembered as a founder of genetics in the field though his significance was not appreciated until much later Dobzhansky and colleagues carried out studies on natural populations of Drosophila species in western USA and Mexico over many years

Many were influenced by Ford in the post WWII era Collectively their work on lepidoptera and on human blood groups established the field and threw light on selection in natural populations where its role had been once doubted

Work of this kind needs long term funding as well as grounding in both ecology and genetics These are both difficult requirements Research projects can last longer than a researchers career for instance research into mimicry started 150 years ago and is still going strongly Funding of this type of research is still rather erratic but at least the value of working with natural populations in the field cannot now be doubted

Primula is a genus of 400500 species of low growing herbs in the family Primulaceae They include primrose cowslip and oxlip 

Many species are grown for their ornamental flowers They are native to the temperate Northern Hemisphere south into tropical mountains in Ethiopia Indonesia and New Guinea and in temperate southern South America

Perennial primulas bloom mostly during the spring their flowers can be purple yellow red pink or white Generally they prefer filtered sunlight Many species are adapted to alpine climates

The word primula is the Latin feminine diminutive of primus meaning first applied to flowers that are among the first to open in spring 

Primroses are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species

Some flowering forms of Primula are commonly known as polyanthus as opposite to primrose

The common primrose Primula vulgaris shows heterostyly This is a type of morphism with flower forms which differ in the lengths of the pistil and stamens

The morph phenotype is genetically closely linked to genes responsible for a system of self incompatibility That means the pollen from a flower on one morph cannot fertilize another flower of the same morph

In one morph the stamens are short and the pistils are long in the second morph the stamens are long and the pistils are short The length of the pistil in one morph equals the length of the stamens in the second morph and vice versa

All sections of the genus Primula have heterostyle species altogether 354 species out of 419 Since heterostyly is characteristic of nearly all races or species the system is at least as old as the genus

The Protura or proturans and sometimes nicknamed coneheads are an order of hexapods previously regarded as insects and sometimes treated as a class in their own right There is some evidence that the Protura are basal to all other hexapods although hexapods are increasingly thought to be polyphyletic

The parish church St Bartholomews Church is the town church of Themar in Thuringia It is dedicated to St Bartholomew It belongs to the most richly equipped churches of the upper valley of the Werra It is one of the few buildings of the small town first mentioned in 796 which outlasted all storms of the time The Oberkirche at the upper gate and the Unterkirche at the Werra were the first places of worship in the place Of the Roman Unterkirche there still exist some remainders in the vestry and in both lower floors of the church tower Pope Sixtus IV gave permission for the restoration of the church on 14th of May 1484 with countess Margaretha von Henneberg intermediating 

On 3rd of May 1488 the Chorherr of the Premonstratensian monastery Vera and minister of Themar Antonius Knig founded the building of todays church In 1502 the hall church in late Gothic style was completed

The Protestant Reformation was introduced to Themar on 5th of October 1544 by the count Ernst von Henneberg After the Reformation the church received several smaller carved altars from other churches Since 1541 the church building was frequently converted in the course of the next decades

The barrel vault and the two matroneums were inserted whose support beams were decorated with beautiful Bartmannskpfe Similar sculptures can be found in the churches of Rohr and Herpf near Meiningen 

At the columns the matroneums were decorated with sculptures of saints and apostles partially from older Gothic altar works and with famous verses from the bible 

In the choir area there is the valuable Marienaltar which was created by Hans Nubaum from Bamberg about 1510 

The altar shows in the center Maria with Jesus as a child to her sides archangel Michael killing the dragon with his lance and St Bartholomew the patron of church and town

On the side panels of the altar there are stations from the life of St Mary The announcement to the Virgin Mary the birth of the Lord the three Magi and the Lamentation of St Mary by the apostles At the back of the side panels there are paintings of St Barbara St Dorothy St Margaret St Catherine On the Predella of the altar is to be seen the Holy Kinship

Apart from its artistic value the Marienaltar has also great importance for local history It retained the town church in the Thirty Years War of being burned down After the defeat of Sweden in the battle of Nrdlingen general Johann Ludwig Hektor of Isolani the commander of all Croats plundered the countries of the Thuringian princes

At 16th of October in 1634 Themar was burned down after the plundering by the Croats The town church would have been burned as well but a pious Italian officer gave the order to extinguish the fire when it came near to the Marienaltar

Further carvings and art treasures are The shrine of the apostles that is called Nasenaltar in popular because of the expressive faces of the apostles 

At the back of the side panels there is a painting of the Apostelabschied At the north wall there is the Wallfahrtsaltar one can see the Hhnchenlegende of Santo Domingo de la Calzada at the back of a side panel

At the south wall there are a Piet altar and a Gothic Mondsichelmadonna and in the choir area an epitaph in the Renaissance style Furthermore a fresco painting representing St Catherine that was detected in 1934 then the richly decorated Schalldeckel of the pulpit that dates from 1644 and an Epistelstuhl likewise from the center of the 17th century and some paintings

About 1900 stained glass was donated for the windows in the choir area The pictures show Biblical scenes the prodigal or lost son the Kindersegnung the Good Samaritan 1972 The last renovation of the St Bartholomews Church was in 1972

Originally the organ of the town church was set up in 1851 at the east wall of the church nave by the organ builders Johann Michel and Wilhelm Holland Three organ stops of the pedal division were taken over from the Weise organ built in 1629 In 1866 the organ was moved to the extended second matroneum in the west and renewed and reorganized for the last time in the years 19992000 by the company Rsel and Hercher

From 1668 to 1684 Georg Christoph Bach the oldest uncle of Johann Sebastian Bach worked as Kantor at the town church and as a teacher at the Latin school of Themar In 1684 he was appointed to Schweinfurt and became the ancester of the Schweinfurt branch of the Bach family

The church tower in Renaissance style contains three bells The oldest bell was cast in 1488 another in 1507 The Bartholomus bell that was cast in 1520 had to be delivered in 1942 In 1955 a steel bell was put in instead In the church tower there lived a family of tower guards called Rust up to the fifties of the last century The three rooms of their flat and the winch which helped to wind up food water and coal up to the flat are to be still seen there

Proxy has different meanings when talking about different subjects

A proxy murder is when when a person murders on behalf of someone else Proxy comes from the Latin word procuratio which means to take care of

An example of this would be an assassin killing for money Another example would be a person that convinces someone that loves them to kill another person for them Another example was in prisons where criminals in prison would act as the executioner for people sentenced to death Lady Betty was a famous hangwoman and prisoner in the Roscommon Gaol The Nazis used proxy killings in World War II when they got prisoners to shoot Jewish prisoners instead of doing it themselves The prisoners were told if they did not do it they would be shot as well

A documentary movie was made in 2009 looking at mass killings in the US It is called Murder by Proxy

Banded iron formations are a distinctive type of rock often found in sedimentary rocks 

They consist of repeated thin layers of iron oxides either magnetite or hematite alternating with bands of iron poor shale and chert 

Some of the oldest known rock formations formed over 3700 million years ago include banded iron layers The banded layers are a common feature in sediments for much of the Earths early history

The formations are abundant around the time of the great oxygenation event 2400 mya They become become less common after 1800 mya 

The total amount of oxygen locked up in the banded iron beds is estimated to be perhaps twenty times the volume of oxygen present in the modern atmosphere Banded iron beds are an important commercial source of iron ore such as the Pilbara region of Western Australia and the Animikie Group in Minnesota

The conventional concept is that the banded iron layers were formed in sea water as the result of oxygen released by photosynthetic cyanobacteria This combined with dissolved iron in Earths oceans to form insoluble iron oxides These precipitated out forming a thin layer on the substrate which may have been anoxic mud Each band is similar to a varve the banding is assumed to result from cyclic variations in available oxygen

It is assumed that the Earth started out with vast amounts of iron dissolved in the worlds acidic seas

Eventually as photosynthetic organisms generated oxygen the available iron in the Earths oceans was precipitated out as iron oxides 

At the tipping point where the oceans became permanently oxygenated small variations in oxygen production produced pulses of free oxygen in the surface waters alternating with pulses of iron oxide deposition

Greenstone belts are large metamorphosed regions of volcanic rocks The name comes from the green hue of the metamorphic minerals in the rocks Chlorite actinolite and other green amphiboles are the typical green minerals

The rocks are mafic meaning they are high in magnesium and silica

Greenstone belts are huge zones which occur in ancient Archaean and Proterozoic cratons between granite and gneiss bodies A greenstone belt is typically several dozens to several thousand kilometres long Although composed of a great variety of individual rock units it is considered a stratigraphic grouping in its own right Greenstone belts formed at ancient oceanic spreading centers and in volcanic island arcs 

Greenstone belts are mainly formed of igneous rocks such as basalt with minor sedimentary rocks in between the volcanic formations

A craton is the oldest part of a continental plate It is an old and stable part of the continental lithosphere 

After surviving cycles of merging and rifting of continents cratons are usually found in the interiors of tectonic plates They are composed of ancient crystalline basement rock which may be covered by younger sedimentary rock They have a thick crust and deep roots that extend as much as several hundred kilometers into the Earths mantle

Cratonic lithosphere is much older than oceanic lithosphere up to 4 billion years versus 180 million years

The term craton is used to distinguish the stable portion of the continental crust from regions that are more geologically active and unstable Cratons can be described as shields in which the basement rock crops out at the surface and platforms in which the basement is overlain by sediments and sedimentary rock

Cratons are subdivided geographically into geologic provinces A geologic province is an area with common geologic properties

Petrology is a branch of geology It is concerned with rocks how they form and how they are used It is between mineralogy which is concerned with the minerals in rocks and geology which tries to put rocks into a larger context

Domitian was a usurper to the position of emperor in either 270 or 271AD in Gaul during the reign of Aurelian and is one of the so called Gallic Emperors He was probably killed after reigning only one year

Not much is know about Domitianus However two coins exist that show the Emperor 

He is also mentioned by the Byzantine Historian Zosimus and in the book Historia Augusta as well

Aurelian was an Emperor of Rome between 270 and 275AD

He came from Illyria He suppressed a revolt of Roman mint workers and reformed the coinage to try to avoid the problem of inflation that the Romans had had for a while His notable achievements were his defeat several groups of barbarians  most importantly the Alamanni  but also the Goths Vandals Juthungi Sarmatians and Carpi He recovered Egypt for the empire He also tried to make the Roman god Sol Invictus the main god He was murdered by some of his generals and Tacitus was the next emperor

Domitianus II revolted against Aurelians rule

Marcus Claudius Tacitus was a Roman Emperor between 275 and 276AD He lived between about 200 to 276AD

He was born in Italy and replaced Aurelian as emperor After his death the Roman senate made Tacitus emperor This was the last time the Senate chose an emperor The first thing he did was fight against the mercenaries that Aurelian used to fight enemies in Asia These mercenaries were unhappy because the campaign that they had been hired for hadnt happened They had destroyed several Roman cites in Asia He was about to fight the Franks and Alamanni in France when he died of fever

A war novel is a novel that takes place during some form of fighting In these books the primary action happens during armed combat Other war novels take place on the home front The characters may be busy getting ready for or recovering from war It is sometimes called military fiction

There have been war novels and other stories about war for many thousands of years In Ancient Greece and Rome and the Middle Ages people wrote epic poems about the glory of war Some of the most famous epic poems are The Iliad by Homer The Aeneid by Virgil the Old English saga Beowulf and the legends of King Arthur

Another important influence of war novels are tragedies Euripides Seneca the Younger Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare wrote plays that are important influences on war novels Shakespeares play Henry V has many features of a war novel It has history and military tactics and it talks about the ethics of war 

The genres of romance and satire are also important These works especially in Early Modern Europe show military heroism and folly Some important examples are The Faerie Queen by Edmund Spenser and Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes

The themes and symbols found in modern war novels are also influenced by older works In The Inferno Dante described Hell in a way that is very close to how war is described in war novels Other influences are John Miltons Paradise Lost and the Apocalypse in the Book of Revelation in the Bible

The first war novels were from the 1600s At that time fiction novels written in prose were becoming popular These early war novels were usually satires and picaresque novels The soldier was usually a rogue and not very realistic One example is Simplicissimus by Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen Simplicissimus is a semi autobiographical novel about the Thirty Years War

Influential war novels from this time include Leo Tolstoys War and Peace about the Napoleonic Wars in Russia and Stephen Cranes The Red Badge of Courage about the American Civil War

War novels from this time included the experiences of trench warfare but also began to tell the stories of what happened at home during the war

Many novels came out of soldiers and peoples experiences during World War II These books were not only by European authors but also by people around the world

Just after the war ended Sakaguchi Ango published a book called Idiocy about the strange life in Japan after the bombing and losing the war There were many novels aout the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki including Summer Flowers by Hara Tamiki in 1947 and Black Rain by Ibuse Masuji There were also novels about being part of the kamikaze The 1949 book Last Friends was about a group of soldiers leaving for the front It was a best seller Around 1970 another type of novel began to appear Ordinary people wrote about their experiences of battles and air raids Novels about the many different ways the war ended also began to appear and tell being left behind in China or becoming prisoners of the Soviet Union in Siberia

Many Americans and Vietnamese authors wrote books during or after this long war

The Paleoproterozoic was the first era of the Proterozoic eon It came after the Archean eon and lasted from 2500 to 1600 million years ago

In the Paleoproterozoic there was huge production of stromatolites by cyanobacteria The first unicellular eukaryote organisms also appeared in the fossil record 

The first supercontinent grew and some of the rocks were normal sedimentary rocks not metamorphosed

Because the Earth was only half as old as now there were some basic differences from today Heat in the Earths interior was greater than today This was mainly due to the higher abundance of radioactive isotopes which decay as time passes

Temperatures at the surface were also higher due to radiation from the Earths interior and due to a methane and carbon dioxide based greenhouse atmosphere During the previous eon the Archean the oceans were hot This was only partly balanced by the fact that the Suns radiation was lower at that time 

Paleontological evidence on the Earths rotational history suggests that 18 billion years ago there were about 450 days in a year implying 20 hour days Further back the Earth day had about 17 hours and there were 51433 days per year The EarthMoon distance for the earliest Palaeoproterozoic was 51933 Earth radii

A global supercontinent existed from about 18 to 15 billion years ago in the Paleoproterozoic era

During the era climate changes were as severe as any in Earth history From a global high temperature at the start there were three massive ice ages with ice deep into the tropics

There are clear indications that the era saw a drop in atmospheric methane

Oxygen was produced by the cyanobacteria but it was mostly used up by chemical sinks These were the unoxidized sulfur and iron Until roughly 23 billion years ago oxygen was probably only 1 to 2 of its current levelp323 

Banded iron formations which provide most of the worlds iron ore were formed by the oxygen forming compounds with iron most accumulation ceased after 19 billion years ago Red beds which are colored by hematite indicate an increase in atmospheric oxygen after 2 billion years ago they are not found in older rocksp324

There were three major ice ages with ice deep into the tropics Undoubtedly they happened as a result of reduced greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the rise of oxygen production

There is what researchers call a puzzling interval of 1400 million years with no verified glaciation between early Palaeoproterozoic glaciations at 24002200 mya in North America South Africa Scandinavia and Australia and the Neoproterozoic glaciations that affected all continents at 800600 mya

There were major bolide impacts during the era two of which caused the largest impact crators on Earth There are also three smaller in the time zone of 30 to 12 billion years ago

The origin of the eukaryotic cell was a milestone in the evolution of life since they include all complex cells and almost all multi cellular organisms The timing of this series of events is hard to determine Knoll suggests they developed approximately 1621 billion years ago Some acritarchs are known from at least 1650 million years ago and the possible alga Grypania has been found as far back as 2100 million years ago

The major events of this era are 

Evidence of a eukaryotic red algae Bangiomorpha pubescens has been identified from 1200 mya old rocks in the Hunting Formation This is the oldest known sexually reproducing organism and therefore the earliest known complex multicellular organism

The phenomenon of the Holy Snakes of the Virgin Mary has been occurring for centuries during the festivities to the Theotokos between August 5 and August 15 in the village of Markopoulo on the island of Kefalonia Greece The small black snakes appear at the church of Panagia of Langouvarda on the site of a monastery established as a nunnery and dedicated to Our Lady of Langouvarda 

The myth about these snakes is attached to the year the monastery was attacked by pirates in 1705 The nuns prayed fervently to the Virgin Mary for protection and were subsequently transformed into the snakes to avoid being taken as prisoners

The snakes have a small cross on their head and their tongues are also in the shape of a cross They are known to belong to the Telescopus fallax species also known as the European Cat Snake and they appear in and around the courtyard of the church on the walls and on the bell tower The snakes show no fear while the services are held and are harmless during the festivities As soon as the Liturgy concludes on the 15th of August they become hostile and aggressive and disappear back into the wilderness of the area The snakes cannot be found until the following year

The inhabitants of the villages consider them to be holy collecting them and setting them on the silver icon of the Virgin of the Snakes It has been documented by the locals that during World War II and the year of the islands destructive 1953 earthquake in August the snakes failed to appear The locals now use this as a sign that if the snakes do not show just before the 15th of August that something bad is imminent

Impression management is an idea spoken about in the discipline of sociology It is about the experience in everyday life where people control the way that they appear to others People do this by selecting certain gestures speech patterns feminine or masculine expressions as well as certain expressions of class and cultural interest This so that people can give a particular image to others about who they want to be and how they want to be seen

When gesturing a person might use reserved and minimal movements in a professional setting whilst they may smile widely and wave about when with friends A person might also change their speech pattern in a professional setting in order to sound more educated or refined and may speak more casually or use swear words when in a casual setting 

Males and females also often control how they are perceived in terms of masculinity or femininity Boys and men might sometimes make their voices sound deeper or speak in short sentences to reflect an old stereotype that males are unfeeling and unconcerned with self expression Females on the other hand might feel the need to speak in line with the speech patterns of their peers and this may include tacking on culturally specific phrases like or whatever and thats hotcute to indicate they identify with the female gender and traditional interests These of course are very simple ideas about what it means to be a man or woman In contemporary life the border between male and female is sometimes becoming less strict In Western societies psychologists support that people who show alternative gender expression are still medically normal

People also talk about what kind of music they are interested in what kind of movies they like to watch and what kind of places they like to visit in order to give people an idea of where they stand in relation to class and culture A common distinction in contemporary youth culture is the listening to so called indie alternative or independent music as opposed to pop or popular music Similarly someone might say they like watching highbrow French films or award winning films as opposed to something more mass culture like a Disney movie

Many tabloid newspapers use a photo of a topless or a naked girl to improve their sales Very often this photo is placed on page three of the newspaper that is where the name of this feature is from For this reason the feature is referred to as Page Three or Page 3 The newspaper The Sun who introduced this in 1970 holds a copyright on the name The Sun showed a picture of a topless girl on page three Other newspapers such as the Daily Star and Daily Mirror had pictures of naked women The Mirror changed for models in swimsuits after a few years

Claire Short tried to stop thisShe did not want to penalize the depiction of nude women but she wanted to define a newspaper as a publication that did not show naked or topelss men or women This would have meant that British rainbow press would no longer have been newspapers She reveived 3000 letters supporting the idea The Sun and other papers fought against the bill which was known as Page Three Bill Eventually the Bill failed because it did not get enough support

There are many women who want to appear as a page three girl Most of them are unemployed or come from the working class Buying make up and clothes to be able to run as a contestant is very expensive most of the women can barely afford this alone Very often the whole family will help The best motivation for these women is to be able to start a career as a starlet

Gaius Plinius Secundus better known as Pliny the Elder was a Roman author naturalist and natural philosopher as well as naval and army commander of the early Roman Empire and personal friend of the emperor Vespasian

Spending most of his spare time studying writing or investigating natural and geographic phenomena in the field he wrote an encyclopedic work Naturalis Historia which became a model for all such works written subsequently 

Pliny the Elder died on 25 August 79 AD He was attempting the rescue by ship of a friend and his family from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius The eruption had just destroyed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum

The Naturalis Historia is one of the largest works to have survived from the Roman Empire to the modern day It claims to cover the entire field of ancient knowledge based on the best authorities available to Pliny He claims to be the only Roman ever to have undertaken such a work It includes the fields of botany zoology astronomy geology and mineralogy as well as the exploitation of those resources It remains a standard work for the Roman period and the advances in technology and understanding of natural phenomena at the time 

Some technical advances he discusses are the only sources for those inventions such as hushing in mining technology or the use of water mills for crushing or grinding corn Much of what he wrote about has been confirmed by archaeology It is virtually the only work which describes the work of artists of the time and is a reference work for the history of art

The work became a model for all later encyclopedias in the breadth of subject matter examined the need to reference original authors and a comprehensive index list of the contents The work is dedicated to the emperor Titus son of Plinys close friend the emperor Vespasian in the first year of Titus reign It is the only work by Pliny to have survived and the last that he published lacking a final revision at his sudden and unexpected death in the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius

The Natural History consists of 37 books Pliny devised his own table of contents The table below is a summary based on modern names for topics

The West End is a neighborhood in Washington DC It includes the area between K Street to the south Rock Creek Park to the west and north and New Hampshire Avenue and 21st Street to the east The West End is so named because it was the westernmost part of the original Pierre LEnfant plan for the city of Washington before the annexation of Georgetown It is home to the embassies of Qatar and Spain as well as to the Egyptian Defense Office The George Washington University and The George Washington University Medical Center are on the edge of the West End at Washington Circle

In the past the West End had many vacant lots and old buildings In 1972 the Districts Office of Planning and Management wrote an urban renewal plan to bring life to a declining part of the city Titled New Town for the West End the aerial photograph on the cover of the study showed the area that was planned to become a new intown community Today the Ritz Carlton Hotel and Residences the Park Hyatt and Fairmont hotels numerous luxury condominiums and several of the citys best restaurants are in the West End However the Columbia Hospital for Women closed and became apartments

The neighborhood is close to Georgetown Foggy Bottom Dupont Circle the downtown business district the International Monetary Fund the World Bank the Kennedy Center and the Watergate

Historically West End was a predominantly African American community with brick Victorian rowhouses and warehouses From 1880 until May 2002 the Columbia Hospital for Women provided care for women having babies The hospital was important because other hospitals in the area refused to help African American women having babies The hospital closed and the building became apartments

Many new buildings are coming to West End with hundreds of new luxury condominiums either under construction or in the planning phase

Capitol Hill is also a hill as well as a neighborhood The hill rises in the center of the District of Columbia and extends eastward Pierre LEnfant as he began to develop his plan for the new Federal City in 1791 chose to locate the Congress House on the crest of the hill facing the city a site that LEnfant characterized as a pedestal waiting for a monument 

A large portion of the neighborhood is now designated as the Capitol Hill historic district The name Capitol Hill is often used to refer to both the historic district and to the larger neighborhood around it To the east of Capitol Hill lies the Anacostia River to the north is the H Street corridor to the south are the SoutheastSouthwest Freeway and the Washington Navy Yard and to the west are the National Mall and the citys central business district

LEnfant referred to the hill chosen as the site of the future Congress House as Jenkins Hill or Jenkins Heights However the tract of land had for many years belonged to the Carroll family and was noted in their records of ownership as New Troy Some people have said that a man named Jenkins had once pastured some livestock at the site of the Capitol artist John Trumbull who would paint several murals inside the Capitols rotunda reported in 1791 that the site was covered with a thick wood making it an unlikely place for livestock to graze Noone knows who Jenkins was and how his name became associated with the hill as reported by LEnfant

The neighborhood that is now called Capitol Hill started to develop when the government began work at two locations the Capitol and the Washington Navy Yard It became a distinct community between 1799 and 1810 as the federal government became a major employer The first stage in its early history was that of a boarding house community developed for members of Congress In the early years of the Republic few Congressmen wished to establish permanent residence in the city Instead most preferred to live in boarding houses within walking distance of the Capitol

In 1799 the Washington Navy Yard was established on the banks of the Anacostia River and provided jobs to craftsmen who built and repaired ships Many of the craftsmen who were employed both at the Navy Yard and in the construction of the Capitol chose to live within walking distance to the east of the Capitol and the north of the Navy Yard They became the original residential population of the neighborhood In 1806 President Thomas Jefferson selected the location of the Marine Barracks which had to be within marching distance of both the Capitol and the White House not far from the Washington Navy Yard By 1810 shops goldsmiths blacksmiths and churches were flourishing in the area

The Civil War resulted in more building in the Capitol Hill area including new hospitals Building new houses continued in the 1870s and 1880s The neighborhood began to divide along racial and economic class lines

Electricity piped water and plumbing were introduced in the 1890s and were first available in the downtown areas of the District of Columbia including Capitol Hill There was a real estate development boom between 1890 and 1910 as the Capitol Hill area became one of the first neighborhoods having these modern conveniences

In 1976 the National Park Service added the Capitol Hill Historic District to the National Register of Historic Places It is one of the largest historic districts in the United States The boundaries of the historic district are irregular extending southward from F Street NE as far east as 14th Street as far west as South Capitol Street and with a southern limit marked chiefly by Virginia Avenue but including some territory as far south as M Street SE It includes buildings from the Federal period through 1919 but most of the buildings are late Victorian

Capitol Hill has remained a fairly stable middle class neighborhood throughout its existence It suffered a period of economic decline and rising crime in the mid 20th century but gradually recovered During the so called Crack Epidemic of the 1980s its fringes were often affected More recently the neighborhood has undergone intense gentrification

Capitol Hills landmarks include not only the United States Capitol but also the Senate and House office buildings the Supreme Court building the Library of Congress the Marine Barracks the Washington Navy Yard and Congressional Cemetery

It is however largely a residential neighborhood composed predominantly of rowhouses of different stylistic varieties and periods Side by side exist early 19th century manor houses Federal townhouses small frame dwellings ornate Italianate bracketed houses and the late 19th century press brick rowhouses with their often whimsical decorative elements combining Richardsonian Romanesque Queen Anne and Eastlakian motifs

The main shopping corridor of Capitol Hill is Pennsylvania Avenue It has shops restaurants and bars Eastern Market is an 1873 public market on 7th Street SE where vendors sell fresh meat and produce in indoor stalls and at outdoor farmers stands It is also the site of an outdoor flea market every weekend After a major fire gutted the main market building on April 30 2007 it underwent restoration and reopened on June 26 2009 

Barracks Row so called because of its proximity to the US Marine Barracks is one of the citys oldest commercial corridors It dates to the late 18th century and has recently been revitalized

More recently the Old Naval Hospital has been converted into Hill Center a new community center It is at the corner of 9th and Pennsylvania Avenue SE The rehabilitation of the Old Naval Hospital combines the restoration of a historically significant landmark with the cutting edge technologies of modern green architecture Hill Center is a vibrant new home for cultural educational and civic life on Capitol Hill

Recent estimates in Capitol Hill newspapers suggest as many as a third of all Members of Congress live on Capitol Hill while in Washington

Famous people who were born in the Capitol Hill neighborhood include John Philip Sousa and J Edgar Hoover Frederick Douglasss former house can be found in the 300 block of A Street Northeast Capitol Hill has several local community newspapers such as the Hill Rag The Voice of the Hill closed in May 2010

Alexey Grigoryevich Stakhanov was a miner in the Soviet Union In 1970 he was made a Hero of Socialist Labor In 1936 he became a member of the CPSU He became a celebrity in 1935 as part of a movement that was intended to increase worker productivity and demonstrate the superiority of the socialist economic system

Stakhanov was born in Lugovaya near Oryol In 1927 he began working in a mine called Tsentralnaya Irmino in Kadievka In 1933 Stakhanov became a jackhammer operator In 1935 he took a local course in mining On 31 August 1935 it was reported that he had mined a record 102 tonnes of coal in 5 hours and 45 minutes On 19 September Stakhanov was reported to have set a new record by mining 227 tonnes of coal in a single shift His example was held up in newspapers and posters as a model for others to follow and he even appeared on the cover of Time Magazine

Between 1936 and 1941 Stakhanov was a student of the Industrial Academy in Moscow In 19411942 he was appointed director of mine No 31 in Karaganda Between 1943 and 1957 Stakhanov worked in the Ministry of Coal Industry of the USSR In 19571959 he was deputy director of the Chistyakovantratsit trust and after that assistant chief engineer at the mine management office No 243 of the Torezantratsit trust until his retirement in 1974

Stakhanov was a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of the first convocation He was awarded two Orders of Lenin Order of the Red Banner and numerous medals The last Sunday of August was designated Coal Miners Day also apparently in his honor

The town of Kadievka in eastern Ukraine where he started his work was renamed Stakhanov in his honour in 1978 after his death

Stakhanovs records set an example throughout the country and gave birth to the Stakhanovite movement where workers who exceeded production targets could become Stakhanovites Orwell in Animal Farm presents Boxer as a symbolic character of the StakhanovitesCitation neededdateJanuary 2011

The validity of Stakhanovs record has since been called into question In 1985 The New York Times printed a story that said Stakhanov had indeed succeeded in his feat but that it was only because the Communist Party had pre arranged the event With it the Communist party wanted to boost public morale According to this article many other miners helped Stakhanov beat the mining record The Times quoted the chief of the Tsentralnaya Irmino mines branch of the Party Konstantin G Petrov I suppose Stakhanov need not have been the first It could have been anybody else In the final analysis it was not the individual face worker who determined whether the attempt to break the record would succeed but the new system of coal extraction In 1988 Soviet newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda claimed that the widely propagandized personal achievements of Stakhanov were puffery the paper insisted that Stakhanov had used a number of helpers on support works while the throughput was tallied for him alone Still according to the newspaper Stakhanovs approach had eventually led to the increased productivity by means of a better organization of the work including specialization and task sequencing

It has also been claimed that his record was beaten by Alija Sirotanovi of Yugoslavia and Sergej Scemuk of Ukraine

The Bosporan Kingdom was an ancient empire covering the Crimea and a lot of the north coast of the Black Sea It is regarded as the first real Hellenistic country also speaking Greek

The Bosporan Kingdom was the longest surviving known Roman Client Kingdom It was a Roman Province between 63 to 68 under Roman Emperor Nero In the 1st century and 2nd century AD was a period of a new golden age of the Bosporan Kingdom when it was famous for its jewellery In the end of the 2nd century the King Sauromates II inflicted a critical defeat to the Scythians and included all the territories of the Crimea in the structure of his state

The Bosporan Kingdom became rich from selling wheat fish and slaves to rest of Europe This means that there are a lot of amazing and very rich finds from the Kingdom especially found in burial barrows Today there are lots of architectural and sculptural remains from the Bosporan Kingdoms and many finds can be seen in the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg Russia These include gold work and vases imported from Ancient Athens and the rest of Ancient Greece

It was finally destroyed by the Goths at the end of the 4th century AD

Navy Yard also known as Near Southeast is a neighborhood on the Anacostia River in Southeast Washington DC Navy Yard is bounded by Interstate 395 to the north South Capitol Street to the west and the Anacostia River to the south and east The neighborhood is named after the Washington Navy Yard The Navy Yard fills about half of the neighborhood The neighborhood is located in DCs Ward 6 currently represented by Tommy Wells It is served by the Navy Yard Metro station on the Green Line

Historically the Anacostia River was once a deep water channel with natural resources and home to the Nacotchtank Indians In 1791 Pierre Charles LEnfant designed the plan for Washington DC and recognizing the worth of the Anacostia River set up the citys new commercial center and wharfs there In 1799 the Washington Navy Yard was built in the area and for many decades was the nations largest naval shipbuilding facility Today the Washington Navy Yard has been run by the Navy longer than anywhere else 

The Navy Yard was a busy center in the 19th century and was important in the development of the area The lively wharf was a center for jobs serving ships with lumber and raw materials for the growing city It also played a key role in defending the city from the British during the War of 1812 Surrounding the wharfs was a large commercial district light industrial businesses and one of the citys most notable neighborhoods As the city and nation developed the Navy Yard changed from ship building to making finished ship products and weapons ammunition By the mid 1940s in wartime the Navy Yard and the expanded Annex area were making the most ammo with 26000 employees in 132 buildings on convert127acrekm2 of land

However during the 20th century the river got worse The pollution of the river made it less valuable to the city After World War II the Navy Yard moved everything to a smaller campus slowing commerce in the area For this and other reasons the riverfront neighborhoods became overrun with crime

For many years the neighborhood was an industrial district The area was formerly home to a large commercial and adult entertainment district which has now been displaced Since 1990 the building of a new US Department of Transportation office complex and Nationals Park the new USD600 million stadium of the Washington Nationals Major League Baseball team caused quick changes in the neighborhood Most of the neighborhoods land and businesses have been purchased by companies and is currently being developed into commercial and residential projects The area plans to contain 12 to convert15000000sqftm2 of office space 9000 residential units 1200 hospitality rooms convert800000sqftm2 of retail space four public parks and an Anacostia Riverwalk trail system

The Getty Center in Brentwood Los Angeles California is a campus for cultural institutions founded by oilman J Paul Getty The 13 billion center opened on December 16 1997 People like its architecture gardens and views overlooking Los Angeles The center is at the top of a hill and visitors travel from a visitors parking garage at the bottom of the hill to the top using a three car cable pulled tram The center draws 13 million visitors annually

It is one of two locations of the J Paul Getty Museum This part has pre 20th century European paintings drawings illuminated manuscripts sculpture and decorative arts and 19th and 20th century American and European photographs One of the paintings on display is Irises by Vincent van Gogh Besides the museum the centers buildings house the Getty Research Institute the Getty Conservation Institute the Getty Foundation and the administrative offices of the J Paul Getty Trust which owns and operates the center The center also has outdoor sculptures displayed on terraces and in gardens The center was designed by architect Richard Meier and the campus includes a central garden designed by artist Robert Irwin GRIs separate building contains a research library with over 900000 volumes and two million photographs of art and architecture The centers design included special provisions to address concerns regarding earthquakes and fires

ImageGetty USGSjpguprightthumbleftUSGS satellite image of the Getty Center The circular building to the left is the Getty Research Institute The two buildings at the top are the Getty Trust administrative offices and the rest is the museumThe Getty Museum started in J Paul Gettys house in Pacific Palisades in 1954 He made the house larger by adding a new section In the 1970s Getty built a copy of an Italian villa near his home This new building was a better place to keep his art collection It opened as a museum in 1974 After Getty died in 1976 all of the land and buildings were given to the Getty Trust to be used as museum space However the collection grew too big for the site The people running the museum looked for a new location closer to Los Angeles In 1983 the Trust bought the land where the center is now The new campus has convert24acrehalkon on a convert110acrehaadjon site in the Santa Monica Mountains above Interstate 405 surrounded by convert600acreha kept in a natural state The land cost 25 million The top of the hill is convert900ftm above I 405 So on a clear day it is possible to see not only the Los Angeles skyline but also the San Bernardino Mountains to the east as well as the Pacific Ocean to the west

In 1984 Richard Meier was chosen to be the architect of the center It took a several years to get permits to build the Getty Center The Hathaway Dinwiddie Construction Company built the new buildings starting in August 1989 The construction was significantly delayed with the planned completion date moved from 1988 to 1995 By 1995 however the campus was described as only more than halfway complete

The center finally opened to the public on December 16 1997 Although the total project cost was estimated to be 350 million as of 1990 it was later estimated to be 13 billion After the center opened the villa closed for extensive renovations and reopened on January 28 2006 to focus on the arts and cultures of ancient Greece Rome and Etruria Currently the museum displays collections at both the Getty Center and the site in Pacific Palisades

In 2005 the Los Angeles Times printed a series of articles about how the Getty Trust and its president Dr Barry Munitz were spending money However the California Attorney General investigated of the Getty Trust and found that no laws had been broken The trust agreed to appoint a person from outside the Trust to review how money would be spent in the future The Getty Trust experienced financial difficulties in 2008 and 2009 and cut 205 of 1487 budgeted staff positions to reduce expenses Although the Getty Trust endowment reached 64 billion in 2007 it dropped to 45 billion in 2009

Meier has exploited the two naturally occurring ridges by overlaying two grids along these axes These grids serve to define the space of the campus while dividing the import of the buildings on it Along one axis lie the galleries and along the other axis lie the administrative buildings Meier emphasized the two competing grids by constructing strong view lines through the campus The main north south axis starts with the helipad then includes a narrow walkway between the auditorium and north buildings The axis continues past the elevator kiosk to the tram station The axis goes through the rotunda past the walls and support columns of the exhibitions pavilion and finally the ramp besides the west pavilion and the central garden Its corresponding east west visual axis starts with the edge of the scholars wing of the Getty Research Institute the walkway between the central garden and the GRI and the overlook to the azalea pool in the central garden The east west axis then follows the walkway between the central garden and the west pavilion and finally the north wall of the west pavilion and the courtyard between the south and east pavilions

The main axes of the museum grid that is offset by 225 degrees begins with the arrival plaza carries through the edge of the stairs up to the main entrance aligns with the columns supporting the rotunda as well as the center point of the rotunda aligns with travertine benches in the courtyard between the pavilions includes a narrow walkway between the west and south pavilions a staircase down to the cactus garden and ends in the garden The corresponding cross axis starts with the center point of the circle forming the GRI library garden then passing to the center of the entrance rotunda and aligning with the south wall of the rotunda building Although all of the museum is aligned on these alternative axes portions of the exhibitions pavilion and the east pavilion are aligned on the true north south axis as a reminder that both grids are present in the campus

The primary grid structure is a convert30inmmsingon square most wall and floor elements are convert30inmmsingon squares or some derivative thereof The buildings at the Getty Center are made from concrete and steel with either travertine or aluminium cladding Around convert1200000sqftm2 of travertine was used to build the center

Throughout the campus numerous fountains provide white noise as a background The initial design has remained intact however benches and fences have been installed around the plaza fountains to discourage visitors from wading into the pools Some additional revisions have been made in deference to the Americans with Disabilities Act

The north promontory is anchored by a circular grass area which serves as a landing place for helicopters in case of emergencies and the south promontory is anchored by a succulent plant and cactus garden Access roads also circle the complex and go to loading docks and staff parking garages on both the west and east sides of the buildings The hillside around the complex has been planted with California Live Oak trees

At the bottom of the hill the museum has a seven story deep underground visitor parking garage with over 1200 parking spaces Its roof has an outdoor sculpture garden An automated three car cable pulled tram takes passengers between the parking garage at the bottom of the hill and the museum at the top of the hill

Visitors typically arrive at a tram station in the arrival plaza located between the administrative buildings and the museum entrance A large set of steps leads to the main doors of the rotunda building The rotunda building houses information desks two orientation theatres and museum shops It also holds a grand staircase that starts a path toward the paintings located on the second floor of each art pavilion The rotunda opens to the south to a terrace that links all five of the museum pavilions A separate building to the west of the arrival plaza and stairs holds a cafeteria and restaurant Next to the restaurant is a stone arch which separates the museum from the GRI In between the GRI and the restaurant outdoor stairs go down from the main level to the central garden

The Getty Centers estimated 13 million visitors annually make it one of the most visited museums in the United States The collection of the J Paul Getty Museum on display at the Getty Center includes pre 20th century European paintings drawings illuminated manuscripts sculpture and decorative arts and 19th and 20th century American and European photographs The paintings include

Over its history Georgetown had a large African American population including both slaves and free blacks Slave labor built many buildings in Washington in addition to provide labor on tobacco plantations in Maryland and Virginia Slave trading in Georgetown dates back as early as 1760 when John Beattie established his business on O Street and conducted business at other locations around Wisconsin Avenue Slave trading continued until the mid 19th century when it was banned Other slave markets were in Georgetown including one at McCandless Tavern near M Street and Wisconsin Avenue Congress abolished slavery in Washington and Georgetown on April 16 1862 Many African Americans moved to Georgetown following the Civil War establishing a thriving community

By the late 19th century flour milling and other industries in Georgetown were declining in part because the canals and other waterways continually filled with mud Nathaniel Michler and ST Abert led efforts to dredge the channels and remove rocks around the Georgetown harbor though these were temporary solutions and Congress showed little interest in the issue An 1890 flood and expansion of the railroads brought destitution to the CO Canal and Georgetown became a depressed slum with alleys choked by tiny dwellings lacking plumbing or electricity Shipping trade vanished between the Civil War and World War I As a result many older homes were preserved relatively unchanged Alexander Graham Bells earliest switching office for the Bell System was on a site just below the CO Canal and it remains in use as a phone facility to this day

From a pre Civil War population of 6798 whites 1358 free Negroes and 577 slaves Georgetowns population had grown to 17300 but half these residents were poverty stricken Negroes

In 1915 the Buffalo Bridge opened and connected this part of Georgetown with the rest of the city east of Rock Creek Park Soon thereafter new construction of large apartment buildings began on the edge of Georgetown In the early 1920s John Ihlder led efforts to take advantage of new zoning laws to get restrictions enacted on construction in Georgetown A 1933 study by Horace Peaslee and Allied Architects laid out ideas for how Georgetown could be preserved

Legislators largely ignored concerns about historic preservation of Georgetown until 1950 when Public Law 808 was passed establishing the historic district of Old Georgetown The law required that the United States Commission of Fine Arts be consulted on any alteration demolition or building construction within the historic district

As the only existing town at the time Georgetown was the fashion and cultural center of the newly formed District of Columbia As Washington grew however the center of social Washington moved east across Rock Creek to the new Victorian homes that sprang up around the citys traffic circles and to the Gilded Age mansions along Massachusetts Avenue While many old families stayed on in Georgetown the neighborhoods population became poorer and more racially diverse by the early 20th century Its demographics started to shift again when gentrification began during the 1930s as a number of members of the administration of President Franklin D Roosevelt moved into the area By the 1950s a wave of new post war residents arrived Many of these new residents were well educated from elite backgrounds and they took a keen interest in the neighborhoods historic nature At about the same time the Citizens Association of Georgetown was formed

The area reached the height of fashionability when Georgetown resident John F Kennedy was elected president Kennedy lived in Georgetown in the 1950s as both a Congressman and a Senator Parties hosted by his wife Jackie and many other Georgetown hostesses drew political elites away from downtown clubs and hotels or the upper 16th Street corridor Kennedy went to his presidential inauguration from his townhouse at 3307 N Street in January 1961

There is no Metro station in Georgetown The planners of the Metro never seriously considered locating a station in the neighborhood primarily due to the engineering issues presented by the extremely steep grade from the Potomac River to the center of Georgetown Some Georgetown residents concerned about outsiders entering their wealthy neighborhood wrote letters against a station but no serious plans for a station were ever drafted in the first place Since the Metros opening there have been occasional discussions about adding an additional subway line and tunnel under the Potomac to service the area Three stations are about one mile from the center of Georgetown Rosslyn Foggy Bottom GWU and Dupont Circle Georgetown is served by the 30 series D Series and G2 Metrobuses as well as the DC Circulator

Brentwood is a neighborhood in Northeast Washington DC It is named after the Brentwood Mansion built at Florida Avenue and 6th Street NE in 1817 by Robert Brent the first mayor of Washington City He built it as a wedding present for his daughter Eleanor and Congressman Joseph Pearson Brent gave them both the mansion and a large farm surrounding it Congressman Pearson also purchased additional properties and expanded the estate further The property then known as Brentwood was larger than the present neighborhood known as Brentwood Images of the mansion may be found in the book Capital Losses A Cultural History of Washingtons Destroyed Buildings by James W Goode and in several books in the collection of the Historical Society of Washington DC Edward Sisson a descendant of the family that owned the mansion throughout its existence has posted a collection of paintings drawings photos and histories of the mansion on line The Frick Art Reference Library has drawings paintings and perhaps photographs On the web a small drawing of the mansion together with a brief description of its owners in 1873 Capt Mrs Carlile Pollock Patterson may be found in Washington Outside and Inside by George Alfred Townsend at page 620 searchable as a google book 

Many people think that Benjamin Latrobe designed Brentwood Mansion However at the time of the houses design Latrobe was suffering family troubles and his records for this period are poor

During the administration of President Ulysses S Grant Brentwood Mansion was a center of Washington social life with many parties hosted by Elizabeth Worthington Patterson and her husband Carlile Pollock Patterson Patterson had known Grant since 1852 Pattersons brother in law David Dixon Porter married to Pattersons sister George Ann was the highest ranking Admiral in the US Navy and Pattersons brother Thomas H Patterson was commander of the Washington Navy Yard before becoming the Rear Admiral in command of the Asiatic Squadron Patterson Street NE which is adjacent to the property was probably named for the Patterson family 

CP Patterson a Naval officer and ship captain turned scientist and administrator of a government department had neither the interest nor the aptitude to manage the transformation of a large rural farming and forest property into an urbanized part of the city growing around it After CP Pattersons death in 1881 long delayed financial problems came to a head and on June 6 1884 three years after Pattersons death Congress enacted a private bill House bill No 4689 entitled An act for the relief of Eliza W Patterson CP Pattersons widow excusing accumulated District of Columbia property taxes on the Patterson land President Chester A Arthur neither signed nor vetoed the bill but held it ten days and allowed it to become law without his signature In a message dated June 21 1884 the President explained I do not question the constitutional right of Congress to pass a law relieving the family of an officer in view of the services he had rendered his country from the burdens of taxation but I submit to Congress that this just gift of the nation to the family of such faithful officer should come from the National Treasury rather than from that of this District and I therefore recommend that an appropriation be made to reimburse the District for the amount of taxes which would have been due to it had this act not become a law 

After five more years confusion in March 1889 Pattersons son in law Lt Francis Winslow USN after 19 years of Naval service during the slow promotion post war years resigned from the Navy to devote himself to subdividing renting developing and selling portions of the property He was successful A portion of this property later became the subject of a lawsuit that reached the United States Supreme Court Francis Winslow v Baltimore Ohio RR Co 188 US 646 which includes excerpts of the will by which Mrs Patterson came into the property on the death of her mother Catherine Worthington Pearson in 1868 The suit which the PattersonWinslow family won involved renewal of a lease of some of the land to a railroad

The death of Francis Winslow in 1908 suspected to have been caused by illnesses contracted in the Nicaraguan jungle led to another period of drift in the management of the property as his four sons pursued other careers In 1917 100 years after it was built the vacant Brentwood Mansion burned and the land became the site of a World War I Army staging camp Camp Meigs Three of Francis Winslows sons were officers in World War I and they may have staged in that camp on their own family land In 1919 the partially burnt house was finally demolished Part of the property became the first lumberyard for the building supply and hardware company Hechinger Co a store that was prominent in Washington into the 1990s 

In the 1920s Lt Winslows son Francis Winslow ended his career as a mining engineer and took over active management of the Brentwood PattersonWinslow land His most notable achievement was the development of the Union Market For years called the Florida Avenue Market it still operates after 80 years as the citys principal wholesale food and produce market Photographs and a detailed history of this development may be found in an April 24 2007 District of Columbia planning document the Florida Avenue Market Study at httpwwwanc6aorgFLaveMarketStudypdf 

In the early 1940s the District of Columbia used eminent domain to acquire a large parcel of the Patterson land known as square 710 on which is being built the new headquarters of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Illustrations of the ATF headquarters can be found at httpwwwloopnetcomxNetMainSiteListingProfileProfileSEaspxLID15025032linkcode10850sourcecode1lww2t006a00001 The seizure of square 710 led to a suit by Winslow as trustee asserting that the compensation offered by the District was inadequate Winslow won the suit and a judgment for a larger sum whereupon according to the family the District informed him that it simply didnt have the money to pay the larger judgment Regardless of payment or nonpayment title had vested in the government At about this time Winslow was demoralized by the death of his 17 year old daughter in a 1946 car accident and was then diagnosed with cancer He died in 1948 

His youngest brother Cameron an insurance executive in Hartford CT stepped in as trustee but it is unclear whether either Francis or Cameron ever received payment from the government of the court ordered price of square 710 If not there may be the ironic situation of a government law enforcement agency headquarters located on land for which the government did not comply with the law by paying the lawful price Cameron Winslow determining that no one in the next generation appeared interested in managing the property and unable to manage the properties day to day from Hartford began selling all remaining parts of the property in the 1950s completing the last of the sales in the 1960s breaking up the landed estate that Robert Brent had assembled some 200 years before 

Over the decades much of the land was acquired by or donated to Gallaudet University a prominent school for the deaf Cogswell Hall a residence hall of Gallaudet University is said to be built on the site of the old Brentwood Mansion According to a website on Washington ghost stories httpmembersaolcomwanieholDCplaceshtml students have reported that it is haunted by the spirit of a little girl Allegedly blankets have been yanked off an unplugged alarm clock went off papers have moved with no draft or breeze there are feelings of being watched and at least one student has been tapped awake with no one there 

Brentwood neighborhood as it is today is trapezoidal in its geography It is bounded by New York Avenue to the south Montana Avenue to the east Rhode Island Avenue NE to the north and the tracks of the Washington Metros Red Line and Amtraks Northeast Corridor to the west It is serviced by the Rhode Island Ave Brentwood Metro station Politically Brentwood is in Ward 5

Brentwood has the main post office for Washington DC It was the postal mail sorting facility through which anthrax contaminated mail addressed to two members of the US Senate passed in the 2001 anthrax attacks The Post Office is now named after Joseph Curseen Jr and Thomas Morris Jr who were postal workers who died after exposure to the anthrax in the incident The 633000 square foot facility was closed October 21 2001 because of anthrax contamination and did not reopen until December 21 2003

The area also is the site of a major rapid transit rail maintenance facility of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transportation Authority the principal public transit operator in metropolitan Washington DC It is served by the New York Avenue Metrorail station

IP addresses can be blocked by administrators in the same way as registered users are IP blocks can be more powerful and effective but also have additional ramifications

If you block an IP address in any of the following ranges you are required to immediately notify the Wikimedia Foundation Communications Committee These ranges are allocated to major governmental organizations and blocks of these organizations have political and public relations implications that must be managed by the Foundations press relations team Avoid long blocks of these addresses and be especially careful in formulating your block messages because your block message will be seen and commented on by the press

If the IP address belongs to anything that might be closely related to the above or a major corporation for example Microsoft Sun etc it may be a good idea to notify the committee

Blocking an IP address listed in this section can cause undesired effects on Wikipedia which varies depending on the IP address in question Please issue soft blocks on any bot coming from this address If you are unsure as to how to do this correctly please do not issue the block but contact another admin

Some organizations have an Incident Response Team that has demonstrated willingness and ability to be responsive to reports of abuse at the source In those cases it is preferable to contact their response team through the provided contact information rather than blocking all or part of their IP ranges although it remains appropriate to place short blocks to interrupt ongoing vandalism or disruption

Organizations should be encouraged to be involved in managing disruption caused by their users to avoid the inconvenience to their users When placing a long block on an IP or IP range a politely worded email to the organizations IT suggesting that they participate this way would be a good idea and it is important to be liberal in unblocking ranges of organizations that collaborate

Blocks should be based on the protection of Wikipedia rather than the punishment of offenders Most IP addresses should not be blocked more than a few hours since the malicious user will probably move on by the time the block expires If there is persistent disruption or vandalism from an IP address the block should be extended as long as is necessary to prevent further disruption

However IP addresses should almost never be indefinitely blocked Many IP addresses are dynamically assigned and change frequently from one person to the next and even static IP addresses are periodically re assigned or have different users In cases of long term vandalism from an IP address consider blocks over a period of months or years instead Long term blocks should never be used for isolated incidents regardless of the nature of their policy violation IP addresses used by blatant vandals sockpuppets and people issuing legal threats should never be blocked for long periods unless there is evidence that the IP address has been used by the same user for a long time

Open proxies should generally be reported to the WikiProject on open proxies and blocked for the length of time they are likely to remain open on the same IP address which in most cases is likely to be only a few months Many open proxies have been blocked indefinitely but this is no longer considered good practice A large proportion of indefinitely blocked proxies are no longer open proxies

If you do indefinitely block an IP address place indefblockedip or blocked proxy on its user or user talk page for tracking purposes

Before implementing a long term block on an IP address with a long history of vandalism please check if it is shared by performing a WHOIS and Reverse DNS lookup query on the IP address to determine if it belongs to a school or an ISP If a Shared IP address talk page is not already identified or tagged as such use either the tlSharedIP tlShared IP edu or any one of the templates at CategoryShared IP header templates to do so For anonymous only blocks of Shared IP Addresses please consider using tlanonblock or tlschoolblock as your blocking reason as it causes less offence to innocent users

Administrators can block ranges of IP addresses Use careful judgement and make them as brief as possible they can affect up to sixty five thousand IP addresses each potentially affecting millions of users These should be reserved as an absolute last resort

For more information see mwHelpRange blocks You need some knowledge of how networks and IP address numbering work and of binary arithmetic If you dont many other administrators do ask on the Administrators noticeboard or on ircircfreenodenetwikipedia IRC

If you propose to block a significant range or for a significant time consider asking a user with checkuser access to check for collateral damage  that is for the presence of other users who may be unintentionally affected by the range block Alternately if you are unsure whether or not disruptive edits from a specific range can be matched to a single user you can post a request at sock puppet investigations where an administrator or a checkuser will attempt to match users with IP addresses

Many users operate from shared IP addresses often those belonging to proxies used by large networks or home users with their Internet service providers Since it is impossible to distinguish between individual users operating from shared IP addresses blocking one may affect a very large number of legitimate users Users operating from dynamic IP addresses change IP addresses periodically This can compound the autoblock problem particularly when they are also shared because a block targeted at a malicious user may shift to a legitimate user while the target shifts to an unblocked IP address

See WikipediaWikiProject on XFFs

Open proxies may be blocked on sight according to the policy on open proxies The IP should be unblocked once the proxy has been closed Because the IPs may eventually be reassigned or the proxies closed blocks should not be indefinite but in some particular cases can be very long term Block lengths should typically range from several weeks for dynamic IPs and short term Tor nodes up to several years for long term proxies hosted on static IP addresses

Administrators who block open proxies should attempt to record in the block log or on the user talk page how to verify whether the IP address is still an open proxy at a future date Administrators who deal with unblock requests from blocked open proxies should typically seek advice from either the blocking admin or the WikiProject on open proxies before unblocking

Some behaviour by users for example egregious threats and harassment is so extreme that an indefinite block of the user is warranted There are also some Wikipedia policies for example WikipediaNo legal threats and WikipediaSock puppetry where an indefinite block of the user is suggested These indefinite periods apply to users and not their IP addresses While the user may be considered indefinitely blocked and subsequently blocked on sight the IP addresses they use should only be blocked for as long as they are likely to remain assigned to the same user

Minamisanriku was largely destroyed by the Japanese 2011 tsunami with most buildings swept away by waves of convert16mft or more Over half the towns population is missing and almost certainly dead

95 percent of the town was destroyed by the 2011 Japanese tsunami that followed the 2011 Tohuku earthquake Only the tallest buildings remain and an estimated 9500 people are missing roughly half the population 9700 people are confirmed alive and evacuated

The town had two evacuation centres where residents could go to escape from a tsunami One was on the southern headland overlooking the town The other was inland away from the center of the town Although both were 20 meters above sea level the tsunami covered them and washed people away At least 31 of the towns 80 designated evacuation sites were inundated by the tsunami

One early report suggests that many residents may have evacuated to the nearby city of Tome Miyagi According to an English teacher at the local high school located on a hill above the tsunami The entire town was simply swept away It just no longer exists There were around 7000 of us on the hill that day Perhaps a few thousand at the school on the hill opposite But there are 17000 in the town All the others have gone Since the schools were all on high ground many children were orphaned Survivors wrote SOS in white lettering in the playing field of Shizugawa High school

When the earthquake struck the mayor of the town Jin Sato was talking at the town assembly They were discussing the much smaller tsunami caused by the March 9 foreshock before the March 11 earthquake The three story building of the towns Bsai Taisaku Chsha was covered by the tsunami Out of the 130 people who worked at the town hall Sato was one of only 30 who reached the roof He was one of only 10 who survived He returned to government affairs founding the headquarters for disaster control at the Bayside Arena on March 13 2011

Shizugawa hospital was one of the few major buildings that survived the tsunami However it was partly flooded and 74 out of 109 patients died Close to 200 people were rescued from the roof of the building

Miki Endo a 25 year old employee of the towns Crisis Management Department continued to broadcast warnings and alerts over a community loudspeaker system as the tsunami came in People believe she saved many lives The three storey headquarters of the department remained standing but only the steel frame remained All of the interior and walls were destroyed After the disaster Endo was missing and was later found dead Photos show the roof of the building completely submerged at the height of the tsunami Some people held onto an antenna on the roof

The town is the site of the first field hospital established by an outside nation offering assistance following the disaster A team of five doctors from Israel set up a surgery A 53 member group of medical personnel from the Home Front Command and the IDFs Medical Corps opened a field hospital near Minamisanriku on March 29 The clinic included surgical pediatrics and maternity wards and an intensive care unit pharmacy and laboratory along with 62 tons of medical supplies The clinic began treating patients immediately

Politically Ivy City is in Ward 5

Ivy City is outside of the boundaries of the original Pierre LEnfant plan for the City of Washington within the District of Columbia

In 1831 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad received approval of a plan to build its Washington Branch Passenger train service between Baltimore and Washington began in 1835 As part of the construction the railroad company built its last roundhouse one mile outside the city limitCitation neededdateFebruary 2010 The railroad then worked with land speculators to develop the tract immediately next to the roundhouse as Ivy City Ivy City became an early Washington suburb It housed railroad employees and give a formal mailing address to the roundhouseCitation neededdateFebruary 2010

Ivy City became part of the city of Washington with the passage of the Organic Act of 1878 which extended the city to occupy all of the District of Columbia

Over the years railroads were one of the few industries to consistently give jobs to African Americans Ivy City became an increasingly black section of town In 1911 while Washington DC had separate schools for black and white students the neighborhoods first colored school Alexander Crummell Elementary School opened in Ivy City The school quickly became a symbol of civic pride in the neighborhood and a major community anchor

The economic status of Ivy City went up and down with the economic success of the railroads After World War II US rail travel suffered terrible declines due to the rise of the commercial airline industry and the Interstate Highway System In 1963 BO was bought by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad the two were combined in the Chessie System in 1973 Three years after that the Ivy City yard was acquired by the newly created Amtrak which leased it to commuter rail services

Amtrak gave some stability to the industrial tenor of the neighborhood But Ivy City had suffered a lot from the railroad industrys decades long downturn Even after Amtrak took over the train yard Washington entered a period of poor city management and economic blight This was hard on low income neighborhoods Those who could afford to leave Ivy City did its population decreased by a third in the 1990s

Ivy City remains home to many of the poorest residents of the District It is largely occupied by old warehouses abandoned and decrepit homes and large expanses of parking lots and crime By mid 2005 the citys recent trend toward gentrification had only just begun to reach some parts of Ivy City Only 20 percent of Ivy City residents own their own homes In 2011 Habitat for Humanity built or rennovated 23 houses in Ivy City

The Getty Conservation Institute in Los Angeles California is a program of the J Paul Getty Trust It is headquartered at the Getty Center but also has facilities at the Getty Villa It commenced operation in 1985 The GCI is a private international research institution dedicated to advancing conservation practice through the creation and delivery of knowledge It serves the conservation community through scientific research education and training model field projects and the dissemination of the results of both its own work and the work of others in the field and adheres to the principles that guide the work of the Getty Trust service philanthropy teaching and access GCI works in both art conservation and architectural conservation

GCI conducts scientific research related to art conservation It offers formal education and training programs GCI published a number of scholarly books GCI pays for field projects around the world to preserve cultural heritage

GCI scientists study the decay of objects and buildings and how to prevent or stop such decay One of many projects in this area involved the effect of outdoor and indoor air pollutants on museum collections Another project analyzed the cause of deterioration of the sandstone in the original National Capitol Columns now at the United States National Arboretum

In addition GCI conducts scientific research on materials composition For example a project on the conservation of photographs has as one of its objectives the creation of an Atlas of Analytical Signatures of Photographic Processes which will provide a precise chemical fingerprint of all the 150 or so ways pictures have been developed As a part of that project Getty scientists once examined the worlds first photograph from nature by Nicphore Nipce Using X ray fluorescence spectroscopy reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and other techniques during the 2002 2003 project they found that bitumen of Judea was present in the image

Training of conservation works is an important part of GCIs work For example GCI collaborated with other organizations to create a course to assist museum personnel in safeguarding their collections from the effects of natural and human made emergencies Also GCI developed a course on the Fundamentals of the Conservation of Photographs which is now taught in eastern Europe by the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Bratislava and the Slovak National Library Besides courses and workshops GCI has also been involved with long term education programs such as establishing a Masters degree program in Archaeological and Ethnographic Conservation in collaboration with the University of California Los Angeles

GCI workers travel to other places to protect items important to history GCIs field projects are selected based on how they fit the institutes goals of raising public awareness contributing new broadly applicable information to the field and supporting cultural heritage and must be executed in collaboration with partners who must be serious about their efforts so that projects are assured of continuing after the Gettys involvement ceases Among other completed GCI field projects were efforts to preserve the Mogao Caves and Yungang Grottoes in China to restore prehistoric rock paintings of Sierra de San Francisco in Baja California Sur and to protect ancient buildings and archaeological sites in Iraq following the start of the Iraq war

It has been stated that perhaps the institutes most profound contribution to conservation is the dissemination of information and methods learned in the field GCI spreads information in conferences lectures books and online publications newsletters video and audio

The following are selected books published by GCI

Here is a selection of courses by GCI

Since GCI was established it has had three directors Besides the director the GCI senior staff includes

The Getty Information Institute was dissolved in 1999 as a result of a change of leadership at the Getty Trust GRI absorbed many of its functions

In 2000 Thomas E Crow was hired as GRI director to replace Settis who had resigned in 1999 Crow announced in October 2006 that he would be leaving for New York University Since November 2007 Thomas W Gaehtgens has been GRIs director he was previously a visiting scholar with the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities

In addition to exhibitions GRI has lectures colloquia workshops and screenings of films and videos

The GRI hires people who work at other art museums and colleges to work for a year at GRI After the year is over the people go back to their old jobs The goal is to help spread ideas between people who work for different art museums The residential scholars program seeks to integrate the often isolated territory of art history into the wider sphere of the humanities The first class of scholars arrived in 19851986 they had their salaries paid for and their housing provided but were under absolutely no obligation to produce Among the notable scholars was German writer Christa Wolf in 19931994 who wrote the novel Medea a modern retelling during her year at GRI

Each year the scholars are invited to work on projects related to an annual theme In 20082009 the theme for the Getty Center was Networks and Boundaries and for the Getty Villa The Power and Function of Ancient Images The lengths of stay vary Getty scholars are in residence for three six or nine months visiting scholars for one to three months and predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows for a nine month academic year In 2011 12 the theme is Artistic Practice

GRI publishes Series Imprints books in the categories of Issues and Debates Texts Documents Introduction To and ReSources In addition GRI publishes exhibition catalogs and other materials in hardcopy form

Alienation is the feeling of being left out not belonging or not understanding yourself in relation to your environment Alienation can be talked about in many ways In psychology researchers talk about alienation in terms of how well or unwell people fit in to their social groups This may include how well people relate to their peers in a school or workplace and how connected they feel to those around them 

In sociology alienation can become a more complex and difficult idea In sociology alienation is sometimes spoken about in terms of how people understand themselves in relation to their entire society A good example of this is how people think of themselves when they are working and doing a job A famous sociologist and writer named Karl Marx spoke about how people can feel alienated when working and doing their jobs This kind of alienation happens when people do work that they are not interested in or find boring However in Western capitalist societies some people may have to do jobs that they dont like because they need to make money Therefore this can be thought of as a type of alienation because a persons true feelings and real actions are separated and unrelated On the other hand a person might feel empowered and connected if they do a job that they do like Empowerment and the feeling of being connected might then be thought of as the opposite of alienation

SUNY comprises all institutions of higher education in New York State that are state supported but the City University of New York are not a part of SUNY CUNY receives money from both SUNY and from New York City

The first colleges in New York State were established privately with some arising from local seminaries New York State has a long history of supported higher education prior to the start of the SUNY system in 1948 On May 7 1844 the State legislature voted to establish New York State Normal School in Albany as the first college for teacher education In 1865 New York created Cornell University as its land grant college New York began direct financial support of Cornells statutory colleges in 1894 From 1889 to 1903 Cornell operated the New York State College of Forestry until the Governor vetoed its annual appropriation The school was moved to Syracuse University in 1911 It is now the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry In 1908 the State legislature began the NY State College of Ceramics at Alfred University

In 1946 48 the Governor appointed a Temporary Commission on the Need for a State University It was chaired by Owen D Young then Chairman of the General Electric Company The Commission studied New Yorks existing higher education institutions and recommended consolidating them into a state university system While Thomas E Dewey was Governor the state legislature established The State University of New York in 1948 The new law followed the commissions recommendations The system was greatly expanded during the administration of Governor Nelson A Rockefeller who took a personal interest in the design and construction of new SUNY facilities across the state

On October 8 1953 SUNY took a historic step of banning national fraternities and sororities that discriminated based on race or religion from its 33 campuses Various fraternities challenged this rule in court As a result national organizations felt pressured to open their membership to students of all races and religions

SUNY is governed by a Board of Trustees which consists of sixteen members fifteen of whom are appointed by the Governor with consent of the New York State Senate The sixteenth member is the President of the SUNY Student Assembly The Board of Trustees appoints the Chancellor who serves as SUNY Chief Executive Officer The SUNY Chancellor is Nancy L Zimpher

The state of New York assists in financing the SUNY system which along with CUNY provides lower cost college level education to residents of the state SUNY students also come from out of state and 171 foreign countries Out of state and foreign students pay more tuition than do students from New York State Although tuition is higher for these non resident students their tuition is subsidized by New York State taxpayer dollars 

For the 2010 2011 academic year tuition costs at SUNY schools for an undergrad degree are less than two thirds the cost of most other state run college institutions in the US Tuition at the State University of New York at Buffalo for an undergraduate degree is 777275 per semester or 1554550 per year for non resident students Undergrad tuition for non resident students at the University of Maryland is 2483044 per year Non resident tuition and fees at University of Oregon are 2583000 per year 

There are a large variety of colleges in the SUNY system with some overlap in specialties from site to site SUNY divides its campuses into four distinct categories university centersdoctoral granting institutions university colleges technology colleges and community colleges SUNY also has a unique relationship with its statutory colleges which embeds state funded colleges within other institutions such as Cornell University and Alfred University Students at the statutory colleges have the benefit of state subsidized tuition while receiving all of the campus life amenities of the host institutions

SUNY and the City University of New York are entirely different university systems Also SUNY is not to be confused with the University of the State of New York which is the governmental umbrella organization for most education related institutions and many education related personnel in New York State and which includes as a component the New York State Education Department

In the 1970s students asked for voting representation on the governing boards of SUNY colleges In 1971 the State Legislature added five student voting members to Cornells Board of Trustees In 1975 the legislature added a non voting student seat to the boards of all SUNY units Two Attorney General of the State of New York opinion letters reduced the parliamentary rights of the student members to participate at meetings These documents indicated that the student members were not in fact Public Officers For this reason the Attorney General said the students might be taken to court for their decisions In 1977 another statutory amendment made student members of SUNY councils and boards subject to the NYS Public Officers Law or NYS General Municipal Law and granted student representatives parliamentary powers of moving or seconding motions and of placing items on the agendas of the bodies Finally the legislature gave full voting rights to the student members in 1979 resulting in the students of all SUNY units having voting representatives except for the NYS College of Environmental Science and Forestry Finally in 1986 the legislature gave the student representative of that college voting rights as well

All of these colleges are located in New York State except that the Jamestown Community College operates its Warren Center in Pennsylvania under a contract with the Warren Forest Higher Education Council and the Center is licensed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education The Warren Center is 25 miles south of Jamestown New York on the grounds of the North Warren Pennsylvania state mental hospital ICCD is a part of the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations

The 2010 Asian Games was a many sport event held in Guangzhou China from November 12 to November 27 2010 This was the second time that any Chinese city had hosted the Games after Beijing in 1990 A total of 9704 athletes from 45 National Olympic Committees competed in 476 events from 42 sports and disciplines making it the biggest event in the history of Asian Games

Circuit de Nevers Magny Cours is a motor racing circuit in France near the towns of Magny Cours and Nevers It is often called just Magny Cours It is most well known for hosting the Formula One French Grand Prix which was held there between 1991 and 2008

The circuit was built in 1960 by Jean Bernigaud It was the home to the Lcole de pilotage Winfield racing school The school provided such drivers as Franois Cevert and Jacques Laffite In the 1980s the track condition was not very good It needed a lot of repairs The circuit was not used for international racing until it was purchased by the Regional Conseil de la Nivre

In the 1990s the Ligier Formula One team was based at the circuit They did a lot of their testing at Magny Cours It started hosting the F1 French Grand Prix in 1991 and the Bol dOr motorcycle race in 2000 The circuit was re designed in 2003 and used for a wide range of events include various sports and commercial use

The circuit does not provide many overtaking opportunities The races here are commonly regarded as quite uneventful

For the 2003 event the final corner and chicane were changed in an effort to increase overtaking It did not help much The change did make the pitlane much shorter Because less time was lost making a pit stop Michael Schumacher was able to win the 2004 French Grand Prix using a four stop strategy

In 2006 the circuit was the scene of more Formula One history Michael Schumacher became the first driver to win a single Grand Prix 8 times at the same circuit

The 2007 race was to mark the last French Grand Prix at Magny Cours The French Grand Prix had been indefinitely suspended from the Formula One calendar Bernie Ecclestone originally said that F1 would not return to Magny Cours in 2008 He wanted to move to another location possibly in Paris 

When the official calendar on July 2007 the 2008 French Grand Prix was still in place at Magny Cours

In May 2008 Ecclestone confirmed that Magny Cours would stop hosting the French Grand Prix after the 2008 race He suggested he was looking into hosting the French Grand Prix on the streets of Paris

In June 2008 the provisional calendar for the 2009 season was released The French Grand Prix at Magny Cours appeared on it scheduled for 28 June However in October 2008 the 2009 French Grand Prix was canceled after the French Motorsports Federation withdrew financing for the event

In 2009 the track hosted its first Superleague Formula event It has also been confirmed it will host a second event in 2010

The current track is a modern smooth circuit It has good facilities for the teams and spectators It is convert250kmabbron from Paris in central France Many corners are modeled on famous turns from other circuits and are named after those circuits Examples include the fast Estoril corner and the Adelaide hairpin It has a mix of slow hairpins and high speed chicane sections It includes a long fast straight into the first gear Adelaide hairpin the best overtaking opportunity on the circuit The circuit is very flat with little change in elevation It does not provide many overtaking opportunities despite modifications in 2003 

A telomere is a region of DNA at the end of a chromosome It protects the end of the chromosome from deteriorating or fusing with other chromosomes

The telomeres are made of repeated sequences of DNA During cell division enzymes that duplicate DNA cannot continue their work all the way to the end of chromosomes If cells divided without telomeres they would lose the ends of their chromosomes and the information they contain 

The telomeres are disposable buffers blocking the ends of the chromosomes They are destroyed during cell division and are remade by an enzyme telomerase reverse transcriptase

The Australian Elizabeth Blackburn and the Americans Carol W Greider and Jack W Szostak won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on telomeres

Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Swami Rambhadracharya is a Hindu religious leader He is also an educator composer skilled public speaker and philosopher He was born on 14 January 1950 His birth name was Giridhar Mishra He can speak 22 languages He lives in Chitrakuta Uttar Pradesh India

In 1988 he became one of the four Jagadguru Ramanandacharyas the leaders of the Ramananda order He is the founder of Tulsi Peeth which is a religious and social service organization It is in Chitrakuta It is named after the saint Tulsidas He is the founder and lifelong chancellor of the Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University It is a university situated in Chitrakuta and it gives graduate and postgraduate courses entirely to the four types of disabled students having a poor physical or mental ability Jagadguru Rambhadracharya became blind at the age of two months He has never used Braille or any other help to learn or compose He can speak 22 languages and heis a self produced poet He is a composer in Sanskrit Hindi Avadhi Maithili and many other languages He has written more than 80 books which include four story telling poems a Hindi series of comments on the Ramcharitmanas a Sanskrit series of comments on the Ashtadhyayi and a Sanskrit series of comments on the Prasthanatrayi religious books He is seen as one of the greatest sources of information on Tulsidas in India and he is the editor of a critical edition of the Ramcharitmanas He is a famous Katha artist for the Ramayana and the Bhagavata His Katha programmes are held regularly in different cities in India and in other countries They are shown on many television channels like Sanskar TV and Sanatan TV

Jagadguru Rambhadracharya was born in Shandikhurd village of Jaunpur district in the state of Uttar Pradesh India His family was a Saryupareen Brahmin family of Vasishtha Gotra His birth time was 1034 pm and he was born on the Makar Sankranti day of Saturday January 14 1950 His mother was Shachidevi and his father was Pandit Rajdev Mishra His name Giridhara was named by his fathers aunt a cousin of his grandfather Pandit Suryabali Mishra His fathers aunt was an admirer of Mirabai a female saint of the Bhakti age in middle India who used the name Giridhara for Krishna in her compositions

Giridhara became blind in March 1950 when he was aged two months When he got a eye disease named Trachoma there was no medical care in his village He was taken to a local woman who was known to cure Trachoma She dropped a hot medicine into his eyes to break the Trachoma lumps but his eyes started bleeding and he became blind His family took him to many Ayurvedic Homeopathic Allopathic and medical doctors in Sitapur Lucknow and Mumbai but there was no help He cannot read or write as he does not use the Braille system but learns by listening and composes by dictating to secretaries

As Giridharas father used to work in Bombay his early learning was at home from his grandfather During afternoons his grandfather used to tell him various parts of the Ramayana the Mahabharata and other books like Vishramsagar Sukhsagar Premsagar and Brajvilas etc When he was of 3 years Giridhara made his first poem in Hindi which was the following pada He spoke it to his grandfather In this poem Yashoda is fighting with a Gopi for causing pain to Krishna

Having a great memory Giridhar learnt all 700 verses of Bhagavad Gita at in 15 days when he was 5 years old His neighbour Pandit Murlidhar Mishra helped him On the Janmashtami day in 1955 he read out the whole Bhagavad Gita By accident 52 years after the day he learnt the Gita he released the first ever Braille form of Gita at New Delhi on November 30 2007 with the real Sanskrit text and a Hindi series of comments When Giridhara was seven years old he learned the whole Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas in 60 days His grandfather helped him On Ram Navmi day of 1957 he spoke the whole book while not eating food because of religious reasons After that Giridhara went on to learn the Vedas Upanishads books on Sanskrit grammar the Bhagavata Puran all books of Tulasidas and many other books

His Upanayana was done on the Nirjala Ekadashi day of June 24 1961 On this day he got the Gayatri Mantra and he was given Diksha into the Mantra of Rma by Pandit Ishvardas Maharaj of Ayodhya After learning Gita and Ramcharitmanas to high level of skills at a very young age Giridhara started visiting the Katha programmes held one time in 3 years near his village When he went to the third event he showed a Katha on Ramcharitmanas which was highly respected by many famous representers of the Katha art

On 7 July 1967 Giridhara Mira joined the Adarsh Gaurishankar Sanskrit College in Jaunpur to study Sanskrit Grammar as well Hindi English Maths History and Geography As he has the ability to memorize everything by just listening it one time he never used Braille or other help to learn In three months he had learned the whole Laghusiddhntakaumud of Varadarja to a high level He was the best student and got most marks in tests in his class for four years passing the primary to secondary tests in Sanskrit with best grades and a thing which makes him better than others

When Girihara was in Adarsh Gaurishankar Sanskrit College he learnt the eight Gaas while learning Chandaprabh a book on Sanskrit poetic metre On the next day he made his first Sanskrit poetic form in the Bhujagaprayta metre

In 1971 Giridhara Mira entered at the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in Varanasi for higher learning of Vykaraa He got most marks in the final test for the str in 1974 He then registered for a Masters degree at the same university While trying to get the masters degree he went New Delhi to take part in many national contests at the Akhila Bhratya Sanskrit Adhiveana There he won five gold medals in Vykaraa Skhya Nyya Vednta and Sanskrit Antykar out of eight Then the Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi gave the five gold medals with the Calavaijayant prize for Uttar Pradesh to Giridhara Surprised by his abilities Indira Gandhi gave him the offer to send him to the United States of America for medical care of his eyes but Giridhara Mira did not accepted this offer In 1976 he got most marks in the final crya tests in Vykaraa he also won seven gold awards and the Chancellors gold award In a uncommon achievement though he had registered for a masters degree in Vykaraa only he was made crya of all subjects which were taught at the university for his all round qualities on April 30 1976

Giridhara began studying for a PhD also at Sampurnanand Sanskrit University Pandit Ramprasad Tripathi supervised his studies Giridhara got a scholarship from the University Grants Commission by passing an examination However he had money problem for several years He completed his PhD in Sanskrit grammar on October 14 1981 He wrote about the language of the poet Pin in the Ramayana UGC then offered him a job as head of the Vykaraa department of the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University However Giridhara Mira did not take the job He decided to give his life to the service of his religion the world and the disabled

In 1997 he was awarded the post doctorate Vcaspati degree by Sampurnanand Sanskrit University for his lecture called Search into spoken knowledge of every Stra of the Adhyy in English He described each phrase of the sutra carefully He told about Pins grammar and use of Sanskrit poetic forms

In 1976 Giridhara Mira said aloud a Kath on Rmcaritamnasa to Svm Karaptr Svm Karaptr advised him not to marry to live a lifelong Brahmacrin and to take start in a Vaiava Sampradya Giridhara Mira took Vairagi start in the Rmnanda Sampradya on the Krtika full moon day of November 19 1983 from r r 1008 r Rmacaraadsa Mahrja Phlhr He now came to be known as Rmabhadradsa

Rambhadradas had a six month Payovrata which is a diet only of milk and fruits at Chitrakoot in 1979 per the following fifth verse of the Dohavali made by Tulsidas

In 1987 Rambhadradas established a religious and social service institution in Chitrakoot where as per the Ramayana Rama had spent twelve out of his fourteen years of exile Its name is Tulsi Peeth As he is the founder of the institution Sadhus gave him the title of rcitrakatulasphdhvara In the Tulsi Peeth there a temple of Rama and Sita and its name is Kanch Mandir

Rambhadradas was made Jagadguru Ramanandacharya seated at the Tulsi Peeth by the Kashi Vidwat Parishad in Varanasi on 24 June 1988 and this order was supported by the Mahants of three Akharas the four sub Sampradayas the Khalsas and saints of the Ramananda Sampradaya on 3 February 1989 at the Kumbh Mela in Allahabad On 1 August 1995 he was anointed as the Jagadguru Ramanandacharya in a ritual manner in Ayodhya by the Digambar Akhara After that he is known as Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Swami Rambhadracharya

Swami Rambhadracharya started the Tulsi School for the Blind in Chitrakoot on 23 August 1996 He also started the Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University in Chitrakoot on 27 September 2001 This is the first university in the world entirely for disabled students It was created by a local law of the Uttar Pradesh Government which was afterwards accepted as the Uttar Pradesh State Act 32 by the Uttar Pradesh legislature This act assigned Jagadguru Rambhadracharya as the chancellor of this university for his entire life The university offers graduate post graduate and doctorate degrees in many arts and sciences The university is planning to give courses in Ayurveda and Medical Sciences from 2013 The permission to enter into the university is limited to only four types of disabled students those who are blind or have difficulty in hearing having difficulty in walking or having some mental illness as defined in the Disability Act of the Government of India According to the Government of Uttar Pradesh the university is one of the main education institutes for Information Technology and Electronics in the state Various degrees were given to 354 disabled students in the second graduation ceremony of the university which was held in March 2010 In the third graduation ceremony which was held in January 2011 388 disabled students were given degrees

Rambhadracharya also founded an organisation Its name is Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Viklang Seva Sangh Its based in Satna Madhya Pradesh Its mission is to make community awareness and to start child development programs in Indian villages Its main aim is to support the education programs of Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University It helps disabled children get a good education by making access to education easier Rambhadracharya also runs a hundred bed hospital in Gujarat

Tulsidas wrote the epic poem Ramcharitmanas in the late sixteenth century It has been very popular in northern India ever since Some Western scholars have called it the Bible of northern India Many different poets have created their own versions of the poem

In chemistry a molecular orbital explains what happens to electrons when atoms join together in a molecule A MO is a mathematical function which describes the wave like behaviour of an electron in a molecule Chemists use such functions to predict or explain chemical and physical properties For example the functions can tell the probability of finding an electron in any specific region

Chemists usually build mathematical models of molecular orbitals by combining atomic orbitals Hybrid orbitals from each atom of the molecule or other molecular orbitals from groups of atoms can also be used Computers can work on these functions using the Hartree Fock or Self Consistent Field methods Molecular orbitals allow chemists apply quantum mechanics to study molecules MOs answer questions about how the atoms in molecules stick together 

The word orbital was first used in English by Robert S Mulliken The German chemist Erwin Schrdinger wrote about MOs earlier Schrdinger called them Eigenfunktion This name is good because chemists think that orbitals are the region made with the function

Physicist Max Born described the theory behind using orbitals in 1926 It is known as Borns rule today It is part of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics This theory did not agree with atom model of Niels Bohr Bohr said that the electrons move around the atom kernel in circles But the Bohr model had problems It did not say where the electrons were in molecules Also it did not explain a number of chemical reactions

Molecular orbitals are areas in a molecule where an electron is likely to be found Molecular orbitals are created when atomic orbitals are brought together Atomic orbitals predict the location of an electron in an atom A molecular orbital can give information about the electron configuration of a molecule This is the areal distribution and energy of one electron Mostly a MO is represented as a linear combination of atomic orbitals especially in qualitative or very approximate usage This means that chemists assume that the chance of an electron being at any point in the molecule is the sum of the probabilities of the electron being there based on the individual atomic orbitals LCAO MO is a simple model of bonding in molecules LCAO MO is important for studying molecular orbital theory 

Theoretical chemists use computers to calculate the MOs of different molecules The computers can draw graphs that show the cloud that says how likely the electron will be found in any region The computers can also give information about the physical properties of the molecule They can also say how much energy is required to form the molecule For example this information helps chemists to say whether some small molecules can be combined to make bigger molecules

Most present day ways of doing computational chemistry begin by calculating the MOs of a system An electric field builds each MO Each MOs electric field is generated by the nuclei of all the atoms and some average distribution of the other electrons When two electrons are in the same orbital the Pauli exclusion principle says each electron has the opposite spin of the other This is an approximation and highly accurate descriptions of the molecular electronic wave function do not have orbitals

Understanding MOs is like the task of knowing where each employee is in a large home improvement store An analyst knows the number of employees working at the store and each employees department He also knows that employees do not step on each other toes and employees stand in the aisle rather than on the merchandise shelves Employees leave their own department to help customers locate merchandise in other departments or to check inventory An analyst giving the location of all employees in the store at a selected moment without looking inside is like a chemist calculating the MOs of a molecule Just as MOs cannot tell the exact location of each electron the exact location of each employee is not known An MO having a nodal plane is like the conclusion that employees walk down aisles and not through shelves Although electrons are contributed from a specific atom the electron fills an MO without regard to its source atom This is like an employee leaving his department to walk elsewhere in the store during the day So an MO is an incomplete description of an electron just as the analysts calculations about the unseen store is an incomplete guess about employee locations

Theoretical chemists have invented rules for calculating MOs These rules come from an understanding of quantum mechanics Quantum mechanics helps chemists to use what physics said about electrons to work out how the electrons behave in molecules Molecular orbitals form from allowed interactions between atomic orbitals Chemists study atomic orbital interactions These interactions come from the overlap between two atomic orbitals The overlap is important if the atomic orbitals are close in energy Finally the number of MOs in a molecule must equal the number of atomic orbitals in the atoms being brought together to form the molecule

Chemists need to understand the geometry of MOs in order to discuss molecular structure The Linear combination of atomic orbitals molecular orbital method ansatz gives a rough but good description of the MOs In this method the molecular orbitals are expressed as linear combinations of all of the atomic orbitals of each atom in the molecule 

Molecular orbitals were first introduced by Friedrich Hund and Robert S Mulliken in 1927 and 1928 The linear combination of atomic orbitals or LCAO approximation for molecular orbitals was introduced in 1929 by Sir John Lennard Jones His ground breaking paper showed how to derive the electronic structure of the fluorine and oxygen molecules from quantum principles This qualitative approach to molecular orbital theory is part of the start of modern quantum chemistry Linear combinations of atomic orbitals can be used to guess the molecular orbitals that are made when the molecules atoms bond together Similar to an atomic orbital a Schrodinger equation which describes the behavior of an electron can be constructed for a molecular orbital as well Linear combinations of atomic orbitals provide approximate solutions to the molecular Schrodinger equations For simple diatomic molecules the wavefunctions that you get are represented mathematically by the equations

where and are the molecular wavefunctions for the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals respectively a and b are the atomic wavefunctions from atoms a and b respectively and ca and cb are adjustable coefficients These coefficients can be positive or negative depending on the energies and symmetries of the individual atomic orbitals As the two atoms become closer together their atomic orbitals overlap to produce areas of high electron density So molecular orbitals are formed between the two atoms The atoms are held together by the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nuclei and the negatively charged electrons occupying bonding molecular orbitals

When atomic orbitals interact the resulting molecular orbital can be of three types bonding antibonding or nonbonding

Antibonding MOs 

Nonbonding MOs 

Each molecular orbital has its own energy level Chemists sort the MOs by energy levels Chemists assume that the electrons will fill the lowest energy level MOs first For example if a molecule has electrons to fill 15 orbitals the 15 MOs with the lowest energy levels will be filled The 15th MO on the list would be called the highest occupied molecular orbital and the 16th MO on the list would be the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital The difference in the HOMOs energy level and the LUMOs energy level is called the band gap The band gap can sometimes serve as a measure of the excitability of the molecule the smaller the energy the more easily it will be excited When the electron is excited it will jump to an unoccupied MO For example this can help guess whether something will give out light

The WoodwardHoffmann rules are a set of organic chemistry rules to predict the stereochemistry of pericyclic reactions The rules are based on molecular orbital symmetry The rules cover electrocyclic reactions cycloadditions sigmatropic reactions and group transfer reactions They were written by Robert Burns Woodward and Roald Hoffmann Hoffmann was awarded the 1981 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work shared with Kenichi Fukui who developed a similar model Woodward did not share the prize because he died two years before Generally the Nobel Prize is awarded only to living people Woodward had already won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for a different discovery

Note that a recent paper in the journal Nature describes how mechanical stress can be used to reshape chemical reaction pathways to lead to products that apparently violate WoodwardHoffman rules

Stereochemistry is the study of how molecules are affected by the way their atoms are arranged in space It is also known as 3D chemistry as the word stereo means three dimensional Using stereochemistry chemists can work out the relationships between different molecules that are made up from the same atoms They can also study the effect on the physical or biological properties these relationships give molecules When these relationships influence the reactivity of the molecules it is called dynamic stereochemistry 

In chemistry some molecules have more than one isomer This means that molecules can have different forms even though all the forms made up of the same atoms There are two kinds of isonomers Constitutional isonomers have the same atoms but they are joined differently Stereoisomers have the same atoms they are joined the same way but the atoms are arranged differently in space An important part of stereochemistry is the study of chiral molecules These molecules look almost identical except that one molecule is the mirror image of the other

In most chemical bonds the atoms of a molecule free to move around without breaking the bonds When a molecule has a double bond or a ring structure the molecule can be sorted into different isomers These are molecules with the same chemical structure but different forms

The study of stereochemical problems covers the entire range of organic inorganic biological physical and supramolecular chemistries

Louis Pasteur was the first person to study stereochemistry He observed in 1849 that salts of tartaric acid collected from wine making equipment could rotate plane polarized light but that salts from other sources did not This property was the only difference between the two types of salt It is due to optical isomerism In 1874 Jacobus Henricus van t Hoff and Joseph Le Bel discovered the difference was caused by the way that the atoms bonded to carbon in a tetrahedral shape

Stereochemistry was important in solving the thalidomide disaster in the 1960s Thalidomide is a drug that was first produced in 1957 in Germany Doctors used it to treat morning sickness in pregnant women Later the drug was shown to cause deformations in babies One isomer of the drug was not dangerous but the other caused serious genetic damage to the embryos In the human body thalidomide undergoes racemization even if only one of the two stereoisomers enters a human body the body changes some of it to other one The thalidomide disaster caused governments to test drugs more carefully Selected people take new drugs in an experiment first before the drug is made available for public use Thalidomide is now used as a therapy for leprosy Women must use it with contraceptives to prevent pregnancy

When an atom can have other atoms connect to it in more than one way it is called a stereocenter For example if a carbon atom has four different groups attached to it it becomes a stereocenter

Cahn Ingold Prelog priority rules are part of a system for describing a molecules stereochemistry They rank the atoms around a stereocenter in a standard way This allows the relative position of these atoms in the molecule to be described very clearly A Fischer projection is a simplified way to show the stereochemistry around a stereocenter

Types of stereoisomerism are

Cornel Ronald West is an American philosopher author critic actor and civil rights activist He is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America West is the Class of 1943 University Professor at Princeton University He teaches in the Center for African American Studies and in the Department of Religion West is known for his combination of political and moral insight and criticism and his contribution to the post 1960s civil rights movement Much of Wests work focuses on the role of race gender and class in American society and the means by which people act and react to their radical conditionedness West draws intellectual contributions from such diverse traditions as the African American Baptist Church pragmatism and transcendentalism

West was born in Tulsa Oklahoma and grew up in Sacramento California where his father was a general contractor for the Defense Department and his mother was a teacher and a principal Irene B West Elementary School Elk Grove California is named for her While West was a student he marched in civil rights demonstrations As the class president in his high school West organized protests demanding black studies courses He later wrote that in his youth he admired the sincere black militancy of Malcolm X the defiant rage of the Black Panther Party and the livid black theology of James Cone In 1970 West graduated from John F Kennedy High School He enrolled at Harvard University and took classes from philosophers Robert Nozick and Stanley Cavell In 1973 he graduated magna cum laude in Near Eastern Languages and Civilization Owing to my family church and the black social movements of the 1960s he says I arrived at Harvard unashamed of my African Christian and militant de colonized outlooks More pointedly I acknowledged and accented the empowerment of my black styles mannerisms and viewpoints my Christian values of service love humility and struggle and my anti colonial sense of self determination for oppressed people and nations around the world

In 1980 he earned a PhD from Princeton where he was influenced by Richard Rortys pragmatism The title of his dissertation was Ethics historicism and the Marxist tradition which was later revised and published under the title The Ethical Dimensions of Marxist Thought

In his mid 20s he returned to Harvard as a W E B Du Bois Fellow before becoming an Assistant Professor at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York In 1985 he worked at Yale Divinity School in what eventually became a joint appointment in American Studies While at Yale he participated in campus protests for a clerical labor union and divestment from apartheid South Africa He was arrested and jailed at one of the protests As punishment the University administration canceled his leave for Spring 1987 leading him to commute from Yale in New Haven Connecticut where he was teaching two classes across the Atlantic Ocean to the University of Paris

He then returned to Union and taught at Haverford College in Pennsylvania for one year before going to Princeton to become a Professor of Religion and Director of the Program in African American Studies He worked with novelist Toni Morrison to improve the Princeton program

In 1994 West accepted an appointment as Professor of African American Studies at Harvard University with a joint appointment at the Harvard Divinity School West taught one of the Universitys most popular courses an introductory class on African American Studies In 1998 he was appointed the first Alphonse Fletcher University Professor This professorship allowed West to teach both African American studies and Divinity Religion and Philosophy

In 2001 after an argument with Harvard President Lawrence Summers West returned to Princeton where he has taught ever since

Critics most notably The New Republic Literary Editor Leon Wieseltier have charged him with opportunism crass showmanship and lack of scholarly seriousness

West remains a widely cited scholar in the popular press in African American Studies and Studies of Black Theology

West is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity He is a member of the fraternitys World Policy Council a think tank whose purpose is to expand Alpha Phi Alphas involvement in politics and social and current policy to encompass international concerns

West appears in both The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions playing Councilor West who serves on the council of Zion Wests character advises that comprehension is not a requisite of cooperation In addition West provides philosophical commentary on all three Matrix films in The Ultimate Matrix Collection along with integral theorist Ken Wilber

Cornel West has also made several appearances in documentary films such as the 2008 film Examined Life a documentary featuring several academics discussing philosophy in real world contexts West driving through Manhattan  compares philosophy to jazz and blues reminding us how intense and invigorating a life of the mind can be He also appears in conversation with Bill Withers in the Bill Withers documentary Still Bill West also makes frequent appearances on the political talk show Real Time with Bill Maher

A character based on West and events in his career appeared in the Law Order Criminal Intent episode Anti Thesis significant for introducing the recurring villain character Nicole Wallacecitation neededdateMay 2011

On the musical front West recorded a recitation of John Mellencamps song Jim Crow for inclusion on the singers box set On the Rural Route 7609 in 2009 In 2010 he completed recording with the Cornel West Theory a Hip Hop band endorsed by West He has also released two hip hopsoulspoken word albums one under Cornel West the other under Cornel West BMWMB Both works are musical expressions of Wests personal politics and beliefs which he has enunciated in his previous written works

In 2000 economist and former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers became president of Harvard In a private meeting with West Summers allegedly rebuked West for missing too many classes contributing to grade inflation neglecting serious scholarship and spending too much time on his economically profitable projects Some people say that Summers allegedly suggested that West produce an academic book West had written several books some of them widely cited but his recent output consisted primarily of co written and edited volumes According to some reports Summers also objected to Wests production of a CD the critically panned Sketches of My Culture and to his political campaigning According to Wests book Democracy Matters Summers wrongly accused him of canceling classes for three straight weeks during 2000 to promote Bill Bradleys presidential campaign West contends that he had missed one class during his tenure at Harvard in order to give a keynote address at a Harvard sponsored conference on AIDS Summers also allegedly suggested that since West held the rank of Harvard University Professor and thus reported directly to the President he should meet with Summers regularly to discuss the progress of his academic production

West contends that popular coverage of the controversy obscured the true issues at stake in his dispute with Summers West argues that Summerss vision of academia is corrosive to a deep democratic commitment that strives to connect the academy with society at large so as to fulfill its calling to educate the public He contends that the controversy with Summers was indicative of the fact that a market driven technocratic culture has infiltrated university life with the narrow pursuit of academic trophies and the business of generating income from grants and business partnerships taking precedence over the fundamental responsibility of nurturing young minds  According to West during the controversy he was highly regarded in the academic community had more academic references than fourteen of the other seventeen Harvard University Professors and had nearly twice as many such references as Summers himself At the time West had been focused on reaching wider audiences as part of his effort to encourage civic engagementespecially amongst youthin the hope of revitalizing what he calls a deep democratic commitment that would counteract the encroaching political nihilism that he argues threatens the future of American democracy While West does not deny the importance of academics engaging the more specialized concerns of their fields he strongly opposes the sentiment that academia must limit itself to those rarefied interests Academia and academics he contends have an important role to play in promoting public discourse that cannot be achieved if professors lock themselves in their ivory towers instead of engaging society at large and the salient issues of the day Ultimately this was the root of the quarrel according to West

Summers refused to comment on the details of his conversation with West except to express hope that West would remain at Harvard Soon after West was hospitalized for prostate cancer West complained that Summers failed to send him get well wishes until weeks after his surgery whereas newly installed Princeton president Shirley Tilghman had contacted him frequently before and after his treatment In 2002 West left Harvard University to return to Princeton West lashed out at Summers in public interviews calling him the Ariel Sharon of higher education on NPRs Tavis Smiley Show In response to these remarks five Princeton faculty members led by professor of molecular biology Jacques Robert Fresco said they looked with strong disfavor upon his characterization of Summers and that such an analogy carries innuendoes and implications that many on the Princeton faculty find highly inappropriate indeed repugnant and intolerable

Harvard Universitys undergraduate student newspaper The Harvard Crimson suggested in October 2002 that the premise of Law and Order Criminal Intent episode Anti Thesis was based on Wests conflicts with Summers

West publicly supported 2008 Democratic Presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama He spoke to over 1000 of his supporters at the Apollo Theater in Harlem NYC on November 29 2007 However West now calls Obama a black mascot of Wall Street oligarchs and a black puppet of corporate plutocrats In an interview West saidAs a young brother who grows up in a white context brilliant African father hes always had to fear being a white main with a black skin All he has known culturally is whiteWests comments about President Obama have drawn criticism from other African Americans including Melissa Harris Perry and Al Sharpton

West criticized President Obama when Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 saying that it would be difficult for Obama to be a war president with a peace prize West recanted his support for Obama in an April 2011 interview in which he said Obama is merely a black mascot for Americas elites and also a black muppet of corporate plutocrats

West has called the US a racist patriarchal nation where white supremacy continues to define everyday life White America he writes has been historically weak willed in ensuring racial justice and has continued to resist fully accepting the humanity of blacks This has resulted he claims in the creation of many degraded and oppressed people hungry for identity meaning and self worth Professor West attributes most of the black communitys problems to existential angst derived from the lived experience of ontological wounds and emotional scars inflicted by white supremacist beliefs and images permeating US society and culture

In Wests view the September 11 2001 attacks gave white Americans a glimpse of what it means to be a black person in the United Statesfeeling unsafe unprotected subject to random violence and hatred for who they are The ugly terrorist attacks on innocent civilians on 911 he said plunged the whole country into the blues

West has described himself as a non Marxist socialist and serves as honorary chair of the Democratic Socialists of America which he has described as the first multiracial socialist organization close enough to my politics that I could join He also described himself as a radical democrat suspicious of all forms of authority on the Matrix themed documentary The Burly Man Chronicles

West believes that the overthrow of Saddam Husseins ugly totalitarian regime was desirable but that the war in Iraq was the result of dishonest manipulation on the part of the Bush administration He asserts that Bush Administration hawks are not simply conservative elites and right wing ideologues but rather are evangelical nihilists drunk with power and driven by grand delusions of American domination of the world He adds We are experiencing the sad gangsterization of America an unbridled grasp at power wealth and status Viewing capitalism as the root cause of these alleged American lusts West warns Free market fundamentalism trivializes the concern for public interest It puts fear and insecurity in the hearts of anxiety ridden workers It also makes money driven poll obsessed elected officials deferential to corporate goals of profit often at the cost of the common good

West has been involved with such projects as the Million Man March and Russell Simmonss Hip Hop Summit and worked with such public figures as Louis Farrakhan and Al Sharpton whose 2004 presidential campaign West advised

In 2000 West worked as a senior advisor to Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley When Bradley lost in the primaries West became a prominent endorser of Ralph Nader even speaking at some Nader rallies Some Greens sought to draft West to run as a presidential candidate in 2004 West declined citing his active participation in the Al Sharpton campaign West along with other prominent Nader 2000 supporters signed the Vote to Stop Bush statement urging progressive voters in swing states to vote for John Kerry despite strong disagreements with many of Kerrys policies

In April 2002 West and Rabbi Michael Lerner performed civil disobedienceClarifydateFebruary 2009 at the US State Department in solidarity with suffering Palestinian and Israeli brothers and sisters West said We must keep in touch with the humanity of both sides In May 2007 West joined a demonstration against injustices faced by the Palestinian people resulting from the Israeli occupation and to bring attention to this 40 year travesty of justice In 2011 West called on the University of Arizona to divest from companies profiting from the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories

West also serves as co chair of the Tikkun Community He co chaired the National Parenting Organizations Task Force on Parent Empowerment and participated in President Clintons National Conversation on Race He has publicly endorsed In These Times magazine by calling it The most creative and challenging news magazine of the American left He is also a contributing editor for Sojourners Magazine

West supports of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in its Kentucky Fried Cruelty campaign aimed at eliminating what PETA describes as KFCs inhumane treatment of chickens West is quoted on PETA flyers Although most people dont know chickens as well as they know cats and dogs chickens are interesting individuals with personalities and interests every bit as developed as the dogs and cats with whom many of us share our lives

The Toyota Prius is a hybrid automobile from the Japanese automobile producer Toyota It is called hybrid because it has two different engines a gasoline engine and an electric motor Because of the electric motor it uses less fuel than a normal gasoline automobile when driving at low speeds The electric motor uses batteries for its power and these batteries are charged by a dynamo when the gasoline engine is used at higher speeds

The Upper Palaeolithic is the third and last part of the Palaeolithic period It lasted from about 40000 to 10000 years ago Humans used tools for hunting and fishing They also developed cave paintings In this period the Neanderthal man completely disappeared leaving Homo sapiens as the only surviving species in the human genus

In Europe Asia and Africa this time is known as the last part of the Old Stone Age

The first modern humans found in Western Europe date back to about 36000 years ago Those fossils were found in the south west of Romania The founds were made in a stone cave called Petera cu Oase

The Lascaux cave paintings are from this time period They are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1979 and are in France

Evidence for belief in the afterlife in the Upper Palaeolithic appearance of burial rituals and ancestor worship

Possibly among the earliest traces of art are Venus figurines These are figurines of women mostly pregnant with visible breasts The figurines were found in areas of Western Europe to Siberia Most are between 20000 and 30000 years old Two figurines have been found that are much older the Venus of Tan Tan dated to 300000 to 500000 years ago was found in Morocco The Venus of Berekhat Ram was found on the Golan Heights It has been dated to 200000 to 300000 years ago It may be the one of the earliest things that show the human form 

Different kinds of stone bones and ivory were used to make the figurines Some are also made of clay which was then burned in a fire This is one of the earliest known traces of the use of ceramics

Today it is not known what the figurines meant to the people who made them There are two basic theories

Scientists have excluded that these figurines were linked to the fertility of fields because agriculture had not been discovered at the time the figurines were made

The two figurines that are older may have mostly formed by natural processes The Venus of Tan Tan was covered with a substance that could have been some kind of paint The substance contained traces of iron and manganese The figurine of Berekhat Ram shows traces that someone worked on it with a tool A study done in 1997 states that these traces could not have been left by nature alone

Cave paintings are paintings that were made on the walls or roofs of caves Many cave paintings belong to the Palaeolothic Age and date from about 15000 to 30000 years ago Among the most famous are those in the caves of Altamira in Spain and Lascaux in Francep545 There are about 350 caves in Europe where cave paintings have been found Usually animals have been painted like aurochs bisons or horses Why these paintings were done is not known They are not simply decorations of places where people lived The caves they were found in usually do not show signs that someone lived in them

One of the oldest caves is that of Chauvet in France Paintings in the cave fall into two groups One has been dated to around 30000 to 33000 years ago the other to 26000 or 27000 years agop546 The oldest known cave paintings based on radiocarbon dating of black from drawings from torch marks and from the floors As of 1999 the dates of 31 samples from the cave have been reported The oldest paintings have been dated from 32900490 years ago

Some archaeologists have questioned the dating Zchner believe the two groups date from 2300024000 and 1000018000 years ago Pettitt and Bahn believe the dating is inconsistent They say the people at that periods of time painted things differently They also do not know where the charcoal used to paint some things is from and how big the painted area is

People from the Palaeolithic era drew well They knew about perspective and they knew of different ways to draw things They also were able to observe the behaviour of animals they painted Some of the paintings show how the painted animals behaved The paintings may have been important for rituals

Adams Morgan is a culturally diverse neighborhood in Northwest Washington DC It is centered at the intersection of 18th Street and Columbia Road Adams Morgan is the center of Washingtons Hispanic immigrant community It is a major night life area with many bars and restaurants particularly along 18th Street and Columbia Road Much of the neighborhood has 19th and early 20th century row houses and apartment buildings 

Adjacent to Adams Morgan is Dupont Circle to the south Kalorama Triangle to the southwest Mount Pleasant to the north and Columbia Heights to the east The neighborhood is bounded by Connecticut Avenue to the southwest Rock Creek Park to the west Harvard Street to the north 16th Street to the east and Florida Avenue to the south 

The name Adams Morgan was originally hyphenated It is derived from the names of two formerly segregated area elementary schoolsthe older all black Thomas P Morgan Elementary School and the all white John Quincy Adams Elementary School Pursuant to the 1954 Bolling v Sharpe Supreme Court ruling District schools were desegregated in 1955 The Adams Morgan Community Council comprising both Adams and Morgan schools and the neighborhoods they served was formed in 1958 The city drew boundaries of the neighborhood through three preexisting neighborhoods Washington Heights Lanier Heights and Meridian Hill naming the resulting area after both schools

In the late 1960s a group of residents organized and worked with city officials to plan and construct a new elementary school and recreational complex that was conceived as a community hub a concept that 40 years later has become a favored one in public school facilities design The development was named the Marie H Reed Learning Center after Bishop Reed a community activist minister and leader It featured a daycare center tennis and basketball courts a solar heated swimming pool health clinic athletic field and outdoor chess tables

Adams Morgan together with the nearby Mount Pleasant and Columbia Heights serve as a gateway community for immigrants Since the 1960s the predominant international presence in both communities has been Latino with the majority of immigrants coming from El Salvador Guatemala and other Central American countries Since the early 1970s like other areas of the nation Adams Morgan had seen a growing influx of immigrants from Africa Asia and the Caribbean as well Gentrification and the resulting high cost of housing however have displaced many immigrants and long time African American residents particularly those with young children Many small businesses have also been displaced The community still retains a degree of diversity most evident in its array of international shops and restaurants Restaurants in Adams Morgan offer ethnic cuisines among them Spanish Ethiopian Guatemalan Mexican Italian Dutch Vietnamese Ghanaian Cajun Brazilian Palestinian Peruvian Indian Israeli Thai Lebanese Eritrean and Chinese

Adams Morgan also has become a thriving spot for night life with a number of bars and clubs featuring live music Over 90 establishments possess liquor licenses putting it on level with other popular nightlife areas like Georgetown and Dupont Circle Local stores along the 18th Street corridor were rapidly replaced with late night establishments leading to a moratorium on new liquor licenses by the Alcohol Beverage Control Board in 2000 after successful lobbying by resident groups The moratorium was renewed in 2004 but eased to allow new restaurant licenses

Although many immigrants and African American residents have left Adams Morgan the long time institutions that meet the needs of Latinos and other non English speaking residents ontinue to serve immigrants and their families Adams Morgan is home to Marys Center a clinic focusing on healthcare delivery to Spanish speaking patients and the Latino Economic Development Corporation as well as numerous businesses and churches that employ and cater to immigrants Adjacent Mt Pleasant also hosts a number of commercial enterprises social service agencies and other institutions that help to anchor local immigrants to the area

Adams Morgan continues to show linguistic and cultural diversity of its public schools Many of the families served live beyond the boundaries established for routine student enrollment however Adams Reed and HD Cooke elementary schools all have international populations with children from well over 30 nations in attendance Latino and African American children comprise the majority of students in the public schools and virtually all are children of color 

The second Sunday of September the neighborhood hosts the Adams Morgan Day Festival a multicultural street celebration with live music and food and crafts booths And weather permitting every Saturdayexcept during the coldest winter monthslocal growers sell fresh organically grown produce and herbs baked and canned goods cheeses cold pressed apple juice and fresh flowers at the farmers market in operation in the same location for more than 30 years Also on summer Saturdays the Western Art Market is open at the Marie Reed School

In the 1960s the neighborhoods attractions included the Avignon Freres bakery and restaurant the Caf Don restaurant the Ontario motion picture theater and the Showboat Lounge jazz nightclub In the 1980s Hazels featured live blues and jazz Its soul food offerings made it a favorite of black jazz musicians like Dizzy Gillespie when they came to town

The area is not directly served by the Metrorail system The nearest station Woodley Park ZooAdams Morgan is in the Woodley Park neighborhood but was renamed in 1999 to reflect the stations proximity to Adams Morgan The nearest station on the Green Line is Columbia Heights In March 2009 the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority began operating a DC Circulator bus route connecting the center of Adams Morgan with both Metro stations The area is also served by a number of WMATA Metrobus lines

Adams Morgan is in the service area of Advisory Neighborhood Commission 1C The boundaries of ANC 1C are 16th Street NW on the east Harvard Street NW and Rock Creek Park on the north Rock Creek Park and Connecticut Avenue on the west and Florida Avenue and U Street on the south

Foxhall is an affluent neighborhood in Washington DC It is bordered by Reservoir Road on the north side and Foxhall Road on the west and south sides Glover Archibold Park makes up the eastern border The first homes were constructed along Reservoir Road and Greenwich Park Way in the mid 1920s By the end of December 1927 some 150 homes had been erected and the community given the name of Foxhall Village

Foxhall is mostly residential Foxhall has a distinct architecture The vast majority of the homes are a brick Tudor style

Judiciary Square is a neighborhood in Northwest Washington DC It has various federal and municipal courthouses and a number of important federal and municipal office buildings Judiciary Square is roughly between Pennsylvania Avenue to the south H Street NW to the north 6th Street to the west and the I 395 access tunnel to the east

The center of the Judiciary Square neighborhood is an actual plaza by the name of Judiciary Square so named because it is adjacent to or inclusive of most of the courthouse buildings in the area The square is between 4th and 5th Streets with D Street to the south and F Street to the north

Among the buildings in Judiciary Square are

The neighborhood is served by the Judiciary Square station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro

During the first half of the 19th century Judiciary Square was mostly residential Its proximity to the courthouses drew a number of lawyers judges and clerks to the neighborhood while its location between the White House and the Capitol made it ideal for government employees Among its most prominent residents were Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton Vice President John C Calhoun and Daniel Webster As of 2006 however nearly all of the once plentiful rowhouses in the area were gone with the remaining houses mostly centered around the intersection of 5th and D Streets

Around the turn of the 20th century the eastern side of Judiciary Square became an enclave of Italian immigrants in Washington  the equivalent of a Little Italy The Italian neighborhood rested on the eastern edge of the square proper stretching eastward to about 2nd Street NW The heart of the community was Holy Rosary Church a chapel built at 3rd and F Streets NW The neighborhood lasted well into the 20th century with a particular surge of Italian immigrants in the 1950s and 60s in the mid 1970s however construction of the I 395 northbound extension through the city gutted about half of the neighborhood and forced its remaining residents to move away from the heavy commuter traffic Today the former Italian enclave is dominated by Federal office buildings and law offices for the trial attorneys who argue in Judiciary Square courthouses although Holy Rosary Church remains standing and continues to draw a heavily Italian congregation along with its Casa Italia cultural center next door

The island of New Guinea or islands of Papua New Guinea are not always included in definitions of the Malay Archipelago The Indonesian Moluccas are included in the archipelago

The Malay Archipelago is the place where two large tectonic plates meet and is an area where orogeny and volcanoes are common 

The Wallace Line is a key term in biogeography It passes between Bali and Lombok which are separated by a passage of water which is both deep and fast On the one side are Australasian species and on the other side Asian species The natural history of the area was investigated by Alfred Russel Wallace who spent eight years in the Spice Islands

Lucian Michael Freud was regarded as one of the greatest painters of the human form He was born in Berlin in 1922 and moved with his family to England in 1932 to escape from the Nazis His father an architect was the son of Sigmund Freud During World War II Freud studied art as well as working as a sailor in the British Merchant Navy

He painted portraits which have been described as being brutally honest he did not try to make people look good He often painted them nude with the faces staring straight ahead He used thick layers of paint impasto using colors of green gray and purple which he blended to with pink to suggest skin color He was popular for a while in the 1960s but his work was rediscovered in 1987 after an exhibition in the US In 2008 his painting Benefits Supervisor Sleeping was sold for US336 million the most ever paid for a painting by a living artist This painting was of a fat nude lady asleep on a couch

He was made a member of the Order of Merit in 1993 This honour given by the Queen is limited to only 24 people who have achieved distinction in the arts science or other areas

He died in London after a short illness

Parthian language is an old Iranian language the language has been spoken in the north east of Iran the region has been called Parthia the main time of this language was about 248 BC until 224 ADthe time of Parthian Empire Parthian language is a kind of Indo European languages

At the time of Sassanid Empire Parthian language has been destroyed and Middle Persian language replaced Parthian language

Now there is many words in Armenian language that remain of Parthian language

The President of the Czech Republic is head of state of the Czech Republic The first President took office in 1993 

The Wallace Line is a boundary that separates the ecozones of Asia and Australasia The transitional zone is sometimes called Wallacea

Plants and animals related to Asian species are found to the north west to the south east are mainly Australasian species are found with some Asian species The line is named after Alfred Russel Wallace who noticed this clear dividing line during his travels through the East Indies in the 19th century 

The line runs through Indonesia between Borneo and Sulawesi and through the Lombok Strait between Bali and Lombok 

The distance between Bali and Lombok is only about 35 kilometers Surprisingly the distributions of many bird species observe the line because many birds do not cross even the smallest stretches of open ocean water Some bats have distributions that cross the Wallace Line but other mammals are generally limited to one side or the other an exception is the Crab eating Macaque Other groups of plants and animals show differing patterns but the overall pattern is striking and reasonably consistent

During Quaternary ice age cold periods when the ocean levels were up to 120 m lower both Asia and Australia were joined with their respective islands The deep water between those two large continental shelf areas was for over 50 million years a barrier that kept the flora and fauna of Australia separated from that of Asia Wallacea consists of islands that were never recently connected by dry land to either of the continental land masses and thus was populated by organisms capable of crossing the straits between islands Webers Line runs through this area at the tipping point between dominance by species of Asian vs species of Australian origin

The Japanese Macaque also known as the snow monkey is a tough monkey that lives in the high mountains of the island of Honshu in Japan There are two things that make these monkeys different from other primates they live in below zero temperatures and they like to warm themseves and relax in hot springs Macaques are found in Japan

Macaque monkeys eat fruit flowers seeds bark leaves shrimp and insects

Macaques weigh around 12 kilograms and can grow up to 70cm They have short tails

The macaques are a group of primates

The word geek is a slang word It has many different meanings It can mean a person who enjoys computers and knows a lot about them It used to mean a carnival worker who bit the heads off of chickens and rats One dictionary says that a geek is a peculiar or otherwise dislikable person especially one who is perceived to be overly intellectual This means a strange and un likeable person especially one who is thought to be very clever in simple English

This word comes from English dialect words geek geck fool freak from Low German geck from Middle Low German A different form of the word geck is still used in Dutch and Afrikaans gek crazy Other forms of geck are also used in some German dialects and in the Alsatian word Gickeleshut geeks hat used in carnivals

In 18th century Austria Hungary Gecken were freaks shown by some circuses In 19th century in North America the term geek referred to a freak in circus side shows In some cases its performance included biting the head off a live chickenCitation neededdateOctober 2011 The 1976 edition of the American Heritage Dictionary included only the definition regarding geek showsCitation neededdateOctober 2011

The word is often used to be rude or mean to someone However it can also be used without meaning to be hurtful or with pride An example is the Geek Squad of the Best Buy company

The meaning of geek has changed much over time and there is no longer a single meaning The words nerd gimp dweeb dork spod and gump have similar meanings as geek But many people choose to say that these words mean slightly different things However the differences are not agreed on In a 2007 interview on The Colbert Report Richard Clarke said the difference between nerds and geeks is geeks get it done Julie Smith described a geek as a bright young man turned inward poorly socialized who felt so little kinship with his own planet that he routinely traveled to the ones invented by his favorite authors who thought of that secret dreamy place his computer took him to as cyberspacesomewhere exciting a place more real than his own life a land he could conquer not a drab teenagers room in his parents house

The word geek is in Robert Heinleins 1952 short story The Year of the Jackpot The word appears meaning the modern definition

Being called a geek is usually an insult The word is now often a nice thing to say meaning that the person it is describing has extraordinary technical skill Geek Pride Day has been observed on May 25 in Spain since 2006 The holiday promotes the right to be nerdy or geeky and to express it in public without feeling bad A new meeting GeekKon is held in Madison Wisconsin to celebrate all things geek

The website BoardGameGeek is an online community of boardgamers who see themselves as geeks at boardgame meetings they call their website The Geek for short Technical support services such as Geek Squad use the term geek to show that they have helpful technical abilities In recent history some geeks have grown a geek culture such as geek humor and odd references on t shirts The so called geek chic trend is a deliberate affectation of geek or nerd traits as a fashion statement Nonetheless the derogatory definition of geeks remains that of a person only thinking about his area of interest at the cost of social skills personal hygiene and status

There has been criticism over the widespread appropriation of the terms geek and nerd as self descriptors Certain people who would have most likely not been described as such under the traditional stereotype have argued this Along with efforts to de emphasize the negative social aspects in recent years there have been arguments for de emphasizing the necessity for having noticeably high levels of intelligence or technical aptitude This has resulted in the desire to redefine the term geek rather as any person who pursues a passionate interest in anything regardless of genre is creative and individualistic Arguments against the revisionist definitions however state that it is not only unnecessary but it completely contradicts the traditional accepted definition of the terms which distinctly refer to persons who are noticeably above average intelligence usually good at things in technically demanding fields and socially awkward or alienated to a certain extent

Geek chic is a phrase that means a person who has stereotypically geek features including black rimmed glasses T shirts with geek in jokes and more technically complex things

There are many ways of looking at the term geek chic with heavy black rimmed glasses being the one defining thing as far as the press is concerned Wearing them is sufficiently notable to have celebrities like David Beckham Justin Timberlake and Myleene Klass being reported as trying geek chic David Tennant the Tenth Doctor in Doctor Who has also described the look of his bespectacled character as having a bit of geek chic

Geeks themselves think that the term is used for reclaiming the geek identity as something not only meaningful but also stylish  for this usage more than just glasses are needed and so the term has a wider meaning being applied to home fittings and objects as well as clothes In this usage the term geek chic can even be used as a positive contrast to the somewhat more negative term geeky

Geek chic is not to be confused with preppie fashion which is more widely to do with a conservative image rather than geek culture Instead much of the geek chic image borrows from various other youth fashions such as goth hippie and bohemian among othersCitation neededdateJuly 2010 but t shirts with geeky in jokes seem to originate from the geeks themselves Shirt designers who tailor to geeks offer rewards for the best ideas

The Best Buy company of Richfield Minnesota has trademarked Geek Squad as the name of its computer repair service Best Buy has fought the trademarks of a dozen other companies including Geek Rescue Rent a Geek and Speak With a Geek It is also fighting with Newegg over the use of Take it from a Geek on Neweggs website The NBC television show Chuck wanted to use Geek Squad to describe the main characters job But Best Buy asked for them to change the name So the characters on Chuck were called Nerd Herd instead

The Northern Virginia military shootings were several attacks by a man shooting a rifle at empty military buildings The shots were fired in October and November 2010 Experts looked at the bullets left at the various places They could see that all of the shots were from the same rifle

The first shooting was aimed at the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Triangle Virginia on October 16 2010 Some bullets from a high velocity rifle went through the atrium skylight The second shooting happened on October 19 2010 shortly before 5 am Someone shot at the south side of The Pentagon in Arlington Virginia The bullets broke windows on the third and fourth floors Special glass stopped the bullets from entering the building The offices behind those windows were empty because of repairs The Pentagon Reservation was temporarily closed because the police searched the area for evidence The building was reopened about 540 am The Joint Terrorism Task Force is leading the investigation into the incident In the third shooting the same rifle shot the Marine Corps Museum again on October 29 The same rifle was used to attack a Marine Corps recruiting center in Chantilly Virginia on October 26

These attacks made the organizers of the October 31 2010 Marine Corps Marathon upgrade the safety measures The race was run without problems On November 3 police announced that the same rifle was used to shoot at a United States Coast Guard recruiting center in Woodbridge Virginia on late November 1 or early November 2

The person behind the attacks remained unknown until June 17 2011 when Yonathan Melaku was arrested He is a 22 year old naturalized Ethiopian immigrant and Marine Corps Reserve Lance Corporal He was found at Arlington National Cemetery while it was closed He was carrying spent shell casings a notebook containing references to the Taliban and Osama bin Laden and plastic bags filled with ammonium nitrate a common component of homemade explosives He also left his car parked in the woods near the Pentagon police said He had also been recently charged with breaking into 27 cars in suburban Washington The investigation of the incident connected Melaku to the shootings On June 23 2011 he was charged with two counts of willfully injuring the property of the United States If he is convicted of those charges he could go to prision for 20 years Melaku is also charged with two counts of using a firearm during a violent crime If he is convicted of those charges he could go to prison for the rest of his life More charges are possible

In chemistry molecular symmetry is the symmetry of molecules It also puts molecules into groups according to their symmetry Molecular symmetry is a basic idea in chemistry It can predict or explain many of a molecules chemical properties such as its dipole moment It can also explain a molecules allowed spectroscopic transitions Nearaly all university level textbooks on physical chemistry quantum chemistry and inorganic chemistry have a chapter on molecular symmetry Chemists study symmetry to explain how crystals are made up and how chemicals react The molecular symmetry of the reactants help predict how the product of the reaction is made up and the energy needed for the reaction

Molecular symmetry can be studied several different ways Group theory is the most popular idea Group theory is also useful in studying the symmetry of molecular orbitals This is used in the Hckel method ligand field theory and the WoodwardHoffmann rules Another idea on a larger scale is the use of crystal systems to describe crystallographic symmetry in bulk materials

Scientists can find molecular symmetry by using X ray crystallography and other forms of spectroscopy Spectroscopic notation is based on facts taken from molecular symmetry

Physicist Hans Bethe used characters of point group operations in his study of ligand field theory in 1929 Eugene Wigner used group theory to explain the selection rules of atomic spectroscopy The first character tables were compiled by Lszl Tisza in connection to vibrational spectra Robert Mulliken was the first to publish character tables in English E Bright Wilson used them in 1934 to predict the symmetry of vibrational normal modes The complete set of 32 crystallographic point groups was published in 1936 by Rosenthal and Murphy

Mathematical group theory has been adapted to study of symmetry in molecules 

Each of the five symmetry elements has a symmetry operation People use a caret symbol to talk about the operation rather than the symmetry element So n is the rotation of a molecule around an axis and is the identity operation A symmetry element can have more than one symmetry operation associated with it Since C1 is equivalent to E S1 to and S2 to i all symmetry operations can be classified as either proper or improper rotations

A point group is a set of symmetry operations forming a mathematical group for which at least one point remains fixed under all operations of the group A crystallographic point group is a point group which will work with translational symmetry in three dimensions There are a total of 32 crystallographic point groups 30 of which are relevant to chemistry Scientists use Schoenflies notation to classify point groups 

Mathematics define a group A set of symmetry operations form a group when

The order of a group is the number of symmetry operations for that group

For example the point group for the water molecule is C2v with symmetry operations E C2 v and v Its order is thus 4 Each operation is its own inverse As an example of closure a C2 rotation followed by a v reflection is seen to be a v symmetry operation vC2 v

Another example is the ammonia molecule which is pyramidal and contains a three fold rotation axis as well as three mirror planes at an angle of 120 to each other Each mirror plane contains an N H bond and bisects the H N H bond angle opposite to that bond Thus ammonia molecule belongs to the C3v point group which has order 6 an identity element E two rotation operations C3 and C32 and three mirror reflections v v and v

The following table contains a list of point groups with representative molecules The description of structure includes common shapes of molecules based on VSEPR theory

Although an infinite number of such representations exist the irreducible representations of the group are commonly used as all other representations of the group can be described as a linear combination of the irreducible representations Chemists use the irreps to sort the symmetry groups and to talk about their properties

For each point group a character table summarizes information on its symmetry operations and on its irreducible representations The tables are square because there are always equal numbers of irreducible representations and groups of symmetry operations

The table itself is made of characters which show how a particular irreducible representation changes when a particular symmetry operation is applied Any symmetry operation in a molecules point group acting on the molecule itself will leave it unchanged But for acting on a general entity such as a vector or an orbital this does not have to be what happens The vector could change sign or direction and the orbital could change type For simple point groups the values are either 1 or 1 1 means that the sign or phase is unchanged by the symmetry operation and 1 denotes a sign change 

The representations are labeled according to a set of conventions

The tables also tells the Cartesian basis vectors rotations about them and quadratic functions of them transformed by the symmetry operations of the group The table also shows which irreducible representation transforms in the same way Chemists use this because chemically important orbitals have the same symmetries as these entities 

The character table for the C2v symmetry point group is given below

For example water which has the C2v symmetry described above The 2px orbital of oxygen is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and switches sign with a C2 and a v operation but remains unchanged with the other two operations This orbitals character set is thus 1 1 1 1 corresponding to the B1 irreducible representation Similarly the 2pz orbital is seen to have the symmetry of the A1 irreducible representation 2py B2 and the 3dxy orbital A2 These assignments and others are in the rightmost two columns of the table

Jean Paul Getty was an American industrialist He founded the Getty Oil Company In 1957 Fortune magazine named him the richest living American and the 1966 Guinness Book of Records named him as the worlds richest private citizen worth an estimated 1200 million At his death he was worth more than 2 billion A book published in 1996 ranked him as the 67th richest American who ever lived Despite his wealth Getty was known for being a miser

Getty enjoyed collecting art and antiquities His collection formed the basis of the J Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles California and over 661 million of his estate was left to the museum after his death He established the J Paul Getty Trust in 1953 The trust is the worlds wealthiest art institution It operates the J Paul Getty Museum the Getty Foundation the Getty Research Institute and the Getty Conservation Institute

His father George Getty owned a petroleum business in Minneapolis Minnesota J Paul was one of the first people in the world with a fortune estimated at over one billion US dollars

He enrolled at the University of Southern California then at University of California Berkeley before graduating in 1914 from Magdalen College Oxford with degrees in economics and political science He spent his summers between studies working on his fathers oil fields in Oklahoma Running his own oil company in Tulsa he made his first million by 1916 However in 1917 he announced that he was retiring to become a Los Angeles based playboy Although he eventually returned to business Getty had lost his fathers respect Just before George Franklin Getty died in 1930 he believed that Jean Paul would destroy the family company and told him so

After taking a few years off from the money making grind to enjoy spending his earnings on women Getty returned to Oklahoma in 1919 During the 1920s he added about 3 million to his already sizable estate His succession of marriages and divorces so distressed his father however that J Paul inherited a mere 500000 of the 10 million the senior Getty left at his death in 1930

Getty carefully invested his resources during the Great Depression Getty acquired Pacific Western Oil Corporation He began the acquisition of the Mission Corporation which included Tidewater Oil and Skelly Oil In 1967 the billionaire merged these holdings into Getty Oil

Beginning in 1949 Getty paid Ibn Saud 95 million in cash and 1 million a year for a 60 year concession to a tract of barren land near the border of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait No oil had ever been discovered there After spending 30 million over four years oil was discovered there From 1953 onward Gettys gamble produced convert16000000oilbbl a year which contributed greatly to the fortune which made him one of the richest people in the world

Getty learned to speak Arabic which helped his unparalleled expansion into the Middle East Getty owned the controlling interest in nearly 200 businesses including Getty Oil Associates identified his overall wealth at between 2 billion and 4 billion It did not come easily perhaps inspiring Gettys widely quoted remarkThe meek shall inherit the earth but not the mineral rights

He moved to England in the 1950s and loved English culture He lived and worked at his 16th century Tudor estate Sutton Place near Guildford the traditional country house became the centre of Getty Oil and his associated companies and he used the estate to entertain his British and Arabian friends Getty lived the rest of his life in the British Isles dying of heart failure at the age of 83 on June 6 1976

Getty was married and divorced five times He had five sons with four of his wives

He was quoted as saying A lasting relationship with a woman is only possible if you are a business failure

Getty wrote a very successful book entitled How to Be Rich

Getty famously had a pay phone installed at Sutton Place helping to seal his reputation as a miser In his autobiography he described his reasons

Getty placed dial locks on all the regular telephones limiting their use to authorised staff and the coin box telephone was installed for others When speaking in a televised interview with Alan Whicker Getty said that he thought guests would want to use a payphone Citation neededdateJune 2011

On July 10 1973 in Rome 16 year old John Paul Getty III was kidnapped and a ransom of 17 million was demanded over the phone for his safe return However the family suspected a ploy by the rebellious teenager to extract money from his miserly grandfather John Paul Getty II asked his father for the money but was refused

In November 1973 an envelope containing a lock of hair and a human ear was delivered to a daily newspaper The second demand had been delayed three weeks by an Italian postal strike The demand threatened that Paul would be further mutilated unless 32 million was paid This is Pauls ear If we dont get some money within 10 days then the other ear will arrive In other words he will arrive in little bits

When the kidnappers finally reduced their demands to 3 million Getty senior agreed to pay no more than 22 million  the maximum that would be tax deductible He loaned his son the remaining 800000 at 4 interest Paul III was found alive in southern Italy shortly after the ransom was paid After his release Paul III called his grandfather to thank him for paying the ransom but Getty refused to come to the phone Nine people were later arrested for the kidnapping but only two were convicted Paul III was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict After a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in 1981 Paul III was rendered speechless nearly blind and partially paralyzed for the rest of his life He died thirty years later on February 5 2011 at the age of 54

Getty defended his initial refusal to pay the ransom on two points First he argued that to submit to the kidnappers demands would immediately place his other fourteen grandchildren at the risk of copy cat kidnappers He added

J Paul Getty and J Paul Getty II are cited on Leonard Cohens song Jazz Police J Paul Getty also mentioned in Aerosmiths song Last Child from the album Rocks and in Sparkss song In My Family from Kimono My House J Pauline Spaghetti a character portrayed by Spring Byington in the episodes The Sandman Cometh and The Catwoman Goeth of the 1966 Batman series is a female parody of J Paul Getty whether to emphasize the shows sense of humor or to avoid lawsuit for illegal usage of Gettys likeness

Paradise Lost is an epic poem by the 17th century English writer John Milton It was printed in 1667 though it was written nearly ten years earlier The second part was printed in 1674 Most of the poem was written after Milton was blind

The poem is about the Christian story of the Fall of Man how Adam and Eve got out from the Garden of Eden and about the fallen angel Lucifer

During his rule Western nations called Libya a pariah state A Dutch investigation found that Gaddafi had built up a billion dollar empire from assets in an international company in the oil industry It also claims that his assets are scattered throughout much of Europe Gaddafi had a strong interest in geo political control was a firm supporter of OAPEC and led a Pan African campaign for a United States of Africa In 1986 Libya was bombed and in 1993 the United Nations imposed sanctions on it After these events Gaddafi started to have closer economic and security relations with the West He cooperated with investigations into alleged Libyan acts of state sponsored terrorism and he stopped his nuclear weapons program As a result the UN sanctions were liften in 2003

In early February 2011 there were major political protests against Gaddafis government These came alongside other demonstrations in Tunisia Egypt and other parts of the Arab world The protests quickly turned into a civil war Gaddafi vowed to die a martyr if necessary in his fight against rebels and external forces he said that those rebelling against his government deserved to die On 17 May 2011 the International Criminal Court issued a request for an arrest warrant against Gaddafi for crimes against humanity which was approved on 27 June and a warrant was issued by the court Gaddafi was captured alive and killed in the town where he was born Sirte Libya on 20 October 2011

Otto Konrad is a retired Austrian football goalkeeper and is now working as goalkeeper coach for SV Grdig in Austrias First League

He started his professional career with his local club SK Sturm Graz He stayed 11 years and then went to SV Austria Salzburg With this team he reached 3 national titles and played in the 1994 UEFA Cup Final which Salzburg lost to Inter Milan In the 199495 season he even scored a goal for Salzburg This goal was voted Goal of the year 1994 1997 to 1998 he became goalkeeper of Real Zaragoza in Spain but returned to Austria where he played for GAK DSV Leoben and PSV Salzburg

He played 12 matches for the Austrian national football team and was member of the squad for the 1990 FIFA World Cup At all his international career was not as sucessful as the club career because at this time there were a lot of good goalkeepers in Austria

In organic chemistry an electrocyclic reaction is a type of pericyclic rearrangement reaction The reaction is electrocyclic if the result is one pi bond becoming one sigma bond or one sigma bond becoming a pi bond Electrocyclic reactions share the following properties

The torquoselectivity in an electrocyclic reaction refers to the direction that the substituents rotate For example the substituents in a reaction that is conrotatory can still rotate in two directions It produces a mixture of two products that are the mirror image of each other A reaction that is torquoselective restricts one of these directions of rotation to produce a product in enantiomeric excess

Chemists are interested in electrocyclic reactions because the geometry of the molecules confirm a number of predictions made by theoretical chemists They confirm the conservation of molecular orbital symmetry

The Nazarov cyclization reaction is an electrocyclic reaction that closes a ring It converts divinylketones to cyclopentenones 

An example is the thermal ring opening reaction of 34 dimethylcyclobutene The cis isomer only yields cistrans 24 hexadiene But the trans isomer gives the transtrans diene

The frontier orbital method explains how this reaction works The sigma bond in the reactant will open in a way that the resulting p orbitals will have the same symmetry as the highest occupied molecular orbital of the product This can only happen with a conrotatory ring opening that results in opposite signs for the two lobes at the broken ends of the ring The following diagram shows this

The stereospecificity of the result depends on whether the reaction proceeds through a conrotatory or disrotatory process

The WoodwardHoffmann rules address the conservation of orbital symmetry in electrocylic reactions

Correlation diagrams connect the molecular orbitals of the reactant to those of the product having the same symmetry Correlation diagrams can be drawn for the two processes

These correlation diagrams indicate that only a conrotatory ring opening of 34 dimethylcyclobutene is symmetry allowed whereas only a disrotatory ring opening of 56 dimethylcyclohexa 13 diene is symmetry allowed This is because only in these cases would maximum orbital overlap occur in the transition state Also the formed product would be in a ground state rather than an excited state

The Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory predicts that the sigma bond in the ring will open in a way that the resulting p orbitals will have the same symmetry as the HOMO of the product

The above diagram shows two examples For the 56 dimethylcyclohexa 13 diene only a disrotatory mode would result in p orbitals having the same symmetry as the HOMO of hexatriene The two p orbitals rotate in opposite directions For the 34 dimethylcyclobutene only a conrotatory mode would result in p orbitals having the same symmetry as the HOMO of butadiene The p oribtals rotate in the same direction

Light can move an electron up to an excited state that occupies a higher orbital The excited electron will occupy the LUMO which has a higher energy level than the electrons old orbital If light opens the ring of 34 dimethylcyclobutene the resulting electrocyclization would be occur by a disrotatory mode instead of a conrotatory mode The correlation diagram for the allowed excited state ring opening reaction shows why

Only a disrotatory mode in which symmetry about a reflection plane is maintained throughout the reaction would result in maximum orbital overlap in the transition state Also once again this would result in the formation of a product that is in an excited state of comparable stability to the excited state of the reactant compound

Electrocyclic reactions occur frequently in nature One of the most common such reactions in nature is the biosynthesis of vitamin D3

The first step involves light opening the ring of 7 dehydrocholesterol to form pre vitamin D3 This is a photochemically induced conrotatory electrocyclic reaction The second step is a 17 hydride shift to make vitamin D3

Another example is in the proposed biosynthesis of aranotin an oxepine found in nature and its related compounds

Phenylalanine is used to make diketopiperazine Then enzymes epoxidate diketopiperazine to make the arene oxide This undergoes a 6 disrotatory ring opening electrocyclization reaction to produce the uncyclized oxepine After a second epoxidation of the ring the nearby nucleophilic nitrogen attacks the electrophilic carbon forming a five membered ring The resulting ring system is a common ring system found in aranotin and its related compounds

The benzonorcaradiene diterpenoid was rearranged into the benzocycloheptatriene diterpenoid isosalvipuberlin by boiling a methylene chloride solution This transformation can be thought of as a disrotatory electrocyclic reaction followed by two suprafacial 15 sigmatropic hydrogen shifts as shown below

An example of a electrocyclic reaction is the conrotatory thermal ring opening of benzocyclobutane The reaction product is a very unstable ortho quinodimethane This molecule can be trapped in an endo addition with a strong dienophile such as maleic anhydride to the Diels Alder adduct The chemical yield for the ring opening of the benzocyclobutane depicted in scheme 2 is found to depend on the nature of the substituent R With a reaction solvent such as toluene and a reaction temperature of 110C the yield increases going from methyl to isobutylmethyl to trimethylsilylmethyl The increased reaction rate for the trimethylsilyl compound can be explained by silicon hyperconjugation as the C Si bond weakens the cyclobutane C C bond by donating electrons 

An biomimetic electrocyclic cascade reaction was discovered in relation to the isolation and synthesis of certain endiandric acids 

The Arctic hare is a social animal that lives in the frigid tundra of North America Newfoundland and Greenland These hares often congregate in groups of up to 200 individuals They hop at great speeds on their large powerful hind legs in a kangaroo like fashion The female is called a doe the male is called a buck and the baby hare is called a leveret The young are born open eyed and furry Most hares live for about a year in the wild 

This mammal is hunted by wolves and people The young are preyed upon by Arctic foxes falcons snowy owls and ermine

Woodward was born in Boston Massachusetts When he was one year old his father died in the influenza pandemic of 1918

He went to school in Quincy Massachusetts and was interested in chemistry at an early age By the time he entered high school he had already done most of the experiments in Ludwig Gattermanns textbook of experimental organic chemistry In 1928 Woodward asked the Consul General of the German consulate in Boston to send him copies of a few original papers published in German journals He was fascinated to read Otto Diels and Kurt Alders original communication about the DielsAlder reaction Woodward worked with this reaction both in theoretical and experimental ways In 1933 he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology but did not do well enough to continue MIT readmitted him in 1935 and by 1936 he had received the Bachelor of Science degree Only one year later MIT awarded him the doctorate This was very unusual at the time because most MIT students earned only a Bachelor of Science degree after four years Woodwards studies were about the synthesis of the female sex hormone estrone He then studied at the University of Illinois He held a Junior Fellowship at Harvard University from 1937 to 1938 Woodward stayed at Harvard for the rest of his life In the 1960s Woodward was named Donner Professor of Science a job which meant he did not have to teach and could spend all his time on research

In the early 1940s Wooward was using ultraviolet spectroscopy to discover the structure of natural products Woodward collected a large amount of information and then worked out a series of rules later called the Woodwards rules These rules could be used to find out the structures of new natural products as well as non natural synthesized molecules Woodward was always quick to use newly developed techniques Woodwards discovery saved chemists from spending a lot of time using chemical methods to work out the structures of compounds

In 1944 Woodward and William von Eggers Doering reported the synthesis of the alkaloid quinine used to treat malaria The synthesis was a breakthrough as quinine was hard to get from Japanese occupied southeast Asia In fact Woodwards synthesis method was too long and difficult to use on a practical scale However it was a landmark for chemical synthesis Woodward knew that the German chemist Paul Rabe had turned quinotoxine into quinine in 1905 Wooward thought that a synthesis of quinotoxine which he had already synthesized would be the way to synthesize quinine When Woodward did this organic synthesis was still largely a matter of trial and error Nobody thought that such complex structures could actually be constructed Woodward showed that organic synthesis could be made into a rational science and that synthesis could be aided by well established principles of reactivity and structure Woodwards synthesis of quinine was the first of many of his very complicated and elegant syntheses

By the 1930s the British chemists Christopher Ingold and Robert Robinson among others had studied the mechanisms of organic reactions They had come up with rules which could predict reactivity of organic molecules Woodward was probably the first synthetic organic chemist who used these rules to predict what steps would work in a synthesis Woodwards style was the inspiration for the work of hundreds of other chemists who synthesized important medicines and structurally complex natural products

During the late 1940s Woodward synthesized many complex natural products including quinine cholesterol cortisone strychnine lysergic acid reserpine chlorophyll cephalosporin and colchicine With these Woodward opened up a new era of synthesis sometimes called the Woodwardian era He showed that natural products could be synthesized by careful applications of the principles of physical organic chemistry and by very careful planning

Many of Woodwards syntheses were described as spectacular by his colleagues Before he did them some people thought it would be impossible to create these substances in the lab Woodwards syntheses were also described as having an element of art in them and since then synthetic chemists have always looked for elegance as well as utility in synthesis His work also involved the exhaustive use of the then newly developed techniques of infrared spectroscopy and later nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Another important feature of Woodwards syntheses was their attention to stereochemistry or the particular configuration of molecules in three dimensional space Most natural products of medicinal importance are effective for example as drugs only when they possess a specific stereochemistry This creates the demand for stereospecific synthesis producing a compound with a defined stereochemistry While today a typical synthetic route routinely involves such a procedure Woodward was a pioneer in showing how with exhaustive and rational planning one could conduct reactions that were stereospecific Many of his syntheses involved forcing a molecule into a certain configuration by installing rigid structural elements in it another tactic that has become standard today In this regard especially his syntheses of reserpine and strychnine were landmarks

During World War II Woodward was an advisor to the War Production Board on the penicillin project At this time people disagreed on the structure of penicillin Although often given credit for proposing the beta lactam structure of penicillin it was actually first proposed by chemists at Merck and Oxford and then investigated by other groups Woodward at first endorsed an incorrect tricyclic structure put forth by the penicillin group at Peoria Subsequently he put his imprimatur on the beta lactam structure all of this in opposition to the thiazolidine oxazolone structure proposed by Robert Robinson the then leading organic chemist of his generation Ultimately the beta lactam structure was shown to be correct by Dorothy Hodgkin using X ray crystallography in 1945

Woodward also applied the technique of infrared spectroscopy and chemical degradation to determine the structures of complicated molecules Notable among these structure determinations were santonic acid strychnine magnamycin and terramycin About terramycin Woodwards colleague and Nobel Laureate Derek Barton said The most brilliant analysis ever done on a structural puzzle was surely the solution of the terramycin problem It was a problem of great industrial importance and hence many able chemists had performed an enormous amount of work trying to determine the structure There seemed to be too much data to resolve the problem because a significant number of observations although experimentally correct were very misleading Woodward took a large piece of cardboard wrote on it all the facts and by thought alone deduced the correct structure for terramycin Nobody else could have done that at the time

In each one of these cases Woodward again showed how rational facts and chemical principles combined with chemical intuition could be used to achieve the task

In the early 1950s Woodward along with the British chemist Geoffrey Wilkinson then at Harvard postulated a novel structure for ferrocene a compound consisting of a combination of an organic molecule with iron This marked the beginning of the field of transition metal organometallic chemistry The field later grew which grew to be important to the chemical industry Wilkinson won the Nobel Prize for this work in 1973 along with Ernst Otto Fischer Some historians think that Woodward should have shared this prize along with Wilkinson Remarkably Woodward himself thought so and voiced his thoughts in a letter sent to the Nobel Committee

Woodward won the Nobel Prize in 1965 for his synthesis of complex organic molecules In his Nobel lecture he described the total synthesis of the antibiotic cephalosporin and claimed that he had pushed the synthesis schedule so that it would be completed around the time of the Nobel ceremony

In the early 1960s Woodward began work on what was the most complex natural product synthesized to date vitamin B12 In a remarkable collaboration with his colleague Albert Eschenmoser in Zurich a team of almost one hundred students and postdoctoral workers worked for many years on the synthesis of this molecule The work was finally published in 1973 and it marked a landmark in the history of organic chemistry The synthesis included almost a hundred steps and involved the characteristic rigorous planning and analyses that had always characterised Woodwards work This work more than any other convinced organic chemists that the synthesis of any complex substance was possible given enough time and planning However as of 2006 no other total synthesis of Vitamin B12 has been published

That same year based on observations that Woodward had made during the B12 synthesis he and Roald Hoffmann devised rules for elucidating the stereochemistry of the products of organic reactions Woodward formulated his ideas based on his experiences as a synthetic organic chemist he asked Hoffman to perform theoretical calculations to verify these ideas which were done using Hoffmanns Extended Hckel method The predictions of these rules were verified by many experiments Hoffmann shared the 1981 Nobel Prize for this work along with Kenichi Fukui a Japanese chemist who had done similar work using a different approach Woodward had died two years before and was not eligible to share in this Nobel Prize

Note that a recent paper in the journal Nature describes how mechanical stress can be used to reshape chemical reaction pathways to lead to products that apparently violate WoodwardHoffman rules

While at Harvard Woodward took on the directorship of the Woodward Research Institute based at Basel Switzerland in 1963 He also became a trustee of his alma mater MIT from 1966 to 1971 and of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel

Woodward died in Cambridge Massachusetts from a heart attack in his sleep At the time he was working on the synthesis of an antibiotic erythromycin A student of his said about him

I owe a lot to R B Woodward He showed me that one could attack difficult problems without a clear idea of their outcome but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning He showed me that one does not need to specialize Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis to the deduction of difficult structures to the invention of new chemistry and to theoretical aspects as well He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist

In 1938 he married Irja Pullman They had two daughters In 1946 he married Eudoxia Muller an artist and technician whom he met at the Polaroid Corp This marriage which lasted until his death in 1979 produced a daughter and a son

During his lifetime Woodward authored or coauthored almost 200 publications of which 85 are full papers The remainder comprising preliminary communications the text of lectures and reviews The pace of his scientific activity soon outstripped his capacity to publish all experimental details and much of the work in which he participated was not published until a few years after his death Woodward trained more than two hundred PhD students and postdoctoral workers many of whom later went on to distinguished careers 

Some of his best known students include Robert M Williams Harry Wasserman Yoshito Kishi Stuart Schreiber William R Roush Steven A Benner Christopher S Foote Kendall Houk porphyrin chemist Kevin M Smith and Ronald Breslow 

His lectures were legendary and frequently used to last for three or four hours His longest known lecture defined the unit of time known as the Woodward and thereafter his other lectures were deemed to be so many milli Woodwards long In many of these he eschewed the use of slides and used to draw beautiful structures by using multicolored chalk As a result it was always easy to take good notes at a Woodward lecture Typically to begin a lecture Woodward would arrive and lay out two large white handkerchiefs on the countertop Upon one would be four or five colors of chalk neatly sorted by color in a long row Upon the other handkerchief would be placed an equally impressive row of cigarettes The previous cigarette would be used to light the next one His famous Thursday seminars at Harvard often lasted well into the night He had a fixation with blue and all his suits his car and even his parking space were coloured in blue In one of his laboratories his students hung a large black and white photograph of the master from the ceiling complete with a large blue tie appended There it hung for some years until scorched in a minor laboratory fire He detested exercise could get along with only a few hours of sleep every night was a heavy smoker and enjoyed Scotch whiskey and a martini or two Hoffmann would correspond with Woodward using blue paper

For his work Woodward received many awards honors and honorary doctorates including election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1953 and membership in academies around the world He was also a consultant to many companies such as Polaroid Pfizer and Merck 

Other awards include

Woodward also received over twenty honorary degrees including honorary doctorates from the following universities

The Galil is a family of Israeli small arms They were designed by Yisrael Galil and Yaacov Lior in the late 1960s They were made by Israel Military Industries Ltd of Ramat HaSharon 

There are four basic types of Galil the usual rifle length AR a carbine type called the SAR a small MAR version and an ARM light machine gun

The Galils design is supposed to make it work well in warm weather It was designed from the Finnish RK 62 The RK 62 itself was designed from the Soviet AK 47 assault rifle It was chosen as the winner of a competition for the Israel Defense Forces This competition included many other designs Some of these were the M16A1 Stoner 63 AK 47 and HK33 The Galil was officially brought into service in 1972 It replaced the FN FAL

The Galil is hammer fired It has a trigger mechanism which was designed from the trigger used in the American M1 Garand The rifles fire has three positions R the middle position A gives fully automatic fire and pushing the lever fully forward turns on the safety so that the weapon can not be fired

The weapon is made with a plastic hand guard and pistol grip The rifle can be used with a sound suppressor A suppressor makes the weapon quieter The weapon has a bottle opener and wire cutter built into the bipod The bottle opener was built in to stop damage to magazines This was because the magazines were being used to open bottles Wire cutters were built in to reduce the time that IDF troops took to cut down wire fences as wire fences can be seen a lot in rural areas in Israel

The barrel has a flash suppressor with 6 ports It can be used to launch rifle grenades or attach a bayonet It will take the M7 bayonet

The Galil is fed from a curved steel box magazine It can hold 35 rounds There is a special colour coded 12 round magazine which is used for blanks used to launch rifle grenades The magazine is put in front end first It is put in a similar way to the AK family An special attachment can allow the Galil to use the M16 type STANAG magazines

Urticaceae the nettle family comprising about 45 genera of herbs shrubs small trees and a few vines distributed primarily in tropical regions The family is typical of the nettle order 

Many species especially the nettles and Australian nettle trees have stinging hairs on the stems and leaves The leaves are varied and the sap is usually watery The small greenish flowers often form clusters in the leaf axils Both male and female flowers may be borne on the same plant The curled stamens of the male flowers straighten quickly as the flowers open releasing the pollen

Adrian Malik Fenty was the sixth and youngest Mayor of the District of Columbia He was a national leader in urban education reform He lost his re election bid in the 2010 Democratic primary to Vincent C Gray who went on to win the general election for Mayor

Fenty grew up in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Washington DC and graduated from Mackin Catholic High School As a teenager he worked at Swensons Ice Cream next to the Uptown Theatre

Fentys mother is white and his father is African American Adrian Fenty is the middle child of three boysolder brother Shawn a bicycle expert and younger brother Jess Their parents are runners and own a Fleet Feet athletic shoe store in the DC neighborhood of Adams Morgan Adrian has run in the Cherry Blossom Ten Mile Run each year since 2004 improving his finishing time from 11722 to 10259

Fenty earned a BA in English and Economics at Oberlin College and a JD from the Howard University School of Law He is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity

In 1997 Fenty and lawyer Michelle Cross eloped Michelle Cross Fenty works for the Inter American Development Bank They have three children twins Matthew and Andrew and Aerin Alexandra

Fenty was an intern for Senator Howard Metzenbaum Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and Representative Joseph P Kennedy II before becoming involved in local politics In addition to serving as an aide to Councilmember Kevin P Chavous he was elected as an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner in ANC 4C and was president of the 16th Street Neighborhood Civic Association

In 2000 Fenty won a seat on the DC Council Fenty ran against long time Ward 4 Councilmember Charlene Drew Jarvis Jarvis was well known and a heavy favorite but Fenty campaigned hard He pursued an aggressive door to door strategy that put up countless green yard signs It worked Fenty was elected to the Council seat by a 5743 percent margin Unopposed in both the primary and general elections in 2004 Fenty was reelected for a second term

As a Council member Fenty worked on constituent services He opposed public funding for a new baseball stadium He proposed funding a 1 billion capital improvement program for public schools which the Council subsequently passed in an altered form He is a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition an organization formed in 2006 and co chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino

While major Fenty used three BlackBerry devices One BlackBerry directly connects him to Police Chief Cathy Lanier while the latter two are for business and personal matters

Fenty formally announced his campaign for DC Mayor on June 1 2005 In the fall of 2005 then mayor Anthony A Williams made the widely anticipated announcement that he would not seek re election and then Council Chair Linda Cropp announced she would be a candidate for Mayor Other candidates in the field included businesswoman Marie Johns then Councilmember Vincent Orange and lobbyist Michael A Brown

Fenty ran on a platform of bringing a more energetic and hands on approach to city government Cropp trumpeted her 25 years of experience in city government and her desire to continue the progress made by Anthony Williams who endorsed her candidacy The race was widely viewed as neck and neck through the spring of 2006 Both candidates raised significant and nearly equal amounts of money roughly 175 million through June 10 2006 and neither gained any significant advantages from the numerous candidate debates and forums

By July 2006 public and private polling gave Fenty a roughly 10 point advantage Political observers have debated whether it was Fentys unprecedented door to door campaign Cropps lack of engagement in the campaign or the electorates desire for a new direction after eight years of Anthony Williams Cropps campaign began a series of negative attacks during the last month of the campaign In direct mail and television advertisements Cropp painted Fenty as unfit for the job and a careless lawyer who had been admonished by the DC Bar in 2005 he received an informal admonition from the Bar for his role in a probate case in 1999 The attacks however backfired the reaction coupled with the endorsement of the Washington Post extended Fentys lead in the campaigns final weeks

On September 12 2006 Fenty won all 142 city precincts in the Democratic Primary This had never happened before in District of Columbia historyand defeated Linda Cropp by a 5731 percent margin

Fenty received 89 of the vote in the general election He became the Districts sixth elected mayor since the establishment of home rule

Fenty spent a lot of attention on education reform On the first day of his term in an unprecedented and controversial move Fenty introduced legislation to restructure the school system to place full responsibility for schools under his purview Across the city District residents had been demanding that the schools be fixed Schools in the District had been troubled for years with student test performance scores and graduation rates among the lowest in the nation In 1996 a Control Board appointed by Congress had taken over control of the public school system declaring that the schools were in a state of emergency Mayor Fenty viewed this re structuring as the solution

In April 2007 the DC Council approved Fentys school takeover plan and in May 2007 legislation needed to approve the change was passed by Congress and signed by President Bush Under the new structure the existing superintendent was replaced by a school chief or chancellor who was selected by the mayor reported directly to him This power shift also allowed him to make swift changes in the systems central office alter teacher qualification requirements and implement a school consolidation process His selection of Michelle Rhee to manage District schools surprised many people In choosing Rhee he stepped outside of the local landscape to consult with national education experts including New York City School Chancellor Joel Klein 

The move to restructure the schools reporting system and the addition of a school chancellor as a direct report have been credited with putting the school system on the path to long awaited improvements To ensure that maximum resources go directly to classrooms the Mayor and Chancellor closed 23 underenrolled schools and significantly reduced the school systems central administrative staff Student achievement at the secondary level rose 14 points in reading and 17 points in math since 2007 gains that are unprecedented in DC history and unparalled nationwide Student SAT scores rose 27 points in 2010 Graduation rates have risen each year since 2007 and 72 percent of District students took the Practice Scholastic Aptitude Test aka the PSAT which functions as a practice test for students entering college His administration has also taken on a major five year maintenance and construction effort to dramatically improve school buildings by 2014 The Mayor and Chancellor successfully negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the Washington Teachers Union The contract has become a national model for other jurisdictions especially because it establishes a system of performance based teacher compensation 

While focusing on improving schools the Fenty Administration changed District agencies ensuring more efficient and effective service delivery throughout city government Fentys choice for police chief Cathy Lanier also made national headlines Under Fenty Lanier has added police officers to the streets and expanded community policing initiatives for example beefing up the policy of accepting anonymous text message tips from local residents to cut down on potential retaliation By local news accounts there is evidence of success The homicide rate in the District dropped 25 in 2009 The homicide closure rate rose to 70 In his State of the District speech the Mayor reported that homicides were at their lowest level since 1964 and that both violent crimes and property crimes had experienced a double digit decline

Fenty has championed development efforts across the city Across the District several schools libraries parks and recreation centers have been renovated to offer state of the art facilities for residents youth and families One example is the sheer number of improvements in recreational play spaces for children Under Fenty 16 neighborhood and school playgrounds were opened and 9 play courts and fields were completed Under his leadership the Districts largest shopping center the DC USA Shopping Center was openedCitation neededdateMay 2010 New developments such as the Camp Simms retail development have infused new life into the neighborhood with a retail grocery store and a sit down restaurant east of the Anacostia RiverCitation neededdateMay 2010 Renovation of affordable housing units has helped to provide affordable housing during tough economic times The Fenty Administration also expanded health care coverage for the uninsured and established thousands of units of affordable housing while creating the Housing First program to provide permanent supportive housing for the citys homeless neighbors The administration has made tremendous strides in reducing the backlog of Child Protective Services investigations by improving the retention of social workers increasing recruitment of social workers to fill vacancies and building a quality leadership team with a depth of experience Additionally the Fenty Administration has improved the delivery of emergency medical services It also finalized the sale of Greater Southeast Community Hospital in a public private partnership that kept the facility open for patients east of the Anacostia River

In December 2009 Fenty made history by signing the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Equality Act of 2009 to legalize same sex marriage in the District of Columbia During the signing Mayor Fenty and other attending city officials expressed their support of the gay rights movement by expressing that they want the District to provide a road map for gay rights activists as the debate over same sex marriagemoves across the nation

Mayor Fenty and his administration came under attack from political opponents Council Chair Gray complained that Fenty did not share with the city council tickets donated by a local sports arena Chair Gray demanded that Fenty hand the tickets over to him so Gray could have control of the tickets 

The city council also charged that Fenty circumvented the DC Council in making contracts for park improvements Rather than treat them as city contracts the contracts were made with the DC Housing Agency

Fenty officially launched his reelection bid on April 10 2010 at his campaign headquarters located at 5929 Georgia Avenue NW in Washington DCs Brightwood neighborhood The Fenty campaigns headquarters were located on the site of the old Curtis Chevrolet dealership within Ward 4 the ward in which Fenty began his political career as an Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner in ANC 4C 

Fenty faced ten candidates in the Districts September 14 2010 Democratic primary On July 31 2009 Fentys 2010 mayoral campaign passed the 2006 primary fundraising total of 24 million

On August 1 2010 the editorial board of The Washington Post officially endorsed Fenty Washington City Paper followed on September 9

One primary candidate in particular Sulaimon Brown devoted his efforts to attacking Fenty rather than establishing his own positive campaign After the election Brown was given a 110000 per year job in the DC Department of Health Care Finance of the new administration However Brown was fired because of questions about his past In March 2011 Congress announced an investigation into the hiring of Brown

A Washington Post poll released on Aug 29 found Gray with a 17 point lead among likely voters A Clarus poll conducted September 7 gave Gray a 7 point lead among likely voter while a Public Policy Polling survey sponsored by WAMU FM radio and Washington City Paper showed an 11 percent lead for Gray

Fenty lost the Democratic primary election to Vincent C Gray Gray received 53 percent of the vote to Fentys 46 percent Following the reporting of the results Fenty called it highly unlikely he will run for public office again While Fenty received the most write in votes for mayor in the Republican primary election Fenty had previously said he would not accept the Republican nomination

Fenty signed with Greater Talent Network a major speakers bureau in January 2011 The same month Fenty became an outside adviser and counsel to Heffler Radetich Saitta an accounting and consulting firm based in Philadelphia Also in January 2011 it was announced that Fenty would become a distinguished visiting professor of politics a featured lecturer and a career adviser in the Department of African American Studies at Oberlin College In February 2011 Fenty became an outside adviser to Rosetta Stone which produces foreign language software In March 2011 Fenty became a strategic adviser for the state and local government practice of Capgemini Government Solutions LLC an information technology consulting firm In May 2011 Fenty became a member of the advisory board of EverFi Inc an online education and certification firm In July 2011 Fenty joined the law firm Klores Perry Mitchell PC as special counsel

On the Morning Joe Program broadcast on March 8 2011 Adrian Fenty backed Wisconsin Republican Governor Scott Walkers union busting bill and said that the Democratic State Senators should be held accountable

Sulaimon Maurice Brown is an accountant He was a candidate for mayor of the District of Columbia in 2010 During the campaign he actively supported another candidate Vincent Gray After Gray became mayor Browns criminal record became public He is being investigated by the United States Attorney Brown is also being investigated by committees of the DC City Council and of Congress

Browns father Melvin Brown was an Army Ranger and Browns mother was a nurse at Howard University Hospital Brown earned a Bachelor of Business Administration  Accounting from the University of the District of Columbia Brown worked as a University of the District of Columbia police officer until 2005 Brown then worked at various accounting firms In 1988 Brown was tried and acquitted by a jury on an attempted murder charge in Chicago Brown was also accused of assault in Essex County New Jersey but a grand jury refused to indict Brown The Washington City Paper reported that DC court records show gun charges against Brown were dropped in 1991 in exchange for Brown going to a diversion program and a jury found Brown guilty in 1995 for unlawful entry The City Paper also reported that a restraining order had been issued against Brown in 2007 The press asked Brown if he had a criminal record Brown replied that he had been arrested once for trespassing at Howard University

Brown was a volunteer in Adrian Fentys 2006 campaign for mayor According to Browns 2009 website Brown worked behind the scenes campaigning for many elected officials including The President of the United States Barack Obama He has helped in efforts to get White House Legislation passed and most recently trying to get a Supreme Court nominee appointed Brown became a candidate for the 2010 Democratic Party nomination for mayor

On June 24 2010 Brown was running out of money because he had not held a job for 18 months Brown discussed his financial problems with another candidate for mayor Vincent Gray Brown and Gray reached an agreement for Gray to provide cash payments to Brown for the rest of the campaign They also agreed that if Gray won the election the city would hire both Brown and his brother Before the primary election Brown received 44000 from the Gray campaign and an additional 750 from Lorraine Green Chairwoman of Grays campaign Howard Brooks carried the cash between Grays campaign and Brown

Because Brown was a declared candidate he participated with Mayor Fenty in a number of candidate debates At the August 2010 forum in Ward 8 Brown questioned whether Fenty loved his parents According to the Washington Post During the election Brown 40 drew attention at debates by urging voters to cast ballots for Gray and criticizing incumbent Adrian M Fenty Brown received 209 votes in the primary Gray defeated Fenty in the September 14 2010 primary and Gray won the general election in November 2010 Gray became Mayor in January 2011

The Gray Transition Team hired the Capitol Inquiry firm to check Browns background Capitol Inquiry discovered Browns past legal proceedings in Chicago and New Jersey and included them in a confidential report

In January 2011 Brown was hired to a 110000 a year job in the DC Office of Health Care Finance Gray claimed that Brown was hired by Wayne Turnage the director of that office When the Washington City Paper raised questions about the hiring of Brown he was quickly fired DC police escorted Brown out of his new office Mayor Gray called a press conference the same day and statedHes qualified to do the work Mark What he did on the campaign has no relation to this What he did on the campaign is what he decided to do I didnt ask him to do that nor did I encourage him to do thatTurnage said that he fired Brown because they could not get along and not because of what was printed about his background Brown sat in the back of the press conference as an uninvited guest and spoke to reporters at the end of the conference When the press asked Brown if Gray had promised him a job Brown refused to answer Brown blamed City Councilman David Catania for his being fired Brown said that Catania had threatened to delay the confirmation of Turnage until Brown was fired Catania denied this

Brown was placed on paid administrative leave for 15 days

In March 2011 Congress announced an investigation into the hiring of Brown

In April and May 2011 the DC City Council issued a subpeona to get Brown to testify Brown hid from the people trying to give him the subpeona and went to court to fight having to testify On May 31 2011 the DC Superior Court order Brown to testify before the DC Council committee that was investigating this matter On June 6 2011 Brown testified under oath that Gray had paid him cash to keep in as a candidate in the primary race and had promised him a job Brown claimed that Gray himself had ordered one of the payoffs The City Council probe showed that Green Grays chief of staff Gerri Mason Hall and Grays personnel director Judy Banks gave Grays political allies city jobs They did it in a way that did not pay attention to qualifications or laws

Brown was required to report the money that he got as campaign contributions On June 5 Brown gave the press copies of money orders payable to Sulaimon Brown for Mayor from relatives of Howard Brooks including Brooks son the sons girlfriend and a cousin of Brooks wife The last two denied ever making the contributions Peyton Brooks was also hired as a 110000 a year special assistant in the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development Peyton Brooks was one of several children of Grays campaign workers to be fired after the press printed stories about the jobs Brown said that he received additional money orders from Howard Brooks but that those did not have names on them

The United States Attorneys Office is also investigating Brown said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation asked Brown about the payments from Brooks Green and Gray
