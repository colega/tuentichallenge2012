The littoral zone refers to that part of a sea lake or river which is close to the shore In coastal environments the littoral zone extends from the high water mark which is rarely under water to shoreline areas that are permanently submerged It always includes this intertidal zone and is often used to mean the same as the intertidal zone However the meaning of littoral zone can extend well beyond the intertidal zone

In oceanography and marine biology the idea of the littoral zone is extended roughly to the edge of the continental shelf

Collective animal behaviour describes and analyzes the behaviour of groups of animals In these groups the animals are often all of the same species As an example a school of fish will be made of mostly the same type of fish and a flock of birds will have the same type of bird A herd is a large group of hoofed herbivorous mammals

Animals tend to behave in such a way because this behaviour offers them a benefit The group of animals also behaves differently from a single animal Collective animal behaviour is about finding the rules each animal follows how it communicates with other members of the group and how a decision to do something is reached in the group

Full time colonial animals fall into this category in principle but in practice the species of interest here are those who form temporary groups Colonial animals have been researched for many years and are usually based on some kind of family relationship Temporary collective behavior is a well known phenomenon but little researched until now

Different functions have been proposed as follows

1 Protection from predators

2 Better foraging A school of fish or a group of animals is better at foraging 

3 Easier movement Groups of animals moving together save energy Many of the larger birds fly in flocks Flying in flocks helps in reducing the energy needed Many large birds fly in a V formation which helps individuals save 1220 of the energy they would need to fly alone Red Knots Calidris canutus and Dunlins Calidris alpina were found in radar studies to fly 5 km per hour faster in flocks than when they were flying alone

4 Social interaction This can be seen with fish such as Herring If an animal is separated from the group it will feel stressed

5 Special factors come into play with migrating birds or birds which gather in huge flocks such as starlings Bird behavior has a larger component of learning than fish In addition to factors listed above is the possibility that migrating bird flocks are good at teaching first year birds how to do the migration successfully The specific routes may be genetically programmed or learned to varying degrees The routes taken on forward and return migration are often different

The usual term for insects which are not always in a fixed colony but move in large numbers is swarm There are many good examples Army ants for example The best researched is the locust

Locusts are the swarming phase of short horned grasshoppers of the family Acrididae These are species that can breed rapidly under suitable conditions Then they come together in large groups and migratory They form bands as nymphs and swarms as adultsboth of which can travel great distances rapidly stripping fields and greatly damaging crops

There is no taxonomic difference between locust and grasshopper species and in English the term locust is used for grasshopper species that change morphologically and behaviourally on crowding to form swarms or hopper bands These changes or phase polymorphism were first thought of as separate species 

Research at Oxford University showed that swarming is a response to overcrowding Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin This causes the locust to change colour eat much more and breed much more easily The transformation of the locust to the swarming variety is induced by several contacts per minute over a four hour period It is estimated that the largest swarms have covered hundreds of square miles and consisted of many billions of locusts Plagues of locusts appear in both the Bible and the Koran including one of the biblical Plagues of Egypt where locusts ate all the crops of Egypt

Often animals are thought to follow simple rules such as

Recent studies have shown that an animal only picks five to seven other animals and aligns with them This seems to be independent of the distance Another possible approach at modelling is to say that all animals within a certain distance are kept track of for alignment

The Inline four engine or Straight four is an internal combustion engine with all four cylinders All four cylinders are mounted in a straight line along one crankshaft It can be powered by different types of fuels including gasoline diesel and natural gas

The single bank of cylinders may be in a vertical direction or at an angle When the cylinders are mounted at an angle it is sometimes called a slant four When listed as an abbreviation an inline four engine is listed either as I4 or L4 L4 is often used to avoid confusion between the digit 1 and the letter I

The inline four layout is a mechanically simple engine It has a natural basic engine balance It is smoother than one two and three cylinder engines This makes it popular for economy cars It does have a problem with secondary engine balance This causes minor vibrations in smaller engines These vibrations become worse as engine size and power increase The more powerful engines used in larger cars use different a engine layout to avoid this problem

This inline four gasoline configuration is the most common in cars with a displacement up to 24 L Porsche used a 30 L four in its 944 S2 and 968 sports cars Antique vehicles tended to have larger displacements to develop horsepower and torque The Model A Ford was built with a 33 L inline four engine

Four cylinder diesel engines are lower revving than gasoline engines They often exceed 30 L Toyota made a 41 L diesel engine that was used in the Toyota Mega Cruiser Larger four cylinder engines are used in industrial applications are often made with displacements up to about 46 L

Displacement can also be very small Some cars sold in Japan have engines that are only 660 cc

The 1913 Indianapolis 500 was won by Jules Goux driving a Peugeot This car was powered by an inline four engine designed by Ernest Henry This design was big influence for racing engines It was the first to use dual overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder This became the standard design for racing inline four engines

This Peugeot was sold to the American driver Wild Bob Burman Burman broke the engine in 1915 Because of World War I Peugeot couldnt deliver a new engine Burman asked Harry Arminius Miller to build a new engine With John Edward and Fred Offenhauser Miller created a new engine Its design was based on the Peugeot inline four engine This was the first version of the engine that would dominate the Indianapolis 500 until 1976 At first the engine was named Miller Later it became known as Offenhauser The Offenhauser engines won five straight races at Indianapolis from 1971 to 1976 It was not until 1981 that engines such as the Cosworth V8 engine eliminated them

Many cars produced for the pre WWII voiturette Grand Prix motor racing used inline four engine designs These cars were rebuilt and reused after the war They formed the beginnings of what is now Formula One

Modern inline four motorcycle engines first gained their popularity with Hondas single overhead camshaft CB750 in the 1970s The inline four has become one of the most common engine configurations in street bikes The inline four is common because of its relatively high performance to cost ratio All of the Japanese motorcycle manufacturers offer motorcycles with inline four engines

He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1992 

He died of Alzheimers disease on 21 July 2010

Guildhall School of Music and Drama is a school for music and drama in London England It was founded in 1880 Students can study Music Opera Drama Stage Management and Technical Theatre

The first Guildhall School was in an old warehouse but it was soon too small A new building was especially built and opened in 1886 Before 1935 it was known as the Guildhall School of Music Since 1977 it has been next to the Barbican Arts Centre in the Barbican Complex

The Guildhall School does not just teach students at the school They also organize music examinations in the whole of Britain for anyone learning musical instruments In 2004 these examinations joined with those of Trinity College London to form Trinity Guildhall Examinations Today Trinity Guildhall offers qualifications in performing and teaching in music speech and drama and dance to external students

Today the school has a 308 seat drama and opera theatre concert hall lecture recital hall and a small studio theatre The students of the school regularly perform all over London In 2008 work began on a large extension to the School It will cost about 90 million

Famous musicians who studied there include the trumpeter Alison Balsom the composer Thomas Ads the flautist Sir James Galway the pianist Paul Lewis the violinist Tasmin Little and the singers Kate Royal and Bryn Terfel

A mercury vapor lamp is a special lamp It makes light by a spark in a tube that contains mercury The spark makes the mercury atoms release ultraviolet light The ultraviolet light shines on phosphors which make white light from it The EU wants to ban them because they contain large amounts of mercury and are not efficient like fluorescent bulbs They last much longer though They are the bluish streetlights

A sodium vapor lamp is a lamp It produces a yellow or orange light There are two types the high pressure lamp and the low pressure lamp The high pressure one is very energy efficient and is the orange light in streetlights The low pressure one is yellow These lights contain sodium metal in them They operate by a spark through a tube that contains the sodium The sodium emits a yellow color which produces the light

A streetlight is a light bulb on a pole used for lighting streets Streets can be lit for safety or visibility reasons so people can see where they are walking at night Streetlights are normally either orange or blue The blue ones are mercury vapor lamps They are older and last longer The orange ones are sodium vapor lamps They are newer and more efficient

Aluminium oxide also known as aluminum oxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Al2O3 It is a normally white powdery solid It does not exist in a particular form It can dissolve in acids and bases It is used as an abrasive It comes in bauxite and corundum It does not melt easily It is dissolved in a cryolite melt and electrolyzed to make aluminium

The Starlings are a family of small to medium sized birds the Sturnidae This family are passerine songbirds whose best known species is Sternus vulgaris the common sparrow

Starlings occur naturally in the Old World from Europe Asia and Africa to northern Australia and the islands of the tropical Pacific Several European and Asian species have been introduced to these areas as well as to North America Hawaii and New Zealand In these new areas they compete for habitat with native birds and are invasive species 

Starlings have strong feet their flight is strong and direct and they are very gregarious Their preferred habitat is fairly open country and they eat insects and fruit Several species live around humans and are effectively omnivores Many species search for food by opening the bill after probing it into dense vegetation this behavior is called open bill probing Plumage is typically dark with a metallic sheen Most species nest in holes laying blue or white eggs

Many Asian species particularly the larger ones are called mynas and many African species are known as glossy starlings because of their iridescent plumage

Starlings have varied and complex songs and may copy sounds from their surroundings including car alarms and human speech The birds can recognize particular individuals by their calls

North East European starlings migrate but in southern and western Europe the birds are resident Starlings are generally a highly social family Most species associate in flocks of varying sizes throughout the year These flocks may include other species of starlings and sometimes species from other families This sociality is obvious in their roosting behaviour In the non breeding season some roosts can number thousands of birds Flocks in Britain used to number millions of birds though numbers are now fewer than they used to be

Sternus vulgaris is a highly gregarious species in autumn and winter Flock size is variable huge flocks are a spectacular sight and sound These flocks often attract birds of prey such as Sparrowhawks Flocks form a tight sphere like formation in flight frequently expanding and contracting and changing shape seemingly without any leader 

Very large roosts sometimes up to 15 million birds can form in city centres woodlands or reedbeds causing problems with their droppings Huge flocks of more than a million Starlings are observed just before sunset in spring in southwestern Jutland Denmark There they gather in March until they leave for their breeding ranges by mid April Their flocking creates complex shapes against the sky a phenomenon known locally as Black Sun To witness this spectacle the best place are the seaward marshlands of Tnder and Esbjerg 

Flocks of anything from five to fifty thousand Starlings form in areas of the UK just before sundown during mid winter These flocks are commonly called a Starling Moot

Although there are approximately 200 million starlings in North America they are all descendants of 60 birds released in 1890 in Central Park New York by Eugene Schieffelin He was a member of the Acclimation Society of North America which tried to introduce to North America every bird species mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare

As an introduced species European Starlings are not protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act Starlings are considered a nuisance species in North America The birds which travel in enormous flocks often pose dangers to air travel disrupt cattle operations chase off native birds and roost on city blocks They leave behind corrosive droppings and hundreds of millions of dollars of damage every year In 2008 US government agents poisoned shot and trapped 17 million starlings more than any other nuisance species

A royal charter is a legal document issued by the monarchy which gives certain rights to an organization

When an organization for example a university is founded there has to be an official document which lists the basic laws of the organization If this document is given to the organization by the king or queen it is called a Royal charter

In Europe Royal charters have been used to create towns ever since the middle ages The date when the charter was made is thought of as the date when the town was founded even if there had been people living there many years before

Many groups such as the British East India Company were formed by Royal charter Most British university operate under Royal Charters This gives them the right to give degrees to the students at the end of their studies 

The BBC operates under a Royal Charter which lasts for a limited period of ten years after which it is renewed

Charities may also have Royal charters They do not need to have one but they are likely to be more successful if they have a Royal charter

Sir George Grove born Clapham South London 13 August 1820 died Sydenham 28 May 1900 was an English engineer and musician He wrote books about classical composers and is particularly famous for his big musical dictionary Groves Dictionary of Music and Musicians This dictionary continued to be updated and published after his death It has now gone through seven editions The latest edition is available online

George Grove was born in Clapham in South London His father sold fish His mother was musical He learned to be an engineer and was sent out to Jamaica to help to build a lighthouse He worked on the building of the Britannia tubular bridge over the Menai Strait He married the daughter of a clergyman He became secretary of the Society of Arts and he wrote many articles for a Dictionary of the Bible He spent seven years doing this It gave him the idea of doing something similar for music

Grove went to many concerts He bought sheet music and studied it He wrote programme notes for concerts writing about the music that was being played He wrote about a lot of music by Beethoven Schubert Mendelssohn and Schumann He wrote detailed essays about the symphonies of Beethoven and was a good friend of Clara Schumann He travelled with the composer Arthur Sullivan to Vienna where he met many great musicians including Brahms and discovered some music by Schubert that had been forgotten  He spent several years writing his Dictionary of Music which was published in four volumes

Grove worked very hard to get enough money to found the Royal College of Music which was opened in 1883 by the Prince of Wales Grove got many great musicians to come and teach there including the world famous singer Jenny Lind who was already retired and Hubert Parry Charles Villiers Stanford and others The prime minister William Gladstone gave him a knighthood for what he had done for music The new students included many who were to become famous These include Hamish MacCunn and Charles Wood He became very fond of the student Edith Oldham and had an emotional attachment to her for the rest of his life His wife was not interested in his work He called his students his children and persuaded them to have a broad education He wanted them to read a lot He was director of the RCM for eleven years retiring in 1894 just after the RCM moved into a new building which is situated on the south side of the Royal Albert Hall The RCM is still there today

George Grove was a very influential man for English music Although he was not trained as a musician he became extremely knowledgeable and was an excellent musicologist The RCM have a George Grove Memorial Scholarship in his memory

Thurston Dart was a British musicologist conductor and keyboard player He is particularly remembered for his books in which he wrote about how music from earlier centuries should be performed

Dart studied keyboard instruments at the Royal College of Music in London from 1938 to 1939 and also studied mathematics at University College Exeter graduating in 1942 He became a music lecturer and later professor at the University of Cambridge During his time at Cambridge Dart did a lot of work for the early music revival Musicians were becoming interested in playing music from the Baroque Renaissance and even Middle Ages He formed such groups as the Early Music Consort of London In 1964 he became King Edward Professor of Music in the University of London

Thurston Dart played the harpsichord in many concerts and made several gramophone recordings He wrote a book The Interpretation of Music which became very widely read He wrote many articles in journals about music

Dart taught many students included some who later became famous the composer Michael Nyman conductor Sir John Eliot Gardiner and conductormusicologist Christopher Hogwood He was one of the first musicians to make a recording of Bachs Brandenburg Concertos using historical instruments

Mercury compounds are chemical compounds containing mercury ions One thing they have in common is that they are all toxic The soluble ones are more toxic than the insoluble ones Mercury forms compounds in the 1 and 2 oxidation states

Also known as mercurous compounds these are weak reducing agents and weak oxidizing agents Most of them do not dissolve in water making them less toxic than mercury compounds Most of them are colorless or yellow

Also known as mercuric compounds these are strong oxidizing agents Most of them dissolve in water making them very toxic They are colorless or red

These contain mercury reacted with a organic molecule They are even more toxic than other mercury compounds since they get absorbed very easily

Lend Lease was a program of the United States government right before World War II The United States was still trying to be neutral in the War but wanted to give supplies to the Allied Powers The US gave the Allies several billion dollars of weapons The Allies gave the United States rights to air and naval bases around the world as well as billions in future monies This money was not fully given until 2006 

Huey Long was an American politician He served as Governor and Senator in Louisiana in the 1930s He came up with the idea of Share Our Wealth clubs which were some form of utopian communism Long was very well known among American people Long was shot in 1935 when he was only 42 At the time he was saying that Franklin D Roosevelts policies didnt go far enough and might have run against FDR in the 1936 election for President The movie All the Kings Men is based on the life Huey Long

Teapot Dome was the name given to an oil reserve in Wyoming It is also a name given to a political scandal in the 1920s about this oil reserve President Warren G Harding let the reserve and a reserve in California be under the control of the Department of the Interior Secretary of the Interior Albert Fall who had taken 100000 or 773341559 from oil companies then let oil companies use the land The United States Senate looked into the matter and found Fall had committed conspiracy It is thought to be one of the biggest political scandals in American history 

An air door or air curtain is a machine used for separating two spaces from each other The machine is mainly used at doors into buildings The most common setup for air curtains is a downward facing blower fan placed over an opening Normally this opening is an door to a building The air curtain keeps flying insects out by making turbulence It also helps keep outside air out avoiding cold winds by mixing in warm air from the air curtain The fan must be powerful enough to generate a jet of air that can reach the floor

A phosphor is a chemical compound that produces light when it is exposed to ultraviolet rays Phosphors are used in fluorescent bulbs where they change the ultraviolet produced by the excited mercury to visible light They are also used in mercury vapor lamps They are used in fat televisions They can also be used to detect radiation

A neon lamp is a light bulb that can make many colors when Noble gasses are inside of the bulb For example helium would give a light yellow color and neon would make a red or orange color when an electric current is run in the tube It is normally used to make letters for signs Different gases make different colors Neon Lamps are used to make neon signs

The different colors neon lamps can make 

From left to right Helium Neon Argon Krypton and Xenon

A neon glow lamp is a little orange light bulb There is an electric current that flows between the two electrodes

A turbocharger or turbo is a gas compressor It is used for to force air into an internal combustion engine A turbocharger is a form of supercharger It increases the density of air entering the engine to create more power A turbocharger has the compressor powered by a turbine The turbine is driven by the exhaust gas from the engine It does not use a direct mechanical drive This helps improve the performance of the turbocharger 

Early builders of turbochargers called them as turbosuperchargers A supercharger is an air compressor used for forced air into an engine They thought that by adding a turbine to turn the supercharger it would yield a turbosupercharger The term was soon shortened to turbocharger This can now create some confusion The term turbosupercharged is sometimes used to refer to an engine that uses both a crankshaft driven supercharger and an exhaust driven turbocharger This is also called twincharging

Some companies such as Teledyne Continental Motors still use the term turbosupercharger to refer to their turbochargers

An engine creates power by burning a mixture of air and fuel The air and fuel and put into the cylinders to burn When they burn they push the piston down The piston turns the crankshaft and creates power For car engines this is measured horsepower

An engine that does not use a turbocharger or a supercharger is called a naturally aspirated or normally aspirated engine Normally when engine specifications are listed a note is only made if the engine use a turbocharger or supercharger Most car engines are naturally aspirated The power they can create is limited by the amount of air the pistons can pull into the cylinders

A turbocharger is a small fan pump that spins around a shaft The pump is driven by the pressure of the exhaust gas A turbocharger consists of a turbine and a compressor They are both mounted on the same shaft The turbine is a heat engine It converts exhaust heat and pressure to rotation This rotation is used to turn the compressor The compressor takes in the draws in the outside air It squeezes or compresses the air It then sends the air to the engine Because the air pressure has been increased more air and fuel may be put into the cylinders This is sometimes called boost pressureWith more fuel to burn the engine can create more power This increases the horsepower of the engine

The engine can be damaged if the air pressure in the cylinders gets too high If there is too much exhaust gas sent to the turbine the compressor can create too much pressure To stop this from happening a wastegate is used The wastegate will limit amount of exhaust gas sent to the turbine

The turbocharger was invented by Swiss engineer Alfred Bchi His patent was applied for use in 1905 Diesel ships and locomotives with turbochargers began appearing in the 1920s

During the First World War French engineer Auguste Rateau fitted turbochargers to Renault engines powering various French fighters with some success

In 1918 General Electric engineer Sanford Moss attached a turbocharger to a Liberty aircraft engine The engine was tested at Pikes Peak in Colorado at convert14000ftm The test was to show that the turbo could add the power airplanes lose at high altitude Internal combustion engines lose power because at high altitude the outside air pressure is low Less air and fuel can be drawn into the engine

Turbochargers were first used in production aircraft engines in the 1930s 

The first turbocharged diesel truck was built by the Swiss Machine Works Saurer in 1938 The first production turbocharged automobile engines came from General Motors in 1962 The Oldsmobile Cutlass Jetfire was fitted with a Garrett AiResearch turbocharger and the Chevrolet Corvair Monza Spyder with a TRW turbocharger 

In 1974 at Paris Auto Show Porsche displayed the 911Turbo This was during the height of the oil crisis The 911Turbo was the first production sports car with exhaust turbocharger and pressure regulator The pressure regulator was the wastegate The first production turbo diesel automobiles were the Mercedes 300SD with a Garrett turbocharger and the Peugeot 604 Both were introduced in 1978 Today most automotive diesels are turbocharged

The first successful turbocharged racing engine appears to have been in 1952 Fred Agabashian in a diesel powered Cummins Special qualified for the pole position at the Indianapolis 500 He led for convert175mikm Then the turbo was damaged by tire debree Offenhausers turbocharged engines first came to Indianapolis in 1966 Their first victorie came in 1968 using a Garrett AiResearch turbocharger Turbocharged cars dominated the 24 Hours of Le Mans between 1976 and 1988 and then from 2000 2007

Formula One had a Turbo Era from F11977 until F11989 Engines with a capacity of 1500 cc could produce as much as 1500 hp In 1977 Renault was the first to use turbocharged engines F1 The performance made up for the high cost Other engine manufacturers started building turbos The turbocharged engines took over the F1 field They ended the Ford Cosworth DFV era in the mid 1980s the FIA decided that turbochargers were making the sport too dangerous and expensive In 1987 the FIA decided to limit the maximum boost of the turbos In 1989 turbochargers were banned completely

World Rally Car racers have long preferred turbocharged engines They offer a very high power to weight ratios Turbo power started to rise to the levels of F1 cars The FIA did not ban turbos They restrict the turbo power by limiting the inlet diameter

Some engines use two turbochargers They will both be the same size They are normally smaller than used on single turbos engines They are often used on V type engines such as V6s and V8s Each turbo is powered by a separate exhaust pipe from the engine Because they are smaller they reach their optimal boost more quickly This setup of turbos is normally called a parallel twin turbo system The first production car with parallel twin turbochargers was the Maserati Biturbo of the early 1980s 

Some car builders aviod turbo lag by using two small turbos The normal setup is to have one turbo working all the time The seconds turbo will only start working at higher RPM Because the turbos are smaller they do not have as much turbo lag The second turbo will be able get to full speed before it is required This setup is normally called a sequential twin turbo Porsche first used this technology in 1985 in the Porsche 959

Turbocharging is very common on diesel engines in automobiles trucks locomotives ships and heavy machinery Diesels are particularly suitable for turbochargers for several reasons

Using turbochargers to increase performance was very appealing to the Japanese builders in the 1980s The first example of a turbocharged motorcycle is the 1978 Kawasaki Z1R TC It used a Rayjay ATP turbo kit to build 035 bar of boost This raised the power up from convert90hpabbron to convert105hpabbron It was only slightly faster than the standard model Several other motorcycles were built with turbos Turbo applications for motorcycles increased their price The small gains in performance were not worth the extra cost Since the mid 1980s no manufactures have produced turbocharged motorcycles

A natural use of the turbocharger is with aircraft engines As an aircraft climbs to higher altitudes the pressure of the surrounding air quickly decreases A turbocharger fixes this problem by compressing the air to higher pressures 

Compressing the air increases its temperature This causes several problems Increased temperatures can lead to engine knock because of increased cylinder head temperatures Hot air cannot burn as much fuel as cold air This will decrease the power produced 

The common method of dealing with the hotter air is to cool it The most common way is to use an inter cooler or after cooler These coolers reduce the temperature of the air before it enters the engine 

Modern turbocharged aircraft usually do not need to cool the incoming air Their turbochargers are generally small and the pressures created are not very high Thus the air temperature is not increased very much

To run a supercharger it needs to take away some power from the engine The power it adds is more than the power it uses A turbocharger is uses the exhaust gases This is heat energy that would be wasted 

Turbochargers can be damaged by dirty or poor oil Most manufacturers recommend more frequent oil changes for turbocharged engines The turbocharger will heat when running Many recommend letting the engine idle for several minutes before shutting the engine off This gives the turbo time to cool down This will increase the life of the turbo

 Turbo lag  The time required for the turbo to build up the needed pressure is called turbo lag This is noticed as a hesitation in engine response This is caused by the time taken for the exhaust system to speed up the turbine The directly driven compressor in a supercharger does not have from this problem 

Lag can be reduced by using lighter parts This allows the turbine to start faster Other mechanical changes can reduce turbo lag but at an increase in cost

The Song Thrush is a member of the passerine songbird family Turdidae It breeds across much of Eurasia It is also known in English dialects as throstle or mavis The Song Thrush has brown upperparts and black spotted cream or buff underparts and has three recognised subspecies Its distinctive song which has repeated musical phrases has frequently been referred to in poetry 

The Song Thrush breeds in forests gardens and parks and is partially migratory with many birds wintering in southern Europe North Africa and the Middle East it has also been introduced into New Zealand and Australia Although it is not threatened globally there have been serious population declines in parts of Europe probably due to changes in farming practices 

The Song Thrush builds a neat mud lined cup nest in a bush or tree and lays four or five dark spotted blue eggs It is omnivorous and has the habit of using a favourite stone as an anvil on which to smash snails Like other perching birds it is affected by external and internal parasites and is vulnerable to predation by cats and birds of prey

The female Song Thrush builds a neat cup shaped nest lined with mud and dry grass in a bush tree or creeper or in the case of the Hebridean subspecies on the ground She lays four or five bright glossy blue eggs which are lightly spotted with black or purple Two or three broods in a year is normal although only one may be raised in the north of the range

On average 546 of British juveniles survive the first year of life and the adult annual survival rate is 622 The typical lifespan is three years but the maximum recorded age is 10 years 8 months

The Song Thrush is occasionally a host of parasitic cuckoos but this is very rare because the thrush usually recognizes the cuckoos non mimetic eggs However the Song Thrush does not demonstrate the same aggression toward the adult Cuckoo that is shown by the Blackbird The introduced birds in New Zealand where the cuckoo does not occur have over the past 130 years retained the ability to recognise and reject non mimetic eggs

The Song Thrush is omnivorous eating a wide range of invertebrates especially earthworms and snails as well as soft fruit and berries Like its relative the Blackbird the Song Thrush finds animal prey by sight has a run and stop hunting technique on open ground and will rummage through leaf litter seeking potential food items 

Snails are especially important when drought or hard weather makes it difficult to find other food The thrush often uses a favourite stone as an anvil on which to smash the snail before extracting the soft body and invariably wiping it on the ground before consumption Young birds initially flick objects and attempt to play with them until they learn to use anvils as tools to smash snails The nestlings are mainly fed on animal food such as worms slugs snails and insect larvae

Turmeric is a spice widely used in Asian cooking It is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant in the ginger family Zingiberaceae

Turmeric plants are widely grown in tropical areas of India where over 70000 acres are cultivated every year The plant has long leaves surrounding spikes where small flowers form However the root or rhizome of the turmeric plant is harvested in much the same way as ginger The turmeric rhizome takes about 10 months to grow before it can be harvested it is then boiled cleaned and dried in the sun Most of the harvested turmeric is ground up and sold in jars for use in cooking however the fresh root turmeric can also be used 

Turmeric is one of the main ingredients of curry powder and is used to give it the characteristic yellow colour It is also delicious added to rice dishes seafood and mustards and pickles  Turmeric is also more widely used as a colourant for textiles and food products It is sometimes substituted for saffron as it is much less expensive but produces the same yellow colour Turmeric has also been used as an alternative to medicine and can be made into a drink to treat colds and stomach complaints

Peter Bakovic is a retired former professional ice hockey left wing who played briefly in the National Hockey League in the late 1980s for the Vancouver Canucks

Bakovic played his junior hockey for the Windsor Spitfires of the Ontario Hockey League but was never drafted After a strong final year of junior he was signed as a free agent by the Calgary Flames in 1985 A tough player who fought often Bakovic spent three seasons playing minor pro in the Flames system without seeing an NHL game In two years with the Moncton Golden Flames of the AHL he lead the team in penalty minutes both years but also posted good offensive totals notching 54 and 51 points In his only year with the Salt Lake Golden Eagles Bakovic posted 43 points in 39 games along with 221 PIM

Late in the 198788 season he was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks Vancouver immediately promoted him to their NHL team and he played 10 games for the Canucks recording 2 goals and 48 PIM However injuries struck the next year and he found himself back in the IHL with the Milwaukee Admirals Bakovic would play three more seasons in Milwaukee without seeing another NHL game before retiring in 1991

Following his retirement Bakovic stayed in Milwaukee and remained with the Admirals organization as an assistant coach until 1998 He continues to reside in Milwaukee and coaches high school hockey

A V6 engine often just called a V6 is an internal combustion engine with six cylinders The engine has three cylinders on each side called banks The two banks form a V shaped angle In most engines the two banks are at a right angle or less to each other All six pistons turn a common crankshaft It is the second most common engine design in modern cars after the inline four It can be powered by different types of fuels including gasoline diesel natural gas and alcohol

The V6 is a very compact engine design It is shorter than the straight 4 Many V6 engines are narrower than the V8 engine They work well and are well suited to the popular transverse engine front wheel drive cars It has largely replaced the inline 6 which is too long to fit in many modern cars It is more complicated and not as smooth as the inline 6 The V6 is more compact more rigid and less prone to vibrations It is also becoming a high performance engine It has high power and torque output like the classic V8 but has good fuel economy

Some of the first V6 cars were built in 1905 by the Marmon Motor Car Company

The first series production V6 was introduced by Lancia in 1950 Other builders soon started using V6 engines In 1959 General Motors built a heavy duty 305 in3 60 V6 for use in their pickup trucks and Chevrolet Suburban The engine was later enlarged to 478 in3 for heavy truck and bus use

In 1962 the Buick Special offered a 90 V6 with uneven firing intervals Consumers did not like this engine because of the vibration 

Due to the odd number of cylinders in each bank V6 designs are unbalanced whatever V angle they use Each bank in a V6 has an odd number of pistons The V6 has an end to end rocking motion Counterweights on the crankshaft and a counter rotating balancer shaft compensate for some of the rocking motion 

The Lancia V6 in 1950 used a 60 angle between the cylinder banks and a six throw crankshaft to achieve equally spaced firing intervals of 120 This still has some balance and secondary vibration problems The first Buick V6 was a 90 based on their 90 V8 This produced a rough running design This was unacceptable to many customers Later designs have improved the engine and made it reasonably smooth

The most efficient cylinder bank angle for a V6 is 60 degrees This makes the smallest size engine and reduces vibration 60 V6 engines are not as well balanced Modern design has reduced most of the vibration 60 degree V6 engines do not need balance shafts This design works well in larger cars where four cylinder engines do not have enough power

Some 90 V6 engines are built They are usually based on V8 engines It takes little work to change a V8 into a V6 engine The problem is these engines are wider and have more vibration than a 60 V6 More modern 90 V6 engine designs avoid vibration problems by changing the crankshafts design and firing timing Balancing shafts are often used to remove the remaining vibration 

120 could be thought of as the natural angle for a V6 Each cylinder fires a power stroke every 120 of crankshaft rotation This allows pairs of pistons to share crank pins Unlike the V8 there is no way to arrange a V6 to balance the piston forces Because of the odd number of cylinders in each bank a balance shaft is needed

The 120 design also creates a very wide engine It is too wide for most cars It is often used in race cars Race cars are designed around the engine and vibration is not as important The flat 6 boxer engine is only slightly wider than the 120 V6 and it is fully balanced

When the fuel in a cylinder is burned it pushes the piston down and creates power This is often referred to as firing 

Many early V6 engines were based on V8 engine designs This made a firing pattern with groups of two cylinders with an odd firing order This resulting in rough running engines with unpleasant vibrations at certain engine speeds

More modern 90 V6 engines avoid this problem They use a split crank pin where the piston connects to the crankshaft This makes an even 120 firing pattern A split crank pin is weaker than a straight one Modern metallurgical techniques can produce a crankshaft that is strong enough to not break

The V6 engine was introduced into racing by Lancia in the early 1950s They had some good results Then Ferrari built the Dino V6 Alfredo Ferrari the son of Enzo Ferrari was nicknamed Dino He suggested building a 15 litre V6 engine for Formula Two racing The Dino V6 was updated several times and increased to a 24 litre engine The Dino V6 was used in the Ferrari 246 Formula One car in 1958

Laverda showed a 996 cc V6 engined motorcycle at the 1977 Milan show The motorcycle was raced in the 1978 Bol dOr 24 hour race

The notochord is a flexible rod shaped body found in embryos of all chordates It forms the axis of the embryo In some chordates it persists throughout life as the main support down the length of the body In most vertebrates it is replaced by the vertebral column The notochord is found ventral the neural tube 

Notochords were the first backbones serving as support structures in chordates Notochords were advantageous to primitive fish ancestors because they were a rigid structure for muscle attachment yet flexible enough to allow movement Embryos of vertebrates have notochords today as embryonic development often follows a pattern similar to the ancestral evolution of the modern animals traits

Hamish MacCunn was a Scottish composer and conductor who lived in the later part of the romantic period

He was born in Greenock His father was a shipowner He soon showed a great talent for music In 1883 he got a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Music which had only just been founded His teachers there included Sir Hubert Parry and Sir Charles Villiers Stanford 

MacCunn became a professor of harmony at the Royal Academy of Music from 1888 1894 He also taught at the Guildhall School of Music

MacCunn composed several orchestral works as well as operas but he had to spend more and more time conducting in order to earn money For a time he conducted the Carl Rosa Opera Company He conducted Wagners opera Siegfried and the first performance in English of Tristan and Isolde

In 1887 he conducted his overture The Land of the Mountain and the Flood at the Crystal Palace This was a very successful piece and it remains the only composition of his which is still often performed The music has a Scottish feeling and sounds quite similar to the music of Mendelssohn Although he composed other pieces which were similar in mood none of them were as successful as this one

In 1888 he married Alison Pettie daughter of the painter John Pettie who had painted MacCunns portrait several times They had one son John Pettie liked music and helped MacCunn in his career by organizing concerts of his music

He died aged only 48

Dimethylmercury sometimes called dimethyl mercury is a chemical compound It contains methyl and mercury ions Its chemical formula is2Hg 

It is a colorless liquid It evaporates very fast It is a very strong toxin to the nervous system It doesnt react with water like other similar chemicals It contains mercury in its 2 oxidation state It can react with mercury chloride to make a crystalline chemical compound

It is made by reacting a sodium amalgam with methyl iodide 

It has almost no uses It is rarely used to test instruments that are used to detect mercury

It is extremely toxic If just a drip gets placed on human skin it will poison the person It gets into the brain easily when it goes through the skin The poisoning does not happen quickly though It sometimes can take months before the poisoning effects show

Methyl is an ion It is made by removing one of the hydrogen atoms from an atom of methane It is an organic ion Its chemical formula is CH3 It bonds with other ions such as hydroxide to make chemical compounds The bonding with hydroxide makes methanol If it bonds with mercury it makes dimethylmercury

The idea behind Inception was first developed over nine years before it was released In 2001 Nolan wrote an 80 page treatment about dream stealers presenting the idea to Warner Bros At first the story was written as a heist film based on ideas of lucid dreaming and dream incubation  Because Nolan wanted to have more experience working with big scale films he chose to work on Batman Begins The Prestige and The Dark Knight He spent six months polishing up the script for Inception before Warner Bros purchased it in February 2009 Filming spanned six countries and four continents beginning in Tokyo on June 19 2009 and finishing in Canada in late November of the same year Composer Hans Zimmer wrote the music for the film 

Inception was officially budgeted at 160 million a cost which was shared between Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures Nolans success with The Dark Knight helped gain the film 100 million to spend on advertising Inception was first screened in London on July 8 2010 and was shown in standard and IMAX theatres on July 14 2010 The film had a lot of positive reviews and earned over 21 million on its opening day and 627 million in the first weekend

Methyl iodide is a chemical compound It is made of methyl and iodide ions Its chemical formula is CH3I

It is a liquid that evaporates easily When it is exposed to light it turns purple because of iodine This can be stopped by keeping it with copper It breaks down when heated to make carbon dioxide carbon monoxide and hydrogen iodide 

It is made by reacting iodine red phosphorus and methanol all at the same time Phosphorus iodide is formed during the reaction Another way to make it is to react methanol with potassium iodide and some sulfuric acid 

It is used to add methyl to some organic compounds It can also be used as a pesticide It is used to make dimethylmercury and other chemicals

It causes nausea and dizziness when breathed It can cause burns when put on skin 

Phosphorus iodide also known as phosphorus triiodide is a chemical compound It is made of phosphorus and iodide ions It contains phosphorus in its 3 oxidation state Its chemical formula is PI3

It is a red solid It is very unstable and a powerful reducing agent It reacts violently with water The reaction with water makes phosphorous acid and hydrogen iodide It is used in making chemicals Some think that it is too unstable to be stored but it can be stored and can be bought 

Phosphorus iodide is made by reacting iodine with white phosphorus dissolved in carbon disulfide It is dissolved in carbon disulfide because it does not dissolve in water It can also be made by reacting phosphorus chloride with hydrogen iodide or some other iodide

It reacts with alcohols such as methanol to make alkyl iodides such as methyl iodide Many times phosphorus iodide is made in the reaction The alkyl iodides are used in many chemical reactions

Carbon disulfide also known as carbon bisulfide is a chemical compound It consists of carbon and sulfide ions It contains carbon in its 4 oxidation state and sulfur in its 2 oxidation state Its chemical formula is CS2

It is similar to carbon dioxide although much more reactive Sulfide is a much more powerful reducing agent than oxide It burns very easily and catches fire at 90C It smells sweet but is often contaminated other chemicals that smell bad 

It used to be made by reacting carbon and sulfur at a very high temperature Now it is made by burning methane in sulfur It is much harder to burn methane in sulfur The waste product is also much more reactive than carbon dioxide the normal waste product

It is used to make carbon tetrachloride It is also used in making organic chemicals It is used to dissolve things like phosphorus and iodine and to kill insects 

Carbon disulfide is very flammable and is also toxic in large amounts when breathed in

The term Atlantic economy refers to the trading of goods across the Atlantic Ocean It usually refers to the period of colonization in the Americas from 1492 to 1815 The triangular trade was an important part of the Atlantic economy During this time countries such as Britain Spain and France had colonies in the Americas and Africa The Atlantic economy was tied into the idea of mercantilism which thought it was a good idea for European countries to have a lot of colonies that traded only with them Goods that were traded in the Atlantic economy were rum slaves sugar tobacco gold spices fish lumber and manufactured goods Some of the major cities that were into the Atlantic economy were London Liverpool Boston New York Philadelphia Charleston Cap Francais and Nassau

Chemiluminescence is a kind of Luminescence and is a process of making light from a chemical reaction The light made in Chemiluminiscence is not directly related to heat A simple two step example of a reaction of A and B that produces C D and Light

Where C is an excited state of C This Reaction is simplier then most chemiluminesence reactions The excited state in chemiluminescence happens when electrons in higher orbitals are made from a chemical reaction The excited state is less stable then the ground state this causes the electrons in the excited state to fall to the ground state The excited state is normally not stable because it is higher in energy to become more stable the electron drops to the ground state this extra energy between the two states is radiated in the from of light Chemiluminescence in biological systems and is also named bioluminescence The amount of measurable light made is called Radiant Intensity ICL and is a term used to place a number value on the observed results The Radiant Intensity is related the rate of the reaction and the Quantum Yield 

The device needed to measure the light made is simple and needs something to hold the sample and a photomultiplier tube There are three ways for this to be used in chemical measurements sometimes the product wanted makes light when it reacts with another compound in another type the amount of light made drops when the wanted product is added and an sometimes the wanted product when added to a chemiluminescence reaction makes more light

Analysis of Gases

The method was made because it can measure small amounts of compound that are atmospheric pollutants one of the most used methods measures the amount of nitrogen monoxide by reacting it with ozone The light made has a wavelength range of 600 to 2800 nm

Analysis of liquids

Luminol is the most well known type of compound used for chemiluminescence in liquids 

Analysis of cellular species

Ca2 inside of different parts of cells like the mitochondria can make light when it reacts with a protein from jellyfish named aequorin Nitric oxide is in cells and is a way for cells to talk to each other this can be measured with the compound luminol

The Turn of the Screw is an opera by Benjamin Britten It is a chamber opera The story is based on a story with the same title by Henry James The libretto were written by Myfanwy Piper The story of the opera is almost exactly the same as in Henry Jamess book  Britten was asked by the Venice Biennale to write the opera It was first performed on 14 September 1954 at the Teatro La Fenice Venice Its first performance in Britain took place a month later on 6 October 1954 at Sadlers Wells Opera in London

The opera is divided into two acts It is further divided into a prologue and sixteen scenes Before each scene starts we hear a variation on the Screw theme This theme is based on twelve notes which are all the 12 notes in the octave This is called twelve tone row but it is tonally based There are only 13 players in the orchestra

The prologue is just for a solo singer and piano He tells us about a young governess he once knew who looked after two children at Bly House The childrens parents were dead and they were supposed to be cared for by their uncle The uncle who lived in London was far too busy to care for them and he hired a governess for them He told the governess that she must never write to him about the children She must make any decisions about them herself She must never ask him about the history of Bly House and she must always continue to care for the children

The Governess wonders what the children will be like The children wonder what their new governess will be like When the Governess arrives at Bly House she is greeted by the housekeeper Mrs Grose and the children who She thinks that the boy Miles looks strangely familiar Miles goes to a boarding school but he has come home for the holidays A letter from his school arrives saying that he has been expelled because he had been threatening other children The Governess is sure that Miles like his sister Flora is too kind and innocent to have done such terrible things Mrs Grose also thinks the same thing The Governess decides not to take any notice of the letter

The Governess sings about her wonderful position at the house and the beautiful children she has in her care But at night she hears strange footsteps and a cry outside her door Suddenly she sees a pale faced man sitting on a tower of the house When the man disappears she becomes frightened and wonders if she has seen a ghost But then she is comforted when she hears the children singing the nursery rhyme Tom Tom the Pipers Son The Governess doubts that she saw anything but decides to tell Mrs Grose The housekeeper tells the Governess about Peter Quint who used to be a servant at Bly House What Mrs Grose says seems to suggest that Quint had done nasty things to Miles At that time Miles had a governess called Miss Jessel Mrs Grose suggests that Quint had a sexual relationship with Miss Jessell and that they both had sexual relations with the children The housekeeper said she could do nothing about it as Quint cleverly found any letters that came for her and he threatened her with physical harm But when Miss Jessel became pregnant and people found out how bad she was she abandoned the children and ran away Soon afterwards she died Shortly after that Quint died a mysterious death on an icy road near Bly House 

The next morning the Governess is teaching Miles Latin when he goes into a trance like state and sings a song which shows that Quint had abused him

Later that day the Governess sits by the side of a lake with Flora Flora names the seas of the world finishing with the Dead Sea Flora compares the Dead Sea to Bly House This worries the Governess As Flora plays on the shore with her doll the Governess suddenly sees a strange woman across the lake who seems to be watching Flora It is the ghost of Miss Jessel who has returned to get Flora The Governess hurries Flora home to safety

That night Miles and Flora slip out into the woods to meet Miss Jessel and Peter Quint The children fantasize about a world where dreams come true The Governess and Mrs Grose arrive as the children are about to be possessed and the spirits depart Miles sings a song about how he has been a bad boy

The ghosts of Peter Quint and Miss Jessel reappear They argue about who harmed whom first when they were alive and accuse one another of not acting quickly enough to possess the children In her room the Governess worries about the evil she feels in the house

The next morning the family goes to church The children sing a song which sounds like a song praising God Mrs Grose does not realize the meaning of the song until the Governess tells her they are singing about horrors The Governess runs off and goes to her room She can feel the presence of Miss Jessel and sees her sitting at her desk The Governess now knows that she cannot abandon the children She writes to the childrens uncles saying that she must see him 

When the Governess asks Miles what happened at school Quints voice is heard Miles shrieks and the candle goes out Miles is tempted by Quint to pick up the letter He steals it and rushes off Miles distracts the grown ups attention by playing the piano so they do not notice Flora going off to the lake Mrs Grose and the Governess find Flora by the lake The Governess tries to make Flora say that she can see Mrs Jessel but she shouts that she cant see anybody Mrs Grose takes her home 

In the last scene Flora has become mad Mrs Grose tells the Governess that her letter to the uncle must have been stolen She asks Miles whether he stole it He denies it but all the time he can see Peter Quint who is telling him he must not tell them the truth about him In the end Miles screams Peter Quint You devil and then dies The Governess is left holding the dead boy in her arms

The instruments used in the orchestra are 2 violins viola cello double bass flutealto flutepiccolo harp oboecor anglais piano celesta and percussion 

Demonic possession is a term used to describe a situation when a demon controls a human being In many cultures and religions people often used to believe that a devil could enter the body of a person and control them They often thought this was happening when a person seemed to be mad or when they had a fit or when they fainted

Cosworth is a high performance engineering company It was founded in London in 1958 It builds engines and electronics for automobile racing mainstream automotive and defence industries Cosworth is based in Northampton England It has North American facilities in Torrance California Indianapolis Indiana and Mooresville North Carolina It also has a facility in Pune India

Cosworth has had a long and well respected career in Formula One beginning in 1963 Cosworth stepped away from Formula One for three years when no team deceided to use their engines for F12007 Cosworth returned to F1 in F12010 suppling engines to Williams HST Lotus and Virgin The first Formula One engines shipped in January Cosworths 176 wins make it the second most successful engine manufacturers in F1 after Ferrari

The company was founded as a British racing internal combustion engine maker in 1958 by Mike Costin and Keith Duckworth The name Cosworth came by combining their last names Even thought it was an independent company it was supported by the Ford Motor Company for many years Most of the Cosworth engines were named Ford engines

The company went through a several ownership changes The business was growing Keith Duckworth did not want to run the day to day business 

Cosworth was sold to United Engineering Industries in 1980 Duckworth remained as president for life and technical involvement with Cosworth He became a UEI board director UEI was a group of small to medium sized technology companies 

UEI was taken over by Carlton Communications in 1988 Carlton wanted some of the audio visual companies that were part of UEI Cosworth was a poor fit so Carlton sold the Cosworth part off 

In 1990 Cosworth was sold to Vickers a British engineering company 

In 1998 Cosworth was sold to Audi which is a part of Volkswagen Hours later Audi sold the Cosworth Racing division to Ford

In September 2004 Ford announced that it was selling Cosworth along with Cosworth Racing Ltd and its Jaguar Formula One team On 15 November 2004 the sale of Cosworth was completed to Champ Car World Series owners Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven They are the current owners of the Cosworth Group

The road car engine division of Cosworth was re named Cosworth Technology It was sold to MAHLE in 2005 Cosworth Technology was then renamed as MAHLE Powertrain on 1 July 2005

Cosworth has had a long relationship with the Ford Motor Company This started when Cosworth started building racing engines in 1959 These engines were modified versions of the convert1000cc1lkon Inline four Ford Kent engine for Formula Junior Cosworth built a convert1340cc1 engine for the Lotus 7 convert1500cc1 and convert1600cc1 engines were were built use in Formula B sports car racing and the Lotus Cortina The final version of the Cosworth Kent in 1965 was the MAE It was used in Formula 3 when convert1000cc1 engines were allowed This was the dominate engine

The Cortina engine was also the basis for the FVA a Formula Two engine introduced in 1966 This engine featured dual overhead camshafts with 16 valves It produced at least convert225bhpkWlkon at 9000 rpm This engine dominated the category until 1971 It was also used in sports car racing as the FVC The FVA was part of the same Ford contract that gave rise to the DFV

A larger engine was built for endurance racing in the mid 1970s The FVC displaced convert1976cc1lkon The FVC produced only convert275bhpkWlkon

In 1966 Colin Chapman of Lotus Cars was the founder and principal of Team Lotus He got Ford to finance Keith Duckworths design for a new lightweight 30 litre Formula One engine Cosworth received the order along with 100000 from Ford The contract told Duckworth to build a four cylinder Ford based F2 engine to prove it would work After that a pure Cosworth V8 would be built The DFV design used a similar cylinder head to the one on the FVA engine wih custom cylinder block and crankcase This created the legendary DFV  literally meaning Double Four Valve This engine and its version were used for a quarter of a century It was the most successful engine in the history of Formula One Grand Prix motor racing With 167 winning races it put Cosworth Engineering on the map Although designed for Formula One the engine has been modified for use in many other areas

The DFV won on its first outing at the 1967 Dutch Grand Prix Jim Clark drove a Lotus 49 with the DFV engine Starting in 1968 any F1 team could purchase the engine During the 1970s it was common for almost the entire field to use one of the DFV engines Ferrari never used a Cosworth engine Most teams just built a car around a Cosworth DFV and a Hewland gearbox It won a record 155 World Championship races The last was the Detroit Grand Prix in 1983 in a Tyrrell driven by Michele Alboreto

The DFV with 410 horsepower did not produce as much power as some of its rival 12 cylinder engines It was lighter resulting in a better power to weight ratio It was also a structural part of the car

The DFY introduced in 1982 was upgrade of the DFV for Formula One with 520 horsepower While it produced more power it no match for the turbocharged cars of the day It was the advent of turbocharged engines which ended the use of the DFY In 1986 Cosworth returned to the lower levels of racing They modified the DFV for the newly created Formula 3000 The DFV remained in F3000 until 1992 

In Formula One a new DFV based design was introduced for the new rules in F11987 35 litre normally aspirated engines were allowed In 1988 Cosworth built the DFR which was used in F1 by the smaller teams until 1991 It scored its last points in 1990

The DFV is still being used in Classic F1 racing The FIA given them World Championship status in 2004

One of the most successful and longest lived projects of Cosworth has been its CART Champ Car engine program In 1975 Cosworth developed the DFX engine A turbocharged 265 litre engine the DFX became the standard engine to run in IndyCar racing It ending the reign of the Offenhauser and maintaining that position until the late 1980s 

While designed as an F1 engine the DFV was also used as in endurance racing Its design led to vibrations putting stress on devices surrounding the engine It was hard on the exhaust system The first sports car to use a DFV failed to finish a single race because of repeated breakdowns The DFV did win the 24 hours of Le Mans twice in its original 30 litre form A special endurance version the DFL was then developed The 33 litre was reliable The 40 litre was largely remembered as a failure

A variant of the Ford Essex engine was developed for the Ford Capris The Capris were raced in Group 2 in the early 1970s This engine had a displacement of 34 L The GA was also used in the last few years of Formula 5000 in Europe

The FBA and FBC engines were found in the Ford Granada and Ford Scorpio Ultima The FBA came first in 1991 and was also known as the BOA It was based on the Ford Cologne V6 It was a twin overhead camshaft with 24 valves and produced 192 horsepower In was updated 1995 to produce 201 horsepower This engine was known as the BOB

A racing version was also available for a short time The FBE had with individual throttle butterflies for each cylinder The FBB and FBD engines were developed but never released

Cosworth increased its work with Ford in 1969 Cosworth developed a double overhead camshaft 16 valve inline four cylinder engine for road use in the European Ford Escort Working from the Kent block Cosworth created a 16 Litre engine for homologation purposes The camshafts were driven by a toothed timing belt The name BDA came from Belt Drive A type Running in Group 2 and Group 4 on either rallying or touring car racing this engine could be enlarged to 20 litres The standard 16 L engine could be used in cars competing overall wins not just first in class

In 1970 the BDC version received fuel injection In 1972 the 18 L BDA series was being used in Formula 2 In 1973 it went to 198 L as the BDG engine The BDG also had an aluminum engine block

Other versions of the engine were made for Formula Atlantic in 1970 and SCCA club racing and sports car racing A 17 L BDR version was built in the 1980s A 18 L BDT was built for the Escort RS1700T and the Ford RS2000

A 214 L version was developed by Brian Hart just as Group B was canceled by the FIA The Hart 420R owes much to the BDA series It is basically an aluminum block version with similar cylinder heads

In 1970 Ford asked Weslake and Co to build the BDA Engine for them and by the end of 1970 the production line had been installed at Rye and production was under way

The YB series of 20 L engines are based on the older Pinto engine block They were introduced in the road going Ford Sierra RS Cosworth in 1986 with 201 horsepower Racing versions could develop about 400 horsepower A limited edition version was introduced in 1987 The RS500 could produce 550 horsepower in full racing setup 

The YB series engine was replace in 1997 with the Zetec engine design

Cosworth tested turbocharged BD version They finally built an all new turbocharged 15 L V6 engine This engine was badged the Ford TEC Inside Cosworth it was known as the GB series This engine had a long development history It only raced only for a short time In was used by the Haas Lola team in F11986 and the Benetton Formula team in F11987

The final replacement for the DFVDFZDFR series was the 35 L HB V8 engine It was used by the Benetton team midway through 1989 It won the Japanese Grand Prix that year This engine had a narrower v angle than the DFV 

As the works team Benetton was the only team to use this model through the rest of F11989 and F11990 In F11991 customer units became available The customer engines did not have all the updates the works engines did In 1991 these engines were supplied to the new Jordan Grand Prix team In 1992 they went to Team Lotus 1993 saw McLaren added to the customer engine deal McLaren won five Grands Prix with Ayrton Senna that year A new Cosworth unit badged as a Ford Zetec R was built in 1994 That year Michael Schumacher won the Drivers World Championship with Benetton This was the last Ford powered F1 title

A Jaguar badged version of the HB was used for a short time in sports car racing with the Jaguar XJR 14 Cosworth also developed a 72 V10 engine for the Sauber Formula One team It was baged as a Ford engine 

Cosworth has made several 30 L V10 engines for other Formula One teams The Stewart Grand Prix team basically became the Ford works team They used Cosworth CR 1 engines from their first season in 1997 Stewart became Jaguar Racing which became Red Bull Racing They used Cosworth V10 engines until 2006 Minardi also used re badged Cosworth engines until 2005

Williams began using the new CA2006 Cosworth V8 engines for the 2006 season In the same year Scuderia Toro Rosso used detuned V10 engines based on the 2005 units 

In 2007 Williams and Scuderia Torro Rosso both switched to other engines This left Cosworth out of Formula one for three years Honda left F1 in December 2008 This lead to Cosworth being selected to provide a standard engine to any interested team Teams could purchase entire engines or build their own from the Cosworth designs

In 2010 Cosworth returned as the engine supplier for Williams They also supplied three new teams Hispania Racing Lotus Racing and Virgin Racing The CA2010 is the same 24 litre V8 base of the CA2006 used by Williams It has been re tuned from 20000 rpm to the current 18000 rpm limit required on all engines The first engines were shipped to teams in mid January 2 weeks prior to first track testing for the year

Cosworth needed to replace the DFS engines used in IndyCar and Champ Car racing Cosworth designed the X series beginning in 1992 with the XB The XF was built for the 2000 season to replace the XD It was picked as the spec engine for the Champ Car World Series in 2003 The most recent version is the 265 litre XFE used through 2007 The Champ Car World Series set a rev limit of 12000 rpm The 2004 model of the XFE was rated at 750 horsepower for normal running It could produce 800 horsepower during the Push to Pass mode 

In mid 2003 Cosworth provided the 35L V8 XG badged as a Chevrolet Gen 4 engine to IRL IndyCar Series teams The XG finished 2nd in its first race at Michigan on 27 July 2003 Sam Hornish Jr went on to win 3 races that season with the new XG The XG was reduced in size to 3L for 2004 season It won one race in 2005 during Chevrolets final season in IRL

In 2007 the Ford name was removed from the XFE engine The Champ Car World Series merged into the Indy Racing League IndyCar Series prior to the 2008 season Cosworth does not currently provide engines to any American open wheel racing series

These are 300 horsepower 23 L inline four engines based on the Mazda MZR engine A detuned 250 horsepower version is sold to the consumer market This version is intended for club racers Both engines are built by Cosworth in Torrance California

Cosworth is best known in Europe for its relationship with Ford Cosworth is in the vehicle name on the high performance Ford Sierra RS Cosworth and Ford Escort RS Cosworth

In the United States Cosworth has also appeared in the name of a road car the Chevrolet Vega Only 3508 1975 and 1976 Cosworth Vegas were built The engine featured the Vega sleeveless aluminum alloy block fitted with forged components The twin cam 16 valve aluminum cylinder head design was assisted by Cosworth The engine featured electronic ignition electronic fuel injection and stainless steel headers The final US version produced 110 bhp Cosworths EA racing version was not successful due to engine block structural failures Projected sales of the Cosworth Vega had been 5000 The 1500 unused hand built Cosworth Vega engines were simply scrapped for lack of demand

Cosworth became involved with Mercedes Benz in the mid 1980s Mercedes Benz wanted to create a Group B rally car They turned to Cosworth to development the engine

Mercedes wanted a 320 bhp engine based on the 136 bhp Mercedes M102 23 litre 4 cylinder engine The task was given to Mike Hall who design the famed DFV and BDA engines Designed around the existing M102 engine its valves set a 45 angle rather than the 40 of the BDA The valves were the biggest that could be fitted into the combustion chamber Flat top pistons gave a 1051 compression ratio The new Cosworth WAA engine also was Cosworths first one piece head The camshaft carrier was cast with the head itself

Cosworth tried to design a full Formula One Grand Prix car in 1969 The car was designed by Robin Herd It used an new design of a 4WD transmission designed by Keith Duckworth This transmission was different from the Ferguson transmission used by all other 4WD F1 cars of the 1960s It was powered by a version of the DFV engine built out of magnesium The plan was to drive the car at the F11969 British Grand Prix Cosworth withdrew the car without any explanation Herd left Cosworth to form March Engineering The F1 car project was canceled The external design of the car was Herds use of Mallite sheeting Mallite is a product made from layers of wood and aluminum The Mallite was for the main structural monocoque sections This is a procedure he developed on the first McLaren single seat race cars including the McLaren M2B of 1966

Carbon tetrachloride also known as carbon tet or Freon 10 is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is CCl4 It contains carbon in its 4 oxidation state and chloride ions

It is a colorless liquid It smells like ether It evaporates quite quickly It can dissolve fats and oils as well as other stuff such as iodine It doesnt burn but it does make phosgene when heated to a high tempature 

It is made by reacting methane with chlorine This reaction is similar to the burning of methane Hydrogen chloride is a byproduct It used to be made by reacting carbon disulfide with chlorine This reaction would produce sulfur chloride 

The uses of carbon tetrachloride have been diminished lately because people think it might damage the ozone layer in the sky that removes ultraviolet rays from the earth Without ozone people would get skin cancer much more It was used as a fire extinguisher It was also used to make freon 

Carbon tetrachloride is very toxic to the liver and so is used to test for medicines that protect the liver It can cause cancer if one is exposed to it a lot 

Freon is a word for chemical refrigerants Thomas Midgley Jr invented using Freon as a refrigerant Freon is a registered trademark of DuPont Freon was first used to describe chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants but it is now used to describe almost any kind of refrigerant Refrigerants may contain carbon chlorine fluorine and sometimes bromine For example Freon 10 is carbon tetrachloride Many kinds of freon are not toxic to animalscn They also are cheap and work well However most refrigerants can reduce the amount of ozone from the upper atmosphere Reducing ozone lets more ultraviolet light to come through Too much ultraviolet light can cause skin cancer and cataracts and can kill off plankton in the oceans 

The chlorine part of CFC refrigerants can reduce ozone Hydrochlorofluorocarbons can also damage ozone Newer Hydrofulorocarbon refrigerants do not have chlorine in them and do not reduce ozone in the the atmosphere Most refrigerants also increase global warming because they are powerful greenhouse gasses These refrigerants increase global warming thousands of times more than carbon dioxide

A refrigerant is a chemical that is found in an air conditioner a refrigerator and in other refrigeration equipment Refrigerants can be a liquid or a vapor depending on their temperature and pressure Most refrigerants in their liquid state will evaporate very fast if at atmospheric pressure but this depends on the particular refrigerant and its particular boiling point Refrigerants in their vapor state are compressed by a compressor then cooled by a condenser where it condenses back into a liquid The refrigerant is very hot as it leaves the compressor The refrigerant then passes through a part called a metering device or an expansion device where the pressure is reduced to a point where the liquid begins to boil At this point the refrigerant is very cold and it enters an evaporator where it absorbs heat from the air passing over it By the time the refrigerant leaves the evaporator it is all a vapor again and it goes back to the compressor where the cycle begins again This is called the refrigeration cycle This is one example of the use of a refrigerant as in a residential air conditioning system

The 2010 Canterbury earthquake was a powerful 71 magnitude earthquake which struck the South Island of New Zealand at 435 am September 4 2010 local time It was centred 40 km west of Christchurch near the town of Darfield at a depth of 10 km Strong aftershocks were reported including ones of magnitude 53 The main quake was felt widely across the South Island and in the North Island as far north as New Plymouth

William Langland was an English poet He wrote a long and complicated poem called Piers Plowman The poem is an allegory about the struggle to lead a virtuous Christian life when the institution of the Church is often corrupt

We do not know for sure that this poem was written by Langland The strongest evidence we have is one manuscript which says that the poem was written by Willielmi de Langlond son of Stacy de Rokayle who died in Shipton under Wichwood a tenant of the Lord Spenser in the county of Oxfordshire Other manuscripts also name the author as Robert or William langland or Wilhelmus W Another piece of evidence is within the poem itself At one stage the narrator says I have lyved in londemy name is longe wille Scholars agree that this is a code for the poets name Longe Land and Wille meaning Will short for William This may seem unlikely but this method of hiding the poets name within a poem was used in Roman times and was quite common in late medieval literature

Avebury is the site of the largest ancient monument in Great Britain It consists of a large henge several stone circles stone avenues and barrows The main henge and stone circle surrounds the village of Avebury in the English county of Wiltshire 

Avebury is one of the finest and largest Neolithic monuments in Europe about 5000 years old Although older than the megalithic stages of Stonehenge convert32kmmi to the south the two monuments are products of the same culture 

At gbmappingSU10266996 Avebury is roughly midway between the towns of Marlborough and Calne just off the main A4 road Avebury is a Scheduled Ancient Monument a World Heritage Site and a National Trust property

On the World Heritage list Avebury and Stonehenge are listed together as Avebury Stonehenge and Associated Sites However Stonehenge is really a different site built at a different time

Most of the surviving structure is composed of earthworks known as the dykes consisting of a massive ditch and external bank henge Although the henge is not perfectly circular it has a diameter of about convert420myd 1 The only known comparable sites of similar date are only a quarter of the size of Avebury The ditch alone was 21 metres wide and 11 metres deep with a sample from its primary fill carbon dated to 3300  2630 BC 

Within the henge is a great outer circle This is one of Europes largest stone circles with a diameter of convert3316mft0 Britains largest stone circle It was either contemporary with or built around four or five centuries after the earthworks There were originally 98 sarsen standing stones some weighing in excess of 40 tons The stones varied in height from 36 to 42 m as exemplified at the north and south entrances The fill from two of the stoneholes has been carbon dated to between 2900 and 2600 BC

Nearer the middle of the monument are two additional separate stone circles The northern inner ring is convert98mft0 in diameter but only two of its four standing stones remain upright A cove of three stones stood in the middle its entrance facing northeast The southern inner ring was convert108mft0 in diameter before its destruction in the eighteenth century The remaining sections of its arc now lie beneath the village buildings A single large monolith convert55mft0 high stood in the centre along with an alignment of smaller stones

The West Kennet Avenue an avenue of paired stones leads from the southeastern entrance of the henge and traces of a second the Beckhampton Avenue lead out from the western entrance 

Findings of archaeological geophysics suggests that a timber circle of two concentric rings stood in the northeast sector of the outer circle This has not yet been confirmed by excavation A ploughed barrow is visible from the air in the northwestern quadrant 

The henge had four opposing entrances two on a north by northwest and south by southeast line and two on an east by northeast and west by southwest line

A henge is a Neolithic earthwork It has a ring bank and ditch with the ditch inside the bank They are not thought to be defensive For defence it would be much better to have the ditch outside the bank so attackers would need to climb up further Henges are typical of the British Isles but there are a few similar structures in continental Europe

Henges are divided into three types

The Carnac stones are the largest collection of megalithic standing stones in the world The more than 3000 prehistoric standing stones were cut from local rock and erected by the pre Celtic people of Brittany

The stones were erected at some stage during the Neolithic period probably around 3300 BC but some may be as old as 4500 BC The stones occur in a number of Neolithic sites around the French village of Carnac in Brittany They include rows of stones dolmens tumuli and single menhirs 

In recent centuries many of the sites have been neglected with reports of dolmens being used as sheep shelters chicken sheds or even ovens Stones have been removed to make way for roads or used as building materials The management of the sites is a controversial topic

There are three major groups of stone rows Mnec Kermario and Kerlescan which may have once formed a single group but have been split up as stones were removed for other purposes

Eleven converging rows of menhirs stretching for convert1165by100mftlkon There is what may be the remains of stone circles at either end According to the tourist office there is a cromlech containing 71 stone blocks at the western end and a very ruined cromlech at the eastern end The largest stones around convert4mft high are at the wider western end the stones then become as small as 06m high along the length of the alignment before growing in height again toward the extreme eastern end

This fan like layout recurs a little further along to the east in the Kermario alignment It consists of 1029 stones in ten columns about convert1300mftabbron in length A stone circle to the east end where the stones are shorter was revealed by aerial photography

A smaller group of 555 stones further to the east of the other two sites It is composed of 13 lines with a total length of about convert800mft ranging in height from convert80cmftinlkonabbron to convert4mftabbron At the extreme west where the stones are tallest there is a stone circle which has 39 stones There may also be another stone circle to the north

A much smaller group further east again of Kerlescan falling within the commune of La Trinit sur Mer These are now set in woods and most are covered with moss and ivy

There are several tumuli mounds of earth built up over a grave In this area they generally feature a passage leading to a central chamber which once held neolithic artefacts

The tumulus of Saint Michel was constructed between 5000 BC and 3400 BC At its base it is convert125by60mftabbron and is convert12mftlkoffabbron high It required convert35000m3cuydlkon of stone and earth Its function was the same as that of the pyramids of Egypt a tomb for the members of the ruling class It contained various funerary objects such as 15 stone chests pottery jewellery most of which are currently held by the Museum of Prehistory of Carnac It was excavated in 1862 by Ren Galles with a series of vertical pits digging down convert8mftabbron Le Rouzic also excavated it between 1900 and 1907 discovering the tomb and the stone chests

A chapel was built on top in 1663 but was rebuilt in 1813 before being destroyed in 1923 The current building is an identical reconstruction of the 1663 chapel built in 1926 

Also known as Er Man it is a chamber tomb convert85mftabbron long convert35mftabbron wide and convert5mftabbron high It has a dolmen at the west end and two tombs at the east end A small menhir approximately convert3mft0abbron high is nearby coord476119N30608Wtypelandmark

There are several dolmens scattered around the area These dolmens are generally considered to have been tombs however the acidic soil of Brittany has eroded away the bones They were constructed with several large stones supporting a capstone then buried under a mound of earth In many cases the mound is no longer present sometimes due to archeological excavation and only the large stones remain in various states of ruin

There are some individual menhirs and at least one other formation which do not fit into the above categories

 Manio quadrilateral  An arrangement of stones to form the perimeter of a large rectangle Originally a tertre tumulus with a central mound it is convert37mftabbron long and aligned to east of northeast The quadrilateral is convert10mftabbron wide to the east but only convert7mftabbron wide at the west 

Near the quadrilateral is a single massive menhir now known as the Giant Over convert65mftabbron tall it was re erected around 1900 by Zacharie Le Rouzic and overlooks the nearby Kerlescan alignment coord476034N3056Wtypelandmark

Vindolanda was a Roman fort at Chesterholm just south of Hadrians Wall in northern England Near the modern border with Scotland it guarded the Stanegate the Roman road from the River Tyne to the Solway Firth It is noted for the Vindolanda tablets one of the most important find of military and private correspondence found anywhere in the Roman Empire

The Vindolanda tablets are fragments of wooden leaf tablets with writing in carbon based ink They were found at Vindolanda in northern England The tablets date from the first and second centuries AD which makes them roughly contemporary with Hadrians Wall which is near Vindolanda The tablets contain messages to and from members of the garrison of Vindolanda their families and their slaves Similar records on papyrus were known from elsewhere in the Roman Empire but wooden tablets had not been recovered until archaeologist Robin Birley discovered them at Vindolanda in 1973 Pages have since been found at Carlisle in Cumbria and continue to be found at Vindolanda

Most of the tablets are official military documents However the best known document is perhaps Tablet 291 written around 100 AD from Claudia Severa the wife of the commander of a nearby fort to Sulpicia Lepidina wife of the commandant of Vindolanda inviting her to a birthday party The invitation is one of the earliest known examples of writing in Latin by a woman It has even been claimed that this is the earliest surviving letter known to be written by a woman in any language 

The tablets are written in Roman cursive script One of the tablets confirms that Roman soldiers wore underpants and also testifies to a high degree of literacy in the Roman army

The tablets do not throw much light on the native Celts but there are references Until the discovery of the tablets historians could only speculate on whether the Romans had a nickname for the Britons Brittunculi found on one of the Vindolanda tablets is now known to be a derogatory or patronizing term used by the Roman garrisons to describe the locals

The tablets are on display in the British Museum They are regarded by the Museum as one of its top ten British treasures

The garrison were auxiliaries Roman infantry or cavalry units not parts of Roman legions From the early third century AD onwards this was the Fourth Cohort of Gauls An inscription found in recent excavations suggests that native Gauls were in the regiment and that they liked to distinguish themselves from British soldiers The inscription reads CIVES GALLI DE GALLIAE CONCORDES QUE BRITANNI

A free translation would be The troops from Gaul dedicate this statue to the goddess Gallia with the full support of the British born troops

In 1970 the Vindolanda Trust a registered charity was founded to administer the site and its museum In 1997 the Trust took over the running of the Roman Army Museum at Carvoran another Hadrians Wall fort which it had acquired in 1972 

Psychiatrist Ian Stevenson from the University of Virginia interviewed young children who claimed to remember a past life He did more than 2500 interviews over a period of 40 years and wrote twelve books including Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation 

Stevenson found that childhood memories possibly related to reincarnation normally occurred between the ages of three and seven years He compared the memories with reports of people known to the deceased attempting to do so before any contact between the child and the deceaseds family had occurred 

Some 35 per cent of the children examined by Stevenson had birthmarks or birth defects Stevenson believed that the existence of birth marks and deformities on children when they occurred at the location of fatal wounds in the deceased provided the best evidence for reincarnation However Stevenson has never claimed that he had proved the existence of reincarnation and cautiously referred to his cases as being of the reincarnation type or suggestive of reincarnation 

Stevenson retired in 2002 and psychiatrist Jim B Tucker took over his work and wrote Life Before Life A Scientific Investigation of Childrens Memories of Previous Lives

Jim B Tucker is medical director of the Child and Family Psychiatric Clinic and associate professor at the Division of Perceptual Studies at the University of Virginia His main research interests are reincarnation research and prenatal and birth memories Tucker a child psychiatrist worked for several years on this research with Ian Stevenson before taking over upon Stevensons retirement in 2002 Tucker is the author of Life Before Life A Scientific Investigation of Childrens Memories of Previous Lives He has been interviewed about reincarnation in print and broadcast media in the United States United Kingdom and Canada

Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation is a 1974 book written by psychiatrist Ian Stevenson on reincarnation research The book focuses on twenty cases investigated by the author It has been translated into seven foreign languages

Reviews of Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation have been published in the American Journal of Psychiatry British Journal of Psychiatry British Journal of Medical Psychology Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease and some other journals

The Indian Grand Prix is the 17st race of the FIA Formula One World Championship racing calender in 2011 following the cancellation of the season opener in Bahrain It is scheduled to take place at the Buddh International Circuit on 30 October 2011 in Greater Noida Uttar Pradesh in India It is subject to approval of the circuit

Starting in 1997 there have been plans to host an Indian Grand Prix at Calcutta In 2003 India had only two permanent raceways One in Chennai and Kari Memorial Speedway in Coimbatore Two sites in the area of the Bangalore airport were consired In the state Andhra Pradesh land near the airport at Hyderabad were set aside In December 2003 an seven year preliminary agreement to host the GP in Hyderabad in 2007 was signed The track was to be build near Gopanapally village near the outskirts of Hyderabad In 2004 pressure came from Mumbai to shift the track from Hyderabad to Mumbai

F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone expected India to host a Grand Prix within three years He wanted a locating at either Hyderabad or Mumbai Both projects then were declared dead when Mumbais government decided not to waste money on car fumes while there are more serious issues

As of 2007 five locations remained in the running for hosting the Indian Grand Prix Bangalore the Gurgaon district district in the state Haryana a permanent track somewhere near New Delhi a street circuit in New Delhi as proposed by Vijay Mallya and a site in Lucknow Uttar Pradesh

In June 2007 the Indian Olympic Association and Bernie Ecclestone announced a provisional agreement for India to host its first Grand Prix in the 2009 F1 season The track would be built in the Gurgaon on recommendation by architect Hermann Tilke

In September 2007 the IOA announced that the debut race would take place in 2010 on the Jaypee Group Circuit in Greater Noida In September 2008 Bernie Ecclestone announced that the Indian Grand Prix has been delayed to 2011

On 8 September 2010 the FIA announced the F12011 schedule The Indian Grand Prix was on the schedule It was scheduled as the 18th race of a 20 race schedule Before the season started the Bahrain Grand Prix scheduled for 13 March was called off due to the political unrest in the country 

On 3 June the FIAs World Motor Sport Council announced that the Bahrain Grand Prix would be added back to the schedule The Bahrain GP was to be held on 30 October the original date of the Indian Grand Prix The Indian GP would have been moved to the end of the schedule The race teams objected to adding the Bahrain GP back to the schedule It was removed again and the Indian GP was set to run on the original date of 30 October

In April 2011 the circuit was renamed to the Buddh International Circuit

The race will be held at the Buddh International Circuit in Greater Noida 50 km from Delhi The circuit will be roughly 55 kilometres and will be designed by F1 circuit designer Hermann Tilke The 10 year contract for the race has been given to the Indian construction company Jaiprakash Associates

There have been a lot of infrastructure developments in Delhi for the 2010 Commonwealth Games There has been no direct funding provided for an Indian Grand Prix According to experts the benefits of India joining the F1 calendar are clear The hotel and tourism industry get an immediate boost and the countrys profile would get a lift Experts are also that once the Indian Grand Prix starts it could generate 170 million in revenue and employ as many as 10000 people There will also be opportunities for advertising between manufacturers and F1

Increased awareness has led to the popularity of merchandise Formula 1 tickets and race tours to F1 destinations

Georges Braque was a major 20th century French painter and sculptor who with Pablo Picasso developed the art movement known as Cubism

French art critic Louis Vauxcelles first used the term Cubism or bizarre cubiques in 1908 after seeing a picture by Braque He described it as full of little cubes after which the term quickly gained wide use Art historian Ernst Gombrich described cubism as the most radical attempt to stamp out ambiguity and to enforce one reading of the picture that of a man made construction a colored canvas The Cubist movement spread quickly throughout Paris and Europe

A major idea of Braques was the fractured stringed instrument as a cubist model This he painted a number of times with variations and made sculptures with fractured violins guitars etc inside transparent acrylic blocks Examples

Vaslav Nijinsky was the most famous male ballet dancer and choreographer of the early 20th century He was born to Polish parents both of whom were dancers Tomasz Niyski and Eleonora Bereda The part of the Ukraine where they worked was then in Imperial Russia

He was famous for his dancing ability and of his ability to show the character of the part he was playing He could perform en pointe a rare skill among male dancers at the time His ability to perform seemingly gravity defying leaps was legendary The ballerina and choreographer Bronislava Nijinska was his sister

In 1900 Nijinsky joined the Imperial Ballet School at St Petersburg where he studied under great trainers such as Enrico Cecchetti At 18 he was given a string of leads In 1910 the companys prima ballerina assoluta Mathilde Kschessinska selected Nijinsky to dance in a revival of Marius Petipas Le Talisman Nijinsky created a sensation in the role of the Wind God Vayou

His performance in The Sleeping Beauty was a tremendous success In 1910 he performed in Giselle and Fokines ballets Carnaval and Scheherazade His partnership with Tamara Karsavina in the Mariinsky Theatre was highly praised they were called the most exemplary artists of the time

A turning point for Nijinsky was his meeting Sergei Diaghilev Diaghilev was a celebrated entrepreneur of ballet and art exhibitions who promoted Russian visual and musical art abroad From that moment on Diaghilev directed and managed Nijinskys career and they became lovers 

In 1909 Diaghilev took a company of Russian opera and ballet stars to Paris featuring Nijinsky and Anna Pavlova The season of colourful Russian ballets and operas works mostly new to the West was a great success It led Diaghilev to create his famous company Les Ballets Russes with choreographer Michel Fokine and designer Lon Bakst The Paris seasons of the Ballets Russes were an artistic and social sensation setting trends in art dance music and fashion for the next decade

Nijinsky also choreographed ballets They were avant garde and controversial His ballets included Laprs midi dun faune based on Claude Debussys Prlude laprs midi dun faune In The Rite of Spring with music by Stravinsky Nijinsky created choreography which went beyond the limits of traditional ballet For the first time his audiences got a sight of modern dance The angular movements expressed the heart of Stravinskys radically modern score The music and dance caused a riotous reaction at the Thtre de Champs lyses when they premiered in Paris

In 1913 the Ballets Russes toured South America Diaghilev did not make this journey because of a fear of sea travel Free from Diaghilevs supervision Nijinsky became acquainted with Romola de Pulszky a Hungarian countess Eventually she succeeded in engaging his affections They were married in Buenos Aires and later had a daughter Kyra When the company returned to Europe Diaghilev flew into a rage and dismissed Nijinsky 

During World War I Nijinsky was interned in Hungary Diaghilev succeeded in getting him out for a North American tour in 1916 During this time Nijinsky choreographed and danced the leading role in Till Eulenspiegel Around this time signs of his schizophrenia was noticed by members of the company He suffered a nervous breakdown in 1919 and his career effectively ended He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and taken to Switzerland by his wife He spent the rest of his life in and out of psychiatric hospitals and asylums as his family travelled round Europe He never danced again

Iran is home to one of the worlds oldest continuous major civilizations with historical and urban settlements dating back to 4000 BC The Medes unified Iran as a nation and empire in 625 BC

The Islamic conquest of Persia and the end of the Sassanid Empire was a turning point in Iranian historyIran had been a monarchy ruled by a shah or emperor almost without interruption from 1501 until the 1979 Islamic revolution when Iran officially became an Islamic Republic on 1 April 1979

Iran used to be called Persia for a long time by people outside of Iran Iranians or Persians since the Sassanian era called their country Iran But the official name was Persia meaning that this was the name used in foreign relationships and in government papers In 1935 Reza Shh Pahlavi then shh of Iran officially renamed the country Iran a move which was made to please Adolf Hitler The name Iran comes from Aryan and is also mentioned in the ancient book of the Zoroastrians which was called the Avesta Iran means Aryan in Persian In the 19th and early 20th century the name Aryan was used by Europeans to mean all Indo Europeans The Aryan Race was a term that Hitler used to describe his ideal Superior or perfect race though it originally meant Iranians

Around 500 BC present day Iran was the center of the Persian Empire Then Alexander the Great took the country by fighting and the Achaemenid dynasty of Persia later ruled After them the Sassanian dynasty took over

Other people took Persia by fighting like the Arabs Turks and Mongols However Iran has always maintained a distinct culture and continued to survive

The Safavid dynasty made Islam and Shia the religion of Iran although Islam was always popular then The latest kings of Iran where from Pahlavi dynasty and ruled from 1925 until 1979 when there was a revolution and Ayatollah Khomeini created an Islamic republic

In 1951 Mohammed Mossadegh was brought to power after being elected as prime minister by nearly all members of the Majlis in Iran His first act in office was to take control of the oil industry in Iran which had been controlled by Great Britain Most of Britains oil was pumped from Iran at the time This move was seen as a danger to Great Britains security and empire so they tried to overthrow the government but failed After this they convinced the United States through diplomacy that the government of Iran was a communist threat

The CIA worked in Iran to create riots which led to the removal of Prime Minister Mossadegh The United States and Great Britain then made the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi King of Iran again

He ruled in Iran for less than a year when he left Iran and the Iranian government was changed to an Islamic Republic by Islamic Revolution Soon afterwards Iranian Students Movement with the backing of the new government took over the US Embassy in Tehran and held most of the diplomats hostage for 444 days Relations between the two countries have not been good since For example The US has imposed various types of economic sanctions against Iran The US claims the Iran supports terrorist groups against Israel Iran does not recognize Israel as a state Iran along with most Arab countries believe that Israel does not have the right to occupy the land of Palestinians 

Iran has long borders in common with Iraq Iranians are ethnically not Arabs Iran defended itself against Iraqi invasion in 1980 a war that lasted eight years Many Arab and Western countries including the United States provided weapons and technical support for Iraqs Saddam Hussein 

Now the West is trying to prevent Iran from mastering nuclear technology even though Iran is a member of the NPT They voice their concern claiming that Irans intention is to develop nuclear weapons The International Atomic Energy Agency has reported numerous times that there is no evidence that Iran is developing nuclear weapons however it also says that it can not say for sure that Iran is not doing so in secret A CIA report on nuclear activity in Iran in December 2007 claimed that Irans secret program to achieve nuclear weapons technology was stopped in 2003 and that since then it was never restarted It reports that Irans ability to build a nuclear weapon will probably not happen soon

Cobalt chloride also known as cobaltous chloride and cobalt dichloride is a chemical compound It contains cobalt in its 2 oxidation state Its chemical formula is CoCl2 It contains cobalt and chloride ions

Cobalt chloride is normally found in the red form The red form has water in it It can be heated to turn it into the blue form without water The blue form will absorb water from the air and turn red again 

A different blue form is made when cobalt chloride is reacted with a chemical compound that has chloride in it Hydrochloric acid works the best but sodium chloride can be used too When it is heated it turns more blue than when it is cooled See the unheated picture and the heated picture for an example Cobalt chloride can be used to test for chloride ions in this way

It can be oxidized to cobalt compounds although cobalt chloride does not exist If it is made it just drops a Cl from CoCl3 making CoCl2 again

The anhydrous blue form can be made by reacting cobalt with chlorine The hydrated red form can be made by reacting cobalt oxide or cobalt hydroxide with hydrochloric acid 

It is used to place cobalt into other chemical compounds It can be used to make other cobalt compounds It is the most common cobalt compound in the lab 

It is a weak oxidizing agent too weak to ignite things Cobalt compounds are toxic in large quantities like any other transition metal compounds They are not toxic like lead or mercury compounds though

Cobalt chloride normally refers to cobalt chloride Cobalt chloride is unstable

An eyeborg or eye borg is an electronic eye that allows people to hear colors It is mostly used by blind people or by people with color blindness It works by using a head mounted camera that reads the colors directly in front of a person and converts them into musical notes

The first eyeborg was made in England in 2003 by Adam Montandon in collaboration with colourblind artist Neil Harbisson The invention won a British award in Innovation and a European award in Content Tools and Interface Design In 2007 Peter Kese a software developer from Slovenia made further developments to the eyeborg by increasing the number of colors to 360 and adding color intensity through different volume levels Matias Lizana a student from Universitat Politcnica de Catalunya is currently developing the eyeborg into a smaller chip as part of his final year project The new chip will allow users to hear colors in stereo and to implant the device

Christian Dior was the leading French fashion designer of the post war world He was the founder of one of the worlds top fashion houses the House of Dior

During the German occupation of France in World War II Christian Dior dressed the wives of Nazi officers and French collaborators On 8 October 1946 he founded his own fashion house backed by Marcel Boussac the cotton fabric magnate

For his first collection in early 1947 the phrase The New Look was coined by Harpers Bazaar the fashion monthly Diors designs were more voluptuous than the economy shapes of World War II when fabric was rationed 

Dior was a master at creating shapes and silhouettes he said I have designed flower women His look employed fabrics lined with percale boned bustier style bodices hip padding wasp waisted corsets and petticoats This made his dresses flare out from the waist giving his models a very curvaceous form 

Some women protested because his designs covered up their legs which they did not during wartime There was also criticism of Diors designs which used a lot of fabric Opposition ceased as soon as wartime shortages ended The New Look revolutionized womens dress and reestablished Paris as the center of the fashion world

The term was first used by Dior as the label for his collection of spring 1955 The A Line collections feature item then the most wanted silhouette in Paris was a fingertip length flared jacket worn over a dress with a very full pleated skirt Evening dresses at this time were always worn with petticoats

Although an A shape this silhouette was not identical to what is now understood to embody the A line idea That idea was given its definitive expression and popularized by Diors successor Yves Saint Laurent with his Trapeze Line of spring 1958 which featured dresses flaring out dramatically from a fitted shoulder line 

A line clothes remained popular in the 1960s and 70s disappeared from fashion almost completely by the early 1980s and were revived by the retro trend of the late 1990s By that time A line was used more loosely to describe any dress wider at the hips than at the bust or waist as well as a number of flared skirt styles True A line shapes on the pattern of Dior and Saint Laurent saw a revival in the early 2000s

I see over half of the top 50 longest pages are huge lists full of red links There are nine in the top ten This includes some pages which dont actually have list in title but are one in fact Most Ive checked are text dumps from enWP and scarcely worked on since They are the devil to download and pretty useless as a way to get to pages Many of them go to an insane level of detail from the point of view of our wiki There is another way to approach lists It is to cut them down ruthlessly to a minimum using the notability criterion more severely An example when faced with the present inflated number of chess Grandmasters after some agreement on the talk page and elsewhere the list was cut to those rated over 2700 plus any others thought to be significant The chess project has been helpful in providing a small support group An even more radical move would be to list only those pages we already have on a subject in this wiki Thus lists could become List of our XYZ pages What Im suggesting is a Cut down overlong lists project Macdonald ross

My idea is something like for each of the longest pages one by one a small group looks at the page and tries to find an objective and defensible way to reduce its size Look with 30 regular contributors many of whom have their own special interests these over long lists will not change unless something is done about them But if someone thinks its OK to have hundreds of red links on a page well theyre welcome to their opinion Perhaps it all hinges on how one sees the potential damge I see the potential damage to Simple as a whole as quite real There is something wrong with the idea that we should duplicate lists which are exactly the same as lists in enWP when their lists are highly linked to articles Macdonald ross

20 Sep 2010 I will be focusing on putting some broader medicine related articles on Simple WP As if there werent enough problems already as you might know many articles on enwiki are being converted into a doctors view of the subject Its as if Hair will cease to be a concern of fashion or cultural trends or barbershops and instead all hair related articles on English WP will be rewritten for medical concerns such as hair follicle pathology listing only major symptoms and treatment of hair diseases The final straw for me was the enwiki renaming of Diaper rash as enIrritant diaper dermatitis In the US many medical doctors have an attitude problem which they dont see as POV pushing but instead the hospital system typically worships doctors by high salary fame and keeping nurses and med techs to stay in their place as inferior underlings Does anyone know of any formal complaints of that medical takeover on enwiki or have other editors noted they are coming to Simple WP to save broad minded articles from becoming POV funnels for medical data Some enwiki article revisions from 2008 might still contain broader views of medical related topics so those writings could be simplified for use here I think it is good that medics are adding details on enwiki unfortunately they seem to be axing any prior article contents which are not shown in medical encyclopedias so issues such as hygiene laundry or house design are likely to be axed as insignificant trivia which clutters a doctors reading for hospital concerns To recap the problem in a nutshell by paraphrasing US General George Patton Compared to War Medicine all forms of human endeavour shrink to insignificance It might be very difficult to stop doctors from replacing articles as Medi pedia texts Therefore perhaps there should be a guideline for Simple WP to warn about keeping medical related articles as broader in scope than the narrow view of some doctors Anyone have other thoughts about this Wikid77 1347 20 September 2010

I had a look at the most wanted article list It looks like it was last updated 4 months ago I recently did a calculation Suppose a bot would get one page every ten seconds thisw bot would need about 75 days to go through all articles we have It would therefore be possible to run such a bot once to twice a month which would give us more accurate data on the most wanted articles

I wonder how such tasks are handled at other wikipedias and who would be responsible for developing such a bot if none exists  Eptalon 1238 4 October 2010 Basically what we need to keep track of

The template tlCite news generates the news article title as an html link It also outputs the html url address The url is wrapped in a set of tags This is to display the url only when a printable version of the article is produced On enwp MediaWikiCommoncss has a class printonly with attributes display none Simple seems to be missing this class The result is the raw url link is also displayed in the reference section For an example check Indianapolis Motor Speedway reference link number 10 and compare to enIndianapolis Motor Speedway reference link number 10

Since WikiLeaks has become a hot topic over the last days I feel its a good idea to explain a chat I had with Mike Godwin about how to use WikiLinks in our articles We should not quote or cite a WikiLeaks document directly due to legal problems that could occur If you are planning on using some of the newly released information from WikiLeaks the way to do it safely for us is to quote or cite a third party who quotes or cites WL So if I wanted to include information about the claimed shooting of an 8 year old girl by a British soldier which is one of the events WikiLeaks claims top secret documents show then I would quote or cite the Mail of Sunday articles treatment of it and what it said but not the WikiLeaks document directly fr33kman 1457 25 October 2010

Wow Its been a while since I popped by but to see that WPPVGA has had 11 edits since the beginning of September is shameful Is this Wikipedia ignoring the idea of promoting good content Are editors here not asking for help in making decent articles There are a number of decent editors most of whom are contactable by email and it takes maybe 20 minutes to look at some of the candidates for GAVGA 

If this Wikipedia continues to fail in producing reasonable quality articles and persists in being a chatroom I suggest the Wikimedia Foundation switch it off If you guys want to keep it going make it useful I remember the days when one GAVGA a month was minimum now its a rare event and that frankly is pathetic and a waste of the resources of this charity The Rambling Man 2041 12 October 2010

Hello everyone just a quick pop in to thank you for at least reacting to a comment I made The so called threat was nothing other than a suggestion that this Wikipedia focus on making a little quality content rather a ton of mediocre content My nudge at Facebook was to remind folks that this is not a place for smalltalk and chat I know wholeheartedly that were all volunteers but a Wikipedia which fails to produce good content is a useless one Im sorry but 5000 stubs on footballers is all very well but how useful is it to the simple English speaker or the school child at which this Wikipedia is aimed Eptalon and I have not agreed wholeheartedly on too much in the past but the one thing he has always advocated is a minimum set of excellence in other words a set of articles which we can use to show simple English speakers or school children that this is a useful website Ive seen some decent subjects go through to PVGAPGA but theres no real interest here in getting these articles to an excellent state Id love to spend more time helping articles get to GAVGA but until theres a groundswell of interest in doing this theres no point If anyone nominates a GAVGA and wants a review email me Ill do my best The Rambling Man 1734 17 October 2010

Ive been giving this whole discussion some thought and have an idea Im still pretty new around here so apologies in advance if this has already been discussed Ive started to act on my idea already anyway so if anyone else cares to join in please

One problem as I see it is how to best use the scarce time and resources of editors on GAVGA I agree with Kansan that often Id rather work on getting a greater number of articles up to a usable standard than trying to carry each of them through the vetting process

But as TRM said there is some value in a minimum set of excellence in other words a set of articles which we can use to show simple English speakers or school children that this is a useful website We cant make all of the pages excellent but it might be a good idea to prioritize some articles that visitors are more likely to see and to read If a new visitors first experience is a GA or VGA that would be great

Here is an example According to the Telegraph UK httpenwikipediaorgwikiTwitter Twitter was the 13th most visited page on enWP in 2009 Twitter on Simple ranks 1111 according to these stats The Twitter article on Simple was a stub and a GA on enWP To me that indicates that time spent trying to get content from enWP and simplifying to create a GA here is worthwhile More visitors may read it

Of course a lot of the energy and dedication to create a GA or VGA will come from editors personal interest and they should follow that I think Ill keep working on some obscure music pages as well But if the idea is to get a set of top quality articles to show the world working on what web users seem to want would be a good idea too

Ive gone ahead and simplified the intro from enWP and added it to the Simple article for Twitter Ill work on some other parts later but if anyone else cares to the infobox needs work and these sections remain to be done

1 History 2 Overview 3 Finances 4 Technology 5 tco 6 Reception

So my questions Does anyone else think this is a worthwhile approach If so is there a way to get better stats For example which of the top 100 good articles visited on enWP are stubs on Simple Or even more directly which of the most visited articles on Simple are still stubs

Thanks Ted 0152 23 October 2010

Homalocephale was a thick skulled plant eating dinosaur Its flat head housed a very thick skull a tiny brain and large eyes The skull consisted of porous non rigid bone interlaced with blood vessels

Homalocephale grew to be about 5 feet long and weighed about 95 pounds Homalocephale probably had a good sense of smell It had bumpy knobs on its snout and along the rear of its skull It had leaf shaped teeth short forelimbs and a stiff tail 

Pachyrhinosaurus was a large plant eating dinosaur that had a bony spiked neck frill four short legs and a short tail Pachyrhinosaurus was a short frilled ceratopsian dinosaur that was 18 to 23 feet long Pachyrhinosaurus had many small horns on the middle of its frill 

The Arnhem Land Region is one of the five regions of the Northern Territory of Australia It is in the north east corner of the territory and is about 500km from the territory capital Darwin It has an area of 97000 km This area includes Kakadu National Park About 16230 people live in Arnhem Land It was named by Matthew Flinders after the Dutch ship Arnhem which explored the coast in 1623 

Arnhem Land goes from Port Roper on the Gulf of Carpentaria around the coast to the East Alligator River where it joins Kakadu National Park The major towns are Jabiru on the Kakadu National Park border Maningrida on the Liverpool River mouth and Nhulunbuy in the far north east on the Gove Peninsula Gove is the site of large bauxite mine with an alumina refinery Its administrative centre is the town of Nhulunbuy the fourth largest town in the Northern Territory

The climate of Arnhem Land is tropical monsoon with a wet and dry season Temperatures do not vary much during the year It can get as cold as 15 degrees Celsius during nights in the dry season In the wet season the days can be as hot as 33 degrees Celsius

Arnhem Land became an Aboriginal Reserve in 1931 It is still one of the largest Aboriginal Reserves in Australia It is best known for its remoteness its art and the strong continuing traditions of its people North east Arnhem Land is home to the Yolngu people one of the largest indigenous groups in Australia They have been able to keep their traditional indigenous culture The Malays and Macassans are believed to have had contact with the coastal Aboriginal groups and traded with them prior to European settlement of Australia

The 2006 movie Ten Canoes shows life in Arnhem land with a story that uses old Aboriginal stories It was co directed by one of the cast members The movie and also the movie about how it was made The Balano and the Bark Canoes shows the great struggle the indigenous people have made to keep their culture alive 

The Aboriginal town of Yirrkala just outside Nhulunbuy is famous throughout the world This is because of its its bark paintings and its role in supporting the rights of Indigenous Australians It is also the place where the Yidaki or Didgeridoo came from The town of Gunbalanya once called Oenpelli in Western Arnhem Land is also famous for its bark painting 

Arnhem Land is famous for its Aboriginal rock art Some of the best art can be found at Ubirr Rock Injalak Hill and in the Canon Hill area Some of these show early visits by Europeans sometimes in such detail that Martini Henry rifles can be identified Other paintings show axes aircraft and ships In one rock shelter hundreds of kilometres from Darwin there is a painting the wharf at Darwin It shows buildings and boats the Europeans with their hats and pipes Some are shown without hands which they have in their pockets There is a painting near the East Alligator River crossing which shows a man with a gun and long pigtails down his back This would be one of the Chinese workers brought to Darwin in the late 19th century The people also make ritual sand sculptures which do not last

One Yolngu stone arrangement at Maccasans Beach near Yirrkala shows the layout of the Macassan praus used for Trepang fishing The Yolngu traded with the people of Makassar on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi This trading was happening 200 years before European settlement

Sir Joseph Banks 1st Baronet GCB PRS was an English naturalist botanist and patron of the natural sciences Banks was President of the Royal Society 17781820 baronet 1781 Privy Counsellor 1797 His collections were given to the British Museum

Banks took part in Captain James Cooks first great voyage from 1768 to 1771 He inherited a large fortune and was able to hire his own team to help collect package and transport his finds Banks discovered and collected Eucalyptus Acacia Mimosa and Banksia About 80 species of plants are named after Banks 

Banks was educated at Harrow School Eton College and Christ Church Oxford

In 1766 Banks was elected to the Royal Society and in the same year he accompanied Phipps to Newfoundland and Labrador to study their natural history He made his name by publishing the first Linnean descriptions of the plants and animals of Newfoundland and Labrador

Banks was promptly appointed to a joint Royal NavyRoyal Society scientific expedition to the south Pacific Ocean on HMS Endeavour 17681771 This was the first of James Cooks voyages of discovery in that region Banks joined the ship with a staff of eight Daniel Solander and HD Spring naturalists Alexander Buchan and Sydney Parkinson artists James Roberts and Peter Briscoe tenants from Revesby Thomas Richmond and George Dorlton negro servants Only four of this party survived the voyage Banks himself Solander and the two Revesby men

This voyage went first to Brazil where Banks made the first scientific description of a now common garden plant Bougainvillea and to other parts of South America 

The voyage then went to Tahiti to New Zealand and to the east coast of Australia where Cook mapped the coastline and made landfall at Botany Bay and at Endeavour River in Queensland where they spent seven weeks ashore while the ship was repaired after damage on the Great Barrier Reef 

While they were in Australia Banks Solander and Spring made the first collection of Australian plants describing many that were new to science Almost 800 specimens were illustrated by the artist Sydney Parkinson and appear in Banks Florilegium finally published in 35 volumes between 1980 and 1990 Banks arrived back in England on 12 July 1771 and immediately became famous

A petticoat is a womans undergarment shaped like a skirt or skirtbodice Think of it as a skirt underneath a regular skirt The purpose is possibly insulation and certainly to make the skirt fly out in an attractive way Petticoats which are starched with ruffles or made with stiff fabric serve to support a wider skirt The ultimate in this trend is the crinoline which is a petticoat structure which includes hoops of whalebone Crinolines are not worn today but petticoats sometimes are with ballgowns

For most of the first half of the 20th century with a few exceptions petticoats were out of fashion Certainly multiple petticoats were not needed for the narrow skirts and dresses which were fashionable Some evening gowns needed petticoats but they were finished off by WWII wartime rationing and shortages

Petticoats were revived by Christian Dior in his full skirted New Look of 1947 Tiered ruffled stiffened petticoats remained extremely popular during the 1950s especially with teenage girls Typically at least three single petticoats were worn until manufacturers began making double and triple layer petticoats A narrow slip was usually worn under the petticoats especially the crinoline type because they tended to be scratchy

Dior continued this theme with his A Line collection of Spring 1955 which featured the most wanted silhouette in Paris This was a fingertip length flared jacket worn over a dress with a very full pleated skirt Evening dresses at this time were always worn with petticoats

Although an A shape this silhouette was not identical to what is now understood to embody the A line idea That idea was given its definitive expression and popularized by Diors successor Yves Saint Laurent with his Trapeze Line of Spring 1958 which featured dresses flaring out dramatically from a fitted shoulder line A line clothes remained popular in the 1960s and 70s 

Paul the Octopus was an octopus living in a tank at a Sea Life Centre in Oberhausen Germany Paul became famous around the world for correctly choosing the winner of Germanys seven matches at the 2010 World Cup as well as the final

During the divinations Paul was shown two boxes with a mussel inside them for food Each box had on the outside a flag of a football team Paul would eat the mussel from the box with the flag of the winning team He did this correctly in four of Germanys six Euro 2008 matches and in all seven of their matches in the 2010 World Cup He correctly chose a win for Spain against the Netherlands in the World Cup final His predictions were 100 right for the 2010 World Cup and 86 correct overall Paul was retired after the 2010 FIFA World Cup

It was at first said that Pauls career as an oracle began during the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament In the lead up to Germanys international football matches Paul was presented with two clear plastic boxes each containing food a mussel or an oyster Each container was marked with the flag of a team one the flag of Germany and the other the flag of Germanys opponent The box which Paul opened first was judged to be the predicted winner of the game

Some people had doubt about the octopus abilities

Under the thought that Paul had the same chances of choosing the winner or the loser of a match and not considering the chance of a draw he had a 12 chance of rightly choosing any single game and a 1256 chance of rightly choosing eight in a row

On October 26 2010 Paul died of natural causes after being inactive for the last few days

The Variations on a Rococo Theme is a piece of music for cello and orchestra composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky It is one of the most popular pieces of music for cello and orchestra

Tchaikovsky never composed a cello concerto but he did write this work which is a tune with a set of variations It is called Rococo because the music is based on the style that was popular in the late 18th century the period during the Classical period known as Rococo the time of composers such as Mozart The main theme is an original theme by Tchaikovsky not a theme that had been composed by someone else in the 18th century

Tchaikovsky wrote this piece for Wilhelm Fitzenhagen to play He was a German cellist who lived in Russia Like Tchaikovsky he was a professor at the Moscow Conservatory Fitzenhagen gave the first performance of the work in Moscow on 30 November 1877 Nikolai Rubinstein was the conductor 

What happened to the work after that first performance is an interesting story Tchaikovsky himself had not been at the first performance because he was in Switzerland trying to calm himself down after a very short disasterous marriage He wanted to prepare the work so that it could be published He sent Fitzhagen a short score He asked Fitzhagen to make any necessary changes to the cello part Meanwhile Tchaikovsky got on with the job of orchestrating the music

However Fitzhagen did not only make changes to the solo cello part He made other changes as well He left one of the variations out and changed the order of some of the others When the music was about to be published Tchaikovsky saw what Fitzhagen had done Tchaikovsky was very cross but he decided to let the publishers print it like that anyway

When it was published there was nothing in the score which said that Fitzhagen had made lots of changes It was not until about 70 years later that people realized that Tchaikovskys original version had been different Some cellists such as Steven Isserlis now choose to play Tchaikovskys original version However most cellists still prefer to play Fitzhagens version It is hard to tell which one Tchaikovsky would have preferred Maybe he let it be printed because he realized that Fitzhagen had improved it We cannot tell Musicians still argue about which version ought to be played

The piece is written for an orchestra which is smaller than Tchaikovskys usual Romantic orchestral It is like the ones from the time of Mozart There are just two of each woodwind instrument two horns and strings

The piece which is about 20 minutes long consists of a theme and seven variations

The work is occasionally played by other solo instruments Maxim Rysanov plays it on the viola He played it at the Last Night of the Proms in 2010

A gravitational slingshot gravity assist maneuver or swing by is the use of the relative movement and gravity of a planet to alter the path and speed of a spacecraft typically in order to save fuel time and expense Gravity assistance can be used to speed up slow down andor change the path of a spacecraft The assist is provided by the motion of the gravitating body as it pulls on the spacecraft

The heliosphere is a bubble in space blown into the interstellar medium by the solar wind Although electrically neutral atoms from interstellar volume can pass through this bubble almost all of the material in the heliosphere comes from the Sun itself 

For the first ten billion kilometres of its radius the solar wind travels at over a million kilometres per hour As it begins to drop out with the interstellar medium it slows down before finally stopping altogether The point where the solar wind slows down is the termination shock the point where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance is called the heliopause the point where the interstellar medium travelling in the opposite direction slows down as it collides with the heliosphere is the bow shock 

The solar wind is made of particles charged atoms from the solar corona and fields in particular magnetic fields As the Sun rotates once in about 27 days the magnetic field transported by the solar wind gets wrapped into a spiral Differences in the Suns magnetic field are carried outward by the solar wind and can produce magnetic storms in the Earths magnetosphere

In March 2005 measurements by the Solar Wind Anisotropies instrument onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory have shown that the heliosphere the solar wind filled volume which prevents the solar system from becoming embedded in the local interstellar medium is not axisymmetrical but is distorted very likely under the effect of the local galactic magnetic field

Blest Pair of Sirens is a short work for choir and orchestra by Hubert Parry It was composed in 1887 It is a setting of an ode called At a solemn Musick by John Milton

Blest Pair of Sirens was first performed by the Bach Choir conducted by Charles Villiers Stanford At first Stanford wanted to perform another work by Parry The Glories of Our Blood and State However the performance was going to be part of Queen Victorias Silver Jubilee celebrations The words of The Glories of Our Blood and State were about Death coming to kings and queens so it was not thought to be appropriate and so Stanford asked Parry to write a new work for the occasion George Grove suggested Miltons Ode at a Solemn Music would be a good poem for Parry to set

The first performance of Blest Pair of Sirens at St Jamess Hall took place on 17 May 1887 It is very well written for choir with music that excellently fits Miltons powerful words The choir divides into eight parts The words are about mans desire to join the heavenly music of the spheres

Blest Pair of Sirens was sung by the choirs of Westminster Abbey and the Chapel Royal at the Royal Wedding of Prince William Duke of Cambridge and Kate Middleton on 29 April 2011 It was performed during the signing of the register

Uruk was an ancient city of Sumer and later Babylonia It was situated east of the present bed of the Euphrates river on the ancient dry former channel of the Euphrates River

Uruk gives its name to the Uruk period the protohistoric Chalcolithic to Early Bronze Age period in the history of Mesopotamia about 4000 to 3100 BC This was followed by the Jemdet Nasr period of Sumer proper Uruk played a leading role in the early urbanization of Sumer in the mid 4th millennium BC At its height c 2900 BC Uruk probably had 5000080000 residents living in 6 km2 of walled area the largest city in the world at the time 

According to the chronology in the Sumerian king list the semi mythical king Gilgamesh ruled Uruk in the 27th century BC The city lost its prime importance around 2000 BC after the struggle of Babylonia with Elam It remained inhabited throughout the Seleucid and Parthian periods until it was finally abandoned during the Sassanid period just before the Islamic conquest of Mesopotamia

Nippur from the Sumerian Enlil is modern Nuffar in Iraq Nippur was one of the most ancient of all the Sumerian cities It was the special seat of the worship of the Sumerian god Enlil ruler of the cosmos and subject to An alone

Nippur was always part of a larger empire Its control was crucial as it gave overall kingship to monarchs from other city states It was a sacred city important because it had the famous shrine of Enlil

Late in the 3rd millennium BC Nippur was conquered and occupied by the Semitic rulers of Akkad and their rulers like Sargon left gifts at this sanctuary Another ruler Naram Suen rebuilt the temple and the city walls in the debris of this ancient site his remains were found This Akkadian occupation was succeeded by an occupation during the third dynasty of Ur and the constructions of Ur Nammu the great builder of temples are on top of those of Naram

Under the succeeding Kassite dynasty shortly after the middle of the 2nd millennium Nippur was restored once more to its former splendour 

After the middle of the 12th century BC follows a long period of neglect but after with the conquest of Babylonia by the Assyrian Sargon II at the close of the 8th century BC the city revives Under Ashurbanipal about the middle of the 7th century BC we find Ekur restored with a splendour greater than ever before the ziggurat of that period being 58 by 39 m 

After that Nippur appears to have gradually fallen into decay until finally in the Seleucid period the ancient temple was turned into a fortress Huge walls were built at the edges of the ancient terrace and the courts of the temple were filled with houses and streets This fortress was occupied and further built upon until the close of the Parthian period about AD 250

Under the rule of the Sassanids Nippur fell into decay and the ancient sanctuary became only a little village of mud huts huddled about the ancient ziggurat The city was the seat of a Christian diocese as late as the 8th century AD

Nippur was situated on both sides of the Shatt en Nil canal one of the earliest courses of the Euphrates It lies between the present bed of that river and the Tigris almost 160 km southeast of Baghdad It is divided into two main parts by the dry bed of the old Shatt en Nil The highest point of these ruins a conical hill rising about 30 m above the level of the surrounding plain northeast of the canal bed is called by the Arabs Bint el Amiror

Nippur was first excavated briefly by Sir Austen Henry Layard in 1851 Full scale digging was begun by an expedition from the University of Pennsylvania The work involved four seasons of excavation between 1889 and 1900 Nippur was also excavated for 19 seasons between 1948 and 1990

Chucky as he is affectionately known has been a leading player in the world since 1988 at times reaching the second spot on the FIDE list but has never won the World Chess Championship Ivanchuk has often had erratic results Since 2007 his world ranking has ranged from twelfth to second before dropping to 30th in July 2009

He was the 20072008 World Blitz Chess champion He won Amber blindfold and rapid chess championship in 1992 and 2010

Chucky has been described by Viswanathan Anand as the most eccentric player in the chess world Anand gave his view on Ivanchuk like this

When he plays Ivanchuk rarely looks at the board Instead he stares at the ceiling and at the walls with a blank stare His playing style is unpredictable and highly original making him a threat to any chess player although it sometimes also leads to quick losses

After a string of unsuccessful games culminated in his elimination at the early stages of the 2009 Chess World Cup Ivanchuk announced in a highly emotional interview his retirement from professional chess However he soon recanted this decision

On the July 2009 FIDE rating list Jakovenko had a rating of 2760 but he has slipped a bit since then He shared first in the Russian Championship 2006 losing the playoff against Evgeny Alekseev

He was a member of the gold medal winning Russian team at the 2009 World Team Chess Championship in Bursa

Manganese oxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Mn2O3 It has manganese in its 3 oxidation state It is a brown or black solid It is made by heating manganese oxide to a temperature lower than convert800CF It is made in an alkaline cell when it dies 

Manganese fluoride also known as manganese trifluoride is a chemical compound It contains manganese and fluoride ions The manganese ions are in the 3 oxidation state Its chemical formula is MnF3 It is a purple pink powder It is used to add fluoride ions to other chemical compounds It is an oxidizing agent It is made by heating manganese fluoride with fluorine These are in a solution of hydrofluoric acid It decomposes to manganese fluoride when heated 

It can form hydrofluoric acid when dissolved in water so it can be dangerous It should not be stored in glass

Manganese fluoride is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is MnF2 It is made by reacting manganese carbonate or manganese oxide with hydrofluoric acid It is used to make other manganese fluorides It is also used in lasers It is much less reactive than the other manganese fluorides

Manganese fluoride is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is MnF4 It contains manganese and fluoride ions The manganese ions are in the 4 oxidation state It is a light blue green solid It is very reactive It can form very reactive fluorine gas easily It can be made by reacting fluorine or strong oxidizing agents containing fluorine with several manganese compounds It was used to make fluorine without using electrolysis It is much more reactive than manganese oxide

Manganese fluoride can refer to any of these following compounds

Res Gestae Divi Augusti also known as Res Gestae and RGDA was an autobiography and epitath written by Emperor Augustus following the tradition of writing about a dead persons achievements and life but Augustus is the biggest by far It was about his achievements in his life in politics the positions he held and various other parts like the money he spent on Public Games and on rebuilding temples around the empire Various copies of the Res Gestae have been found throughout the Roman Empire All the surviving copies come from modern day Turkey  the best preserved one comes from Ancyra Most historians feel that Augustus wrote several versions during his life and kept updating them until the final version which is usually dated to the same year as Augustus death in 14 AD

As a source the Res Gestae is not fully accurate Whilst not lying he doesnt mention some things that he did like the proscriptions of his enemies and refers to his rival Marc Antony as a faction Through the inscription Augustus makes a big deal of his money he spends on the people Rome and the empire He also says frequently that he has restored the republic and only gains his titles because of the universal support from the people and most importantly the senate

The Res Gestae Divi Augusti is grouped into four sections

Potassium fluoride is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is KF It contains potassium and fluoride ions 

Potassium fluoride is a colorless crystalline solid It rarely occurs in the ground It dissolves easily in water It can react with glass Hydrofluoric acid is more effective at reacting with glass though It has to be stored in plastic or platinum containers

Potassium fluoride is made by reacting potassium carbonate with hydrofluoric acid This reaction can make potassium bifluoride Potassium bifluoride is a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and potassium fluoride 

It is used because of its fluoride ion It can be used to add fluoride ions to some chemical compounds

Potassium fluoride is somewhat toxic It is corrosive to glass It can burn when spilled on skin

Sodium permanganate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is NaMnO4 It contains sodium and permanganate ions

It is a purple black crystalline solid It can dissolve in water to make a bright pink solution It dissolves in water more than potassium permanganate It is more expensive than potassium permanganate It also absorbs water from the air It is a strong oxidizing agent 

It cannot be made in the way that potassium permanganate is made because sodium manganate is not made It can be made by reacting pure manganese oxide with sodium hypochlorite It can also be made by reacting potassium permanganate with certain sodium compounds

It can be used to make circuit boards

Permanganates are toxic They are also strong oxidizing agents and should be kept away from things that can burn

Manganate normally means the MnO42 ion It is a bright green ion It is made during the making of permanganates It is a weak reducing agent and moderate oxidizing agent They are similar to the sulfate and chromate ions Potassium manganate is an example 

The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains was a battle in 451 AD It happened in northwest Gaul between Attila the Huns armies and Roman legions and Visigoth soldiers commanded by Flavius Aetius and Theodoric I Atillas armies consisted mainly of horsemen and it was mainly the extended use of cavalry that defeated him The battle ended as a stalemate and thus a victory for the west the Huns having maintained too many losses to continue their attack The battle of the Catalaunian Plains had crushed Attilas dreams of marrying the emperors sister Honoriacn

Invented by Byzantines Greek fire was a fearsome weapon It had the ability to keep burning while on water As such it was often used in naval battles The creation of it was a closely guarded secret and has now been lost

The term Greek fire is normally used in English However most other languages use other terms such as sea fire Roman fire war fire liquid fire or processed fire

The Siphonophores are an Order of Cnidarian invertebrates The Portuguese Man o War is an example 

A siphonophore is not a single animal It is a colony of four kinds of zooids Zooids are very small highly modified individuals All the zooids in a colony are genetically identical These zooids are specialized polyps and medusoids 

Though structurally similar to other cnidarians the zooids do not live by themselves they are attached to each other Each type of zooid is not self sufficient It depends for survival on the others doing what it cannot do by itself

So close do the zooids fit together that the colony looks like a single individual It was a triumph of 19th century biology to discover the real nature of the siphonophores 

Potassium manganate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is K2MnO4 It contains potassium and manganate ions 

Potassium manganate is a green solid It can disproportionate into potassium permanganate and manganese oxide This happens in acidic pH This reaction because of its color change is known as a chemical chameleon

It is made by reacting manganese oxide with very hot potassium hydroxide Sometimes oxygen or potassium nitrate is used as the oxidizing agent This makes potassium manganate Normally the potassium manganate is converted to potassium permanganate Potassium permanganate is more common Potassium iodide can reduce potassium permanganate to potassium manganate It can also be made by reacting hot potassium permanganate with potassium hydroxide This makes oxygen and potassium manganate

Potassium manganate does not have many uses It is mainly made when potassium permanganate is made

Potassium manganate is a moderate oxidizing agent When it is reduced it can made black or brown stains on glass clothing or skin

Sodium manganate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Na2MnO4 It contains sodium and manganate ions It is a bright green solid It cannot be made by reacting manganese dioxide with sodium hydroxide like potassium manganate is made It is made by reacting hot sodium hydroxide with sodium permanganate This releases oxygen and makes sodium manganate It is more expensive than potassium manganate because it is harder to make

Hypomanganate is an ion Its chemical formula is MnO43 It is bright blue It disproportionates into manganates and manganese oxide easily This can be stopped by adding a lot of a base They are both reducing agents and oxidizing agents They are made by reducing manganates with sulfites and hydrogen peroxide 

Potassium hypomanganate is a chemical compound It contains potassium and hypomanganate ions It is a bright blue solid It is unstable and rare It can be made several ways reduction of potassium permanganate with potassium sulfite reduction of potassium manganate with hydrogen peroxide and potassium hydroxide and disproportionation when manganese dioxide is dissolved in potassium hydroxide It disproportionates into potassium manganate and manganese dioxide easily Only a strong base can stop it from disproportionation 

Potassium sulfite is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is K2SO3 It contains potassium and sulfite ions 

It is a white crystalline solid It is a reducing agent It can react with oxidizing agents to make potassium sulfate 

It is made by reacting sulfur dioxide with potassium hydroxide

It is used to preserve food Sulfites can cause allergies in some people though

The set of tissues which work together to resist infections is called the immune system The immune mechanisms help an organism identify a pathogen and neutralize its threat 

The immune system can detect and identify many different kinds of disease agents Examples are viruses bacteria and parasites The immune system can detect a difference between the bodys own healthy cells or tissues and foreign cells Detecting an unhealthy intruder is complicated because intruders can evolve and adapt so that the immune system will no longer detect them

Once a foreign cell or protein is detected the immune system creates antibodies to fight the intruders and sends special cells to eat them up 

Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess enzyme systems that protect against viral infections Other basic immune mechanisms appeared in ancient life forms and remain in their modern descendants such as plants and insects These mechanisms include antimicrobial peptides called defensins phagocytosis and the complement system These are the innate immune system which defends the host from infections in a non specific way The simplest innate system is the cell wall or barrier on the outside to stop intruders getting in For example skin stops most outside bacteria getting in

Vertebrates including humans have much more sophisticated defense mechanisms Whereas the innate immune system is found in all metazoa the adaptive immune system is only found in vertebrates It is thought to have arisen in the first jawed vertebrates

The adaptive immune response gives the vertebrate immune system the ability to recognize and remember specific pathogens The system mounts stronger attacks each time the pathogen is encountered It is adaptive immunity because the bodys immune system prepares itself for future challenges

The typical vertebrate immune system consists of many types of proteins cells organs and tissues that interact in a complex and ever changing network The acquired immunity and creates akind of immunological memory 

This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination Primary response can take 2 days to even 2 weeks to develop After the body gains immunity towards a certain pathogen when infection by that pathogen occurs again the immune response is called the secondary response

In some organisms the immune system has its own problems within itself called disorders These result in other diseases including autoimmune diseases inflammatory diseases and possibly even cancer Immunodeficiency diseases occur when the immune system is less active than normal Immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease or an infection such as the acquired immune deficiency syndrome that is caused by the retrovirus HIV or other causes 

In contrast autoimmune diseases result from an immune system that attacks normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimotos thyroiditis rheumatoid arthritis diabetes mellitus type 1 and lupus erythematosus

Immunology is the study of all aspects of the immune system It is very important to health and diseases

Immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease The earliest known mention of immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of some diseases could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time In the 18th century Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom This and other observations of acquired immunity was later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed Germ theory of disease Pasteurs theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease such as the miasma theory It was not until the proofs of Robert Koch published in 1891 for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905 that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901 with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by Walter Reed

Immunology made a great advance towards the end of the 19th century through rapid developments in the study of humoral immunity and cellular immunity Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich who proposed the side chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen antibody reaction his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908 which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular immunology Ilya Mechnikov

Sulfur hexafluoride also known as sulfur fluoride is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is SF6 It contains sulfur in its 6 oxidation state It also contains fluoride ions

Sulfur hexafluoride is a colorless odorless gas It is very heavy for a gas It is non reactive and hard to find anything that reacts with it It is a strong greenhouse gas This has made people put some restrictions on using it

It is made by reacting sulfur with fluorine That combination also makes toxic disulfur decafluoride which has to be removed

It is used in electronics and various electrical devices It can be used in the body since it is not toxic It can be used as a test gas to look where gas flows in a heater system for example It is detected easily It is used in some torpedoes Lithium is one of the only things that reacts with sulfur hexafluoride Sulfur hexafluoride is sprayed on lithium This makes the lithium very hot It creates steam from water and shoots the torpedo It can be breathed in to make the voice deeper This is the opposite of breathing in helium gas

Sulfur hexafluoride is not toxic It can fill up in closed spaces though A person may suffocate in the closed space if sulfur hexafluoride has pushed out the oxygen from the space

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change chemSF6 is the most potent greenhouse gas that it has evaluated with a global warming potential of 22800 times that of 2 when compared over a 100 year period Measurements of SF6 show that its global average mixing ratio has increased by about 02 ppt per year to over 7 ppt Sulfur hexafluoride is also extremely long lived It is inert in the troposphere and stratosphere It has an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 8003200 years chemSF6 is very stable Average global SF6 concentrations increased by about seven percent per year during the 1980s and 1990s mostly as the result of its use in the magnesium production industry and by electrical utilities and electronics manufacturers Given the low amounts of SF6 released compared to carbon dioxide its overall contribution to global warming is estimated to be less than 02 percentCitation neededdateAugust 2010

In Europe chemSF6 falls under the F Gas directive which ban or control its use in several ways Since 1 January 2006 chemSF6 is banned as a tracer gas and in all applications except high voltage switchgear

The Turdidae are a family of passerine songbirds the thrushes It includes the common Song Thrush and the Blackbird

The Paridae is a family of tiny birds the tits They are passerine songbirds which are native to the northern hemisphere and Africa Most of them used to be classified in the genus Parus which has now been split up

These birds are mainly small stocky woodland species with short stout bills Some have crests They range in length from 10 to 22 centimetres They are adaptable birds with a mixed diet including seeds and insects 

Many species will live around human habitation and come readily to bird feeders for nuts or seed and learn to take other foods In Britain Great Tits and Blue Tits learned to break through the foil caps sealing bottles of milk on doorsteps to get at the cream on top Of course the change in milk packaging has robbed them of this delicacy

These are hole nesting birds typically using trees although some species build nests on the ground They lay anything from three to nineteen speckled white eggs depending on species

The tits are active noisy social birds They are territorial during the breeding season The tits are highly adaptable and after the corvids and parrots amongst the most intelligent of all birds

The tits make a variety of calls and songs They are amongst the most vocal of all birds calling continuously and loudly They are only ever silent for reasons such as avoiding predators or when intruding on a rivals territory Quiet calls are made while feeding to keep contact with others in their social group Other calls are used for signalling alarmthe most famous of which is the Chic a dee dee of North American species in the genus Poecile The call also serves a rallying call to summon others to mob and harass the predator It has been demonstrated through experiments that the number of dee syllables at the end of the call increases with the level of danger the predator poses

The tits are insectivorous and eat a wide range of small insects and other invertebrates particularly small leaf eating caterpillars They also eat seeds and nuts especially in winter A typical activity is hanging where they inspect a branch or twig and leaves from all angles while hanging upside down to feed 

In areas with several species of tit the different species will forage in different parts of a tree Larger species forage on the ground medium sized species forage on larger branches and the smallest species on the ends of branches If they get larger prey or seeds tits will engage in hold hammering They hold the item with one foot and hammer it with the bill until it is open In this way they can open hazelnuts in 20 minutes A number of genera engage in food caching hoarding supplies of food during the winter These caches are usually of seeds but may be of insects

Sulfur tetrafluoride also known as sulfur fluoride is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is SF4 It contains sulfur in its 4 oxidation state

Sulfur tetrafluoride is a colorless gas It is toxic and corrosive It releases hydrogen fluoride when exposed to water

Mary Quant OBE FCSD is a British fashion designer In 1963 she won the Sunday Times International Fashion Award and was chosen as Woman of the Year 

She was instrumental in the mod fashion movement and one of the designers who took credit for inventing the miniskirt and hot pants Born to Welsh parents Quant went to Blackheath High School then studied illustration at Goldsmiths College before taking a career with a couture milliner She is also famed for her work on pop art in fashion

In November 1955 she teamed up with her husband Alexander Plunkett Grene and a former solicitor Archie McNair to open a clothes shop on the Kings Road in Chelsea called Bazaar Bazaars best sellers were small white plastic collars to brighten up black dresses or t shirts Black stretch stockings were also popular

Skirts had been getting shorter since about 1958 a development Mary Quant thought was practical and liberating allowing women to run for a bus The miniskirt which she is most famous for became one of the defining fashions of the 1960s The miniskirt was also developed separately by Andr Courrges and John Bates and there is disagreement as to who came up with the idea first Like most fashion the short and ever shorter skirt was evolving already among individual fashion minded young women The designers who adapted it just helped spread the style and in Quants case gave it a name Mary Quant named the miniskirt after her favorite make of car the Mini She loved the car so much she had one designed especially for her

Quants first collection of underwear was designed to be worn with the miniskirt look She renamed the basics booby traps and bacon savers which appealed to her young customers 

In addition to the miniskirt Mary Quant is often credited with inventing the coloured and patterned tights that often went with the miniskirt These are also attributed to Cristobal Balenciaga or John Bates 

Tights worn over briefs or bikini panties were an essential accessory to the miniskirt because the older method of stockings plus suspenders was no longer suitable and legs need to be covered for most of the year in Britain Often there would be a second pair of coloured short pants on top of the tights for show A range of materials and colours were used for the tights

In the late 1960s Quant popularised hot pants Through the 1970s and 1980s she concentrated on household goods and make up rather than just her clothing lines At a talk at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2007 she claimed to have invented duvet covers

She is a Fellow of the Chartered Society of Designers and winner of the Minerva Medal the Societys highest award

In 2000 she resigned as director of Mary Quant Ltd her cosmetics company after a Japanese buy out There are over 200 Mary Quant Colour shops in Japan where Quant fashions continue to enjoy popularity

Romo et Juliette is a French opera in five acts by Charles Gounod first performed in Paris on April 27 1867 libretto by Jules Barbier et Michel Carr after Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet One of Gounods most successful works it contains his most beautiful and melodious music It is still regularly performed 

Roberta Peters is an American soprano who enjoyed a long and successful career at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City She was particularly associated with light coloratura roles in Italian French and German operas 

Born Roberta Peterman in New York City she began vocal study at the age of 13 with William Herman encouraged by tenor Jan Peerce a family friend 

She made her unscheduled debut at the Metropolitan Opera on November 17 1950 as Zerlina in Don Giovanni aged only 20 Her well schooled voice good looks and charming personality quickly made her a great favorite of this theatre where she was to sing regularly for 35 seasons

Some of her most performed roles include Susanna Despina The Queen of the Night Rosina Adina Norina Lucia Gilda Oscar Nanetta Olympia Sophie Zerbinetta etc

She also appeared abroad notably at the Royal Opera House in London in 1951 as Arline in The Bohemian Girl and later appeared at the Vienna State Opera the Salzburg Festival the Bolshoi in Moscow She also made several appearances on television notably on The Ed Sullivan Show 

Roberta Peters retired from the stage in 1985 but continued to give recital until recent years She was briefly married to baritone Robert Merrill

Hannibal Alkhas was a sculptor painter and author He was born in 1930 in Iran into an ethnic Assyrian and Christian family and spent his childhood and teenage years in Kermanshah Ahwaz and Tehran In 1951 Hannibal Alkhas moved to the United States in pursuit of his education and studied philosophy for three years at Loyola University of Chicago Illinois

From 1953 to 1958 he attended the Art Institute of Chicago where he earned his Bachelors and Masters of Fine Arts

In 1959 after the death of his father the famous Assyrian writer Rabi Adai Alkhas Hannibal Alkhas returned to Iran and began to teach painting drawing and art history at the Tehran School of Fine Arts for the next four years During this time he established the successful Gilgamesh gallery the first modern art gallery in Iran where aspiring young artists were introduced In 1963 he returned to the United States and taught a Monticello College in Illinois where he became the chairman of the art department

He teach at Islamic Azad University in Iran

Hannibal Alkhas has also created book illustrations written poems and translated many poems to and from Assyrian His works have been displayed in numerous exhibitions in Iran Europe Canada Australia and the US

Hannibal Alkhas died on September 14 2010 at the age of 80 in the United States He was suffering from cancer

The Blue Tit Cyanistes caeruleus is a passerine songbird in the family Paridae It is 105 to 12 cm long 

The Blue Tit is a widespread and common resident breeder It lives throughout temperate and subarctic Europe and western Asia in deciduous or mixed woodlands It is a resident bird most do not migrate

Blue and Great Tits form mixed winter flocks and the former are perhaps the better gymnasts on the slender twigs A Blue Tit will often ascend a trunk in short jerky hops imitating a Treecreeper As a rule the bird roosts in ivy or evergreens but in hard weather will shelter in a hole Blue tits are very agile and can hang from almost anywhere

The Blue Tit has an average life expectancy of 15 years 

The Blue Tit is a destroyer of pests It is fond of young buds of various trees and may pull them to bits in the hope of finding insects No species however destroys more coccids and aphids the worst foes of many plants It also eats leaf miner grubs and green tortrix moths Seeds are eaten as with all this family

An interesting example of culturally transmitted learning in birds was the phenomenon dating from the 1960s of Blue Tits teaching one another how to open traditional British Milk bottles with foil tops to get at the cream underneath This behaviour has declined recently because of the replacement of doorstep delivery by supermarket purchases of milk and by hard topped containers instead of the old bottles

Silver sulfide also known as silver sulfide and silver sulphide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Ag2S It contains silver in its 1 oxidation state It also contains sulfide ions

It is a black solid It reacts with acids It is heavy It can irritate the skin

It exists in the ground as acanthite and argentite It is also made when silver is in air containing hydrogen sulfide The oxygen in air cannot oxidize the silver directly the hydrogen sulfide helps it It is the tarnish on silver items

It is mostly an unwanted product when silver tarnishes

Silver nitrate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is AgNO3 It contains silver in its 1 oxidation state as an ion It also has nitrate

Silver nitrate is a colorless crystalline solid It dissolves in water Most silver compounds do not dissolve in water It can get dark if light shines on it It is an oxidizing agent Most of the times the silver ion is reduced but sometimes the nitrate ion is reduced It reacts with copper to make silver crystals and copper nitrate It turns into silver nitrogen dioxide and oxygen when it is heated It is the least expensive silver compound It reacts with bases to make dark brown silver oxide

It is made by dissolving silver in nitric acid This produces nitrogen dioxide so it should be done where the person can get fresh air

It was used to separate silver and gold Gold does not dissolve in nitric acid It is used to make other silver compounds It reacts with chloride bromide and iodides to make white cream and yellow colored solids It is also used as an oxidizing agent It can also be used to kill germs 

Silver nitrate is an oxidizing agent and should be kept away from chemicals that can burn It can burn and stain skin If too much is eaten it can turn the skin blue

Smokey Bear is a mascot of the United States Forest Service He was made to teach people that forest fires are dangerous and how people can prevent An advertising campaign featuring Smokey was started in 1944 with the slogan Smokey Says Care Will Prevent 9 out of 10 Forest Fires Smokey Bears later slogan Remember Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires was made in 1947 by the Ad Council In April 2001 the message was changed to Only You Can Prevent Wildfires According to the Ad Council Smokey Bear and his message are recognized by 95 of adults and 77 of children in the US

Smokeys correct name is Smokey Bear In 1952 the songwriters Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins made a famous song named Smokey the Bear The pair said that the was added to Smokeys name to keep the songs rhythm This small change has made people confused ever since Smokeys name is spelled differently from the word smoky on purpose 

The fictional character Smokey Bear is run by three groups the United States Forest Service the National Association of State Foresters and the Ad Council Smokey Bears name and image are protected by US federal law the Smokey Bear Act of 1952

Though the US Forest Service fought wildfires long before World War II the war made doing it even more important The forest service began using colorful posters to teach Americans about the dangers of forest fires Since most physically fit men who were able to already were serving in the armed forces there were few people who could stay back and put them out as a job The hope was that local communities educated about the danger of forest fires could prevent them from starting in the first place However Japan saw wildfires as a possible weapon Forest fires could waste the time of people in the United States who could otherwise be involved in the war They could also destroy natural resources

The government made advertisements about fire safety It decided to use a bear in the advertisement The bear was named Smokey after Smokey Joe Martin a New York City Fire Department hero who suffered burns and blindness during a brave 1922 rescue 

Smokeys first poster was released on August 9 1944 It was drawn by Albert Staehle In the poster Smokey was wearing jeans and a forest rangers hat pouring a bucket of water on a campfire The message underneath reads Smokey says Care will prevent 9 out of 10 forest fires Knickerbocker Bears got a license to make Smokey bear dolls in 1944 Also in 1944 Forest Service worker Rudy Wendelin became the full time campaign artist he was considered Smokey Bears caretaker until he retired in 1973

In 1947 the saying now associated with Smokey Bear was first said Rememberonly YOU can prevent forest fires

The living symbol of Smokey Bear was an American black bear who in the spring of 1950 was caught in the Capitan Gap fire a wildfire that burned convert17000acrekm2 in the Capitan Mountains of New Mexico The cub was in the Lincoln National Forest Smokey had climbed a tree to get away from the fire but his paws and hind legs had been burned He was rescued by a game warden after the fire

At first he was called Hotfoot Teddy but he was later renamed Smokey after the mascot A local rancher who had been helping fight the fire took the cub home with him but he needed care from a veterinarian New Mexico Department of Game and Fish Ranger Ray Bell took him to Santa Fe His wife Ruth and their children Don and Judy took care of the cub News services around the country wrote stories about the cub and he became famous Soon after Smokey was flown in a Piper Cub airplane to the National Zoo in Washington DC where he lived for 26 years After he died on November 9 1976 Smokeys remains were returned by the government to Capitan New Mexico and buried at what is now the Smokey Bear Historical Park

The character became a big part of American popular culture in the 1950s He appeared on radio programs in comic strips and in cartoons

In 1952 Congress passed the Smokey Bear Act an act of Congress was passed to remove the character from the public domain and place it under the control of the Secretary of Agriculture This meant that people had to have permission from the government to use pictures of Smokey The act 

In 2004 Smokeys 60th anniversary was celebrated According to Richard Earle author of The Art of Cause Marketing the Smokey Bear campaign is recognized one of the most powerful and lasting of all public service advertising Smokey is simple strong straightforward Earle writes Hes a denizen of those woods youre visiting and he cares about preserving them Anyone who grew up watching Bambi realizes how terrifying a forest fire can be But Smokey wouldnt run away Smokeys strong Hell stay and fight the fire if necessary but hed rather have you douse it and cover it up so he doesnt have to

In 2009 new commercials with Smokey made in CGI came out

Burt Munro was a motorcycle racer from New Zealand He began riding motorcycles when he was 15 He is famous for setting a world record on 26 August 1967 with his motorcycle

Lilongwe River is a river in Malawi flowing through Lilongwe Its length is near 200 kms and at mouth of the Lilongwe River is as lake called the Malawi Lake

Finches are passerine songbirds in the family Fringillidae They are mostly seed eaters The scientific name Fringillidae comes from the Latin word fringilla for the Chaffinch which is common in Europe

Most species are native to the Southern Hemisphere but one subfamily is endemic to the Neotropics one to the Hawaiian Islands and one genus is found only in the Palaearctic 

Many birds in other families are also commonly called finches They include 

Some species are being imported or smuggled into other countries and sold as exotic pets

Third Way tries to create consensus that restores friendly relations between the two parties right wing and left wing in an effort to settle their differing standpoints

Supporters of the Third Way include Bill Clinton and Tony Blair

The Red Ribbon Foundation is an organization that helps people with HIV andor AIDS Their key word is Fight Against AIDS This organazation was identified in 1993

Silver fluoride also known as argentic fluoride is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is AgF2 It has silver in its 2 oxidation state It also contains fluoride ions

It is a white or gray crystalline solid It is usually black or brown because of impurities It is a powerful oxidizing agent It is one of the only silver compounds that is in the 2 oxidation state Most of the silver compounds are in the 1 oxidation state It can react with glass It should be stored in certain fluorinated plastics 

It is extremely reactive It reacts with xenon It also reacts with water to make oxygen and hydrofluoric acid It reacts with acids to make ozone It reacts with iodide to make iodide It also reacts with hydrogen peroxide to make oxygen 

It is very expensive Only a little is made each year

Silver fluoride is made by reacting fluorine with silver oxide It can also be made by reacting silver fluoride or silver chloride with fluorine

Silver fluoride is used to add fluoride to certain chemical compounds It is not used much because it is very expensive 

Silver fluoride is very corrosive and toxic It reacts with water to make toxic hydrofluoric acid It also corrodes glass

Katrina cottages are small houses designed and marketed in the United States in the wake of Hurricane Katrina They were designed as a response to the inadequacies of the trailers issued to flood victims by the Federal Emergency Management Agency The homes are designed to attempt to fulfill the needs of their occupants in a more permanent and weather resistant manner while addressing the challenges of building and protecting a home in the Gulf Coast region Some of the homes are elevated on stilts particularly in southern Louisiana and Mississippi where much of the land currently used is near sea level protected by levees or prone to flooding by nearby rivers or coastal storm surges or high tides

Though designs differ somewhat the main factor for appearance is that Katrina cottages look like traditional homes in the area reduced in size to lower costs and ease construction so that multiple units can be built quickly as needed The Katrina cottages are usually one bedroom shotgun house designs with a front porch that helps stabilize the house from strong winds Hence they tend to be smaller than many house trailers which have 2 or 3 bedrooms however the cottages are constructed of heavier materials to resist winds that would buckle the light weight walls of mobile homes

The best known of these designs are those by Marianne Cusato whose original Katrina Cottage made the term popular and received in 2006 the first annual Peoples Design Award from the Cooper Hewitt Museum of the US Smithsonian Institution As Cusatos design and others gained increasing media attention the number of designs has increased The home improvement retailer Lowes offers pre packaged Katrina Cottage kits including plans and all materials needed for construction A Federal Emergency Management Agency pilot program accommodating 900 Mississippi coast families encountered some opposition from local government officials opposed to permanent small housing units although Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour urged local officials to accept the cottages as safer than trailers in high winds or moderate floods

Silver fluoride can refer to either of these chemical compounds

Silver fluoride is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is AgF It contains silver in its 1 oxidations state It also contains fluoride ions 

It is a yellow brown solid It can turn black when in moist air It dissolves easily in water It is an oxidizing agent because of the silver ion 

It is made by reacting silver carbonate with hydrofluoric acid

It is used to add fluoride to organic compounds

Silver compounds can stain skin They are also oxidizing agents and should be kept away from metal

Silver carbonate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Ag2CO3 It contains silver in its 1 oxidation state It also contains carbonate ions

It is a yellow solid It reacts with acids to make carbon dioxide and a silver salt It does not dissolve in water

It is made by reacting sodium carbonate with silver nitrate

It is used as a catalyst

Silver compounds can irritate skin If consumed they may turn the skin blue

Silver chloride is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is AgCl It contains silver in its 1 oxidation state It also contains chloride ions

It is a white crystalline solid It does not dissolve in water When it is exposed to light it turns back into silver and chlorine It dissolves in several solutions such as ammonia 

It can be made by reacting a common chloride such as sodium chloride with silver nitrate

It is used in photographic film It darkens when exposed to light which makes a picture It is also used in electrochemistry It is used as a disinfectant in bandages It is also used to make stained glass It can be used when someone is poisoned with mercury

It can irritate skin It can also stain the skin It is a weak oxidizing agent

Silver bromide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is AgBr It contains silver in its 1 oxidation state It also contains bromide ions

It is a light yellow solid It does not dissolve in water It darkens when light shines on it The darkening is because it turns into silver metal and bromine gas It reacts with ammonia to dissolve 

It is made by reacting a bromide such as potassium bromide or sodium bromide with silver nitrate

Potassium bromide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is KBr It contains potassium and bromide ions

It is a white crystalline solid It dissolves easily in water When it is dilute it tastes sweet when it is a little concentrated it tastes bitter when it is very concentrated it tastes salty This taste is because of the potassium ion 

It can be made by reacting hydrogen bromide with potassium carbonate or potassium hydroxide It can also be made by reacting bromine and potassium metal This is very difficult though

It is used to put people to sleep It is also used to stop convulsions This is because of the bromide ion not the potassium ion It is used to make silver bromide It is used to treat various animals 

Bromide ions can be toxic in large amounts Potassium ions can burn similar to salt when someone eats too much

Silver iodide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is AgI It contains silver in its 1 oxidation state It also contains iodide ions

Silver iodide is a yellow solid It does not dissolve in water It turns dark when light is shined on it The darkening is caused by a chemical reaction The silver iodide turns into silver and iodine

It is made by reacting an iodide such as sodium iodide with silver nitrate

Silver iodide is sprinkled in clouds to make rain It can also be used in photographic film

Silver iodide is toxic It can stain skin It is not as toxic as other silver compounds that dissolve in water The iodide also is toxic

Drosera regia also known as the King sundew is a carnivorous plant of the sundew family In the wild it only grows in two places in a single valley in South Africa Its leaves can grow to a size of 70 cm in length It also has features which are not found in many other sundews such as wooded rhizomes and special covered pollen These features have been combined with a genetic analysis and it was found that D regia is among the older species of sundew The Venus Flytrap another carnivorous plant shares some of the features which suggests a close relationship between the two 

The leaves of the plant are covered with tentacles They are able to capture large prey such as beetles moths and butterflies The tentacles of all Drosera species are specialized glands capable of producing sticky mucus The leaves are active flypaper traps they capture prey by surrounding it In its native habitat the plants compete for space with native marsh grasses and low evergreen shrubs There are two known populations of the plant in the wild The higher altitude site is overgrown and D regia no longer grows there On the lower altitude site there are about 50 mature plants For this reason D regia is the most endangered Drosera species since it is threatened with extinction in the wild It is often grown by people who like carnivorous plants and a single cultivar Big Easy has been registered

Traction motor refers to a type of electric motor A traction motor is used to make rotation torque on a machine It is usually changed into a straight line motion

Traction motors are used in electrically powered rail vehicles such as electric multiple units and electric locomotives They are also used in electric vehicles such as electric milk floats elevators and conveyors Vehicles with electrical transmission systems such as Diesel electric locomotives electric hybrid vehicles and battery powered electric vehicles 

Railroad first used DC motors These motors usually ran on about 600 volts High powered semiconductors were developed to control the switching of AC motors They have made AC induction motors a better choice An induction motor does not require contacts inside the motor These AC motors are simpler and more reliable than the old DC motors AC induction motors known as asynchronous traction motors 

Before the mid 20th century a single large motor was often used to drive multiple wheels through connecting rods This was the same way that steam locomotives would turn their drive wheels Now the normal practice is to use one traction motor to drive each axle through a gear drive

Usually the traction motor is mounted between the wheel frame and the driven axle This is called a nose suspended traction motor The problem with this mounting is that some of the motors weight is on the axle This causes the track and frame to wear out faster The Bi Polar electric locomotives built by General Electric for the Milwaukee Road had direct drive motors The rotating shaft of the motor was also the axle for the wheels 

The DC motor is made in two parts the rotating armature and the fixed field windings The field windings also called the stator surrounds the armature The field windings are made of tightly wound coils of wire inside the motor case The armature also called the rotor is another set of coils of wire wound round the central shaft The armature is connected to the field windings through brushes The brushes are spring loaded contacts pressing against the commutator The commutator sends the electricity in a circular pattern to armature windings A series wound motor has the armature and the field windings connected in series A series wound DC motor has a low electrical resistance When voltage is applied to the motor it makes a strong magnetic field inside the motor This produces a high amount of torque so it is good for starting a train If more current than needed is sent to the motor there would be too much torque and the wheels would spin If too much current is sent to the motor it could damage the motor Resistors are used to limit the current when the motor starts

As the DC motor starts to turn the magnetic fields inside start to join together They create an internal voltage This electromagnetic force works against the voltage sent to the motor The EMF controls the current flow in the motor As the motor speeds up the EMF falls Less current flows into the motor and it makes less torque The motor will stop increasing its speed when the torque matches the drag on the train To accelerate the train more voltage must be sent to the motor One or more resistors are removed to increase the voltage This will increase the current The torque will increase and so will the speed of the train When no resistors are left in the circuit full line voltage is applied directly to the motor 

On an electric train the train driver originally had to control the speed by changing the resistance manually By 1914 automatic acceleration was being used This was achieved by an accelerating relay in the motor circuit This was often called a notching relay The relay would watch the fall of current and control the resistance All the driver had to do was select low medium or full speed These speeds are called shunt series and parallel from the way the motors were wired

Traditionally road vehicles have used diesel or gasoline engines with a transmission In the latter part of the 20th century vehicles with electrical transmission systems began to be developed These vehicles have a source of electricity from batteries or fuel cells They may also be powered by an internal combustion engines 

A benefit from using electric motors is that some types can generate energy They act as a dynamo during braking This helps improve the efficiency of the vehicle

Because of the high power levels used by traction motors they create a lot of heat They usually require colling often with forced air

Silver compounds are chemical compounds containing silver ions Silver exists in two main oxidation states 1 and 2 The 1 is much more common Silver compounds can be brown black yellow gray or colorless

Silver compounds are oxidizing agents They are more common Most of them are very expensive

Silver compounds are powerful oxidizing agents and rare

Morelia viridis also called the green tree python is a species of python found in New Guinea islands in Indonesia and Cape York Peninsula in Australia

Quotation marks or inverted commas are punctuation marks used in pairs to set off speech a quotation a phrase or a word They are used in groups of 2 as a pair of opening and closing marks in either of two forms single or double

Depending on the typeface the opening and closing quotation marks may be identical in form or they may be distinctly left handed and right handed The closing single quotation mark is identical or similar in form to the apostrophe and similar to the prime symbol These three characters have quite different purposes however See also ditto mark 

Single or double quotation marks show the text as meaning either speech or a quotation Neither stylesingle or doubleis an absolute rule though double quotation marks are preferred in the United States and both single and double quotation marks are used often in the United Kingdom A publishers or authors style can be considered as more important than national general preferences The important rule is that the style of opening and closing quotation marks must be matched

For speech within speech the other mark is used for the inner quotation marks

Sometimes quotations are nested in more levels than inner and outer quotation Nesting levels up to five can be found in the Bible In these cases questions arise about the form of the quotation marks to be used The most common way is to simply alternate between the two forms thus

If such a passage is further quoted in another publication then all of their forms have to be shifted over by one level

In most cases quotations which span multiple paragraphs should be set as block quotations and thus do not require quotation marks Quotation marks are used for multiple paragraph quotations in some cases especially in narratives The convention in English is to put an opening quotation mark at the first and each subsequent paragraph but use a closing quotation mark only for the final paragraph of the quotation as in the following example from the book Pride and Prejudice

My dear Lizzy

I wish you joy If you love Mr Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham you must be very happy It is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do I hope you will think of us I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help Any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to Mr Darcy about it if you had rather not

As noted below in some older texts the quotation mark is repeated every line rather than every paragraph The Spanish convention uses closing quotation marks at the beginning of all subsequent paragraphs beyond the first

When quoted text is interrupted such as with the phrase he said a closing quotation mark is used before the interruption and an opening quotation mark after Commas are also often used before and after the interruption more often for quotations of speech than for quotations of text

It is incorrect to use quotation marks for paraphrased speech This is because a paraphrase is not a direct quote and in the course of any composition it is important to document when one is using a quotation versus when one is using a paraphrased idea

If HAL says All systems are functional then

However another convention when quoting text in the body of a paragraph or sentencefor example in an essayis to recognize double quotation marks as marking an exact quotation and single quotation marks as marking a paraphrased quotation or a quotation where grammar pronouns or plurality have been changed in order to fit the sentence containing the quotation

Another common use of quotation marks is to indicate or call attention to ironic or apologetic words

To avoid the potential for confusion between ironic quotes and direct quotations some style guides specify single quotation marks for this usage and double quotation marks for verbatim speech Quotes indicating irony or other special use are sometimes called scare sneer shock distance or horror quotes They are sometimes gestured in oral speech using air quotes

Quotation marks are also used to indicate that the writer realizes that a word is not being used in its current commonly accepted sense

In addition to conveying a neutral attitude and to call attention to a neologism or slang or special terminology quoting can also indicate words or phrases that are descriptive but unusual colloquial folksy startling humorous metaphoric or contain a pun

Dawkinss concept of a meme could be described as an evolving idea

People also use quotation marks in this way to

The Chicago Manual of Style 15th edition acknowledges this type of use but cautions against overuse in section 758 Quotation marks are often used to alert readers that a term is used in a nonstandard ironic or other special sense They imply This is not my term or This is not how the term is usually applied Like any such device scare quotes lose their force and irritate readers if overused

Using either quotation marks or italics can emphasize that an instance of a word refers to the word itself rather than its associated concept

A three way distinction is occasionally made between normal use of a word referring to the concept behind the word and the word itself

The logic for this form derives from the need to distinguish use forms coupled with the mandate to retain consistent notation for like use forms The switching between double and single quotes in nested citation quotes reveals the same literary device for reducing ambiguity

Books about language often use italics for the word itself and single quotation marks for a gloss

In common usage there may be a distinction between the single and double quotation marks in this context often single quotation marks are used to embrace single characters while double quotation marks enclose whole words or phrases

The two may however in these cases be to some degree interchangeable

Quotation marks rather than italics are generally used for the titles of shorter works Whether these are single or double is again a matter of style however many styles especially for poetry prefer the use of single quotation marks

As a rule a whole publication would be italicised whereas the titles of minor works would be written with quotation marks

Quotation marks can also offset a nickname embedded in an actual name or a false or ironic title embedded in an actual title for example Nat King Cole Miles Tails Prower or John Hannibal Smith

Quotes are sometimes used incorrectly for emphasis in lieu of underlining or italics most commonly on signs or placards This usage can be confused with ironic or altered usage quotation sometimes with unintended humor For example For sale fresh fish fresh oysters could be construed to imply that fresh is not used with its everyday meaning or indeed to indicate that the fish or oysters are anything but fresh And again Cashiers desks open until noon for your convenience might mean that the convenience was for the bank employees not the customers

Haute couture is a French term for high fashion It refers to the creation of exclusive custom fitted clothing The term refers to 

Haute couture is made to order for a specific customer It is usually made from high quality expensive fabric and sewn with extreme attention to detail and finish by the most experienced and capable seamstresses often using time consuming hand executed techniques Couture is a common abbreviation of haute couture

In France haute couture is une appellation juridiquement protge It may only be used by firms which meet certain well defined standards However the term is also used to describe all high fashion custom fitted clothing in other fashion capitals such as Milan London New York Tokyo and Madrid 

The couturier Charles Frederick Worth is widely considered the father of haute couture as it is known today Although born in Lincolnshire England Worth made his mark in the French fashion industry He revolutionized how dressmaking was oranised Worth made it so the dressmaker became an artist a fashion designer He created one of a kind designs to please his titled or wealthy customers More importantly he prepared designs which were shown on live models at the House of Worth Clients selected a design specified colours and fabrics and had a version tailor made in Worths workshop Worth combined individual tailoring with a standardization more characteristic of the ready to wear clothing industry which was also developing during this period

To earn the right to call itself a couture house and to use the term haute couture members of the Chambre syndicale de la haute couture must follow these rules

Membership is seldom given Outside the Chambre syndicale are many successful fashion houses which deal in prt porter They have their own Chambre syndicale du prt porter

Joanna Newsom is an indie singer and a harpist She was born in Nevada City California in 1982

When Night is Falling is a 1995 Canadian drama movie It is about a university professor dealing with a bad relationship who gets confused when she starts having romantic feelings for a female circus 

The MPAA rated the movie as NC 17 The movie was released without a rating rather deal with the problems of being rated as NC 17The movie was later released with two versions the original unrated version and an R rated version Patricia Rozema directed the movie

Hurricane Bob struck North Carolina and southeast New England during August of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season It was caused by a tropical depression in the Bahamas which came inland and turned into a hurricane Bob took 18 lives injured 190 and created 21 billion in damage The storm was one of the worst hurricanes to impact the New England during the 20th Century the 1938 hurricane being the worst of them Bob was strong for a Category 3 hurricane

A Nithing pole according to ancient Scandinavian and Germanic pagan beliefs was a kind of pole used for cursing enemies 

The way of cursing was supposed to be to cut a horses head from its body and put it on top of the pole Cursing words were carved into the wood too This was done to stop the soul of a cowardly person or Nithing Also the terrible shame of the coward was called Nith 

Imber is a village in Wiltshire England which has no people It is on Salisbury Plain a flat area in Southern England The people of Imber were moved out in 1943 and rehoused elsewhere The whole area was needed as a training ground for the military Imber is now part of the British Armys largest training area in England

The area around Imber has been settled since the iron age before the Romans came to Britain The first mention of the village was in Saxon times in 967 The village is also listed in the Domesday Book At that time around fifty people lived there The village has a church that was bulit in the 13th century In the 14th century about 250 people lived in the village In 1851 the population reached its peak at about 440 people When they left in 1943 about 150 people had to move

An emoticon is a written symbol often as 2 or 3 punctuation characters representing a writers mood or facial expression Some examples are a smile  or wink  or frown There is some debate as to whether it is a typo a legitimate form of punctuation or an emoticon

Typographical emoticons were published in 1881 by the US satirical magazine Puck In 1912 Ambrose Bierce created something called a snigger point It is written thus and presents a smiling mouth

Emoticons had already come into use in sci fi fandom in the 1940s although there seems to have been a lapse in cultural continuity between the communities

In 1963 the smiley face a yellow button with two black dots representing eyes and an upturned thick curve representing a mouth was created by freelance artist Harvey Ball This smiley presumably inspired many later emoticons the most basic graphic emoticon that depicts this is in fact a small yellow smiley face

In a New York Times interview in April 1969 Alden Whitman asked writer Vladimir Nabokov How do you rank yourself among writers and of the immediate past Nabokov answered I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile some sort of concave mark a supine round bracket which I would now like to trace in reply to your question

As early early as 1973 or earlier teletype machine users used emoticons to express themselves Teletypes were limited to the keys of a standard typewriter keyboard plus a few special characters Teletype operators developed a sort of shorthand to communicate among themselves These shorthand notations became the foundation of emoticons as video terminals began to replace teletypes in general use

By the early 1970s people on the PLATO System were using emoticons They had many of the advantages of later character based emoticons because they could be used anywhere that you could type text They also had many of the advantages of later graphical emoticons because they used character overstriking which created graphical images

Several Internet websites such as BTs Connected Earth assert that Kevin Mackenzie proposed  as a joke marker in April 1979 on the MsgGroup ARPANET mailing list The idea was to indicate tongue in cheek with the hyphen represented a tongue not a nose

In regard to your message a few days ago concerning the loss of meaning in this medium

I am new here and thus hesitate to comment but I too have suffered from the lack of tone gestures facial expressions etc May I suggest the beginning of a solution Perhaps we could extend the set of punctuation we use ie

If I wish to indicate that a particular sentence is meant with tongue in cheek I would write it so

This idea is not mine but stolen from a Readers Digest article I read long ago on a completely different subject Im sure there are many other better ways to improve our punctuation

Any comments

Kevin 

Others used  for tongue in cheek with the colon representing teeth Also used was  to indicate sticking out your tongue in derision or anger  Although similar to a sideways smiling face the intended interpretation was different and this does not appear to have inspired the later smileys

In the late sixties the APL programming language and timesharing environment with its rich character set with backspace and overstrike capability provided a fruitful arena for interactive and creative symbol invention Union backspace dieresis was a recognised and upright smiley in the early seventies

 19 Sep 82 1144  Scott E Fahlman        From Scott E Fahlman 

I propose that the following character sequence for joke markers

Read it sideways Actually it is probably more economical to mark things that are NOT jokes given current trends For this use

Within a few months it had spread to the ARPANET and Usenet Many variations on the theme were immediately suggested by Scott and others

In web forums instant messengers and online games text emoticons are often automatically replaced with small corresponding images which also came to be called Emoticons Similarly in some versions of Microsoft Word the Auto Correct feature replaces basic smileys such as  and  In general similar looking characters are commonly substituted for one another for instance o O and 0 can all be used interchangeably sometimes for subtly different effect In some cases one type of character may look better in a certain font and therefore be preferred over another

Some variants are also more common in certain countries because of reasons like keyboard layouts for example the smiley is common in Scandinavia where the keys for and are placed right beside each other Also sometimes the user can replace the brackets used for the mouth with other similar shapes such as and instead of and 

Diacritical marks are sometimes used An O or U with an umlaut  can be seen as an emoticon as the upright version of O and D nwn

Users from East Asia popularized a style of emoticons that can be understood without tilting ones head to the left This style arose on ASCII NET of Japan in 1986 Similar looking emoticons were used by Byte Information Exchange around the same time

These emoticons are usually found in a format similar to The asterisks indicate the eyes the central character commonly an underscore the mouth and the parentheses the outline of the face Two separate studies in 2007 at Hokkaido University and in 2009 at Glasgow University showed that Japanese and other East Asians read facial expressions by looking mainly at the eyes and the researchers noted that this is reflected in East Asian emoticons which put emphasis on the eyes compared to Western emoticons which emote mainly with the mouth

Different emotions such as are expressed by changing the character representing the eyes for example T can be used to express crying or sadness The emphasis on the eyes is reflected in the common usage of emoticons that use only the eyes eg Looks of stress are represented by the likes of while is a generic emote for nervousness the semicolon indicating sweat that occurs during anxiety Repeating the mark can indicate embarrassment by symbolizing blushing Characters like hyphens or periods can replace the underscore the period is often used for a smaller cuter mouth or to represent a nose eg Alternatively the mouthnose can be left out entirely eg The parentheses also can often be replaced with braces eg Many times the parentheses are left out completely eg  oO OO though this is more likely in Western culture A quotation mark apostrophe or semicolon can be added to the emoticon to imply apprehension or embarrassment in the same way that a sweat drop is used in anime

Microsoft IME 2002 or later supports the use of both forms of emoticons by enabling Microsoft IME Spoken Language Dictionary In IME 2007 it was moved to Emoticons dictionary

In geology a trough refers to a linear depression that extends in one direction over a distance It is less steep than a trench A trough can be a narrow basin or a geologic rift There are various oceanic troughs troughs found under oceans examples include the rifts along the mid ocean ridges

An innuendo is an indirect or implied statement of ideas or opinions It can also be a remark or question often disparaging that works indirectly by allusion In the latter sense the intention is often to insult or accuse someone in such a way that the words as used taken literally seem to be innocent in the direct meaning

An innuendo is as defined in the Advanced Oxford Learners Dictionary an indirect remark about somebodys body usually suggesting something bad mean or rude the use of remarks like this innuendoes about her private life or The song is full of sexual innuendo The word is often used to express disapproval

The term sexual innuendo has a specific meaning namely that of a risque double entendre by playing on a possibly sexual meaning of an otherwise innocent statement

Many TV shows aimed at a younger audience often use innuendoes as a way of attracting older viewers without offending their networks censorship Shows such as The FairlyOdd Parents Spongebob SquarepantsThe Penguins of Madagascar Rockos Modern Life Cow Chicken Ren Stimpy and especially Animaniacs and Looney Tunes have been known to do this over the years Also many prime time shows use an extensive amount of innuendo to the point that they are rated US TV PG14 D for dialogue Some TV shows using innuendoes are The Simpsons Futurama Son of the Beach The Office King of the Hill Beavis and Butthead Everybody Hates Chris American Dad Tosh0 and especially Family Guy

Also many radio shows are known for use of innuendo including The Gallo Radio Show most of the songs played on Southern Crossroads sometimes The Rick Bubba Show The Steve and DC Morning Show especially The JT Dave Show Air Bubba and The Bob Tom Show

The Wikiatlas or Wikimedia Atlas of the World is a wiki portal on the Wikimedia Commons website related to the English Wikipedia Portal Atlas It contains thousands of gallery pages and maps about many nations or regions of the world

As a collection of map image galleries the Wikiatlas links many sets of maps such as

Unlike Wikibooks or Wikisource the Wikiatlas is not a separate wiki website but rather a large subset of the Wikimedia website There are many thousands of maps in the WikiAtlas

The Wikiatlas is based on some simple ideas All maps are grouped in the manner of a World atlas into pages stored with the name Atlas of for each continent such as

Similar page titles Atlas of cover each nation or region such as

Some of the US states also have Wikiatlas pages such as

Similarly hundreds of other Wikiatlas pages are named as Atlas of for over 200 nations and over 94 other regions of the World

Many pages in the Wikiatlas are arranged in a distinctive format with maps displayed down the left side of the page and explanatory text presented to the right hand side The description for each nation territory or region is written first in the official language of the area followed by other languages including English

Because the Wikiatlas is a wiki effort developed by the Wikimedia volunteers the level of detail and coverage varies from section to section of the Wikiatlas Some groups of maps are very extensive while other maps are rudimentary depending on the time spent by volunteer writers

The Wikiatlas was designed during extended discussions on the Wikimedia website beginning in 2003 Originally the concept was to have an automatic map generator based on giving coordinates However use of maps beyond mere location led to the current vast collections of maps also showing economic areas precipitation average temperature political regions earthquake fault lines etc To show a location was only one way to use maps

Many thousands of maps were collected over the years However by June 2005 the Wikiatlas subproject still lacked sufficient structure to be considered viable In April 2006 the Wikiatlas was mentioned in an archaeology conference as a nascent project Finally a coherent page format was generalized during mid 2007 using page layouts stored in MediaWiki template files Hundreds of Wikimedia and Wikipedia editors worked on various aspects of the page descriptions in over 100 languages including uploading and modifying the thousands of map images Some of the maps were transferred from Wikipedia image pages

Although readership figures are not specifically available of the complete grouping of all Wikiatlas pages the general readership of the Wikimedia website has been based nearly 50 within the following United States 245 Germany 107 India 57 United Kingdom 40 and Italy 35

Copper nitrate also known as cupric nitrate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Cu2 It contains copper in its 2 oxidation state It also contains nitrate ions

Copper nitrate is a blue solid It is an oxidizing agent It is blue whether it contains water or not It makes nitrogen dioxide when it is heated

It is made by reacting copper with nitrogen tetroxide It can also be made by reacting copper with nitric acid or silver nitrate 

It can be used to make nitric acid by heating it Then the brown gas made is dissolved in water to make nitric acid It can be used to add nitrate ions to organic chemicals 

Copper ions are toxic like many other metals Nitrates are oxidizing agents and can make things burn

Orogeny is the process of mountain building It takes place when two tectonic plates come together Orogens develop while a continental plate is crumpled and thickened to form mountain ranges and involve a great range of geological processes collectively called orogenesis Examples

Another less common cause is when a plate moves over a hot spot in the Earths mantle Examples

There is a third process called delamination Here an unstable portion of cold root of the lithosphere drips down into the mantle decreasing the density of the lithosphere and causing buoyant uplift Example

Areas that are rifting apart such as mid ocean ridges and the East African Rift have mountains due to thermal buoyancy caused by the hot mantle underneath them which pushes them up This thermal buoyancy is known as dynamic topography Examples

The South African Grand Prix was first run as a Grand Prix motor racing handicap race in 1934 at the Prince George Circuit at East London Eastern Cape Province South Africa 

The races were stopped because of World War II It was started again in 1962 as part of the Formula One circuit It was a popular F1 event It was stopped again after the 1985 race Some nations began boycotting South African events because of racial segregation policy of apartheid 

After apartheid was ended in 1991 there were two more races were in 1992 and 1993

The Portuguese Grand Prix was a motor racing event held for several years starting in the 1950s It was a Formula One race between F11958 and F11960 and between F11984 and F11996

The first event was held on the Boavista street course in Porto on 17 June 1951 The Grand Prix was moved to Monsanto Park Lisbon in 1954 as a one time event The first Formula One race was held in 14 August 1958 The first three F1 races were held in both Boavista and Monsanto 1960 was the last Formula One race for more than 20 years

The Portuguese Grand Prix returned to the calendar in 1984 to the Autdromo do Estoril in 1984 After the deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger at Imola in 1994 the Estoril track was changed A new chicane was built in place of the tank curve as a safety measure But Estoril was considered an unsafe and outdated track The last Portuguese Grand Prix was in Estoril on 22 September 1996

The Argentine Grand Prix was Formula One Grand Prix motor race It was held off and on from F11953 to F11998 Argentine president Juan Pern was the driving force behind the creation of the circuit after seeing the success of the countrys own Juan Manuel Fangio 

The circuit was built just outside of Buenos Aires on swampland in 1952In 1953 the Autodrome hosted the first ever Formula One race held outside Europe The exile of Pern in 1955 lead to an unstable government The Argentine Grand Prix left the F1 calendar in 1961 for over a decade

In F11972 the Argentine Grand Prix returned to the World Championship Carlos Reutemann became the new homegrown hero Reutemann took pole position in his world championship debut He become only the second driver to do this The Grand Prix remained in Argentina through F11981 but the 1982 event was canceled

A private group purchased the track in 1991 and began to upgrade it The modernized Argentine Grand Prix returned in F11995 Because of financial problems the F11998 race was the last running of the Argentine Grand Prix

In typesetting by hand compositing a sort is a piece of type representing a specific letter or symbol cast from a matrix mould and assembled with other sorts bearing additional letters into lines of type to make up a forme from which a page is printed 

In probability theory and applications Bayes theorem shows the relation between a conditional probability and its reverse form For example the probability of a hypothesis given some observed pieces of evidence and the probability of that evidence given the hypothesis This theorem is after Thomas Bayes and often called Bayes law or Bayes rule

Where

A simple example is as follows There is a 40 chance of it raining on Sunday If it rains on Sunday there is a 10 chance it will rain on Monday If it didnt rain on Sunday theres an 80 chance it will rain on Monday

Raining on Sunday is event A and Raining on Monday is event B

However what if we said It rained on Monday What is the probability it rained on Sunday That is where Bayes theorem comes in It allows us to calculate the probability of an earlier event given the later event happened

In our case Raining on Sunday is event A and Raining on Monday is event B

In other words if it rained on Monday theres a 769 chance it rained on Sunday

To calculate the probability of it having rained on Sunday we can take the following steps

Salisbury Plain is a chalk plateau in central southern England covering convert300sqmikm2 It largely lies within the county of Wiltshire with a little in Hampshire 

The Plain is famous for its rich archaeology including Avebury and Stonehenge which are a joint World Heritage Site The Plain is sparsely populated and is the largest remaining area of calcareous grassland in north west Europe The Plain also has arable land and a few small areas of beech trees and coniferous woodland

On the Plain is the British Armys largest training ground in England It is suitable terrain for tank manoeuvres buildings such as Imber are used for urban warfare training

The boundaries of Salisbury Plain have never been defined and there is some difference of opinion as to its exact area The river valleys surrounding it and other downs and plains beyond them loosely define its boundaries To the north the scarp of the downs overlooks the Vale of Pewsey and to the north west the Avon The River Wylye runs along the south west and the River Bourne runs to the east

Hot pants or short shorts are a fashion item from the 1960s which is still popular today They first appeared as a design item in so called Swinging London The trend for shorter brighters clothes for young women was started by designers in London such as Mary Quant

Running or gym shorts are worn by girls as normal wear in some places Many gym shorts have an inlay made of a comfortable fabric such as cotton similar to swim shorts These are designed to be worn without underwear

If a person cuts off the legs of a pair of jeans thats known as a cut off

The mini skirt or miniskirt is a skirt well above the knees close to the buttocks If the top and skirt are all in one then it is a minidress Microskirts are extremely brief and usually worn only for publicity events

Mini skirts were invented by Mary Quant who also invented or promoted hot pants There is disagreement as to who came up with the idea first some say Andr Courrges or John Bates The short and ever shorter skirt was evolving already among fashion minded young women the designers who adapted it just helped spread the style In Quants case she gave it the name Mary Quant named the mini skirt after her favorite make of car the Mini She loved the car so much she had one designed especially for her

The Austrian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race The first event was held in 1964 at a race track on the Zeltweg Airfield The track was deemed too dangerous It was narrow and very bumpy Spectators complained of poor viewing areas The FIA removed the race from the F1 calendar until a better circuit was built

From 1970 until 1987 the event was held at the sterreichring located near Zeltweg In 1975 it was was called the European Grand Prix In 1987 the FIA decided that the circuit was too dangerous The race was dropped for a decade

In 1995 and 1996 the track was modified and brought up to modern standards The race returned to F1 in 1997 The circuit was renamed the A1 Ring after a sponsor Most of the new track is located in Spielberg Spielberg was now used as the location of the Grand Prix The final Austrian Grand Prix was held in 2003

The Luxembourg Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race for two years in the 1990s The FIA created the Luxembourg GP to keep a race at Nrburgring and allow the European GP to be held in another country 

The FIA only allowed one Formula One per country They would allow a second race within a country if it had a different Grand Prix name For several years the German Grand Prix had been held at Hockenheimring and the European Grand Prix at Nrburgring There was unease that the Nrburgring was being given a monopoly for the European GP The border of Luxembourg lies about 50 miles away from the Nrburgring track 

The Mexican Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Mexico City It first appeared as a non championship event in 1962 before being held as a championship event from 1963 1970 and 1986 1992

The Moroccan Grand Prix was a Grand Prix motor racing event It begun in 1925 in Casablanca Morocco The official name was Casablanca Grand Prix

In 1930 the race was moved to the new Anfa Racecourse There was no race in 1933 There were no races between 1935 and 1953 When it returned in 1954 it was held on a circuit at the city of Agadir for sports cars

A new circuit at Ain Diab near Casablanca was ready for the 1957 Moroccan Grand Prix Formula One race This race did not counttoward the World Championship The only World Championship F1 race was in 1958 The race was marred by the death of Stuart Lewis Evans This was the last Grand Prix organized in Morocco

No driver won the Moroccan Grand Prix more than one time

Typesetting is the making of block printed writing which is formed by using types grouped from sorts

Typesetting uses the earlier steps of designing a font and storing it in some manner Typesetting is the taking of the stored letters and the ordering of them in the manner of a languages orthography for showing them on a page

During the letterpress era moveable type was composed by hand for each page Cast metal sorts were grouped into words and lines of text and tightly bound together to make up a page image called a forme All letter faces were set to the same height to form an even surface of type The forme was mounted in a machine press inked and an impression made on paper

The diagram at right shows a cast metal sort a face b body or shank c point size 1 shoulder 2 nick 3 groove 4 foot Wooden printing sorts were in use for centuries in combination with metal type 

Copies of formes were cast when expecting later printings of a text freeing the costly type for other work In this process called stereotyping the entire forme is pressed into a fine matrix such as plaster of Paris or papier mch called Flong to create a positive from which the stereotype forme was cast of type metal 

Hand composing was rendered commercially obsolete by continuous casting or hot metal typesetting machines such as the Linotype machine and Monotype at the end of the 19th century The Linotype invented by Ottmar Mergenthaler enabled one machine operator to do the work of ten hand compositors by automating the selection use and replacement of sorts with a keyboard as input Later advances such as the typewriter or computer pushed the state of the art even farther ahead Still hand composition and letterpress printing did not fall completely out of use Since the introduction of digital typesetting it has seen a renewal as an artisanal pursuit However it is a very small niche within the larger typesetting market

Phototypesetting or cold type systems first appeared in the early 1960s and rapidly displaced continuous casting machines These devices consisted of glass disks that spun in front of a light source which selectively exposed characters onto light sensitive paper Originally they were driven by pre punched paper tapes Later they were hooked up to computer front ends

One of the earliest electronic photocomposition systems was introduced by Fairchild Semiconductor The typesetter typed a line of text on a Fairchild keyboard that had no display To verify correct content of the line it was typed a second time If the two lines were identical a bell rang and the machine produced a punched paper tape corresponding to the text With the completion of a block of lines the typesetter fed the corresponding paper tapes into a phototypesetting device which mechanically set type outlines printed on glass sheets into place for exposure onto a negative film Photosensitive paper was exposed to light through the negative film resulting in a column of black type on white paper or a galley The galley was then cut up and used to create a mechanical drawing or paste up of a whole page A large film negative of the page is shot and used to make a plates for offset printing

The next generation of phototypesetting machines to emerge were those that generated characters on a Cathode ray tube Typical of the type were the Alphanumeric APS2 IBM 2680 III VideoComp Linotron 202 and Autologic APS5 These machines were the mainstay of phototypesetting for much of the 1970s and 1980s Such machines could be driven online by a computer front end system or take their data from magnetic tape Type fonts were stored digitally on conventional magnetic disk drives

Computers excel at automatically typesetting documents Character by character computer aided phototypesetting was in turn rapidly rendered obsolete in the 1980s by fully digital systems Those systems use a raster image processor to render an entire page to a single high resolution digital image now known as imagesetting

The first commercially successful laser imagesetter able to make use of a raster image processor was the Monotype Lasercomp ECRM Compugraphic and others rapidly followed suit with machines of their own

Early minicomputer based typesetting software was introduced in the 1970s and early 1980s such as Datalogics Pager Penta Miles 33 Xyvision troff from Bell Labs and IBMs SCRIPT product with CRT terminals Those replaced the electro mechanical devices and used text markup languages to describe type and other page formatting information The descendants of these text markup languages include SGML XML and HTML 

The minicomputer systems output columns of text on film for paste up and eventually produced entire pages and signatures of 4 8 16 or more pages using imposition software on devices such as the Israeli made Scitex Dolev The data stream used by these systems to drive page layout on printers and imagesetters led to the use of printer control languages such as Adobe Systems PostScript and Hewlett Packards HP PCL

Before the 1980s almost all typesetting for publishers and advertisers was done by specialist typesetting companies These companies performed keyboarding editing and production of paper or film output and formed a large component of the graphic arts industry In the United States these companies were located in rural Pennsylvania New England or the Midwest where labor was cheap and paper produced nearby but still within a few hours travel time of the major publishing centers

In 1985 desktop publishing became available starting with the Apple Macintosh Aldus PageMaker and PostScript Improvements in software and hardware and rapidly lowering costs popularized desktop publishing and enabled very fine control of typeset results at much lower cost than the minicomputer based systems At the same time word processing systems such as Wang and WordPerfect revolutionized office documents They did not however have the typographic ability or flexibility required for complex book layout graphics mathematics or advanced hyphenation and justification rules

By the year 2000 this industry segment had shrunk because publishers were now capable of integrating typesetting and graphic design on their own in house computers Many found that the cost of maintaining high standards of typographic design and technical skill made it more economical to out source to freelancers and graphic design specialists

The availability of cheap or free fonts made the conversion to do it yourself easier but also opened up a gap between skilled designers and amateurs The advent of PostScript supplemented by the PDF file format provided a universal method of proofing designs and layouts readable on major computer and operating systems

IBM created and inspired a family of typesetting languages with names that were derivatives of the word SCRIPT Latter versions of SCRIPT included advanced features such as automatic generation of a table of contents and index multi column page layout footnotes boxes automatic hyphenation and spelling verification

NSCRIPT was a port of SCRIPT to OS and TSO from CP 67CMS SCRIPT

Waterloo Script was created later at the University of Waterloo One version of SCRIPT was created at MIT and the AACS at UW took over project development in 1974 The program was first used at UW in 1975 In the 1970s SCRIPT was the only practical way to word process and format documents using a computer By the late 1980s the SCRIPT system had been extended to incorporate various upgrades 

The initial implementation of SCRIPT at UW was documented in the May 1975 Issue of the Computing Centre Newsletter which noted some the advantages of using SCRIPT

a Footnotes are handled easily 

b Page numbers can be in Arabic or Roman numerals and can appear at the top or bottom of the page in the centre on the left or on the right or even numbered pages and on the right for odd numbered pages 

c Underscoring or over striking can be made a function of SCRIPT thus uncomplicating editor functions 

d SCRIPT files are regular OS databases or CMS files 

e Output can be obtained on the printer or at the terminal The article also pointed out that SCRIPT had over 100 commands to assist in formatting documents though 8 to 10 of these commands were sufficient to complete most formatting jobs Thus SCRIPT had many of the capabilities that computer users generally associate with contemporary word processors

SCRIPTVS was a different version of SCRIPT developed at IBM in the 1980s

SCRIPT is still available from IBM as part of the Document Composition Facility for the zOS operating system

SGML was based upon GML GML was a set of macros on top of IBM SCRIPT

The arrival of SGMLXML as the document model made other typesetting engines popular Such engines include Datalogics Pager Penta Miles 33s OASYS Xyvisions XML Professional Publisher FrameMaker Arbortext YesLogics Prince QuarkXPress and Adobe InDesign These products allow users to program their typesetting process around the SGMLXML with the help of scripting languages Some of them such as Arbortext Editor and XMetaL Author provide attractive WYSIWYG ish interfaces with support for XML standards and Unicode to attract a wider spectrum of users

During the mid 1970s Joseph Ossanna working at Bell Laboratories wrote the troff typesetting program to drive a Wang CAT phototypesetter owned by the Labs it was later enhanced by Brian Kernighan to support output to different equipment such as laser printers and the like While its use has fallen off it is still included with a number of Unix and Unix like systems and has been used to typeset a number of high profile technical and computer books Some versions as well as a GNU work alike called groff are now open source

The TeX system developed by Donald E Knuth at the end of the 1970s is another widespread and powerful automated typesetting system which has set high standards especially for typesetting mathematics TeX is considered fairly difficult to learn on its own and deals more with appearance than structure The LaTeX macro package written by Leslie Lamport at the beginning of the 1980s offered a simpler interface and an easier way to systematically encode the structure of a document LaTeX markup is very widely used in academic circles for published papers and even books Standard TeX does not provide a WYSIWYG interface though there are programs such as LyX and Scientific Workplace which provide one Another WYSIWYG editor very much inspired by TeX is TeXmacs

Swinging London is a catch all term applied to the fashion and cultural scene which flourished in London in the 1960s 

It was a phenomenon which emphasized the young the new and the modern It was a period of optimism and hedonism and a cultural revolution One catalyst was the recovery of the British economy after post World War II hard times had lasted through much of the 1950s Journalist Christopher Booker a founder of the satirical magazine Private Eye recalled the bewitching character of the swinging sixties There seemed to be no one standing outside the bubble and observing just how odd and shallow and egocentric and even rather horrible it was

Swinging London was defined by Time magazine in its issue of 15 April 1966 and celebrated in the name of the pirate radio station Swinging Radio England that began shortly afterward However swinging in the sense of hip or fashionable had been used since the early 1960s In 1965 Diana Vreeland editor of Vogue magazine said London is the most swinging city in the world at the moment 

Although The Beatles came from Liverpool The Rolling Stones and the rest of the new culture was London based Most of the new fashion designers models and photographers were young and packed into a small area in Soho around Carnaby Street W1 and another area round the Kings Road Chelsea

During the time of Swinging London fashion and photography were featured in Queen magazine which drew attention to fashion designer Mary Quant

The model Jean Shrimpton was another icon and one of the worlds first supermodels She was the worlds highest paid and most photographed model of the time Shrimpton was called The face of the 60s in which she has been considered by many as the symbol of Swinging London and the embodiment of the 1960s Other popular models of the era included Veruschka and Twiggy Twiggy was called the Queen of Mod a label she shared with others such as Cathy McGowan who hosted the television rock show Ready Steady Go from 1964 to 1966

Mod related fashions such as the miniskirt stimulated fashionable shopping areas such as Carnaby Street and the Kings Road Chelsea The fashion was a symbol of youth culture

The British flag the Union Flag became a symbol assisted by events such as Englands home victory in the 1966 World Cup The Mini car was used by a fleet of mini cab taxis highlighted by advertising which covered their paintwork

Madama Butterfly is an Italian opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini first performed in Milan on February 17 1904 libretto by Giuseppe Giacosa and Luigi Illica after David Belascos play itself based on a story by John Luther Long Revised version performed in Brescia on May 28 1904 Although a failure at its premiere the revised version quickly established itself as one of the best loved opera of the Italian repertoire 

Tosca is an Italian opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini first performed in Rome on January 14 1900 libretto by Giuseppe Giacosa and Luigi Illica after Victorien Sardous play La Tosca An instant success it has remained one of the most popular of all operas 

Manon Lescaut is an Italian opera in four acts by Giacomo Puccini first performed in Turin on February 1 1893 libretto by Luigi Illica Giuseppe Giacosa Giulio Ricordi Marco Praga and Domenico Oliva Puccinis third opera and the work that established his reputation 

The Caesars Palace Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race in 1981 and 1982 NissanDatsun was a presenting sponsor of both races

When Watkins Glen left the F1 schedule after 1980 the Caesars Palacd GP took its place The track was set up in the parking lot of the Caesars Palace hotel It was surprisingly well set up for a temporary circuit It was wide enough for passing provided ample run off areas filled with sand and had a surface that was as smooth as glass Its counter clockwise direction put a tremendous strain on the drivers necks 1982 was the end of Formula One racing in Las Vegas The races had drawn only tiny crowds

In 1983 and 1984 CART ran Grands Prix races on the same circuit

Kakadu National Park is in the Northern Territory of Australia 171 km southeast of Darwin It is the second largest national park in the world It covers an area of convert1980400haacrelkonabbron It is about 200 kilometres from north to south and more than 100 kilometres from east to west It is the size of Slovenia about one third the size of Tasmania or nearly half the size of Switzerland The Ranger Uranium Mine one of the biggest Uranium mines in the world is inside the park

The name Kakadu comes from Gagadju the name of an Aboriginal language spoken in the northern part of the Park Kakadu National Park has many different ecological areas and many different plant and animal species The main natural features protected within the National Park include

Kakadu National Park is famous for the richness of its Aboriginal cultural sites There are more than 5000 recorded art sites showing Aboriginal culture over thousands of years The archaeological sites show that Aboriginals have lived here for at least 20 000 and possibly up to 40 000 years

The cultural and natural values of Kakadu National Park were recognised internationally when the Park was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site This is an international list of places that are have outstanding cultural or natural values of international significance Kakadu was listed in three stages Stage 1 in 1981 Stage 2 in 1987 and the entire Park in 1992

About half of the land in Kakadu is aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976 Most of the remaining land is currently under claim by Aboriginal people The areas of the Park that are owned by Aboriginal people are leased by the traditional owners to the Director of National Parks to be managed as a national park The remaining area is Australian Government land controlled by the Director of National Parks All of Kakadu is declared a national park under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999

The Aboriginal traditional owners of the Park are descendants of various clan groups from the Kakadu area Their lifestyle has changed in recent years but their traditional customs and beliefs remain very important About 500 Aboriginal people live in the Park many of them are traditional owners All of Kakadu is jointly managed by Aboriginal traditional owners and the Australian Governments Department of the Environment and Water Resources through a division known as Parks Australia Park Management is directed by the Kakadu Board of Management

Kakadu was set up at a time when Australians were becoming more interested in national parks for conservation and in recognising the land rights of Aboriginal people A national park in the Alligator River region was proposed as early as 1965 In 1978 the Australian Government took over the titles of various pieces of land that now makes up Kakadu National Park  

Kakadu National Park was made a park in three stages between 1979 and 1991 Each stage of the Park includes Aboriginal land under the Land Rights Act that is leased to the Director of National Parks or land that is subject to a claim to traditional ownership under the Land Rights Act Most of the land that was to become part of Stage One of Kakadu was given to the Kakadu Aboriginal Land Trust under the Land Rights Act in August 1978 In November 1978 the Land Trust and the Director signed a lease for the land to be managed as a national park Stage One of the Park was declared on 5 April 1979

Stage Two was declared on 28 February 1984 In March 1978 a claim was lodged under the Land Rights Act for the land included in Stage Two of Kakadu The land claim was partly successful In 1986 three areas in the eastern part of Stage Two were given to the Jabiluka Aboriginal Land Trust A lease between the Land Trust and the Director of National parks was signed in March 1991

In 1987 a land claim was made for the land in the Goodparla and Gimbat pastoral leases that were to be included in Stage Three of Kakadu The other area to be included in Stage Three the Gimbat Resumption and the Waterfall Creek Reserve were later added to this land claim The need to create the park in stages was due to the debate over whether mining should be allowed at Guratba which is located in the middle of the area referred to as Sickness Country The traditional owners wishes were ultimately respected and the Australian National Government decided that there would be no mining at Guratba 

In 1996 the land in Stage Three apart from the former Goodparla pastoral leases was given to the Gunlom Aboriginal Land Trust and leased to the Director of National Parks to continue being managed as part of Kakadu

The Chinese Malays and Portuguese all claim to have been the first non Aboriginal explorers of Australias north coast The first surviving written account comes from the Dutch In 1623 Jan Carstenz made his way west across the Gulf of Carpentaria to what is believed to be Groote Eylandt Abel Tasman was the next explorer to visit in 1644 He was the first person to record European contact with Aboriginal people Almost a century later Matthew Flinders surveyed the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1802 and 1803

Phillip Parker King an English navigator entered the Gulf of Carpentaria between 1818 and 1822 During this time he named the three Alligator Rivers after the large numbers of crocodiles which he thought were alligators 

Ludwig Leichhardt was the first land based European explorer to visit the Kakadu region in 1845 on his way from Moreton Bay in Queensland to Port Essington in the Northern Territory He followed Jim Jim Creek down from the Arnhem Land escarpment then went down the South Alligator before crossing to the East Alligator and going north 

In 1862 John McDouall Stuart travelled along the south western boundary of Kakadu but did not see any people

The first non Aboriginal people to visit and have long term contact with Aboriginal people in northern Australia were the Macassans from Sulawesi and other parts of Indonesia They travelled to northern Australia every wet season probably from the last quarter of the 17th century in sailing boats called praus They came to harvest trepang turtle shell pearls and other prized items to trade in their homeland Aboriginal people helped in harvesting and processing the trepang and in collecting and exchanging the other goods

There is no evidence that the Macassans spent time on the coast of Kakadu There is evidence of some contact between Macassan culture and Aboriginal people of the Kakadu area Among the finds from archaeological digs in the Park are glass and metal pieces that probably came from the Macassans either directly or through trade with the Coburg Peninsula people

The British attempted a number of settlements on the northern Australian coast in the early part of the 19th century Fort Dundas on Melville Island in 1824 Fort Wellington at Raffles Bay in 1829 and Victoria Settlement on the Coburg Peninsula in 1838 They wanted to secure the north of Australia before the French or Dutch who had colonised islands further north The British settlements all failed for a variety of reasons such as lack of water and fresh food sickness and isolation It is difficult to assess the impact of these settlements on the local Aboriginal people and the type of relationship that developed between them and the British Certainly some Aboriginals worked at the settlements Exposure to new sickness was an ever present danger As in other parts of Australia disease and the disruption it caused to society devastated the local Aboriginal population

Water buffalo have had a big influence on the Kakadu region as well By the 1880s the number of buffaloes escaped from early settlements had grown so much that hunting them for skins and horns was economically successful 

The industry began on the Adelaide River close to Darwin and moved east to the Mary River and Alligator Rivers regions

Most of the buffalo hunting and skin curing was done in the dry season between June and September when buffaloes gathered around the remaining billabongs During the wet season hunting stopped because the ground was too muddy to follow the buffalo and the harvested hides would rot The buffalo hunting industry became an important employer of Aboriginal people during the dry season months

Missionaries had a big influence on the Aboriginal people of the Alligator Rivers area Many of the people lived and went to school at missions Two missions were set up in the region in the early part of the century Kapalga Native Industrial Mission was started near the South Alligator River in 1899 but lasted only four years The Oenpelli Mission began in 1925 when the Church of England Missionary Society accepted an offer from the Northern Territory Administration to take over the area which had been used as a dairy farm The Oenpelli Mission operated for 50 years

Some writers and anthropologists say that missionaries in trying to civilise and institutionalise Aboriginal people forced them to give up their lifestyle language religion ceremonies and change the whole way they lived Others say that although they might not have used the best methods to achieve their goal the missionaries did care about the Aboriginal people at a time when wider Australian society did not 

The pastoral industry made started slowly in the Top End Pastoral leases in the Kakadu area were progressively given up from 1889 because the Victoria River and the Barkly Tablelands were better pastoral regions 

In southern Kakadu much of Goodparla and Gimbat was claimed in the mid 1870s by three pastoralists Roderick Travers and Sergison The leases were later passed on to a series of owners who were all unsuccessful In 1987 both stations were taken back by the Commonwealth and added to Kakadu National Park 

There was a sawmill at Nourlangie Camp begun by Chinese workers probably before World War I to cut stands of cypress pine in the area After World War II there were a number of small scale activities including dingo shooting and trapping brumby shooting crocodile shooting tourism and forestry

Nourlangie Camp was again the site of a sawmill in the 1950s until the cypress pines were cleared In 1958 it became a safari camp for tourists Soon after a similar camp was started at Patonga and at Muirella Park People were flown in to hunt buffalo crocodiles and fishing

Crocodile hunters often made use of the bush skills of Aboriginal people By copying a wallabys tail hitting the ground Aboriginal hunters could attract crocodiles making it easier to shoot the animals Using paperbark rafts they would track the movement of a wounded crocodile and get the carcass for skinning The skins were then sold to make leather goods Aboriginal people became less involved in commercial hunting of crocodiles once night spotlight shooting started Freshwater Crocodiles have been protected by law since 1964 and Saltwater Crocodiles since 1971

Minerals were found in the Top End during the building of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line line between 1870 and 1872 in the Pine Creek Adelaide River area A number of short mining booms followed

The building of the North Australia Railway line helped the mining camps and places such as Burrundie and Pine Creek became permanent settlements The mining camps and new settlements drew many Aboriginal people away from Kakadu No Aboriginal people are known to have worked in the mines but their access to alcohol and other drugs had a huge impact

Small scale gold mining began at Imarlkba near Barramundi Creek and Mundogie Hill in the 1920s and at Moline south of the Park in the 1930s The mines employed a few local Aboriginal people

In 1953 uranium was discovered in the the South Alligator River valley Thirteen small but rich uranium mines operated in the following decade at their peak in 1957 employing over 150 workers No Aboriginal people were employed at any of these mines

Early in the 1970s large uranium deposits were discovered at Ranger Jabiluka and Koongarra The Australian Government began an inquiry into land use in the Alligator Rivers region The Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry recommended that mining begin at the Ranger site It also said that Jabiluka and Koongarra sites should be developed and that a town be built to support the mines The Ranger mine and the service town at Jabiru have had many impacts on Aboriginal people Aboriginal people have different opinions about mining

Kakadu is in the tropics between 12 and 14 south of the Equator The climate is monsoonal with two main seasons the dry season and the rain season The build up describes the change between the dry and the rain During the dry season there are dry southerly and easterly trade winds Humidity is relatively low and rain is unusual At Jabiru the average maximum temperature for June July is 32 C During the build up conditions can be extremely uncomfortable with high temperatures and high humidity However build up storms are impressive and with many lightning strikes At Jabiru the average maximum temperature for October is 375 C

The rain season has warm temperatures and rain Most of the rain is is caused by monsoonal troughs formed over Southeast Asia Sometimes tropical cyclones cause very heavy rain over small areas At Jabiru the average maximum temperature for January is 33 C Annual rainfall in Kakadu National Park ranges from 1565 mm in Jabiru to 1300 mm in the Mary River region

The Aboriginal people the BininjMungguy named as many as six seasons in the Kakadu region

Periods of torrential rain and long dry spells mean that Kakadu can change its appearance according to the season so is a place deserving of more than one visit

Kakadu has more than 2000 plant species because of the different geological areas landforms and habitats Kakadu is also said to be one of the most weed free national parks in the world

The different geographical areas of Kakadu have their own specialised plants The area called the Stone Country has resurrection grasses that are able to survive extreme heat and dry conditions followed by periods of heavy rain Monsoon forests often develop in the cool moist gorges found in the stone country The southern hills and basins support several endemic plants that are only found in Kakadu such as Eucalyptus koolpinensis near Jarrangbarnmi Lowland areas form a large proportion of Kakadu National Park and are mainly covered in eucalypt dominated open woodland with the ground layer consisting of a large range of grasses including spear grass sedges and wildflowers

The floodplains which are flooded for several months each year feature sedges such as spike rush as well patches of freshwater mangroves pandanus and paper bark trees Varieties of water lilies such as the blue yellow and white snowflake are commonly found in these areas Estuaries and tidal flats are populated with varieties of mangroves in fact 39 of the 47 Northern Territory species of mangrove are found in Kakadu These are important for preventing erosion of the coast Mangroves serve as feeding and breeding grounds for many fish species including the barramundi

On the tidal flats behind the mangroves hardy succulents grasses and sedges grow Isolated pockets of monsoon forest grow along the coast and river banks These forests contain several impressive trees among them the banyan fig which can be recognised by its large spreading aerial roots and the kapok tree which has a spiny trunk large waxy red flowers and pods full of cotton like material

The different areas of Kakadu National Park support a huge number of animals a number of which have adapted to particular habitats Some animals in the Park are rare endangered vulnerable or endemic Because of the extreme weather conditions experienced in the Park many animals are active only at particular times of the day or night or at particular times of the year

About 62 mammal species have been seen in the Park Most of them live in the open forest and woodlands and are nocturnal making it difficult to see them Others such as wallabies and kangaroos are active in the cooler parts of the day and are easier to see The larger mammals are Dingos Antilopine Kangaroos Black Wallaroos Agile Wallabys and Short eared Rock Wallabys Smaller common mammals are northern quolls brush tailed phascogales brown bandicoots black footed tree rats and black fruit bats Dugongs are found in the coastal waters However recent surveys have shown smaller numbers of nearly all mammals throughout Kakadu This includes once common and widespread species such as northern quolls 

Kakadus many habitats support more than 280 species of birds This is about one third of Australias bird species Some birds range over a number of habitats but many are found in only one environment

To date 123 species of reptiles have been found in Kakadu Being cold blooded these animals need heat from an external source such as the sun to control their body temperature This is not to say that reptiles are active only during the day in fact few snakes can withstand Kakadus midday heat and most are active at night 

Two species of crocodile live in Kakadu the Freshwater Crocodile and the Estuarine or Saltwater Crocodile Freshwater Crocodiles have a narrow snout and a single row of four large boney lumps called scutes immediately behind the head Estuarine Crocodiles do not have these scutes and their snout is broader The maximum size for a freshie is 3 metres whereas a saltie can exceed 6 metres 

Kakadus 25 frog species are extremely well adapted to the regions climatic extremes Many remain dormant during dry times At the start of the wet season when the billabongs and swamps start to fill with water the night air is filled with the sounds of frogs such as the northern bullfrog and the marbled frog As the water builds up frogs and tadpoles have plenty of food such as algae vegetation insects dragonfly nymphs and other tadpoles Not all of Kakadus frogs are found in the wetlands many live in the lowland forests

Fifty one species of freshwater fish have been found in Kakadus waterways eight of them have a restricted distribution In the Magela Creek system alone 32 species have been found In comparison the MurrayDarling river system the most extensive in Australia now supports only 27 native fish species Although introduced fish have been found in most Australian waterways none have been recorded in the Park

Kakadu supports more than 10000 species of insect including grasshoppers beetles flies termites butterflies and moths bees wasps ants dragonflies and damselflies caddis flies non biting midges and mayflies The great variety of insects is a result of the varied habitats and relatively high temperatures throughout the year 

Perhaps the most striking insect created features in the Park are the termite mounds The mounds in the southern part of the Park are particularly large and impressive Leichhardts grasshopper in colours of orange blue and black is perhaps the most spectacular insect found in Kakadu It is also found on the Arnhem Land plateau and in Gregory National Park

Kakadu has seen several invasive species threaten the native habitat particularly in recent decades  Introduced fauna including the Water Buffalo wild pig and more recently the Cane Toad have had major effects on habitat Invasive weeds include Mimosa pigra which covers 800 km of the Top End including vast areas of Kakadu invasive paragrass displaces the native food of much of Kakadus birdlife Salvinia molesta has infested the Magela floodplain Brumbies also inhabit areas of the National Park including Yellow Water

There are six main landforms in Kakadu National Park 

Each landform has its own range of habitats Kakadus varied landscapes and the habitats they contain are features that contributed to its listing as a World Heritage Area

Most of Kakadu was under a shallow sea about 140 million years ago with the escarpment wall formed from sea cliffs and Arnhem Land from a flat plateau above the sea Currently the escarpment rises 330 metres above the plateau and stretches 500 kilometres along the East edge of the park and on into Arnhem Land The escarpment varies from near vertical cliffs in the Jim Jim Falls area to isolated outliers and stepped cliffs in the North 

Chasms and gorges form a network that cut through the rocky platforms on the plateau The plateau top is a harsh dry environment where water drains away quickly and top soil is scarce in most areas Sparse pockets of open forest and woodlands have developed in these areas However creeks have carved deep gorges in the escarpment in which tall monsoon forests grow These areas form microclimates for plants and animals and often serve as a refuge during the dry season Allosyncarpia ternata a large shady tree found only in the Kakadu and Arnhem Land is the main plant species

The outliers are pieces of the Arnhem Land plateau that have become separated from the plateau by erosion They were islands in the ancient seas that once covered much of Kakadu The lowland plains stretch over much of the Top End and they make up nearly 70 of the Park The soils are shallow and often are above large sheets of laterite and a thick profile of strongly leached rocks 

During the wet season water carried down from the Arnhem Land plateau often overflows from creeks and rivers onto nearby floodplains Alluvial soils carried in the floodwaters add nutrients to the floodplains Nutrient rich soils along with an abundance of water and sunlight make the floodplains an area of prolific plant and animal life During the dry season the water drains into rivers creeks and isolated waterholes or billabongs Kakadus wetlands are listed under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance for their outstanding ecological botanical zoological and hydrological features

The southern hills and basins cover a large area in the south of the Park including the headwaters of the South Alligator River Rocks here have been exposed from beneath the retreating Arnhem escarpment they are of volcanic origin and are extremely old This landform is characterised by rugged strike ridges separated by alluvial flats

Kakadus coast and the creeks and river systems under tidal influence make up this landform The shape of the estuaries and tidal flats varies considerably from the dry season to the wet season During the dry season tidal action deposits silt along the river beds and banks During the wet season the river beds are eroded by the floodwaters and large quantities of fresh and saline water flow out across the tidal flats where silt is deposited Large silt loads are also carried out to sea some of the silt being deposited as a nutrient rich layer on the sea floor contributing to the muddy waters that characterise Kakadus coastline

The estuaries and tidal flats are home to many plants and animals adapted to living in the oxygen deficient saline mud The dominant habitats are mangrove swamps and samphire flats Where freshwater springs occur along the coasts and river banks isolated pockets of coastal monsoon rainforests form

The art sites of Ubirr Nourlangie Rock and Nanguluwur are world famous as examples of Aboriginal rock art These sites are found among the rocks that have given shelter to the Aborigines for thousands of years The painting in these rock shelters were done for different reasons

Ubirr is a group of rock outcrops in the northest of the Park on the edge of the Nadab floodplain There are several large rock overhangs that would have provided excellent shelter to Aboriginal people over thousands of years Because it is close to the East Alligator River and Nadab floodplains it means that there would have been plenty of food This is shown in much of the rock art here Animals shown in the main gallery include barramundi catfish mullet goanna snake necked turtle pig nosed turtle Rock haunting Ringtail Possum and wallaby and thylacine

There are also images of the Rainbow Serpent said to have created much of the landscape as well as mischievous Mimi spirits and the story of the Namarrgarn Sisters Many stories connected to Aboriginal rock are highly complex and linked to other stories Often the true meanings have been lost but they all have a purpose which is usually to serve as a lesson or a warning to the young or to those passing through the area

Nourlangie is located in an outlying formation of the Arnhem Land Escarpment There are a number of shelters in this large outcrop linked by paths and stairways The shelters contain several impressive paintings that deal with the Dreamtime The stories connected to these artworks are known only to certain Aboriginal people and remain secret

Anbangbang Billabong lies in the shadow of Nourlangie Rock and is home to a wide range of wildlife which would have sustained traditional Aboriginal people well

Nanguluwur a small art site near Nourlangie has several rock art styles These include hand stencils dynamic figures in large head dresses carrying spears and boomerangs Namandi spirits and mythical figures including Alkajko a female spirit with four arms and horns There is also an interesting example of contact art showing a two masted sailing ship with anchor chain and a dinghy trailing behind

Humans have made major changes in the area during the 19th and 20th century Introduction of water buffalo from Southeast Asia caused damage to the fragile floodplains and wetlands Since then buffalo have largely been removed from the area so the land is now recovering Crocodile hunting which has been banned since 1972 made a huge impact on crocodile numbers Since they have been protected the crocodiles have recovered so successfully that some think there are now too many 

Mining has made changes to the landscape but only one uranium mine remains Mine operators are have to repair and replant the area when the mine closes Some small scale logging took place in the early part of the 20th century but little evidence of this remains Tourism causes big changes to Kakadu National Park with hundreds of thousands of visitors arriving annually Roads tracks signs shelter accommodation telecommunications and other services must be provided to support this activity

Fire is part of the landscape of Kakadu National Park The Park has large areas of woodland and grassy plains that are subject to long periods of dry hot weather The flora of the region has adapted to frequent fires Fires in northern Australia are less threatening than in southern Australia as many of the trees are largely fire resistant while other plants simply grow back very quickly 

Controlled burning is practiced by the national park in consultation with traditional owners who have used fire as a land management tool for thousands of years Fire is an important hunting tool for Aboriginal people using it to flush out prey The other benefit is that once the fire has gone through an area the tender shoots of the fast regenerating grasses attract wallabies into a clearly defined area Birds of prey such as Whistling Kites also rely on fire to flush out small animals and are usually found in large numbers circling a fire front Other species such as white throated grasswrens have declined because of too many fires Aboriginal people understand that fire is necessary to clean up the landscape and believe that many small fires are preferable to one large fire

Kakadu National Park is a major tourist attraction in Australias north with more than 200000 vistors a year Kakadus dramatic landscape Aboriginal cultural significance and diverse and abundant wildlife are what visitors come to see There are many beautiful waterfalls and gorges within the Park that are popular with visitors such as Maguk Gunlom Twin Falls and Jim Jim Falls 

Kakadu National Park has some of the best examples of Aboriginal rock art in Australia The sites of Nourlangie and Ubirr are among the most visited locations in the Park It is possible to view some of Kakadus diverse wildlife at places like Yellow Water Billabong Cooinda on board a wildlife cruise or at Mamukala Wetlands or Anbangbang Billabong The Kakadu region is one of the worlds best for bird watching as about 30 of Australias bird species can be seen here 

Large saltwater crocodiles are also common at Yellow Water and the East Alligator River The Crocodile Dundee movies were made here Visitors need to be careful around crocodiles as they have been responsible for a number of fatal attacks Fishing is a popular activity inside Kakadu National Park The main species is Barramundi and the most popular locations are Yellow Water the South Alligator and the East Alligator River Hunting is not allowed in Kakadu National Park

There are several places to stay in the Park mostly found in the town of Jabiru as well as a range of services to cater to visitors needs Visitors can experience Kakadu National Park with a recognised tour operator or they can drive themselves Many of the Parks sites are can be reached by standard two wheel drive vehicles but areas like Twin and Jim Jim Falls and Gunlom require four wheel drive vehicles Visitors can experience Kakadu National Park via the Natures Way tourism drive which is a loop from Darwin to Jabiru then onto Katherine and back to Darwin covering about 900km

The Park is proclaimed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and is managed through a joint management arrangement between the Aboriginal traditional owners and the Director of National Parks The Director manages Commonwealth national parks through Parks Australia which is a part of the Department of the Environment and Water Resources Title to Aboriginal land in the Park is held by Aboriginal land trusts The land trusts have leased their land to the Director of National Parks for the purpose of a national park for the enjoyment and benefit of all Australians and international visitors Traditional owners have also expected that having their land managed as a national park would assist them in looking after their land in the face of growing and competing pressures They saw a national park as establishing a way to manage the land that could protect their interests and be sympathetic to their aspirations Parks Australia and the Aboriginal traditional owners of Kakadu are committed to the principle of joint management of the Park and arrangements to help this happen are highlighted in Kakadus Plan of Management

The EPBC Act provides for boards of management to be established for parks on Aboriginal land The Kakadu Board of Management which has an Aboriginal majority representing the Aboriginal traditional owners of land in the Park was established in 1989 The Board determines policy for managing the Park and is responsible along with the Director for preparing plans of management for the Park The Plan of Management is the main policy document for the Park and strives to balance strategic or long term goals and tactical or day to day goals Day to day management of Kakadu is carried out by people employed by Parks Australia which is a branch of the Australian Governments Department of the Environment and Water Resources Approximately one third of the staff in Kakadu are Aboriginal people

Kakadu National Park brought in an entry fee in April 2010 Money raised will help manage the natural and cultural values of the park environment and improve visitor services

Like many World Heritage sites around the world including Yellowstone National Park Serengeti National Park Stonehenge Pompeii and Herculaneum and the Pyramids of Giza  a park use fee will help maintain world best management practices and facilities for the more than 200000 visitors who experience Kakadu each year

The 25 fee will apply to all interstate and international visitors aged 16 years and over It can be used for 14 days All Northern Territory residents and children under 16 have free entry

Kakadu National Park is linked to Darwin by the Arnhem Highway and to Pine Creek and Katherine by the Kakadu Highway Both roads are sealed all weather roads although may be cut off periodically during periods of heavy rain 

The town of Jabiru has several accommodation options a service station police a medical clinic and a shopping centre with a range of outlets The town was built for the Uranium mine that was established prior to the founding of Kakadu National Park and provides infrastructure for the mines workforce as well as the national park activities and tourism Jabiru has a small airport from which scenic flights operate daily There are no scheduled air services between Jabiru and Darwin however 

Other small tourism centres such as Cooinda and South Alligator provide limited facilities Cooinda 50km south of Jabiru on the Kakadu Highway is the site of Gagudju Lodge Cooinda Yellow Water Cruises and the Warradjan Cultural Centre Fuel and limited provisions are available at Cooinda and there is also a small airstrip for scenic flights South Alligator approximately 40km west of Jabiru on the Arnhem Highway includes a hotel and service station The Border Store near Ubirr Art Site and Cahills Crossing 50km north of Jabiru is a general store

There are a wide variety of designated camping sites throughout the Park Jabiru Cooinda and South Alligator all have commercial camping areas and are in close proximity to most of the important natural attractions in these areas Some of the Parks campsites charge a nominal fee as these have shower and toilet facilities others are free however they have limited or no facilities A list of the sites can be obtained from the Kakadu National Parks Glenn Murcutt designed Bowali Visitor Centre or from their website

The Detroit Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at the Detroit street circuit in Detroit Michigan USA from 1982 through 1988

In 1982 the US became the first country to host three World Championship Grands Prix in one season As of 2010 it is the only one to do so In addition to the US GP West and Caesars Palace GP races the new event was held on another street course in the Renaissance Center of Detroit 

The original circuit had seventeen corners in 2493 miles and included a tunnel and a railroad track crossing For 1989 it was planned to move the Grand Prix to a new circuit at Belle Isle However an agreement could not be reached and the Grand Prix moved to Phoenix in 1989 Upon the departure of F1 the Detroit race was replaced by an event sanctioned by CART 

Active constructors are in bold

The Dallas Grand Prix was a Formula One World Championship motor race in 1984 The race was run at the Fair Park street circuit In 1988 the Dallas GP became a round of the American Trans Am Series

Copper carbonate also known as cupric carbonate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is CuCO3 It contains copper in its 2 oxidation state It also contains carbonate ions

Copper carbonate is a blue green solid It is made when copper is in air for a long time and turns green The other part of that coating is copper hydroxide It dissolves in acids to make carbon dioxide and a copper salt It breaks down when heated to make meepingcarbon dioxide and skyblock copper oxide

It can be made by leaving copper hydroxide in air which makes copper carbonate It can also be made by reacting copper sulfate and sodium carbonate This makes sodium sulfate in solution

Copper carbonate can be used to kill algae It is also used as a pigment 

It can irritate the skin It is toxic since it dissolves in stomach acid to make copper ions in solution which can be absorbed

Copper hydroxide also known as cupric hydroxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Cu2 It contains copper in its 2 oxidation state It also contains hydroxide ions

Copper hydroxide is light blue It is rubbery when wet When it is mixed with copper carbonate it is greenish It reacts with carbon dioxide to make copper carbonate when in air It turns into copper oxide when wet When it is dry though it only turns into copper oxide when it is heated It reacts with ammonia to make a very dark blue solution 

Copper hydroxide can be made by reacting copper sulfate with sodium hydroxide Potassium hydroxide can be used but it is more expensive It can also be made by electrolyzing a solution of sodium bicarbonate with a copper anode 

Copper hydroxide is used to kill mold in paints It can be used to color ceramics It can be used as a catalyst 

It is not toxic in small amounts but it can dissolve in stomach acid to make soluble copper which can poison much more easily

Copper oxide also known as cupric oxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is CuO It has copper in its 2 oxidation state It also has oxide ions

Copper oxide is a black solid It dissolves in acids to make copper salts It can react with carbon monoxide or hydrogen to make copper metal It dissolves in very concentrated alkalis It dissolves in ammonia to make a dark blue solution similar to copper hydroxide 

It can be made by heating copper hydroxide It can also be made by heating copper in air It can also be made by heating copper carbonate or copper nitrate 

Copper oxide is used to color ceramics It is also used to make thermite It can react with many toxic chemicals to oxidize them so they are not toxic any more It can be added to vitamins to get copper into the body It can also be added to clothing to kill germs

Copper oxide is toxic when eaten It can be eaten in very small amounts such as in vitamins This adds copper to the body which is needed 

Copper oxide can refer to either of these compounds

Copper chloride can refer to either of these chemical compounds

Copper chloride also known as cuprous chloride is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is CuCl It contains copper in its 1 oxidation state It also contains chloride ions 

Copper chloride is white when pure It does not dissolve in water It is green when in air because of conversion to copper chloride It can react with Lewis bases a group of chemicals It dissolves in hydrochloric acid easily It dissolves in solutions that have ammonia in them It absorbs carbon monoxide It easily disproportionates into copper and copper chloride It reacts with ammonia and acetylene to make copper acetylide a reddish explosive

It can be made by reduction of copper chloride It was made at first by reacting copper with mercury chloride It can be made by heating copper chloride very hot Some chlorine is released and copper chloride is left behind

Copper chloride is used to make a fungicide which is used to kill fungi It is also used to make many organic compounds 

Alexander Peter Fats Delvecchio is a former ice hockey player and member of the Hockey Hall of Fame 

Copper chloride also known as cupric chloride is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is CuCl2 It contains copper in its 2 oxidation state It also contains chloride ions

Copper chloride is light brown when anhydrous It is green when hydrated It is a weak oxidizing agent It reacts with aluminium foil to make hydrogen copper oxide and aluminium chloride This is used in school demonstrations It releases chlorine and turns into copper chloride when heated very hot It reacts with sodium hydroxide to make copper hydroxide Copper chloride reacts with metals to make metal chlorides and copper It puts out blue flames if it is heated in a flame It reacts with sulfur dioxide to make copper chloride It dissolves in water to make a blue solution When more chloride is added it turns green then yellow

It is made by reacting copper with chlorine It can also be made by reacting copper hydroxide copper oxide or copper carbonate with hydrochloric acid

Copper chloride is used to make fungicides It is also used to make organic compounds It is also used to make acetaldehyde from ethene 

It is toxic with toxicity similar to copper sulfate

Copper oxide also known as cuprous oxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Cu2O It contains copper in its 1 oxidation state It also contains oxide ions

Copper oxide is a red solid It can also be yellow but not commonly It does not dissolve in water It turns into copper oxide when in air It dissolves in ammonia to make a colorless complex This is oxidized to a blue complex of copper It dissolves in concentrated hydrochloric acid It also dissolves in concentrated sulfuric acid to make copper sulfate and nitric acid to make copper nitrate 

Copper oxide is found in the ground It is a copper ore 

Copper oxide is made by heating copper in air Some copper oxide is also made It can also be made by reducing copper oxide or other copper compounds It is the result of a test for sugars Green copper chloride is reduced to red copper oxide when a sugar is present 

Copper oxide is used as a semiconductor It is also used as a pigment and fungicide It can be used to stop things from growing on ships

Copper acetylide also known as cuprous acetylide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Cu2C2 It contains copper in its 1 oxidation state It also contains acetylide ions

Copper acetylide is a reddish solid It is an explosive It is a strange explosive because it does not release gas When it detonates it only releases copper and carbon It can be formed inside copper pipes where acetylene flows through It explodes because the acetylide is a reducing agent and the copper is an oxidizing agent 

It is made by reacting copper chloride dissolved in ammonia with acetylene Hydrochloric acid and copper acetylide is made This reaction is used to test for acetylene

It is used in organic chemistry It is a very sensitive explosive too sensitive to be used 

Copper compounds are chemical compounds containing copper ions Copper is in two main oxidation states 1 and 2 2 is more common Copper compounds have copper in 1 oxidation state Copper compounds have copper in 2 oxidation state

Copper compounds are weak reducing agents They react with air to make copper compounds They also disproportionate to copper and copper compounds Most of them do not dissolve in water

Copper compounds are weak oxidizing agents They are greenish when hydrous They are more stable in air than copper compounds

Illinois State University is a public university in Normal Illinois Founded in 1857 it is Illinois oldest public university 

Acetylide also known as ethynide dicarbide and percarbide is an ion Its chemical formula is C22 It is made by deprotonation of acetylene Some acetylides are explosive Many acetylides are used in organic chemistry Some are known as carbides Copper acetylide is an example

The very first Bridgestone tire was produced on April 9 1930 by the Japanese Tabi Socks Tyre Division On March 1 1931 the founder Shojiro Ishibashi made the Tabi Socks tire Division independent and established the Bridgestone Tire Co Ltd in the city of Kurume Fukuoka Prefecture Bridgestone was named after the name of the founder Shojiro Ishibashi

Abstraction is a process of removing or hiding details about something It concerns the ways by which higher less real concepts are derived from the usage and classification of literal data or other information

Abstractions may be formed by reducing the information content of a concept or a phenomenon as viewed often to keep only the information which is needed for a particular purpose For example abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a ball will keep only the information on general ball attributes and behavior omitting the traits of that particular ball Compare with word generalizing The opposite of the adjective abstract is commonly the word concrete

The first symbols of abstract thinking in humans can be traced to fossil objects dating between 50000 and 100000 years ago in Africa

In philosophical terminology abstraction is the thought process wherein ideas are distanced from objects

Abstraction uses a strategy of simplification where formerly concrete details are left ambiguous vague or undefined thus effective communication about things in the abstract requires an intuitive or common experience between the communicator and the communication recipient

For example many different things can be the color red Likewise many things sit on surfaces The property of redness and the relation sitting on are therefore abstractions of those objects Specifically the conceptual diagram graph 1 identifies only three boxes two ellipses and four arrows whereas the picture 1 shows much more pictorial detail with the scores of implied relationships as implicit in the picture rather than with the nine explicit details in the graph

Graph 1 details some explicit relationships between the objects of the diagram For example the arrow between the agent and CATElsie depicts an example of an is a relationship as does the arrow between the location and the MAT The arrows between the gerund SITTING and the nouns agent and location express the diagrams basic relationship agent is SITTING on location Elsie is an instance of CAT

Although the description sitting on is more abstract than the graphic image of a cat sitting on a mat the delineation of abstract things from concrete things is somewhat ambiguous this ambiguity or vagueness is characteristic of abstraction Thus something as simple as a newspaper might be specified to six levels as in Douglas Hofstadters illustration of that ambiguity with a progression from abstract to concrete in Gdel Escher Bach 

An abstraction can thus encapsulate each of these levels of detail with no loss of generality But perhaps a detective or philosopherscientistengineer might seek to learn about some thing at progressively deeper levels of detail to solve a crime or a puzzle

Abstractions sometimes have ambiguous referents for example happiness can refer to as many things as there are people and events or states of being which make them happy Likewise architecture refers not only to the design of safe functional buildings but also to elements of creation and innovation which aim at elegant solutions to construction problems to the use of space and to the attempt to evoke an emotional response in the builders owners viewers and users of the building

Things that do not exist at any particular place and time are often considered abstract By contrast instances or members of such an abstract thing might exist in many different places and times Those abstract things are then said to be multiply instantiated in the sense of picture 1 picture 2 etc shown above

An abstraction can be seen as a process of mapping multiple different pieces of constituent data to a single piece of abstract data based on similarities in the constituent data for example many different physical cats map to the abstraction CAT This conceptual scheme emphasizes the inherent equality of both constituent and abstract data thus avoiding problems arising from the distinction between abstract and concrete In this sense the process of abstraction entails the identification of similarities between objects and the process of associating these objects with an abstraction

Chains of abstractions can therefore be constructed moving from neural impulses arising from sensory perception to basic abstractions such as color or shape to experiential abstractions such as a specific cat to semantic abstractions such as the idea of a CAT to classes of objects such as mammals and even categories such as object as opposed to action

This conceptual scheme entails no specific hierarchical taxonomy only a progressive exclusion of detail

A recent meta analysis suggests that the verbal system has greater engagement for abstract concepts when the perceptual system is more engaged for processing of concrete concepts This is because abstract concepts cause greater brain activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus compared to concrete concepts when concrete concepts cause greater activity in the posterior cingulate precuneus fusiform gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus

Other research into the human brain suggests that the left and right hemispheres of the brain differ in their handling of abstraction For example one meta analysis reviewing human brain lesions has shown a left hemisphere bias during tool usage

Typically abstraction is used in the arts as a synonym for abstract art in general Strictly speaking it refers to art unconcerned with the literal depiction of things from the visible worldit can however refer to an object or image which has been distilled from the real world or indeed another work of art Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract that which derives from but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction In the 20th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science technology and changes in urban life eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory Later still abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms such as color freed from objective context and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs

In music the term abstraction can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation and may sometimes indicate abandonment of tonality Atonal music has no key signature and is characterized the exploration of internal numeric relationships

Carl Jungs definition of abstraction broadened its scope beyond the thinking process to include exactly four mutually exclusive opposing complementary psychological functions sensation intuition feeling and thinking Together they form a structural totality of the differentiating abstraction process Abstraction operates in one of these opposing functions when it excludes the simultaneous influence of the other functions and other irrelevancies such as emotion Abstraction requires selective use of this structural split of abilities in the psyche The opposite of abstraction is concretism Abstraction is one of Jungs 57 definitions in Chapter XI of Psychological Types There is an abstract thinking just as there is abstract feeling sensation and intuition Abstract thinking singles out the rational logical qualities Abstract feeling does the same with its feeling values I put abstract feelings on the same level as abstract thoughts Abstract sensation would be aesthetic as opposed to sensuous sensation and abstract intuition would be symbolic as opposed to fantastic intuition 

Computer scientists use abstraction to understand and solve problems such as organizing data to be stored in a database

Abstraction in mathematics is the process of extracting the underlying essence of a mathematical concept removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena

The advantages of abstraction in mathematics are

The main disadvantage of abstraction is that highly abstract concepts are more difficult to learn and require a degree of mathematical maturity and experience before they can be assimilated

Eye makeup is a type of cosmetics which aims to make the eyes look noticeable and attractive It is mostly used by females and by stage performers of all types Eye makeup is an important part of the fashion and cosmetic industries The main types of eye makeup are

The idea can be taken much further The colour of the eye can be altered by using contact lenses Glitter and other appliqus can be stuck on near the eye Fake eyelashes or eyelash extensions are possible Eyebrow plucking is quite common for brunettes

Mascara is a cosmetic used to darken colour thicken lengthen or define eyelashes Historically it was usually black but now it also comes in many colours and tints Mascara comes in three forms liquid cake and cream It is available in tubes with wand applicators Ingredients in mascara include water wax thickeners film formers and preservatives 

Eye shadow is a cosmetic that is applied on the eyelids and under the eyebrows The average distance between eyelashes and eyebrows is twice as big in women as in men Pale eye shadow visually enlarges this area and has a feminising effect

Eye shadow can be applied in a variety of ways depending upon the desired look Typically application is done using sponges fingers andor brushes The most important aspect of applying eye shadow and makeup in general is blending well

To remove eye shadow a commercial eye makeup remover may be used though a face wash will usually remove all traces of colour Generally it is easy to remove and simple water and soap can be used Eye shadow eyeliner and mascara may also be removed using baby oil or olive oil There are also makeup wipes that may be used

Eye liner is a cosmetic used to define the eyes It is applied around the contours of the eye along and above the edges of the eyelids where the eyelashes grow Often applied just on the outer half of the eye

Depending on its texture eyeliner can be softly smudged or clearly defined There are four main types available on the market 

Kohl is an ancient black eye pigment which survives to the present day in the Mediterranean the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent It was a dark colored powder made of crushed galena andor antimony burnt almonds lead cupric oxide ochre ash malachite or any combination of them It may be used as an eye liner mascara or eyeshadow

The upper and lower eyelids were painted in a line that extended to the sides of the face for an almond effect In addition to reducing sun glare it was believed that kohl eyeliner could restore good eyesight and reduce eye infection Kohl was kept in a small flat bottomed pot with a wide tiny rim and a flat disk shaped lid According to images of the time the use of makeup was not limited to women Highly polished silver and copper mirrors aided the application of makeup

The Indy Racing League is an American based open wheel auto racing sanctioning body The League sanctions three racing series The premier IZOD IndyCar Series the two developmental series Firestone Indy Lights and the US F2000 National Championship ICS is sometimes considered the same as the Indy Racing League The Indy Racing Leagues centerpiece race is the Indianapolis 500

The IRL is owned by Hulman and Co which also owns the Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex and the Clabber Girl brand

On September 10 2010 the IRL announced that effective January 1 2011 the Indy Racing League will simply be known as IndyCar

Open wheel car describes cars with the wheels outside the cars main body and in most cases one seat Other names include formula car single seater car in British English or Indy car in the United States Open wheel cars are different from street cars sports cars stock cars and touring cars These car have their wheels below or inside the body or fenders Open wheel cars are usually built just for racing Often they have a higher amount of technological sophistication than in other forms of motor racing

A typical open wheeler has a small cockpit It is only large enough for the drivers body The head is exposed to the air In modern cars the engine is often located directly behind the driver and drives the rear wheels Depending on the rules of the class many types of open wheelers have spoilers or wings They are very low and have an almost flat bottom These help add aerodynamic downforce This pushes the car on to the road and makes it handle better

Some races such as the Monaco Grand Prix are held on temporary street circuits Most open wheel races are on dedicated road courses such as the Nrburgring in Germany In the United States some top level open wheel events are held on ovals both short track and superspeedways The most famous the annual Indianapolis 500 

Driving an open wheel car is very different from driving a car with fenders Open wheel vehicles are light weight have good aerodynamics and powerful engines Wheel to wheel contact is dangerous If the forward edge of one tire contacts the rear of another tire the vehicle my be flipped into the air and upside down 

A Speech and Language Therapist is a health care professional who specialises in communication and swallowing difficulties The main part of their work involves assessing people and planning therapy They work with people of all ages across different settings such as nurseries schools day centres care homes clinics and hospitals

These can include difficulties with fluency making sounds and words making sentences understanding what others say and using language socially These difficulties fall into two main areas

There are two types of language difficulties

People with receptive language difficulties have problems understanding spoken and written language Because of this they usually also have expressive language difficulties although this is not always the case

People with expressive language difficulties are able to understand but cannot say the words and sentences they want to This may be because of word finding difficulties or problems making sentences 

In children language difficulties are divided up into 

Where language difficulties occur with no other difficulties the child may be diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment 

In adults acquired receptive and expressive language impairments are known as aphasia There are many different types of aphasia depending on which areas of the brain are damaged and what symptoms they show

Speech therapists can help people with swallowing difficulties They help patients through changing their diets to different textures and consistencies or they may recommend non oral feeding 

A semi automatic shotgun is a kind of gun It fires one shotgun shell every time the trigger is pulled Most shotguns such as pump action shotguns lever action shotguns and break barrel shotguns use no energy from the last fired shell to load the next one A person using a semi automatic shotgun has to load the first shell themselves The rest of the shells are loaded by the gun using part of the energy used to first each shell 

Some shotguns can be semi automatic pump action or fully automatic The Spas 12 for example can fire in semi automatic mode or it can use a pump action Pump action allows less deadly projectiles such as bean bags or gas canisters to be used Some shotguns such as the AA 12 can be fully automatic or it can be switched to semi automatic mode

Semi automatic shotguns are commonly used by special forces military and for other uses where shells need to be fired quickly without reloading

The IZOD IndyCar Series is the premier level of American open wheel racing The current series was founded by Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony George It began in 1996 as a competitor to CART known as the Indy Racing League In 2008 the IndyCar Series merged with the Champ Car World Series The series continues to be sanctioned by the Indy Racing League

The IRL was unable to utilize the name IndyCar until the beginning of the 2003 for legal reasons For 1996 1997 the series was simply called the USAC Indy Racing League For 1998 1999 the series received its first title sponsor and was known as the Pep Boys Indy Racing League In 2000 the series sponsor became the Internet search engine Northern Light The series was named the Indy Racing Northern Light Series This only lasted two of the planed five year contract

The league went back to the Indy Racing League name for the 2002 season The IndyCar Series name was adopted in 2003 For the 2008 season DirecTV served as a presenting sponsor and the series was briefly advertised as the IndyCar Series in DIRECTV HD

IZOD was announced as the series title sponsor beginning on November 5 2009 The contrace runs for at least 5 years

The IndyCar Series is not an open formula where teams build their own cars Chassis and engine manufacturers provided products only to the league in three year cycles Currently Dallara provides the chassis to all teams and Honda is the sole engine supplier The series basically a one make or spec series

In the series first season in 1996 used older CART chassis Any chassis built by Lola and Reynard from 1992 to 1995 could be used The current Indycar started in 1997 Tony George defined rules for less expensive cars and production based engines This outlawed the CART chassis and turbocharged engines These had been the type of race car used at the Indianapolis 500 since the late 1960s 

Dallara began producing Indycars for the 1997 season The G Force chassis was introduced in 1997 It won the 1997 and 2000 Indy 500 races In 2002 lan Motorsport Technologies bought G Force The chassis was re named Panoz G Force and then shortened to Panoz in 2005 

Riley Scott produced IndyCar chassis from 1997 2000 

From the outside IndyCars resemble those of other open wheeled formula racing cars They have front and rear wings and large air intakes

At its inception the IRL used methanol racing fuel Methanol has been the standard choice in American open wheel racing since a fiery crash at the 1964 Indianapolis 500 Methanol provided a safer alternative to gasoline It does not start burning as quickly as gasoline A methanol fire can be put out with water A methanol fire cannot be seen in daylight which is a problem Material was added to the fuel so it would burn with a color

For the 2006 season the fuel was a 9010 mixture of methanol and ethanol Starting in 2007 the league advertised using 100 Fuel Grade Ethanol The mixture was actually 98 ethanol and 2 gasoline The additives satisfied the US governments requirement that the alcohol be unfit for human consumption It also adds a visible color in case of a fire 

For the 1996 season the old CART specification engines were used They were also used for the first two races of the 1996 97 season They were V8 engines with 45 inches of turbocharger boost The Menard Buick V6 engine was used in 1996 with 55 inches of boost was also used 

Ford Cosworth provided support to teams running their older spec engines The Ilmor Mercedes V8 engine was allowed It was only used once at the 1996 Indy 500

Starting in 1997 IRL cars were powered by 40 L V8 methanol burning engines They were production based and normally aspirated engines They were produced by Oldsmobile under the Aurora label and Nissan under the Infiniti label They produced around 700 horsepower The engine rules changed in 2000 The displacement was dropped from 40L to 35L The block no longer needed to be production based In 2004 the displacement was further reduced to 30L to curb top speeds

When General Motors ended the Oldsmobile name the engine label was changed to Chevrolet starting with the 2002 season In August 2003 Chevrolet announced its Gen IV motor a rebadged Cosworth motor for competition At the time Cosworth was owned by Ford On November 4 2004 Chevrolet stated that it would be ending its IRL engine program at the end of the 2005 season 

In 2003 Toyota came to the IRL In November 2005 Toyota company officials announced the companys withdrawal from American open wheel racing and the immediate discontinuation of its IRL program This was the same time they entered into NASCARs Craftsman Truck Series 

Honda also came to the IRL in 2003 By 2005 was clearly the dominant engine manufacturer Starting in 2006 they became the only engine manufacturer in the IndyCar Series and will continue in that capacity until 2010 The Honda engine is designed and produced by Ilmor Engineering which is part owned by Roger Penske

IndyCar Series engines are rev limited to 10300 Revolutions per minute and produce approximately 650 hp The valve train is a dual overhead camshaft configuration with four valves per cylinder The crankshaft is made of alloy steel with five main bearing caps The pistons are forged aluminum alloy while the connecting rods are machined alloy steel The electronic engine management system is supplied by Motorola firing a Capacitor discharge ignition ignition system The engine lubrication is a dry sump type cooled by a single water pump

Following the merger of CARTChamp Car into the Indy Racing League in 2008 the IRL acquired all intellectual property and historic records

Charles Frederick Worth widely considered the Father of Haute Couture was an English fashion designer of the 19th century whose works were produced in Paris The Parisien Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture was his conception It has the legal authority to decide who may use the term haute couture

Worth made his mark in the French fashion industry He worked at several prosperous London drapery shops before moving to Paris in 1846 He was hired by Gagelin and Opigez well known Parisian drapers While working in their shop he married one of the firms models Marie Vernet Worth made a few simple dresses for his wife and customers started to ask for copies of the dresses as well 

Worth by now a junior partner in the firm urged his partners to expand into dressmaking but they hesitated Worth found a wealthy Swede Otto Bobergh who was willing to bankroll the venture and opened the dressmaking establishment of Worth and Bobergh in 1858 Worth was soon patronized by the French Empress Eugnie and after that by many titled rich and otherwise notable women He also dressed actresses such as Sarah Bernhardt and singers such as Nellie Melba Many of his customers travelled to Paris from other countries coming from as far away as New York and Boston 

He removed excessive ruffles and frills and used rich fabrics in simple but flattering outlines He is credited as the first designer to put labels onto the clothing he manufactured Worth gave his customers luxurious materials and exact fit Rather than let the customer dictate the design as had previously been dressmaking practice four times a year he displayed model dresses at fashion shows This was the start of the fashion show as we know it

His patronesses would pick a model which would then be sewn in fabrics of their choice and tailored to their figure Worth was sufficiently fashionable that he had to turn away customers This only added to his fame He completely revolutionized the business of dressmaking He was the first of the couturiers dressmakers considered artists rather than mere artisans

Worth and Bobergh shut down during the Franco Prussian War and re opened in 1871 without Bobergh as the House of Worth Worth took his sons Gaston and Jean Philippe into his business and the couture house continued to flourish after his death in 1895

The great fashion dynasty finally came to an end in 1952 when Charles Frederick Worths great grandson Jean Charles retired from the family business In 1954 the House merged with Paquin Then in 1956 it was closed 

Worth was one of the first couture houses to give its name to a luxury perfume In 1924 Les Parfums Worth launched the first fragrance Dans La Nuit and Rene Lalique the world renowned glass maker designed the bottle Between the wars the House produced five perfumes Dans La Nuit Vers le Jours Sans Adieu Je Reviens and Vers Toi

Je Reviens remains the most famous of Worths perfumes The perfume became a favoured gift from soldiers to their sweethearts during WWII The top London store Harrods offers the perfume in its classic blue ridged bottle which dates back to the perfumes original launch 

The House of Worth has re emerged Dilesh Mehta and Martin McCarthy recently combined their intellectual properties for Worth perfume and apparel This meant for the first time since the 1920s the House is reunited and restored 

The House of Worth resumed in January 2010 with a revival couture collection by Giovanni Bedin The springsummer collection was unveiled in Paris at Les Salons France Amriques and the winter collection in Milan Bedins exquisite corsets and tutus with clouds of tulle and antique lace echo Worths ideas Customers include Scarlett Johansson Kylie Minogue and Charlize Theron 

A stagecoach is a type of horse drawn coach for passengers and goods They were one of the first forms of organized public transport and originated in the 1600s in Great Britain Before railways were invented in the first part of the nineteenth century they were the fastest way to travel long distances Stage coaches were operated across Europe and North America 

The coach would travel between stops called stages at which passengers could obtain food and drink and the horses that pulled the coach would be changed for fresh ones Regularly changing horses meant the coach could travel much faster than other vehicles They were mostly of light weight construction which also allowed them to go faster Their speed meant they were used to carry mail and often called a mail coach

The name is sometimes shortened to simply a stage

The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company is a tire company founded by Harvey Firestone in 1900 They supplied air filled tires for wagons buggies and other forms of wheeled vehicles common at the time Firestone soon saw the possibility for increasing sales by making tires for automobiles The company was a early leader in the mass production of tires Firestone become the original equipment supplier of Ford Motor Company automobiles They also sold a lot of replacement tires

In 1988 the company was sold to the Japanese Bridgestone Corporation It is now known as Bridgestone Firestone

Firestone was originally based in Akron Ohio That was also the home of its rival Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company The company initiated operations in 1900 with 12 employees Together Firestone and Goodyear were the largest suppliers of automotive tires in North America for over three quarters of a century In 1906 Firestone was chosen by Henry Ford for the Model T

At one point the company had a rubber plantation in Liberia that covered more than 4000 square kilometers

During World War II the company make artillery shells aluminum kegs for food transport and other rubberized military products In the 1940s Firestone was given a defense contract to produce plastic helmet liners 

In 1951 Firestone was given the defense contract for the MGM 5 Corporal missile In 1961 Firestone acquired the Dayton Tire division from the Dayco Corporation

In late 1979 Firestone brought in John Nevin as president He was the former head of Zenith Electronics Firestone was more than a billion dollars in debt at the time and losing 250 million dollars a year Nevin closed nine of the companys seventeen manufacturing plants He moved the company Akron to Chicago He split the non tire related businesses from the main company In 1988 Nevin negotiated the sale of the company to the Japanese company Bridgestone Bridgestone Corporation Japan was able to buy the company for much less than it had been worth a decade and a half earlier The combined Bridgestone Firestone North American operations are now based in Nashville Tennessee

Firestone has been a major tire supplier for Formula One teams From F11950 to F11975 they supplied tires to a number of teams including Ferrari Team Lotus and Honda They had 121 cars start the race on their tires winning 49 of those races They were on the winning car of every Indianapolis 500 race from 1950 to 1960 These years the Indy 500 was part of the Formula One world championship series Their last win came in the 1972 Italian Grand Prix Firestone has four Drivers World Championships and three Constructors World Championships with teams using their tires

In 1950 Firestone along with General Motors and Standard Oil were charged and convicted of criminal conspiracy for their part in the Great American streetcar scandal The scandal included buying streetcar systems all across the United States They would shut them down and replacing them with buses 

Radial tires were introduced to the US market by rivals Goodrich and Michelin in the late 1960s Firestone lacked a radial The first radial tire design and built by Firestone was the Firestone 500 Radial Manufacturing of the new tire was done on equipment designed to build bias ply tires 

During the 1970s Firestone had major problems with the Firestone 500 radial At high speeds the steel belted radials started showing signs that the tread was coming apart from the tire The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation found that the tread separation problem was most likely a design defect affecting all Firestone 500s 

In 1977 Firestone recalled of 400000 tires produced at the Decatur plant Firestone blamed the problems on the consumer They said the problems were caused by under inflation and poor maintenance On October 20 1978 Firestone recalled over 7 million Firestone 500 tires Congressional hearings took place in 1978 The tire was found to be defective and the cause of 34 deaths In May 1980 NHTSA fined Firestone 500000 USD At that time was the largest fine imposed on any US corporation Several lawsuits were settled out of court The bad publicity hurt the companys sales and share price badly

In 1926 Firestone opened one of the worlds biggest rubber plantations in Liberia West Africa The International Labor Rights Fund said about Firestone cquoteThe Plantation workers allege among other things that they remain trapped by poverty and coercion on a frozen in time Plantation operated by Firestone in a manner identical to how the Plantation was operated when it was first opened by Firestone in 1926 Firestones management denied these claims They said the corporation provided employment pensions and health care to thousands of Liberians The company also provides education and training opportunities to employees and their children

In May 2006 the United Nations Mission in Liberia released a report on the state of human rights on Liberias rubber plantations According to the report Firestone did not monitor child labor very well UNMIL found that several problems They included pressure to meet company quotas incentive to support the family financially and lack of access to basic education The report also said that the workers housing provided by Firestone has not been renovated They had been built in the 1920s and 1930s

Dan Adomitis President of Firestone Natural Rubber Company talked to CNN about the production quotas and child labor He said that a worker will tap about 650 trees a day and spend a couple of minutes at each tree CNN pointed out the 650 trees at two minutes per tree is 1300 minutes That is more than 21 hours of work a day

In response to the claims Dan Adomitis said

In 1996 several state agencies in Arizona began having big problems with Firestone tires on Ford Explorers Firestone conducted an investigation of the complaints tested the tires and asserted that the tires had been abused or under inflated

According to Joan Claybrook of the group Public Citizen Ford also played a large part They said Ford told Firestone to add a nylon ply to the tires it manufactured in Venezuela for additional strength Ford changed the suspension to Explorers available in Venezuela Ford did not ask for the nylon ply for US made Firestone tires And they did it change the Explorer suspension on US models

There was a very high failure rate in Firestones Wilderness AT Firestone ATX and ATX II tires Several lawsuits were filed There was a mandatory recall of the tires In 2001 Bridgestone Firestone stopped working with Ford because they did not trust Ford They said Ford had not listened to warnings by Bridgestone Firestone about the design of the Ford Explorer In 2006 Firestone announced a new effort to recall the same tires recalled in 2000 More of the tires had been linked to recent deaths and injuries Firestone estimates 97 of the tires were replaced in the 2000 recall They are still concerned over spare tires that owners did not think to replace

High heels are shoes where the heels are much higher than the toes They are a fashion item for women and may also be worn by men Both cowboy boots and Cuban heels are shoes worn by men with higher heels

It matters a great deal how high the heels are Heels of 2 inches are standard for ballroom dancing and certainly quite safe for wear once the user has experience with them A ballroom dance competition may last with intervals for ten hours and is physically very demanding Any ill effect on a girls performance would be noticed These lower heels are safe The standard style for ballroom dancing is the court shoe soled in reverse leather with heels wider than 04 inches wider than the typical stiletto heels 

If the soles of the shoes are also raised then they are a quite different kind of shoe the platform shoe

Mid height heels are from 2 to 3 inches They are an intermediate between standard high heels and stiletto heels which are from 4 to 10 inches made of steel and very narrow at the base 04 inches or less They have been widely criticised for the health risks regular wear would bring They have also been criticised by feminists

Reasons for wearing high heels which are almost exclusively aesthetic include 

Reasons against wearing high heels which are almost exclusively health and practicality reasons include

There are so many types of shoe and so many differences between people that no type will suit everyone It is obvious that the higher the heel the riskier the shoe The more sensible versions are quite safe the extreme versions seen on fashion show catwalks are not for everyday wear A lot depends on their use Nurses tend to wear flat shoes office staff may prefer high heels Despite the critics high heels have been around for a long time and are probably going to stay

Leontyne Price is an American soprano particularly associated with Verdi roles notably Il trovatore and Aida One of the first black singers to enjoy an international career in opera

Born in Laurel Mississippi she studied at Central State College Wilberforce Ohio and with Florence Kimball at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City She began her professional career in 1952 when she appeared as Bess in George Gershwins Porgy and Bess on Broadway followed by an international tour She made her recital debut in New York City in 1954 and appeared in a television production of Tosca for NBC in 1955 

Her actual operatic debut took place in San Francisco in 1957 as Mme Lidoine in Poulencs Le dialogue des carmlites followed by her first Aida The role of Aida would quickly become her signature role and the vehicle for her debut in 1958 at the Vienna State Opera the Royal Opera House in London and at La Scala in Milan both in 1960 She also appeared at the Salzburg Festival as Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni and Leonora in Il trovatore

She made her debut at the Lyric Chicago Opera in 1959 and at the Metropolitan Opera in 1961 as Leonora in Il trovatore She was to sing at the Met for twenty four consecutive seasons Amongst her greatest roles are the female lead in operas such as Verdis Ernani Un ballo in maschera La forza del destino Mozarts Don Giovanni and Cosi fan tutte Puccinis Manon Lescaut Madame Butterfly La fanciulla del West Richard Strausss Ariadne auf Naxos etc

A hair follicle is a part of the skin which grows a hair by packing old cells together Attached inside the top of the follicle are sebaceous glands which are tiny sebum producing glands found in almost all skin except on the palms lips and soles of the feet The thicker the hair the more the number of sebaceous glands that are found

Also attached to the follicle is a tiny bundle of muscle fiber called the arrector pili which is responsible for causing the follicle lissis to become more perpendicular to the surface of the skin The muscle area can also cause the follicle to stick up slightly above the nearby skin with a pore incased with skin oil This process results in goose bumps Stem cells are located at the junction of the arrector and the follicle and are principally responsible for the ongoing hair production during a process known as the Anagen stage

The average growth rate of healthy hair follicles on the scalp is nearly convert05inmmlkon per month

At the base of the follicle is a structure that is called the papilla The papilla is made up mainly of connective tissue and a capillary loop Cell division in the papilla is either rare or non existent

Around the papilla is the hair matrix a collection of epithelial cells often mixed with the pigment producing cells known as melanocytes Cell division in the hair matrix is responsible for the cells that will form the major structures of the hair fiber and the inner root sheath The hair matrix epithelium is one of the fastest growing cell areas in the human body which is why some forms of chemotherapy which kill dividing cells or radiotherapy may lead to temporary hair loss The papilla is usually oval or pear shaped with the matrix wrapped almost totally around it except for a short stalk like connection to the surrounding connective tissue that provides access for the capillary

The root sheath is composed of an external and internal root sheath The external root sheath appears empty with cuboid cells when stained with HE stain The internal root sheath is composed of three layers Henles layer Huxleys layer and an internal cuticle that is continuous with the outer layer of the hair fiber

The hair fiber is composed of a cuticle that is continuous with the root sheath an intermediate cortex and an inner medulla

The bulge is located in the outer root sheath at the insertion point of the arrector pili muscle It houses several types of stem cells which supply the entire hair follicle with new cells and take part in healing the epidermis after a wound

Other structures associated with the hair follicle include arrector pili muscles sebaceous glands and apocrine sweat glands Hair follicle nerve receptors sense the position of the hairs

Before a baby is born the epithelium and underlying mesenchyma interact to form hair follicles

Hair grows in cycles of various phases anagen is the growth phase catagen is the involuting or regressing phase and telogen the resting or quiescent phase Each phase has several morphologically and histologically distinguishable sub phases Prior to the start of cycling is a phase of follicular morphogenesis There is also a shedding phase or exogen that is independent of anagen and telogen in which one of several hairs that might arise from a single follicle exits Normally up to 90 of the hair follicles are in anagen phase while 1014 are in telogen and 12 in catagen phase The cycles length varies on different parts of the body For eyebrows the cycle is completed in around 4 months while it takes the scalp 34 years to finish this is the reason eyebrow hairs have a much shorter length limit compared to hairs on the head Growth cycles are controlled by a chemical signal like epidermal growth factor

Anagen is the active growth phase of hair follicles The cells in the root of the hair are dividing rapidly adding to the hair shaft During this phase the hair grows about 1 cm every 28 days Scalp hair stays in this active phase of growth for 27 years The amount of time the hair follicle stays in the anagen phase is genetically determined At the end of the anagen phase an unknown signal causes the follicle to go into the catagen phase

The catagen phase is a short transition stage that occurs at the end of the anagen phase It signals the end of the active growth of a hair This phase lasts for about 23 weeks while a club hair is formed

Telogen phase The telogen phase is the resting phase of the hair follicle The club hair is the final product of a hair follicle in the telogen stage and is a dead fully keratinized hair Fifty to one hundred club hairs are shed daily from a normal scalp

He entered the University of Wyoming at Laramie in 1917 and graduated in 1921 He earned a BSc in electrical engineering He then went to graduate school In 1925 he received an MS from the University of Colorado In 1928 he received a PhD from Yale University Both graduate degrees were in mathematics and mathematical physics

The yo yo is a popular toy made with of a length of string tied at one end to a flat spool It is used by holding the free end of the string and pulling at it so as to cause the spool to turn while it is hanging in mid air either winding or unwinding the string It first became popular in the 1920s

In the simplest play the string is wound on the spool by hand The yo yo is then thrown downwards so that it goes down and unwinds the string It then climbs back winding the stringt up Finally the yo yo is grabbed ready to be thrown again Many other trick plays exist most based on the basic sleeper trick One of the most famous tricks on the yoyo is walk the dog This is done by throwing a strong sleeper and allowing the yoyo to roll across the floor

English historical names for the yo yo include bandalore and quiz French historical terms include bandalore incroyable de Coblenz emigrette and joujou de Normandie

The earliest surviving yo yo dates to 500 BC and was made using terra cotta clay disks A Greek vase painting from this date shows a boy playing yo yo Greek records from this time describe toys made out of wood metal or painted terra cotta The terra cotta disks were used to ceremonially offer the toys of youth to certain gods when a child came of age Disks of other materials were used for actual play 

Philippine historical records show that 16th century hunters hiding in trees used a rock tied to a string up to 20 feet in length to throw at wild animals beneath them The string meant they could get the rock back without having to come down from the tree

The Commonwealth of Australia is a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy The Commonwealth of Australia was formed in 1901 when the six self governing British colonies agreed to join together as one nation These colonies became the six states of Australia The written agreement is the Australian Constitution This was written at a Constitutional Convention and voted for by the people of the colonies 

The way the Australian Government is organized can be looked at in two ways The first is federalism which organizes the way powers are distributed between the Australian Government and the state governments The second is separation of powers into legislative executive and judiciary branches of government The Constitution supports the separation of powers in the way it sets out the roles of the branches of government

Section 1 of the Australian Constitution sets up a democratic legislature the bicameral Parliament of Australia This is the Queen and two houses the Senate and the House of Representatives Section 51 of the Constitution sets out the Commonwealth Governments legislative powers and gives certain powers and responsibilities to the federal government All remaining responsibilities are kept by the six States Each State has its own constitution so that Australia has seven sovereign Parliaments none of which can take over the powers of any other The High Court of Australia rules on any arguments between the Commonwealth and the States or among the States about their powers

The Commonwealth Parliament can propose changes to the Constitution To become law the proposals must be put to a referendum of all Australians of voting age The changes must get a double majority a majority of all votes and a majority of votes in a majority of States

The Commonwealth Constitution also says that the States can agree to give any of their powers to the Commonwealth This can be done by an amendment to the Constitution through a referendum More commonly if all the states agree then all state and Commonwealth parliaments pass laws to allow the transfer These transfer laws may have a sunset clause This is a part of the law that means the law is only in place for a certain time After this the original division of powers is put back

Australia has several territories three of which are self governing the Australian Capital Territory the Northern Territory and Norfolk Island The legislatures of these territories have powers given to them by the Commonwealth The Commonwealth Parliament keeps the power to overturn territorial legislation and to give or take powers While Australian citizens living in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are represented in the Commonwealth Parliament Norfolk Islanders are not 

Australias other territories are not self governing Instead these territories are governed by federal laws with Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands also having local governments The largely uninhabited Coral Sea Islands was set up as a Territory of the Commonwealth in 1969 The Ashmore and Cartier Islands has been a territory since 1933 run under the laws of the Northern Territory

The federal nature of the Commonwealth and the structure of the Parliament of Australia were the subject of long negotiations among the colonies The House of Representatives is elected on a basis which shows the different sized populations of the States So New South Wales has 50 members while Tasmania has only five But the Senate is elected on a basis of equality among the States all States have 12 Senators regardless of population This was so the Senators of the smaller States could form a majority and change or even reject laws from the House of Representatives The ACT and the NT elect two senators each

The third level of government after Commonwealth and StateTerritory is Local government These are organized as shires towns or cities Local governments are made up of elected representatives usually serving on a part time basis

Government is undertaken by three inter connected arms of government

The Separation of powers is the principle whereby the three arms of government do their activities separate from each other

Before the Australia Act 1986 and matching legislation in the parliament of the United Kingdom some Australian cases could be sent to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for final appeal Australian law is now only decided on in Australia and the High Court of Australia is the highest court of appeal The possibility of the British Parliament making laws to overturn the Australian Constitution was also removed

The Legislature makes the laws and supervises the activities of the other two arms with a view to changing the laws if needed The Australian Parliament is bicameral made up of the Queen a 76 member Senate and a 150 member House of Representatives Twelve Senators from each state are elected for six year terms using proportional representation and the single transferable vote known in Australia as preferential voting with half elected every three years 

There are also two senators elected by voters from the Northern Territory Another two senators are elected by the voters of the Australian Capital Territory Senators from the territories are also elected using preferential voting however their term of office is not fixed it starts on the day of a general election for the House of Representatives and ends the day before the next such election day

The members of the House of Representatives are elected by preferential voting from single member areas spread among the states and territories roughly in proportion to population In ordinary legislation the two chambers have the same powers but all laws for spending money or charging taxes must come from the House of Representatives In the Westminster system the leader of the political party or group of parties that holds the support of a majority of the members in the House of Representatives is asked to form a government and is named Prime Minister 

The Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament of which they must be members General elections are held at least once every three years The Prime Minister can advise the Governor General to call an election for the House of Representatives at any time but Senate elections can only be held within certain periods set out in the Constitution The most recent general election was on 21 August 2010 

The Commonwealth Parliament and all the state and territory legislatures use the Westminster system They have a recognised Leader of the Opposition usually the leader of the largest party outside the government There is also a Shadow Cabinet of Opposition members who shadow each member of the Ministry asking questions on matters about the Ministers responsibilities The government because it has a majority of members in the lower house of the legislature can usually pass its legislation and control the workings of the house The Opposition can slow down the process and obstruct government business if it chooses The day to day business of the house is usually worked out between a senior Minister who holds the title Leader of the House and an Opposition frontbencher known as the Manager of Opposition Business 

The Australian Constitution was written in 1901 when the Dominions of the British Empire were not independent countries and does not use the words head of state In practice the role of head of state of Australia is divided between two people the Queen of Australia and the Governor General of Australia The Governor General is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister of Australia Though in many respects the Governor General is the Queens representative and exercises various constitutional powers in her name they are also independently vested with many important constitutional powers by the Constitution 

The Sovereign of Australia is currently Queen Elizabeth II She is also the Sovereign of fifteen other Commonwealth Realms including the United Kingdom Like the other Dominions Australia gained legislative independence from the Parliament of the United Kingdom through the Statute of Westminster 1931 This came into force in Australia in 1942 but back dated to 3 September 1939 With the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953 the Australian Parliament gave the Queen the title Queen of Australia In 1973 her Australian title no longer included her status as Queen of the United Kingdom and Defender of the Faith 

Section 61 of the Constitution says that The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the GovernorGeneral as the Queens representative and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution and of the laws of the Commonwealth Section 2 of the Australian Constitution says that a Governor General shall represent the Queen in Australia In practice the Governor General carries out all the tasks usually done by a head of state without asking the Queen 

The question of whether the Queen is Australias head of state became a political one during the 1999 Australian republic referendum when opponents of the move to make Australia a republic claimed that Australia already had an Australian as head of state in the person of the Governor General who since 1965 has invariably been an Australian citizen The former Governor General Major General Michael Jeffery said in 2004 Her Majesty is Australias head of state but I am her representative and to all intents and purposes I carry out the full role However in 2005 he declined to name the Queen as head of state instead saying in response to a direct question The Queen is the Monarch and I represent her and I carry out all the functions of head of state The Governor General represents Australia internationally making and receiving State visits

In 2009 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd called the Governor General the Australian head of state He said an overseas visit by Quentin Bryce to Africa of this scale by Australias Head of State will express the seriousness of Australias commitment

Under the Westminster system the Governor Generals powers are almost always used on the advice of the Prime Minister or other ministers The Governor General retains reserve powers similar to those possessed by the Queen in the United Kingdom These are rarely exercised but during the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975 Governor General Sir John Kerr used them independently of the Queen and the Prime Minister

Several times people in Australia have wanted to remove the monarchy In a 1999 referendum the Australian people voted on a proposal to change the Constitution The proposal would have removed the Queen from the Constitution and replaced the Governor General with a President nominated by the Prime Minister but needing the approval of a two thirds majority of both Houses of the Parliament The proposal was defeated The Australian Republican Movement continues to call for an end to the monarchy in Australia opposed by Australians for Constitutional Monarchy

The Federal Executive Council consists of the Governor General the Prime Minister and Ministers It is a formal body which exists to give legal effect to decisions made by the Cabinet and to carry out various other functions Members of the Executive Council are entitled to be styled The Honourable a title which they retain for life The Governor General usually presides at Council meetings but a Minister with the title Vice President of the Executive Council serves as the link between the government and the Council

The Constitution of Australia does not mention the Cabinet and its decisions have no legal force All members of the ministry must be sworn as members of the Federal Executive Council This council is chaired by the Governor General and which meets solely to approve and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet That is why there is always a member of the ministry holding the title Vice President of the Executive Council

Until 1956 all members of the ministry were members of the Cabinet With more ministers added in the 1940s and 1950s this made the cabinet too big In 1956 Robert Menzies created a two level ministry with only senior ministers in the Cabinet These are known as the front bench because the sit on the front bench seats in the Parliament This practice has been continued by all governments except the Whitlam Government

When the non Labor parties have been in power the Prime Minister has made all Cabinet and ministerial appointments When the Liberal Party and its predecessors have been in coalition with the National Party or its predecessor the Country Party the leader of the junior Coalition party has had the right decide his partys members of the Coalition ministry and to work with the Prime Minister to give them their responsibilities

When the Labor first held office under Chris Watson Watson used the right to choose members of his Cabinet In 1907 however the party decided that future Labor Cabinets would be elected by the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party the Caucus The Prime Minister would allocate their responsibilities The Labor Prime Ministers had a lot of influence over who was elected to Labor ministries although the leaders small groups inside the party also had a lot of power Prior to the 2007 general election Kevin Rudd said that he and he alone would choose the ministry if he become Prime Minister His party won the election and he chose the ministry as he said he would 

The cabinet meets not only in Canberra but also in other Australian state capitals most often Sydney and Melbourne Kevin Rudd said he wanted the Cabinet to meet in other places such as major regional cities The Commonwealth Parliament Offices in Sydney are located in Phillip Street

There are times when the government acts in a caretaker capacity principally in the period prior to and immediately following a general election

The Judiciary interprets the laws using as a basis the laws as enacted and what was said in the Legislature while the laws were being passed

The Met Office is the United Kingdoms national weather service

More than 50 of its revenue comes from goods and services This is why it is a trading fund of the Ministry of Defence 

Part of the Met Office headquarters at Exeter in Devon is the Met Office College This does the training for internal personnel and many forecasters from around the world

One of the British stalwarts the Shipping Forecast is produced by the Met Office and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 The Shipping Forecast has long been vital to the safety of mariners on the seas around the British Isles

The Met Office is responsible for issuing Severe Weather Warnings for the United Kingdom through the National Severe Weather Warning Service These warn of weather which may affect transport and lives In March 2008 the system was improved and a new stage of warning was introduced the Advisory

Its main role is to produce forecast models It gathers information from weather satellites in space and observations on earth The information is fed into two IBM supercomputers The computers use models based on a software package known as the Unified Model The principal weather products for UK customers are 36 hour forecasts from the newly operational 15 km resolution UKV model covering the UK and surroundings 48 hour forecasts from the 12 km resolution NAE model covering Europe and the North Atlantic and 144 hour forecasts from the 25 km resolution global model A wide range of other products for other regions of the globe are sold to customers abroad They are used by MOD operations abroad or provided free to developing countries in Africa If necessary forecasters may make adjustments to the computer forecasts

Statistical process control is the use of statistical methods in the monitoring and control of a process by repeatedly sampling measurements or counts to predict results Under SPC a process behaves predictably to produce results with the least possible waste Once a process has become stable and responds as predicted then it is said to be in a state of statistical control While SPC has been applied most frequently to controlling manufacturing lines it applies equally well to any process which has measurable factors Key tools in SPC are control charts a focus on continuous improvement and designed experiments

Much of the power of SPC lies in the ability to examine a process for the sources of variation in that process by using tools which give weight to objective analysis over subjective opinions and which allow the strength of each source to be determined numerically Variations in the process which might affect the quality of the end product or service can be detected and corrected thus reducing waste as well as the likelihood that problems will be passed on to the customer With its emphasis on early detection and prevention of problems SPC has a distinct advantage over other quality methods such as inspection which apply resources to detecting and correcting problems after they have occurred

In addition to reducing waste SPC can lead to a reduction in the time required to produce the product or service from end to end This is partially due to a reduced likelihood that the final product will have to be reworked but it may also result from using SPC data to identify bottlenecks wait times and other sources of delays within the process Process cycle time reductions coupled with improvements in yield have made SPC a valuable tool from both a cost reduction and a customer satisfaction standpoint

Statistical process control was pioneered by Walter A Shewhart in the early 1920s W Edwards Deming later applied SPC methods in the US during World War II thereby successfully improving quality in the manufacture of munitions and other strategically important products Deming was also instrumental in introducing SPC methods to Japanese industry after the war had ended

Shewhart created the basis for the control chart and the concept of a state of statistical control by carefully designed experiments While Dr Shewhart drew from pure mathematical statistical theories he understood that data from physical processes seldom produces a normal distribution curve He discovered how the observed variation in manufacturing data did not always behave the same way as data in nature Dr Shewhart concluded that while every process displays variation some processes display controlled variation that is natural to the process while others display uncontrolled variation that is not present in the process causal system at all times

In 1989 the Software Engineering Institute introduced the notion that SPC can be usefully applied to non manufacturing processes such as software engineering processes in the Capability Maturity Model This idea exists today within the Level 4 and Level 5 practices of the Capability Maturity Model Integration However this notion that SPC is a useful tool when applied to non repetitive knowledge intensive processes such as engineering processes has encountered much skepticism and remains controversial today The problem lies in numerous areas of software which are not repetitive but instead are one time or one off aspects of quality rather than being observed for repeated performance over a long term view In those cases having a test first method of built in performance tests can help detect problems in one time sections of software coding The overall result is that software can be developed with hundreds or thousands of built in performance tests in the theory that if any anomaly arises or errors are made then problems can be pinpointed by the numerous built in tests before causing an expensive problem only detected later in the software system

An analogy of built in tests would be having a car with thousands of electronic sensors attached to each part of the car Hence if a rock in the road or a vandal were to damage part of the car then the sensors would report unusual levels in various parts such as spark plug wire 5 losing charge a weakness in an axle or low pressure in a brake line before a tire falls off or the brakes fail The reason such extensive software tests are cost effective is because software components can be written quickly and might be used by thousands or millions of people analogous to a car which seated a million passengers as a mega risk if problems are not detected early Of course with thousands of built in tests the problem becomes trying to judge which unusual test results indicate a significant problem rather than just being many noise level anomalies Hence more computer software is needed to help prioritize the warning issues within various components of the system and determine the overall severity analogous to warning Stop the car now or Check parts ABC at next monthly servicing Because computers can run continuously they can even record the times at which anomalies occur such as the exact times when someone let the air out of 2 car tires

The following description relates to manufacturing rather than to the service industry although the principles of SPC can be successfully applied to either For a description and example of how SPC applies to a service environment refer to Roberts Selden describes how to use SPC in the fields of sales marketing and customer service using Demings famous Red Bead Experiment as an easy to follow demonstration

In mass manufacturing the quality of the finished article was traditionally achieved through post manufacturing inspection of the product accepting or rejecting each article based on how well it met its design specifications In contrast Statistical Process Control uses statistical tools to observe the performance of the production process in order to predict significant deviations that may later result in rejected product

Two kinds of variation occur in all manufacturing processes both these types of process variation cause subsequent variation in the final product The first is known as natural or common cause variation and consists of the variation inherent in the process as it is designed Common cause variation may include variations in temperature properties of raw materials strength of an electrical current etc The second kind of variation is known as special cause variation or assignable cause variation and happens less frequently than the first With sufficient investigation a specific cause such as abnormal raw material or incorrect set up parameters can be found for special cause variations

For example a breakfast cereal packaging line may be designed to fill each cereal box with 500 grams of product but some boxes will have slightly more than 500 grams and some will have slightly less in accordance with a distribution of net weights If the production process its inputs or its environment changes this distribution can change For example as its cams and pulleys wear out the cereal filling machine may start putting more cereal into each box than specified If this change is allowed to continue unchecked more and more product will be produced that fall outside the tolerances of the manufacturer or consumer resulting in waste While in this case the waste is in the form of free product for the consumer typically waste consists of rework or scrap

By observing at the right time what happened in the process that led to a change the quality engineer or any member of the team responsible for the production line can troubleshoot the root cause of the variation that has crept in to the process and correct the problem

SPC indicates when an action should be taken in a process but it also indicates when NO action should be taken An example is a person who would like to maintain a constant body weight and takes weight measurements weekly A person who does not understand SPC concepts might start dieting every time his or her weight increased or eat more every time his or her weight decreased This type of action could be harmful and possibly generate even more variation in body weight SPC would account for normal weight variation and better indicate when the person is in fact gaining or losing weight

Statistical Process Control may be broadly broken down into three sets of activities understanding the process understanding the causes of variation and elimination of the sources of special cause variation

In understanding a process the process is typically mapped out and the process is monitored using control charts Control charts are used to identify variation that may be due to special causes and to free the user from concern over variation due to common causes This is a continuous ongoing activity When a process is stable and does not trigger any of the detection rules for a control chart a process capability analysis may also be performed to predict the ability of the current process to produce conforming product in the future

When excessive variation is identified by the control chart detection rules or the process capability is found lacking additional effort is exerted to determine causes of that variance The tools used include Ishikawa diagrams designed experiments and Pareto charts Designed experiments are critical to this phase of SPC as they are the only means of objectively quantifying the relative importance of the many potential causes of variation

Once the causes of variation have been quantified effort is spent in eliminating those causes that are both statistically and practically significant Generally this includes development of standard work error proofing and training Additional process changes may be required to reduce variation or align the process with the desired target especially if there is a problem with process capability

A consultant is a professional who provides expert advice in a particular area of expertise Various consultants offer advice in management accountancy the environment entertainment technology law human resources marketing emergency management food production medicine finance statistics software life management economics public affairs communication engineering sound system design graphic design or waste management

A consultant is usually an expert or a professional in a specific field who also has a wide knowledge of the subject matter A consultant usually works for a consultancy firm or is self employed and engages with multiple and changing clients Thus clients have access to deeper levels of expertise than would be feasible for them to retain in house and may purchase only as much service from the outside consultant as desired

Consultant is also the term used to denote the most senior medical position in the United Kingdom Australia and Ireland

Some consultants are employed by a consult staffing company a company that provides consultants to clients This is particularly common in the technology sector Consultants are often called contractors in the technology sector in reference to their employment contract

Strategy consultants are common in upper management in many industries There are also independent consultants who act as interim executives with decision making power under corporate policies or statutes They may sit on specially constituted boards or committees

Consultants work at client places on behalf of a consultancy or Billing company

The Lesser Polish Way of Saint James is one of the very popular routes all over Europe This particular route was created in Poland It starts in the city of Sandomierz and end in the city of Cracow It roots are in Medieval times when many pilgrims travel through Europe to Santiago de Compostela The other famous places on The Lesser Polish Way are Klimontw Szczawory Wilica Wicawice

Carnarvon is a coastal town about 900 kilometres north of Perth Western Australia It is at the mouth of the Gascoyne River on the Indian Ocean The popular Shark Bay World Heritage Site lies to the south of the town In 2006 there were 5283 people living in Carnarvon

The town began in 1883 as a port and supply centre for the surrounding region It is the administrative centre for the Shire of Carnarvon the town site was officially listed on 4 June 1891 It was named after Henry Herbert 4th Earl of Carnarvon Under Secretary of State for the Colonies

Carnarvon has had three tramways

Carnarvon has a warm to hot dry climate Average yearly rainfall is convert226mmin2 with the rainiest months being in May and June Occasionally tropical cyclones will influence Carnarvon and bring very heavy rain high temperatures and strong winds Apart from possible cyclones summers are usually dry Temperatures range from an average maximum of 33C in February to 22C in July Average minimums are 23C and 11C respectively 

Main industries of the area include

During the 1960s NASA set up the Carnarvon Tracking Station to support the Gemini and Apollo space program The tracking station was closed in the mid 1970s Only the foundations of this historical site remain 

Radio Australia had a shortwave relay station that used to relay programming to Europe South Asia and South East Asia

There are five schools in the town three government run and two independent These schools are St Marys Star of the Sea Catholic School which was built in 1906 Carnarvon Senior High School East Carnarvon Primary School Carnarvon Primary School Carnarvon Christian School and Carnarvon School of the Air 

In 1964 and 1965 12 rockets were launched from Carnarvon to a maximum altitude of 120 km 

On 20 May 1988 the bulk carrier Korean Star ran aground in bad weather near Cape Cuvier within the port limits of Carnarvon Around 600 tonnes of fuel oil were spilled into the ocean Damage was limited to 10 km of remote beaches and coastline The ship was left grounded however very little of the wreck remains to be seen

Postcodes are used in Australia to sort and send mail to the correct address All postcodes in Australia have four numbers and are placed at the end of the address Australian postcodes are managed by Australia Post

Postcodes are published in small books which can be collected from your nearest post offices or online at the Australia Post website

On envelopes and postcards there are often four square boxes printed in orange ink at the bottom right for the postcode numbers These are used when addressing mail by hand

Postcodes were started in Australia in 1967 by the Postmaster Generals Department now called Australia Post They replaced earlier postal sorting systems such as Melbournes letter and number codes and a similar system once used in rural and regional New South Wales

Australian Postcodes are four numbers and written after the name of the city suburb or town and the state or territory

When writing an address by hand a row of four boxes is usually used

Australian postcodes are sorting information They are often linked with one area But sometimes they can be quite complex especially in country areas The south western Victoria 3221 postcode of the Geelong Mail Centre also includes twenty places around Geelong with very few people This means that mail for these places is not fully sorted until it gets to Geelong Some postcodes cover large populations while other postcodes have much smaller populations even in urban areas The postcode numbers range from as low as 0200 to 9729

Some towns and suburbs have two postcodesone for street deliveries and one for post office boxes For instance a street address in the Sydney suburb of Parramatta would be written like this

But mail sent to a PO Box in Parramatta would be addressed

Many big businesses government departments and other institutions receive large volumes of mail They can have their own postcode as a Large Volume Receiver eg the Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital has the postcode 4029 More postcode ranges were made available for LVRs in the 1990s

The first one or two numbers usually show the state or territory that the postcode belongs to

Sometimes near the state and territory borders Australia Post finds it easier to send mail through a nearby post office that is across the border

 These are postcodes that does not follow the above rule 

Some or all of the postcodes above may cover two states For example postcode 2620 covers both a suburb in NSW as well as a suburb in the ACT  the postcode is within the ACT range

Jervis Bay Territory once an exclave of the ACT but now a separate territory is geographically located on the coast of NSW It is just south of the towns of Vincentia and Huskisson with which it shares a postcode Mail to the Jervis Bay Territory is still addressed to the ACT

The numbers used to show the state on each radio callsign in Australia is the same number as the first number for postcodes in that state eg 2xx in New South Wales 3xx in Victoria etc Radio callsigns pre date postcodes in Australia by more than forty years

Australias external territories are also included in Australia Posts postcode system While these territories do not belong to any state they are addressed as such for mail sorting

Three scientific bases in Antarctica operated by the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions share a postcode with the isolated sub Antarctic island of Macquarie Island

Each states capital city ends with three zeroes while territorial capital cities end with two zeroes Capital city postcodes were the lowest postcodes in their state or territory range before new ranges for LVRs and PO Boxes were made available The last number can usually be changed from 0 to 1 to get the postcode for General Post Office boxes in any capital city

While the first number of a postcode usually shows the state or territory the second number usually shows a region within the state However postcodes with the same second number are not always next to each othera As an example postcodes in the range 22000001 are split between the southern suburbs of Sydney and the Central Coast of New South Wales

Postcodes with a second number of 0 or 1 are almost always located within the metropolitan area of the states capital city Postcodes with higher second numbers are usually located in rural and regional areas Common exceptions are where towns were rural when postcodes were first introduced in 1967 but have since been suburbanised and incorporated into metropolitan areas eg Penrith New South Wales has the postcode 2750 and Petrie Queensland has the postcode 4502

Within each region with the same second number postcodes usually get bigger the further one travels from the states capital city along major highways and railways For instance heading north on the North Coast railway in New South Wales away from Sydney

Major towns and cities tend to have 0 as the last number or last two numbers eg Rockhampton Queensland has the postcode 4700 and Ballarat Victoria has the postcode 3350 There are exceptions the major town of Ipswich Queensland has the postcode 4305 while Goodna a relatively unimportant suburb of Ipswich is allocated 4300

Post Office Preferred envelopes sold in Australia have four boxes in the bottom right corner of the front of the envelope These boxes or squares which by Australia Post calls postcode squares have the postcode for hand addressed mail This is for the purpose of Australia Posts automated mail sorting equipment which uses optical character recognition software Postcode squares were introduced in 1990Citation neededdateApril 2010

Australia Post says that postcode squares should not be used for machine addressed mail or mail going overseas

Many other organisations now use postcodes Insurance companies often use postcodes when working out the cost of car and house insurance The NSW Ministry of Transport uses postcodes to give specific numbers for each bus stop in Greater Sydney The stop number is five to seven numbers the first four are the postcode and the others show the bus stop Many companies that produce metropolitan street maps also list the postcodes for each suburb both in indexes on the maps themselves

To improve mechanised sorting each address now has a sorting number which is printed on the letter as an orange coloured barcode This number might be 12 numbers long This system enables the post office to place items in delivery order

To monitor or monitoring generally means to be aware of the state of a system Below are some examples

 The Medical Journal of Australia is a peer reviewed medical journal It is the official journal of the Australian Medical Association and began in 1914 It is published by the Australasian Medical Publishing Company Proprietary Limited The current editor in chief is Martin Van Der Weyden 

The journal publishes editorials articles case reports and letters The full text of every issue since January 2002 is available on their internet site

A statistician is someone who works with theoretical or applied statistics The profession exists in both the private and public sectors The core of that work is to measure interpret and describe some events in the world and spot patterns within them The field shares much common history with social science but often with a greater view on complex mathematical methods Statisticians commonly have higher college degrees or other credentials as proof that they are qualified for the job

It is common to combine statistical knowledge with expertise in other subjects The applications are varied Statisticians apply their knowledge to production research finance medicine insurance census taking government etc They often are employed to support managerial decisions or to supervise quality control in manufacturing 

According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics as of 2008 there were 22600 jobs listed as statistician in the United States Of these people approximately 30 worked for governments Additionally there are substantial numbers of persons who use statistics in their work but have job titles other than statistician The job of statistician is considered a profession Most statisticians work in offices and have regular working hours and can therefore be considered to be white collar workers A lower number of statisticians are self employed as statistical consultants

Most employment as a statistician requires a minimum of a masters degree in statistics or a related field Many professional statisticians have a PhD

Civilizations have used the work of statisticians for thousands of years Statistics was employed in ancient Egypt in censuses of population and cattle Typical work might involve developing a model and sampling plans analyzing survey results or making agricultural or econometric forecasts

The Stanford prison experiment was a scientific experiment done at Stanford University in 1971 The experiment was done in the field of psychology It tried to re create the conditions at a prison Philip Zimbardo was the psychologist who led the experiment Twenty four undergraduate students were selected to play the role of either prisoner or prison guard The role was assigned at random The students adapted to the roles beyond what Zimbardo had imagined After some time the guards used authoritarian measures The experiment even affected Zimbardo himself Five of the prisoners were upset enough by the process to quit the experiment early The experiment was abruptly stopped after only six days out of fifteen planned The experimental process and the results remain controversial The entire experiment was filmed Parts of the footage were soon made publicly available The resulting movie shocked certain peoplewho Over 30 years later Zimbardo found new interest in the experiment when the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal occurred 

The experiment also had certain problems

There has been a lot of interest for the events in the media At least the following movies were made

Wonderwall may mean one of the following

Alvin and the Chipmunks is a movie series which includes the movies Alvin and the Chipmunks Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel and Alvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked The movies series stars Jason Lee David Cross and the voices of Justin Long Jesse McCartney and Matthew Gray Gubler 

Acanthaceae is a one of 23 families in the mint order of flowering plants containing approximately 230 genera and nearly 3500 species distributed predominantly in tropical and subtropical regions of the world The greater part of the Acanthaceae family are herbs or shrubs but climbers and trees occur as well The range of habitats extends from marshes to extremely dry situations but most of these plants are found in damp tropical forests

Gesneriaceae is a one of 23 families in the order Lamiales of flowering plant consisting of 147 genera and about 3200 species of mostly tropical and subtropical herbaceous or slightly woody plants Many are of economic importance as horticultural ornamentals Among these are the African violets and gloxinias

A novella is a book shorter than a novel but longer than a short story Sometimes it is also called a novellette

Bignoniaceae or the Trumpet creeper or catalpa family of the mint order of flowering plants It contains about 112 genera and more than 725 species of trees shrubs and most commonly vines chiefly of tropical America tropical Africa and the Indo Malayan region They form an important part of the tropical forest vegetation because of the numerous climbing vines A few are found in temperate regions notably the catalpa tree the trumpet creeper and the cross vine

Super Aguri F1 was a Formula One racing team that competed from F12006 to F12008 The team was founded by former F1 driver Aguri Suzuki They were based in Tokyo Japan They operated from the former Arrows factory in Leafield UK The cars were called Super Aguri Honda because they used Honda engines The team was to some degree an unofficial Honda second team In Japan public pressure convinced Honda to help its former driver Takuma Sato to continue in Formula One This lead to the start of Super Aguri F1 and the engine supply from Honda The team competed two full years and part of the third year After four races in the F12008 season the team withdrew due to financial problems

The team started in September 2005 on 1 November 2005 the team told the FIA its wanted to enter the F12006 Formula One World Championship The FIA did not approved Super Aguris entry It was reported that the team failed to give the required 48 million entry bond on time Super Aguri applied for entry again in 2006 Because they missed the initial registration the team needed the existing ten teams to agree to its entry The other teams gave the required unanimous agreement Super Aguri was confirmed by the FIA on 26 January 2006

In 2006 the chassis Super Aguri SA05 was based on the 2002 Arrows A23 The Arrows chassis was bought from ex Minardi principal Paul StoddartStoddart had bought them when the Arrows team went bankrupt Super Aguri updated their old chassis to become the Super Aguri SA06 They were used from the German Grand Prix to the end of the year

Takuma Sato and Yuji Ide were the initial race drivers for the team in the 2006 season Franck Montagny as the third driver On 4 May after four races the team announced that Montagny would be replacing Ide as race driver Ides Super Licence had been revoked after a clash with Christijan Albers

For F12007 Super Aguri announced Takuma Sato and Anthony Davidson would be driving for the team 

When the new SA07 car was first tested by the FIA it failed the crash test It was less than 48 hours before the first practice session for the Australian Grand Prix that the SA07 chassis was ready At the Spanish Grand Prix the team scored its first point Takuma Sato finished in 8th place At the Canadian Grand Prix the team scored its highest finish Sato finishing in sixth place and earned three points

For F12008 Super Aguri kept their drivers Takuma Sato and Anthony Davidson following the acquisition of an unspecified portion of the team by the Magma Group became a part owner of the team The team did not attend the final pre season tests Not all the parts had arrived Magma canceled their proposed purchase leaving Super Aguris future in doubt Super Aguris equipment was denied entry to Istanbul Park for the Turkish Grand Prix Honda Racings CEO Nick Fry reportedly told the race organizers that Super Aguri would not be taking part On 6 May 2008 team founder and principal Aguri Suzuki announced that they were withdrawing from the 2008 World Championship due to financial problems He said the breach of contract by SS United Group Oil Gas Company resulting in the loss of financial backing The team was in financial difficulties

A team of corporate recovery partners were appointed to seek a buyer for Super Aguri The teams assets were bought by a German businessman named Franz Hilmer Hilmer unsuccessfully to enter the F12010 season under the Brabham name

Polite society often shortened to society is a euphemism for the upper class

It can also refer to

To compromise is to make a deal where one person gives up part of his or her demand In arguments compromise is a concept of finding agreement through communication through a mutual acceptance of terms while often involving variations from an original goal or desire Extremism is often considered as antonym to compromise which depending on context may be associated with concepts of balance or tolerance In the negative connotation compromise may be referred to as capitulation referring to a surrender of objectives principles or material in the process of negotiating an agreement In human relationships compromise is frequently said to be an agreement that no party is happy with this is because the parties involved often feel that they either gave away too much or that they received too little

From cultural background and influences the meaning and perception of the word compromise may be different In the UK Ireland and Commonwealth countries the word compromise has a positive meaning in the US it can have rather negative connotations as in compromising principles as a sell out of basic beliefs

Defining and finding the best possible compromise is an important problem in fields like game theory and the voting system

Research has indicated that less than optimal compromises are often the result of negotiators failing to realize when they have interests that are completely compatible with those of the other party and hence they settle for suboptimal agreements Mutually better outcomes can often be found by careful study of both parties interests especially if done early in negotiations 

Defined broadly a visionary is one who can envision the future For some groups this can involve the supernatural or use of mind altering drugs

A visionary state can be achieved via meditation drugs lucid dreams daydreams or art One example is Hildegard of Bingen a 12th century artistvisionary and Catholic saint Other visionaries in religion are Mohammed St Bernadette and Joseph Smith

A vision can be political religious environmental social or technological in nature By extension a visionary can also be a person with a clear distinctive and specific vision of the future usually connected with advances in technology or socialpolitical arrangements For example Ted Nelson or US Vice President Al Gore is referred to as a visionary in connection with the Internet 

Other visionaries simply imagine what does not yet exist but might some day as some forms of visioning can provide a glimpse into the possible future Therefore visioning can mean seeing in a utopian way what does not yet exist on earth but might exist in another realm such as the ideal or perfect realm as imagined or thought Examples are Buckminster Fuller in architecture and design and some of the pioneers of personal computing such as Steve Wozniak Some people use mathematics to make visionary discoveries in the nature of the universe In that sense a visionary may also function as a secular prophet Some visionaries emphasize communication and some assume a figurehead role in organizing a social group

Artists may produce work loosely categorized as visionary art for its luminous content andor for its use of artistic techniques that call for the use of extended powers of perception in the viewer

Visionary art can be incorrectly defined as a category of primitive art rather than describing people who have used their visions to create their paintings Salvador Dali is one artist who would exemplify visionary art that is neither religious nor primitive

Theodor Holm Nelson is an American sociologist philosopher and pioneer of information technology He coined the terms hypertext and hypermedia in 1963 and published it in 1965 He also is credited with first use of the words transclusion virtuality intertwingularity and teledildonics The main thrust of his work has been to make computers easily accessible to ordinary people His motto is A user interface should be so simple that a beginner in an emergency can understand it within ten seconds However he is known for inventing many new words which few other people understand and his remarks contain humor to entertain rather than just inform Consequently some of his ideas have been met with negative reactions

From a pessimist viewpoint Ted Nelson promotes four maxims most people are fools most authority is malignant God does not exist and everything is wrong

Nelson started Project Xanadu in 1960 He wanted to create a new computer network that was easy to use and easy to understand He wrote about the project in his books Computer LibDream Machines and Literary Machines He has spent much of his adult life working on Project Xanadu and telling people about its benefits

The Xanadu project was not very successful There were many reasons but not everyone agrees why the project did not go well Journalist Gary Wolf published an unflattering history The Curse of Xanadu on Nelson and his project in the June 1995 issue of Wired Nelson expressed his disgust on his website referring to Wolf as a Gory Jackal and threatened to sue him He also outlined his objections in a letter to Wired and released a detailed rebuttal of the article

Nelson says that Tim Berners Lee made some ideas from Xanadu become true by inventing the World Wide Web But Nelson dislikes the World Wide Web XML and all embedded markup Nelson thinks that Berners Lees work is a much too simple way of doing his original plan

HTML is precisely what we were trying to PREVENT ever breaking links links going outward only quotes you cant follow to their origins no version management no rights management Ted Nelson 

Nelson co founded Itty bitty machine company or ibm which was a small computer retail store operating from 1977 to 1980 in Evanston Illinois The Itty bitty machine company was one of the few retail stores to sell the original Apple I computer In 1978 he had a significant impact upon IBMs thinking when he outlined his vision of the potential of personal computing to the team that three years later launched the IBM PC

Ted Nelson is currently working on a new information structure ZigZag More information about ZigZag is on the Xanadu project website That website also has two versions of the Xanadu code that vistors can download He is also currently developing XanaduSpace  a system for the exploration of connected parallel documents an early version of this software may be freely downloaded from  He is a visiting fellow at Oxford University  based at the Oxford Internet Institute  where he works in the fields of information computers and human machine interfaces

Nelson earned a Bachelors degree in philosophy from Swarthmore College in 1959 a Masters degree in sociology from Harvard University in 1963 and a Doctorate in Media and Governance from Keio University in 2002 

In 1998 at the Seventh WWW Conference in Brisbane Australia Ted Nelson was awarded the Yuri Rubinsky Memorial Award He told the audience that it was the first award that he had ever received for his work

In 2001 he was knighted by France as Officier des Arts et Lettres In 2004 he was appointed as a Fellow of Wadham College Oxford and associated with the Oxford Internet Institute where he is currently conducting his research

In 2007 he celebrated his 70th birthday by giving an invited birthday lecture at the University of Southampton

He is the son of the late Emmy Award winning director Ralph Nelson and the Academy Award winning actress Celeste Holm

His parents marriage was brief and he was mostly raised by his grandparents in Greenwich Village with relatively little contact with his parents He is partly of Norwegian descent

The anime Serial Experiments Lain cites Project Xanadu as a precursor to The Wired and mentions Nelson as the originator of hypertext

Populitism is a another neologism coined by Nelson as a combination of the word populism with elite It refers to treating the general populace with the privileges of elitism The word suggests the society of text envisioned by theorists like Shoshana Zuboff and Jay David Bolter a writing space in which traces of authority persist only as local and contingent effects the social equivalent of the deconstructed author function A populite culture might mark the first step toward realization of Jean Francois Lyotards game of perfect information where all have equal access to the world of data and where given equal competence what extra performativity depends on in the final analysis is imagination which allows one either to make a new move or change the rules of the game This is the utopia of information in process the ultimate wetware dream of the clerisy discourse converted with 100 percent efficiency into capital the mechanism of that magical process being nomology or rule making admittedly a rather specialized form of imagination

Gunnysacking is a metaphor used in conflict resolution which involves the act of storing up grievances acquired in the course of a relationship rather than resolve them when they first occurred The word is based on the idea of using a gunny sack to store a large number of various items The term may alternately refer to act of verbally bringing up past grievances during the process of trying to resolve some present problem in a relationship In which case gunnysacking has the dual effect of raising additional problems and presents a side track obstacle to dealing with the current issues Additionally once the practice becomes a familiar pattern used by one person in a relationship other persons may avoid reporting new issues or problems for the sake of avoiding a repeat of the gunnysacking behavior

A gunny sack is a cloth container used for carrying or storing various things

Conflict resolution is a set of ideas and ways to reduce sources of conflict The term conflict resolution is sometimes used interchangeably with the term dispute resolution The terms conflict and dispute overlap As a term conflict is broader than dispute more concerned with physical action and less concerned with verbal arguments

Processes of conflict resolution generally include negotiation mediation and diplomacy The processes of arbitration litigation and formal complaint processes such as ombudsman processes are usually described with the term dispute resolution although some refer to them as conflict resolution

Conflict resolution as both a professional practice and academic field is highly sensitive to cultural background In Western cultural contexts such as Canada and the United States successful conflict resolution usually involves fostering communication among disputants problem solving and drafting agreements that meet their underlying needs In these situations conflict resolvers often talk about finding the win win solution or mutually satisfying scenario for everyone involved In many non Western cultural contexts such as Afghanistan Vietnam and China it is also important to find win win solutions however getting there can be very different In these contexts direct communication between disputants that explicitly addresses the issues at stake in the conflict can be perceived as very rude making the conflict worse and delaying resolution Rather it can make sense to involve religious tribal or community leaders communicate difficult truths indirectly through a third party and make suggestions through stories Intercultural conflicts are often the most difficult to resolve because the expectations of the disputants can be very different and there is much occasion for misunderstanding

Conflict resolution has also been studied in non humans like dogs cats monkeys snakes elephants and primates Aggression is more common among animal relatives and within a group than between groups Instead of creating a distance between the individuals however the primates were more intimate in the period after the aggressive incident These intimacies consisted of grooming and various forms of body contact Stress responses like an increased heart rate usually decrease after these reconciliatory signals Different types of primates as well as many other species who are living in groups show different types of conciliatory behaviour Resolving conflicts that threaten the interaction between individuals in a group is necessary for survival hence has a strong evolutionary value These findings contradicted previous existing theories about the general function of aggression ie creating space between individuals which seems to be more the case in conflicts between groups than it is within groups

In addition to research in primates biologists are beginning to explore reconciliation in other animals Up until recently the literature dealing with reconciliation in non primates have consisted of anecdotal observations and very little quantitative data Although peaceful post conflict behavior had been documented going back to the 1960s it was not until 1993 that Rowell made the first explicit mention of reconciliation in feral sheep Reconciliation has since been documented in spotted hyenas lions dolphins dwarf mongooses domestic goats and domestic dogs

Conflict resolution is an expanding field of professional practice both in the US and around the world The escalating costs of conflict have increased use of third parties who may serve as arbitrators mediators facilitators and ombudsmen or conflict specialists to resolve conflicts In fact relief and development organizations have added peace building specialists to their teams Also many of the major international NGOs have seen a growing need to hire practitioners trained in conflict analysis and resolution Furthermore this expansion of the field has resulted in the need for conflict resolution practitioners to work in a variety of settings such as in businesses court systems government agencies nonprofit organizations government agencies and educational institutions serving throughout the world

Universities worldwide offer programs of study pertaining to conflict research analysis and practice The Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations houses the Scheinman Institute on Conflict Resolution which offers undergraduate graduate and professional training on conflict resolution Additional graduate programs are offered at Georgetown University Eastern Mennonite University and Trinity College Dublin George Mason Universitys Institute of Conflict Analysis and Resolution offers undergraduate certificate and masters programs in Conflict Analysis and Resolution and a PhD program in The Philosophy in Conflict and Conflict Resolution  Many students completing a doctoral program enter the field as researchers theorists analysts policy makers and professors in higher education

Furthermore the Pax Ludens Foundation based in the Netherlands is an organization that puts together conflict resolution simulations set in an International Relations scenario to help students learn about the intricacies of where conflict emerges in the world of international politics

Conflict resolution is a growing area of interest in UK pedagogy with teachers and students both encouraged to learn about mechanisms that lead to aggressive action and those that lead to peaceful resolution 

In many schools in the UK conflict resolution has now become an integral part of the SEAL programme chimingas it does with the SEAL principles of developing social skills and an understanding of ones own feelings

In India masters in conflict analysis and peace building is offered by Nelson Mandela Centre for Peace in Jamia Millia Islamia university in New Delhihttpwwwjminicincpcrcpcrhtmref

Larsen was the strongest chess player born in Denmark and the strongest Scandinavian until the emergence of Magnus Carlsen From the early 1970s he lived for part of the year in Las Palmas and in Buenos Aires with his Argentinian born wife

Bent represented Denmark six times in Chess Olympiads always on first board and compiled an aggregate score of 75109 for 688 according to olimpbaseorg He always played a very high number of games almost all of the rounds and won three board medals one gold and two bronze

The worst result of his career was his 60 defeat by Bobby Fischer in the semi finals of the Candidates matches in 1971 The match was played in Denver Colorado Larsen later claimed in a Kasparovcom interview that his one sided loss to Fischer was due in part to his condition during the match The organizers chose the wrong time for this match I was languid with the heat and Fischer was better prepared for such exceptional circumstances I saw chess pieces through a mist and thus my level of playing was not good Fischer was the great player of the day and went on to beat Spassky in 1972 for the World Championship

This essay WP98 percent table width anomaly addresses the issue of some tables with classwikitable or classinfobox triggering the bottom scroll bar when width is set above 98 The over wide display has been caused by automatic extra margin padding as either wider margin right for classwikitable or wider margin left for infoboxes This issue is about the top level tables on a page not about tables inside other tables Perhaps the full name of the essay could be 98 percent table width anomaly triggering bottom scroll bars for top level CSS class tables The problem does not occur for other tables without the keyword class

Normally a plain table can be sized to any width up to 100 without triggering a bottom scrollbar However the styles for classwikitable or wikitable sortable have added an implicit right side margin right padding that fits okay up to 98 width When sized to 99 or 100 those classwikitable formats have triggered a bottom scollbar appearing along the bottom of the window To avoid this situation use

The option for margin right0 removes the right side margin padding outside the box rather than having a margin of 1em or 20px or such

Note that a full screen table of width101 always triggers a bottom scrollbar as expected because 101100

Normally a plain box table can be sized to any width up to 100 without triggering a bottom scrollbar However the various styles for classinfobox add an implicit left side margin left padding that fits okay up to 98 width When sized to 99 or 100 those classinfobox formats have triggered a bottom scollbar appearing along the bottom of the window To avoid this situation use

The option for margin left0 removes the left side margin padding outside the infobox rather than having a margin of 1em or 20px or such

Although some might wish to consider the default limitation of CSS class tables as a bug when tables are nested within other tables then a wikitable of 100 width will still add the same right side padding as at width 50 80 or 98 The problem of over wide tables occurs at the top level when 100 is the entire window with no outside space to have padded Because of the relative viewpoint the situation is termed an anomaly One mans bug is another mans clever feature when the padding is added inside other tables when formatting a table within a table etc

The issue of determining top level tables is complicated by the use of templates a table coded inside a template might seem to be a top level table However if the template were invoked inside an outer table then the result would generate nested tables Instead the table padding generated by the template is the same whether viewing the template in stand alone mode or when transcluded into another page A similar complex issue is the use of subheaders inside a template and determining which page contains that labeled section for editing because appearing on a formatted page does not mean the heading exists inside that page just inside the template displayed for that page These problems of nesting are related to side effects of recursion

As a final reminder The scrollbar problem only occurs for top level tables in CSS classes such as classwikitable or classinfobox A plain table can be resized up to 100 without triggering a bottom scrollbar

Google Search or Google Web Search is a web search engine owned by Google Inc and is the most used search engine on the World Wide Web Google receives several hundred million queries each day through its various services The main purpose of Google Search is to hunt for text in webpages as opposed to other data such as with Google Image Search Google search was originally developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1997 based on earier search engine designs

Google Search provides at least 22 special features beyond the original word search capability These include synonyms weather forecasts time zones stock quotes maps earthquake data movie showtimes airports home listings and sports scores There are special features for numbers including ranges prices temperatures moneyunit conversions calculations package tracking patents area codes and language translation of displayed pages

The order of search results on Googles search results pages is based in part on a priority rank called a PageRank Google Search provides many options for customized search using Boolean operators such as exclusion inclusion alternatives and wildcard

Googles rise to success was in large part due to a patented algorithm called PageRank that helps rank web pages that match a given search string Previous keyword based methods of ranking search results used by many search engines that were once more popular than Google would rank pages by how often the search terms occurred in the page or how strongly associated the search terms were within each resulting page The PageRank algorithm instead analyses human generated links assuming that web pages linked from many important pages are themselves likely to be important The algorithm computes a recursive score for pages based on the weighted sum of the PageRanks of the pages linking to them PageRank is thought to correlate well with human concepts of importance In addition to PageRank Google over the years has added many other secret criteria for determining the ranking of pages on result lists reported to be over 200 different indicators The details are kept secret due to spammers and in order to maintain an advantage over Googles competitors

The exact percentage of the total of web pages that Google indexes is not known as it is very hard to actually calculate Google not only indexes and caches web pages but also takes snapshots of other file types which include PDF Word documents Excel spreadsheets Flash SWF plain text files and so on Except in the case of text and SWF files the cached version is a conversion toHTML allowing those without the corresponding viewer application to read the file

Users can customize the search engine by setting a default language using the SafeSearch filtering technology and set the number of results shown on each page Google has been criticized for placing long term cookies on users machines to store these preferences a tactic which also enables them to track a users search terms and retain the data for more than a year For any query up to the first 1000 results can be shown with a maximum of 100 displayed per page The ability to specify the number of results is available only if Instant Search is not enabled If Instant Search is enabled only 10 results are displayed regardless of this setting

Despite its immense index there is also a considerable amount of data available in online databases which are accessible by means of queries but not by links This so called invisible or deep Web is minimally covered by Google and other search engines The deep Web contains library catalogs official legislative documents of governments phone books and other content which is dynamically prepared to respond to a query

Privacy in some countries forbids the showing of some links For instance in Switzerland any individual can force Google Inc to delete a link which contains their nameCitation neededdateSeptember 2009

Since Google is the most popular search engine many webmasters have become eager to influence their websites Google rankings An industry of consultants has arisen to help websites increase their rankings on Google and on other search engines This field called search engine optimization attempts to discern patterns in search engine listings and then develop a methodology for improving rankings to draw more searchers to their clients sites

Search engine optimization encompasses both on page factors and Off Page Optimization factors The general idea is to affect Googles relevance algorithm by incorporating the keywords being targeted in various places on page in particular the title element and the body copy Too many occurrences of the keyword however cause the page to look suspect to Googles spam checking algorithms

Google claims that a search query requires altogether about 1 kJ or 00003 kWh

In audio engineering a fade is a gradual increase or decrease in the level of an audio signal The term can also be used for film cinematography or theatre lighting in much the same way

A recorded song may be gradually reduced to silence at its end or may gradually increase from silence at the beginning For example the songs Bitter Sweet Symphony by The Verve and Turn to Stone by Electric Light Orchestra fade in from the beginning while the songs Born to Be Wild by Steppenwolf Boogie Oogie Oogie by A Taste of Honey and Hey Jude by The Beatles fade out However Born to be Wild and Boogie Oogie Oogie fade out in a matter of seconds whereas Hey Jude takes over 2 minutes to completely fade out Goodbye Stranger by Supertramp takes about a minute to fade out Fading out can serve as a recording solution for pieces of music that contain no obvious ending

Though relatively rare songs can fade out then fade back in Some examples of this are Helter Skelter by The Beatles Suspicious Minds by Elvis Presley Thank You by Led Zeppelin or Undercover of the Night by The Rolling Stones

The term fade is also used in multi speaker audio systems to describe the balancing of power between front and rear channels

Neptune part of the orchestral suite The Planets by Gustav Holst was an early piece of music to have a fade out ending Holst stipulates that the womens choruses are to be placed in an adjoining room the door of which is to be left open until the last bar of the piece when it is to be slowly and silently closed and that the final bar is to be repeated until the sound is lost in the distance Although commonplace today the effect bewitched audiences in the era before widespread recorded soundafter the initial 1918 run through Holsts daughter Imogen remarked that the ending was unforgettable with its hidden chorus of womens voices growing fainter and fainter until the imagination knew no difference between sound and silence

The technique of ending a spoken or musical recording by fading out the sound goes back to the earliest days of recording In the era of mechanical recording this could only be achieved by either moving the sound source away from the recording horn or by gradually reducing the volume at which the performers were singing playing or speaking With the advent of electrical recording smooth and controllable fadeout effects could be easily achieved by simply reducing the input volume from the microphones using the fader on the mixing desk

No single recording can be reliably identified as the first to use the technique In 2003 on the website Stupid Question John Ruch listed the following recordings as possible contenders

The earliest such recording anybody could name for me is an 1894 78 rpm record called The Spirit of 76 a narrated musical vignette with martial fife and drum that gets louder as it nears the listener and quieter as it moves away 

A fader is any device used for fading especially when it is a knob or button that slides along a track or slot A knob which rotates is usually not considered a fader although it is electrically and functionally equivalent A fader can be either analogue directly controlling the resistance or impedance to the source or digital numerically controlling a digital signal processor Digital faders are also referred to as virtual faders since they can be viewed on the screen of a digital audio workstation Modern high end digital mixers often have piezo electric actuators attached to the faders such that they can be multi use and will jump to the correct position for the selected function andor saved setting

A crossfader on a dj mixer essentially functions like two faders connected side by side but in opposite directions It allows a DJ to fade one source out while fading another source in at the same time This is extremely useful when beatmatching two phonograph records or compact discs

The technique of crossfading is also used in audio engineering as a mixing technique particularly with instrumental solos A mix engineer will often record two or more takes of a vocal or instrumental part and create a final version which is a composite of the best passages of these takes by crossfading between each track

In the perfect case the crossfader would keep constant output level However theres no standard how this should be achieved Many DJ equipment manufacturers offer different mixers for different purposes High end mixers often have crossfade curve switches allowing the DJ to select the type of crossfade necessary Experienced DJs are also able to crossfade between tracks using the channel faders

There are many software applications that feature virtual crossfaders For instance burning software for the recording of audio CDs

On a mixer with auxiliary send mixes the send mixes are configured pre fader or post fader

If a send mix is configured pre fader then changes to the main channel strip fader does not affect the send mix This is useful for stage monitor mixes where changes in the Front of House channel levels would distract the musicians

If a send mix is configured post fader then the level sent to the send mix follows changes to the main channel strip fader This is useful for reverberation and other signal processor effects

The Centenary Medal is an award given by the Australian Government in 2001 It was set up to celebrate the Centenary of Federation of Australia and to honour people who have made a contribution to Australian society or government Possible winners were studied by a group headed by the historian Professor Geoffrey Blainey

The front of the medal has a seven pointed Commonwealth Star for the six Australian states with the seventh point for Australias territories At the centre of the star is an image showing the Indigenous Australian traditions at the heart of the continent Around the edge are 100 dots for 100 years of federation The other side has a seven pointed star with the words For Contribution Made to Australian Society around the edge

The colours in the ribbon are crimson which represents federation and blue and gold for the beginning of the 21st Century The seven gold and red lines signify the states pathways to federation The bar and ribbon are the same so that a person with the award can be recognized easily

Backspace is the keyboard key that originally pushed the typewriter carriage one position backwards and for modern computer screens moves the cursor one position backwards deletes the preceding character and shifts back the text after it by one position

In typewriters a typist would for example type a lowercase letter a with acute accent by typing a lowercase letter a then backspace and then the acute accent key This is the basis for such spacing modifiers in computer character sets such as the ASCII caret Backspace composition no longer works with digital displays or typesetting systems It has to some degree been replaced with the combining diacritical marks mechanism of Unicode though such characters do not work well with many fonts and precomposed characters continue to be used Some software like TeX or Microsoft Windows use the opposite method for diacritical marks namely positioning the accent first and then placing the base letter at that position

Pressing the backspace key on a computer terminal would generate the ASCII code 08 BS or Backspace a control code which would delete the preceding character That control code could also be accessed by pressing Control H as H is the eighth letter of the Latin alphabet Terminals which did not have the backspace code mapped to the function of moving the cursor backwards and deleting the preceding character would display the symbols H when the backspace key was pressed This sequence is still used humorously for epanorthosis by computer literates denoting the deletion of a pretended blunder much like a strikethrough

Example

A more concise alternative sometimes seen is W which is the shortcut to delete the previous word in the Berkeley Unix terminal line discipline One W can replace a whole string of Hs This shortcut has also made it into the Vi text editor For really embarrassing blunders U can outdo a series of W

The backspace is distinct from the delete key which in paper media for computers would punch out all the holes to strike out a character and in modern computers deletes text following it Also the delete key often works as a generic command to remove an object while backspace usually has no effect

In modern systems the backspace key is often mapped to the delete character although the backspace keys function of deleting the character before the cursor remains

In a mainframe environment to backspace means to move a magnetic tape backwards typically to the previous block

The backspace key is commonly used to go back a page when exploring folders in graphical environments or when browsing the Web in web browsers

Although the term backspace is the standard name of the key which deletes the character to the left of the cursor the actual key may be labelled in a variety of ways for example delete Erase or with a left pointing arrow

Winners of the award included competitors coaches sports scientists office holders and people who maintained sporting facilities and services Over 18000 Medals were awarded

Marin Mersenne born 8 September 1588 in modern day Sarthe died 1 September 1648 in Paris was a French theologian and mathematician He developed the first laws of acustics which bore his name for a long time Today he is mainly remembered for the Mersenne primes Together with Galileo Galilei he constructed the laws how a mass falls in an empty space He was in favor of modern science and opposed to occultist movements 

He often travelled to meet the scientists which made him an important mediator This is especially true for mathematicians such as Pierre Gassendi Gilles Personne de Roberval Blaise Pascal und Pierre de Fermat To inform Mersenne of a discovery was tantamount as to publish it He told Gassendi to reply to the Meditations of Descartes Mersenne gave Huygens the idea to use a pendulum to measure time which led to the development of such clocks

Quatuor pour la fin du temps is a piece of chamber music by the French composer Olivier Messiaen In English speaking countries it is often called by the English title Quartet for the End of Time The piece is written for an unusual combination of four instruments clarinet violin cello and piano There are 8 movements It takes about 50 minutes to perform The work was first performed in unusual circumstances in 1941 It is a very important work in the history of 20th century classical music 

There was a special reason why Messiaen wrote this work for an unusual combination of instruments In 1940 when World War II was being fought Germany invaded France Messiaen was captured by the German army and he was held as a prisoner of war While being taken to the prisoner of war camp Messiaen talked to another prisoner Henri Akoka who was a clarinettist Messiaen showed him the sketches for a clarinet piece he was writing called Abme des oiseaux Two other professional musicians were also among the prisoners Jean le Boulaire a violinist and tienne Pasquier a cellist  Messiaen composed the Quatuor for these three musicians with himself at the piano The combination of these four instruments is unusual although Paul Hindemith had written a work for the same combination in 1938

The quartet was given its first performance in Grlitz Germany on 15 January 1941  The audience consisted of about four hundred prisoners of war There were German prison officers sitting in front The music must have seemed strange to the audience but they all listened politely Shortly after this Messiaen was released from prison and went back to France

Messiaen was inspired by the words in the Bible where the angel says There shall be time no longer These words have another meaning in relation to the music because Messiaen does not write music with a regular number of beats in a bar Like The Rite of Spring the length of the bars keep changing Messiaen had heard enough of soldiers marching to a regular one two three four one two three four during the war His rhythms in this music develop from little tiny rhythmic patterns

The work is in eight movements

The first movement is called Liturgie de cristal and describes the birds waking up All four instruments play this movement

The second movement is Vocalise pour lAnge qui annonce la fin du Temps Song for the Angel who announces the end of time It is played by the full quartet although the clarinet does not play in the central section

The third movement is called Abme des oiseaux and is just played by the clarinet It is extremely slow and the clarinettist needs a lot of breath control

The fourth movement is Intermde and is played by the violin cello and clarinet It is fast and lively

The fifth movement is Louange lternit de Jsus It is played by the cello accompanied by the piano who just plays chords It is again extremely slow and the cellist needs good bow control

The sixth movement is called Danse de la fureur pour les sept trompettes played on all four instruments They play in unison nearly all the way through

The seventh movement is called Fouillis darcs en ciel pour lAnge qui annonce la fin du Temps played by the full quartet Some of the music from the second movement is repeated We hear the angel being covered by the rainbow

The national parks of New Zealand are 14 protected areas that are looked after by the Department of Conservation for the benefit use and enjoyment of the public These are popular among tourists with 30 of tourists visiting at least one national park during their stay in New Zealand While the national parks contain some of New Zealands most beautiful scenery the first few that were created were all focused on mountains Since the 1980s more different kinds of New Zealand landscapes have been included in the national parks New Zealands national parks are all important to preserve both nature and culture and some are also historically important Tongariro National Park is one of 27 World Heritage Sites that is of both cultural and natural significance and four of the South Island national parks form Te Wahipounamu another World Heritage Site

The National Parks Act of 1980 was written to record what national parks are for and how they would be chosen and looked after It begins by explaining what a national park is

The National Parks Act goes on to say that the public will be allowed to enter and use the parks freely but with rules to avoid destroying the native plants and animals or the parks Access to specially protected areas as noted under the act is only allowed with special permits National parks are soil water and forest conservation areas and should be kept as natural as possible Native plants and animals are to be looked after and other plants and animals removed if they harm the natural wildlife Development in what the act calls wilderness areas is only foot tracks and huts used for wild animal control or scientific research 

The Act allows the Department of Conservation to provide hostels huts camping grounds ski tows and other services parking areas roading and tracks within the parks As well as these the department also provides some accommodation transport and other services at entry points to the parks but these are also offered by others Other services within the parks such as guided walks and skiing tutorials are provided by other companies sometimes with help from the department

The area around Waipoua Forest north of Dargaville was suggested to become a new Kauri National Park The area contains most of New Zealands remaining kauri including the largest known kauri Tne Mahuta These stands of kauri are also important because they are homes for many endangered species including the North Island Brown Kiwi This proposal is currently being considered by the Department of Conservation

In 2010 the New Zealand Government proposed removing some national park and conservation areas from Schedule 4 protection of the Crown Minerals Act which means that mining is not allowed in those areas In July the government decided against the proposal after receiving a large number of submissions most of which were against mining

Rudolf von Bitter Rucker is an American mathematician computer scientist science fiction author and philosopher He is one of the founders of the cyberpunk literary movement He writes both fiction and non fiction books and articles He is best known for the novels in the Ware Tetralogy The first two books both won Philip K Dick Awards Now he edits the science fiction webzine called Flurb 

Rucker is the great great great grandson of the philosopher Georg Hegel

Rucker attended St Xavier High School Then he completed a BA in mathematics from Swarthmore College Next earned Masters and PhD degrees in mathematics from Rutgers University

He taught at the State University of New York at Geneseo from 19721978 He got a grant from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation so he went to teach math at the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg from 19781980 He then taught at Randolph Macon Womens College in Lynchburg Virginia from 19801982 Next he tried being as a full time author for four years Inspired by an interview with Stephen Wolfram Rucker became a computer science professor at San Jos State University in 1986 He retired from SJSU in 2004 He is a mathematician who is also interested in philosophy He has written books connecting these two areas for example The Fourth Dimension Geometry Relativity and the Fourth Dimension and Infinity and the Mind Princeton University Press published new editions of Infinity and the Mind in 1995 and in 2005 both with new prefaces the first edition is cited with fair frequency in academic literatureCitation neededdateFebruary 2009

As his own alternative to cyberpunk Rucker developed a writing style he calls Transrealism He gave a brief explanation of Transrealism in his 1983 essay The Transrealist Manifesto It is science fiction based on the authors own life and immediate perceptions mixed with fantastic elements that symbolize psychological change Many of Ruckers novels and short stories apply these ideas One example of Ruckers Transrealist works is Saucer Wisdom a novel in which the main character is abducted by aliens Rucker and his publisher marketed the book as non fiction as a kind of joke

Rucker wrote his first Transrealist novel White Light while he was at Heidelberg This Transrealist novel is based on his experiences at SUNY Geneseo

Rucker often uses his novels to explore scientific or mathematical ideas For example White Light examines the concept of infinity Parts of the Ware Tetralogy are an explanation of using natural selection to develop computer software His novels also show a mystical philosophy Rucker explained this philosophy in an essay called The Central Teachings of Mysticism There may be some irony in this tiitle

He recently published a book called The Lifebox the Seashell and the Soul What Gnarly Computation Taught Me About Ultimate Reality the Meaning Of Life and How To Be Happy This book summarizes the various philosophies hes believed over the years It ends with the tentative conclusion that people might get some benefit by thinking about the world as made of computations His final remark in the book is perhaps this universe is perfect

The tinamous are a family comprising 47 species of birds found in Central and South America One of the most ancient living groups of bird they are related to the ratites Generally ground dwelling they are found in a range of habitats

Of Gondwanan origin tinamids are related to the ratites Although the fossil record in South America is poor the known tinamiform fossil record goes back 10 million years Together with the ratites they make up Palaeognathae while all other living birds are members of Neognathae Unlike the other palaeognaths tinamids do have a keeled sternum Like the other palaeognaths they also have a distinctive palate

Recent phylogenetic studies have shown tinamids as the sister group of AustralasianOceanian ratites Those are the South American ratites and African ratites are also related but more distantly Tinamids themselves were shown to be monophyletic

The purpose of rental insurance is to give you coverage against damage or loss of personal property This is a monthly payment just like any other insurance It covers any damage your items may cause to the place or item you are renting You are protected even if the damage is your fault if you choose those payment plans This protects you from a possible lawsuit Finally you dont have to replace damaged or stolen items

A nickel is a coin It is in the United States currency It is worth 5 cents It is made of cupronickel an alloy of copper and nickel

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation aims to keep peoples money safe If their money is lost they replace it They will replace it up to 250000 for each person for each bank The FDIC insures 7895 different banks or institutions The FDIC also watches banks or institutions for problems or failings

The FDIC was made during the Great Depression by the President Franklin Roosevelt in June 1933 This is an important thing in United States history because it guaranteed people their money This also helped people feel better about using banks in the Unites States

Vehicle insurance also called auto insurance or car insurance is a kind of insurance that protects people if they have a car accident Somebody with vehicle insurance would not have to pay the entire cost of damage a car accident causes In many places it is against the law to drive without vehicle insurance

Somebody with vehicle insurance would pay what is called a premium The insurance company would decide how big the premium is and might consider several factors These include some of the following 

An umbrella insurance policy protects all items of economic value and future income It is also known as liability insurance A liability is a legal debt or obligation The umbrella refers to how the policy shields insured assets It covers damages caused by you and your dependents People who have large sums of money usually have this type of insurance because they have high premiums Premiums are the total cost of the policyIt guarantees you higher liability limits It provides additional limits of coverage if you are at risk of being sued

The umbrella policy is there to fill the gaps in other insurance policies Where one policy does not cover the umbrella policy picks up where it doesnt cover The umbrella policy covers all insurances such as house car etc The umbrella policy covers in increments of 1000000 dollars So if you had car insurance that only covered 200000 dollars the coverage would then be 1200000 dollars The same goes for home owners insurance if you had 500000 dollars in coverage the total coverage would become 1500000 dollars in coverage

An argument from false premises is a line of reasoning which can lead to wrong results A false premise is an untrue proposition that forms the basis of a logical syllogism Since the premise is not correct the conclusion drawn may be in error However the logical validity of an argument is a function of its internal consistency not the truth value of its premises

For example consider this syllogism which involves an obvious false premise

This argument is logically valid but quite demonstrably unsound because its first premise is false one could hose down the streets a street cleaner could have passed or the local river could have flooded etc A simple logical analysis will not reveal the error in this argument since that analysis must accept the truth of the arguments premises For this reason an argument based on false premises can be much more difficult to refute or even discuss than one featuring a normal logical error as the truth of its premises must be established to the satisfaction of all parties

Another feature of an argument based on false premises that can bedevil critics is that its conclusion can in fact be true Consider the above example again It may well be that it has recently rained and that the streets are wet This of course does nothing to prove the first premise but can make its claims more difficult to refute This underlies the basic epistemological problem of establishing causal relationships The adage warns Correlated does not necessarily mean causally related

A false premise can also be a premise that is poorly or incompletely defined so as to make the conclusion questionable The following joke from Plato and a Platypus Walk Into a Bar illustrates the point An old cowboy goes into a bar and orders a drink As he sits there sipping his whiskey a young lady sits down next to him  She says Im a lesbian I spend my whole day thinking about women A little while later a couple sits down next to the old cowboy and asks him Are you a real cowboy He replies I always thought I was but I just found out Im a lesbian The mistake the cowboy makes is that he assumes that the definition of a lesbian is somebody who spends the whole day thinking about women The reason the joke works is because in a certain way that definition could apply to lesbians but it fails to address the point that a lesbian is a homosexual female The cowboy is neither homosexual nor female therefore he is not a lesbian

Nickel oxide can refer to either of these chemical compounds

Nickel oxide also known as nickelous oxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is NiO It contains nickel in its 2 oxidation state It also contains oxide ions

Nickel oxide is a light green solid It does not dissolve in water Sometimes it is gray because all of the nickel is not in the 2 oxidation state It reacts with acids to make nickel salts For example it reacts with hydrochloric acid to make nickel chloride It does not react with bases easily 

Nickel oxide can be made by heating nickel powder in air at convert400CF This normally makes a black nickel oxide It also can be made by reacting nickel with water at convert1000CF The simplest way to make it is to heat nickel hydroxide nickel carbonate or nickel nitrate

It is used to make alloys It is also used in ceramics It is used to make other nickel compounds

Idioma de Signos Nicaragense or Nicaraguan sign language is a sign language that was spontaneously invented by deaf schoolchildren in Nicaragua in the 1970s and 1980s The language developed when the Sandinist government of Nicaragua created the first school for deaf people in the 1970s The language is of special interest to linguists because it allows them to study how languages develop

In the 1970s the deaf people of Nicaragua rarely met They lived isolated lives and used simple gestures to communicate with their friends and family In 1977 a special programme for the deaf was started in a suburb of Managua At first fifty children took part When the Sandinist came to power the number of pupils rose to hundred In 1980 a vocational school for deaf people was opened in another part of Managua In 1983 both schools together had about 400 pupils

The teaching was centered on lip reading and the use of a hand alphabet This was mostly unsuccessful because most pupils had trouble spelling words in this way The children were cut off from their teachers and used recreational breaks and free time spent together to create a system that allowed them to communicate with each other Gestures and signs used at home were used to create a pidgin Later the pidgin developed into a Creole language The first step that is to say the pidgin is called Lenguaje de Signos Nicaragense today Pupils who left the school before the creole language was created continue to use the pidgin 

The staff of the school missed the fact that a language was developing before their eyes All they saw were some mimics and the failure to learn Spanish As they did not know what the pupils were saying they asked for help In 1986 Judi Kegl an expert on the topic of American Sign Language was asked to help When she analysed the language she found out that the pidgin NSL had been made more complex by the younger pupils it now included a fixed grammar and the arrangement of verbs Today this extended form is known as ISN

All days of the week and times given are local 

The event usually begins on Friday with two practice sessions The first session called Practice 1 runs from 1000 to 1130 The second session called Practice 2 rums from 1400 to 1530 

The practice sessions allow the drivers to learn the circuit and the teams to test their cars Teams may test new parts on their cars The cars wings and suspension settings may be changed to make the car faster The teams may also allow one of their test drivers to drive the practice session

The practice sessions have become more important starting in F12010 With the FIA ban on testing during the season the Friday sessions are the only time a team has to test new car parts

The last practice session called Practice 3 takes place on Saturday from 1100 to 1200 This allows the teams a final tune up before qualifying starts

The Monaco Grand Prix has a special schedule The practice sessions the normally take place on Friday are moved to Thursday The F1 teams do not have any sessions scheduled on Friday

The Singapore Grand Prix is the only night race in the Formula One calendar Because of this the session times are changed Practice 1 runs from 1800 to 1930 and practice 2 runs from 2130 to 2300 The practice 3 session runs from 1900 to 2000

On Saturday at 1400 the qualifying session takes place This session will determine the running order at the beginning of the race This is often called setting the grid The qualifying session is split into three parts called Q1 Q1 and Q3 Q1 is 20 minutes long followed by seven minute break Q2 is 15 minutes long followed by an eight minute break Q3 is 10 minutes long During each part of qualifying the fastest lap time set by a car is recorded Drivers may run as many or as few laps as they wish

After Q1 is complete the eight slowest cars are eliminated the qualifying session This would include any cars that did not set a qualifying time The remaining 18 car advance Q2 The eight cars eliminated are placed in the last eight start positions based on their fastest time from Q1 The procedure is repeated for Q2 The eight slowest cars from Q2 are placed in the 11 through 18 starting positions on the grid

The top ten cars remain for Q3 After this final part of qualifying the top ten starting positions on the grid are set The fastest qualifier is placed in the first position which is known as the pole position This car will have an advantage at the start because they do not need to follow any other cars

Generally a driver will leave the pits and drive around the track back to the startfinish line This is called the out lap and is not a timed lap This lap often starts out out at a slower pace to warm up the tyres They will be up to full speed by the time they reach the start line When they cross the line they will try to drive the quickest time they can around the circuit This is called a flying lap or a hot lap A driver may run several hot laps in a row The fastest of these hot laps is used in setting the grid position Finally the driver will slow down and drive around the track They re enter the pit lane on this in lap If there is still time left they may put on fresh tyres and try to set a faster hot lap 

In the past there were more cars entered for each race than the track had available space When this would happen not all cars would qualify The slowest cars would not able to race and would be list as Did not Qualify in race results

In the late 1980s and early 1990s the number of cars attempting to enter each race was as high as 39 It was too dangerous to have that many cars on the track at the same time A pre qualifying session was used The teams with the worst record over the last six months would need to pre qualify This including all new teams Only the four fastest cars from this session were then allowed to the main qualifying session The slowest cars from the pre qualifying session were listed in race results as Did Not Pre Qualify Pre qualifying was ended after F11992 when many of the small teams left the sport

As the number of cars entered fell below 26 a new problem started All cars entered would automatically qualify for the race Some cars were much slower than most of the other cars The 107 rule was introduced in F11996 If the qualifying time of a car was not within 107 of the pole time the car would not qualify for the race For example if the pole time was 1m 30s the slowest a car could go to qualify would be 1m 36s The race stewards could allow a slow car to race if they thought there was a good reason for it being slow For example rain may have slowed down the qualifying session

The rule was dropped in F12003 when the qualifying format was changed However the rule will be return for the F12011 F1 season

The race itself is held on Sunday afternoon Thirty minutes before to race time the cars take to the track They may run several warm up laps if they wish When they are ready they line up on the starting grid in the order they qualified At race time a green turns on to start the formation lap The formation lap is a slow lap around the curcuit The cars warm up the engines and tyres and all systems are checked The cars return to their assigned grid spot and stop The start is called a standing start 

The starting light system is a set of five red lights mounted above the startfinish line The red lights turn on one at a time until all five red lights are on Then there is a short delay of several seconds Then the red lights turn off the race starts The delay is different each time to keep the drivers from guessing when the race will start

The length of the race is at least 305 kilometers The fewest laps needed to race at least 305 km is determined for each circuit The one race that is different is Monaco There the race is set at 78 laps for 2065 km

The time of the race can not exceed two hours After two hours the race is ended the next time the lead car passes the finish line The race can also be stopped short of the full distance for safety reasons if conditions are bad

Any time the car needs to be serviced the driver must make a pit stop The pit lane is next to the main straight with the startfinish line The driver must enter the pit lane using the marked entrance road and slow down Once they car enters the pit lane the driver must not drive faster than the pit lane speed limit If they do they will receive a penalty The driver stops the car in the teams pit box Each team has one pit box to service both of their cars After the work is done the driver reenters the pit lane At the end of the pit lane they enter pit exit road Hear they speed up the car to race speed The driver may not reenter the race circuit until they leave the exit road

Teams are supplied with tyres from Bridgestone They receive two different types of slick dry weather tyre compounds The prime tyres and the option tyre The prime tyre is made from harder rubber and will last longer The option tyre is made from softer rubber It will provide more traction in the corners but will not last as long as the prime tyre Each car is required to use at least one set of prime and one set of option tyres during the race

The drivers who qualify in the first ten positions must start the race with the same tyres they qualified on The remaining drivers may start the race on the tyre of their choice 

Teams are supplied with two different types of wet weather tyres The intermediate and wet tyre Intermediate tyres are used when the track surface is damp or during a light rain Wet tyres are used when the track surface is very wet

Whenever wet weather tyres are used the requirement to use both types of dry tyres is dropped 

Teams are no longer allowed to refuel their cars during the race The cars must start the race with enought fuel to complete the full race distance 

In the past refueling was allowed The amount of fuel a team would add to the car was part of the race strategy Less fuel would make the car lighter so it would go faster But more pit stops would be required to add fuel

When the leader completes the last lap of the race and crosses the finish line the race ends Any remaining cars on the circuit race to the finish line and complete they lap they are on If they are also on the lead lap they are scored as being so many seconds behind the leader If they are not on the lead lap they are scored as being so many laps behind the leader Any cars not still running are normally scored as retired If they have completed 90 of the race distance they scored with a finishing position

The first three finishing positions are called a podium finish The three drivers take their places on a podium They stand as the national anthem of the race winners home country and that of his team are played Dignitaries from the country hosting the race then present trophies to the drivers A constructors trophy is presented to a representative from the winners team

Points are awarded to drivers and teams based on their finishing order The winner receives 25 points the second place finisher 18 points with 15 12 10 8 6 4 2 and 1 points for positions 3 through 10 If a race is stopped 75 of the scheduled race distance has been completed the points awarded are cut in half If two or more drivers tie for a position prizes and points are added together and shared equally for all those drivers who tie Constructors receive points as well as drivers Each constructor receives the same amount of points that their two drivers earned 

The winner of the annual Drivers Championship is the driver with the most points The same hold true for the Constructors Championship If two or more drivers have the same number of points a tie breaker system is used The one with the most wins is ranked higher If the number of wins are the same it goes to the one with the most second places and so on

In the past other point systems were used Also there were not a many races during the season as today In the early years there were seasons with as few as seven races When F1 started in F11950 only eight points were awarded to the winner For the first decade of F1 an additional point was awarded for the fastest lap For many years only the best number of results would count toward the championship 

In F11988 Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna were the drivers for McLaren They were the best two drivers of that year There were 16 races that year but only the best 11 results counted towards the championship Prost won seven races and finished seventh races in second place He scored a total of 105 points but only 87 of them counted for the championship Senna won eight races and finished second in three giving him 90 points for the championship and 94 for the season This resulted in the strange event where Prost took a record number of points yet Senna won the champion

The Quadrivium is the mediaeval education which led to the Master of Arts degree The Quadrivium follows the Trivium in a liberal arts education

The quadrivium consisted of four disciplines which were related to mathematics

These four studies compose the secondary part of the curriculum outlined by Plato in The Republic 

All the education was done in Latin which educated pupils learnt at school or from a private tutor Latin was the lingua franca of mediaeval Europe even the Bible could only be read in Latin Since the quadrivium was taught in universities only boys could take it The teaching was done by priests If girls wanted education it had to be done in their homes In the modern form of liberal arts in the United States both sexes are taught although there are still a few single sex institutions

Croke Park is a stadium It is the biggest stadium in Ireland It is in the middle of Dublin It is the third largest stadium in Europe It can hold 82300 people The stadium is owned by the GAA Ireland s biggest sport organisation Since 1884 it is used by the GAA The annual finals of the All Ireland Senior Football Championship and Senior Hurling Championship are held here Music concerts by major international acts have also been held From 20072009 it was also used for rugby and soccer The stadium is named after Thomas Croke an archbishop who was an early mentor of the GAA

The area was used since 1870 as sports ground It was called Joness Road Sportsground Since the foundation of the Gaelic Athletic Association it was used for major events in Gaelic sports In 1913 the ground was bought by them At this time the ground had one stand and earth walls around the field In the 1920s the capacity raised by building new stands In the 1980s the GAA decided to build a high capacity stadium The final constructions were in 2003

During the Irish War of Independence on November 21 1920 Croke Park was the scene of a massacre by the Royal Irish Constabulary The police shoot into a crowd which was visiting a Dublin Tipperary Gaelic football match The dead included 13 spectators and Tipperarys captain Michael Hogan To his memory the new stand of 1924 was named Hogan stand 

The Ain Diab Circuit was a Formula One road circuit built in 1957 southwest of Ain Diab in Morocco using the existing coast road and the main road from Casablanca to Azemmour

The 7618 km course was designed by the Royal Automobile Club of Morocco It was given a full blessing from Sultan Mohammed V It was built in only six weeks The site hosted an non championship F1 race in 1957 On 19 October 1958 the course was the venue for the Moroccan Grand Prix the final round in the F11958 Formula One season It was won by Stirling Moss driving a Vanwall completing the 53 laps in 2h 09m 151s

There was a terrible accident during the race The engine on the Vanwall of Stuart Lewis Evans seized up The car spun and crashed He was severely burned and died in a hospital in England six days later

Beau Brummell was the leader of mens fashion in Regency England and a friend of the Prince Regent the future King George IV He started the fashion for men to wear tailored clothes that were tasteful and fitted well

Brummell once said If John Bull turns around to look at you you are not well dressed but either too stiff too tight or too fashionable This hardly suggests a dandy whose cravats alone were a peacock display

No doubt Brummell wore various styles but one in particular seems to have been his favourite The style included dark coats and full length trousers with an elaborately knotted cravat 

The coat was cut away at the front and double breasted If worn open it had a double breasted waistcoat underneath The tails of the coat were not long ending above the back of the knees They were cut square The collar of the coat was a stand up it stood higher at the back of the neck

Beau Brummell is credited with introducing and establishing as fashion the modern mans suit worn with a tie The modern tie is a descendant of the cravat 

It is said that Brummell believed in cut rather than colour In the illustration his clothes are well fitted but also quite colourful by our standards 

He claimed to take five hours to dress He recommended using champagne to clean boots and make them shine His style of dress is often referred to as dandyism Brummell would not have agreed with that description

Brummells personal grooming was very modern He kept himself clean which most people did not in his day 

This kind of care is quite modern and a part of celebrity culture today He was a perfectionist in his choice of clothes Theres a story of someone who visited him and met his valet coming out of the room with a huge load of cravats These are our failures said the valet Brummell said of himself I have no talents other than to dress my genius is in the wearing of clothes 

His father died in 1794 leaving him an inheritance of more than 20000 pounds He was educated at Eton and at Oriel College Oxford University He later joined the 10th Hussars where he came to the attention of George Prince of Wales Through the influence of the Prince Brummell was promoted to captain by 1796 When his regiment was sent from London to Manchester he resigned his commission

For a time Brummell avoided extravagance and gambling For example he kept horses but no carriages He was included in Prince Georges circle Here he made an impression with his elegant manner of dress and his clever remarks His attention to cleaning his teeth shaving and bathing daily became popular 

However he did spend money on his appearance When asked how much it would cost to keep a single man in clothes he was alleged to have replied Why with tolerable economy I think it might be done with 800

Brummell was influenced by his wealthy friends He began spending and gambling as though his fortune were as great as theirs This was not a problem while he could still get credit but that did not last Brummel could borrow money based on his closeness to the Prince But in 1811 the Prince became Regent and began abandoning all his old Whig friends

Brummell Lord Alvanley Henry Mildmay and Henry Pierrepoint were the prime movers of Watiers called the Dandy Club by Byron They were also the four hosts of the masquerade ball in July 1813 There an event occurred which ruined Brummel The Prince Regent greeted Alvanley and Pierrepoint but then cut Brummell and Mildmay by snubbing them staring them in the face but not speaking to them This provoked Brummells remark which became famous Alvanley whos your fat friend This widened the rift between them 

Normally the loss of royal favour to a favourite was doom but Brummell had the approval and friendship of other leading people He became a favourite without a patron still in charge of fashion and courted by large segments of society

However his spiralling debt spun out of control and he tried to recover by devices that only dug the hole deeper In 1816 he fled to France to escape debtors prison from the demands for payment in full of thousands of pounds sterling owed Usually Brummells gambling debts as debts of honour were always paid immediately The one exception to this was the final wager recorded for him in Whites betting book Recorded March 1815 the debt was marked not paid 20th January 1816 

He lived the remainder of his life in France In the reign of William IV he got an appointment at Caen by the influence of Lord Alvanley and the Marquess of Worcester This gave him a small annuity He died penniless and insane from strokes in Caen in 1840

A statue of Brummell by Irena Sedlecka was erected on Londons Jermyn Street in 2002

From 1810 Nash would take very few private commissions Nash was a dedicated Whig and was a friend of Charles James Fox through whom Nash probably came to the attention of the Prince Regent For the rest of his career he would largely work for the Prince His first major commissions in 1811 from the Prince was Regent Street and the development of an area then known as Marylebone Park 

With the Regents backing Nash created a master plan for the area put into action from 1818 onwards which stretched from St Jamess northwards and included Regent Street Regents Park and its neighbouring streets terraces and crescents of elegant town houses and villas Nash did not complete all the detailed designs himself in some instances completion was left in the hands of other architects Nash was employed by the Prince to develop his Ocean Pavilion Palace in Brighton originally designed by Henry Holland By 1822 Nash had finished his work on the Ocean Pavilion which was now transformed into the Royal Pavilion

Examples of his work include

The right to education is one of the human rights but it is not used by everyone The right should make everyone equal and help to end discrimination It is thought that all children should go to school for primary education from the age of six years to the age of ten years During this time children usually learn reading and writing skills in their mother tongue as well as some easy mathematics social studies and science Furthermore all children should have access to secondary education and higher education However many children around the world cannot or do not go to secondary education or higher education 

The right to education is written in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 14 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights The right to education has also been re stated in the 1960 UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education 1st Protocol of ECHR and the 1981 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women

It is also listed in the European Convention on Human Rights Protocol 1 Article 2 Some national constitutions name this right for example the Belgian constitution or the Dutch constitution 

The Global Hunger Index is a measurement to measure the hunger situation in a country It is a Statistical tool There are three numbers which are used to calculate the GHI Each number has the same importance

To get the World Hunger index the weighted average of the three numbers is taken This number will be between 0 and 100 Higher numbers are worse The numbers can be interpreted as follows

Today the highest values can be found in Sub Saharan Africa and in South Asia with values of 221 and 230 Even though the numbers may be similar the source of the problem is different In Sub saharan Africa the main problem is high child mortality rates and a large number of people who cannot meet their energy requirements In South Asia the main problem is the high number of malnurished children under the age of five This may also be a consequence of the fact that women have a poorer education and baby girls are not fed as well as baby boys

The GP2 Series GP2 for short is a form of open wheel motor racing GP2 was started in 2005 after the Formula 3000 was stopped The format was conceived by Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore while Ecclestone also has the rights to the name GP1 In 2010 the GP3 Series class was launched as a feeder class for the GP2 series

GP2 was designed to be an affordable racing series and a training series for Formula One GP2 requires all of the teams to use the same chassis engine and tyre supplier Almost all races have taken place as support races on Formula One race weekends Many drivers have used GP2 as a stepping stone into Formula One

The GP2 Series car is used by all of the teams and features a Dallara chassis powered by a V8 Renault engine and Bridgestone tyres

The 4 L Renault V8 engine features design and software upgrades designed to improve performance and fuel consumption The engine produces about 580 hp GP2 Series engines are rev limited to 10000 rpm 

Bridgestone supplying three slick tyre compounds for racing on dry They also provide a wet weather tyre The choice of tyre to be raced is made by the Bridgestone and the GP2 Series organizers prior to each event

Brembo supplies the brakes

On Friday drivers have a 30 minute practice session and a 30 minute qualifying session The qualifying session decides the grid order for Saturdays race which has a length of 180 kilometers

During Saturdays race each driver has to make a pit stop in which at least two tyres have to be changed 

On Sunday there is a sprint race of 120 km The grid is decided by the Saturday result with top 8 being reversed so the driver who finished 8th on Saturday will start from pole position and the winner will start from 8th place

With this points system the most number of points anyone can score in one round is 20 by claiming pole position winning both races with the fastest lap in each race This has only been achieved twice in GP2 Racings short history By Brazilian Nelson Piquet Jr in the 9th round of the 2006 season in Hungary and by German Nico Hlkenberg in the 5th round of the 2009 season in Germany

Drivers are listed by their last year in GP2 Series Usually they started in F1 at the start of the following season

Note Timo Glock had four Grand Prix starts in 2004 drove in GP2 Series in 2006 07 before moving to F1 in 2008

Formula Two often called F2 is a type of open wheel auto racing It served as a feeder series to Formula One In 1985 it was replaced by Formula 3000 In 2008 the FIA announced that Formula Two would return for 2009 season in the form of the FIA Formula Two Championship The goal is to develop a low cost series to allow young drivers a chance to compete in the highest levels of motor racing

Formula One is generally regarded as the top open wheeled auto racing series Because of the high performance and expense of the cars a lower level racing series was needed for developing drivers and teams For much of the history of F1 Formula Two was that step in the racing ladder

Before the Second World War there was a division of racing cars smaller and less powerful than the Grand Prix racers This division was usually called voiturette racing It provided a place for amateur or less experienced drivers and smaller team to prove themselves

In 1946 Formula A was introduced The old 15 L voiturette formula was replaced with 30 L supercharged cars

Formula Two was first formally defined in 1948 by the FIA as a smaller and cheaper racers to complement to the Grand Prix cars of the era

The engines 20 L normally aspirated or 750 cc supercharged The 750 cc engines were rarely used This brought new manufactures such as Cooper to move up to Formula Two Formula One in its early years was very expensive There were so few cars entered for the 1952 and 1953 that the World Championship Grand Prix races were run to Formula Two rules

F2 started to decline with the arrival of the 25 L Formula One in 1954 A new format of Formula Two was introduced for 1957 with 15 L engines This became dominated by rear engined Coopers and Bobtail sports car Porsches cars based on their RSK sports cars enjoying some success Ferrari originally developed their Sharknose Dino 156 as an F2 car The dominant engine was the Coventry Climax FPF four cylinder

Formula Junior was introduced in 1959 It tried to replace F3 and F2 It was realised that it needed to be split up F2 and F3 were reintroduced for the 1964 season F2 cars had a 10 L engine Many F1 stars drove in the F2 series on their off days 

By the late 1960s many fetl the gap between F1 and F2 too wide A new 16 L production based engine formula for F2 was introduced This brought the series back to a feeder series for F1 The most popular engine was the Cosworth FVA 

In 1967 the FIA introduced the European Formula Two Championship Jacky Ickx driving a Matra MS5 won the first championship 

In 1972 the formula was changed to increase power 20 L production based engines were allowed Cosworth BDs and BMW four cylinder engines dominated the early years BMW powered Marches slowly gained the lead For 1976 race only engines were permitted 

After the 1984 season Formula Two was upgraded to Formula 3000 This was an attempt to merge F2 style chassis with the normally aspirated 3000cc Cosworth DFV V8 engines These engines were now obsolete in the all turbocharged Formula One

F3000 was replaced by the GP2 Series in 2005 To save money standard 4000cc V8 engines are used They provided 580 hp at low a cost 

The Formula Two name returned in 2009 following an FIA announcement on 25 June 2008

MotorSport Vision won the contract to supply chassis and engines for the new FIA Formula Two Championship MSV is also the promoter of the Championship as well as the operating entity for all of the cars

The cars were designed by Williams Grand Prix Engineering Ltd and prepared by MotorSport Vision The open wheel chassis is powered by a 18L turbocharged Audi engine developed by Mountune Racing The new F2 cars are aimed to fall between F1 and F3 in performance MSV owned by former Formula One driver Jonathan Palmer The first championship was won by Andy Soucek The season was marred by the death of Henry Surtees during Round 4 at Brands Hatch

A number of other Formula Two series have existed around the world They include Japanese Formula Two Australian Formula 2 Other national Formula Two series include Mexican Brazilian Argentina and South American The British Formula 3000 series was briefly known as Formula Two

The province of West Pakistan was created in 14th October 1955 by the merger of the provinces states and tribal areas of the western wing The province was composed of twelve divisions and the provincial capital was established at Lahore The province of East Bengal was renamed East Pakistan with the provincial capital at Dacca The federal government moved in 1959 from Karachi to Rawalpindi whilst the federal legislature moved to DACCA

West Pakistan formed a seemingly homogeneous block but with marked linguistic and ethnic distinctions and the One Unit policy was regarded as a rational administrative reform which would reduce expenditure and eliminate provincial prejudices However with the military coup of 1958 trouble loomed for the province when the office of Chief Minister was abolished and the President took over executive powers for West Pakistan The province of West Pakistan was dissolved in July 1970 by President Yahya Khan

General elections held in December 1970 saw the Awami League under Mujibur Rahman win an overall majority of seats in parliament The Awami League advocated greater autonomy for East Pakistan but the military government did not permit Mujibur Rahman to form a government

Stamp showing both the East and west divisions of Pakistan Before the secession of Bangladesh On March 25th 1971 West Pakistan began a civil war to subdue the democratic victory of East Pakistanis This began the war between the Pakistani military and the Mukhti Bahini The resulting refugee crisis led to the intervention by India eventually leading to the surrender of the Pakistani Army East Pakistan suffered a genocide of its Bengali population East Pakistan became the independent state of Bangladesh on December 16 1971 The term West Pakistan became redundant

The Rhinoceros Hornbill is a species of bird living in parts of Malaya and Thailand It usually wanders here and there in the forest where it lives in search of fruits and nuts to eat Hornbills use their big bills to open the tough husks of nuts and to handle large fruit 

The Oystercatcher is a species of bird that lives around Europe and Asia They usually eat shellfishes that are found on beaches and mud The Eurasian Oystercatcher uses its sharp bill to open the shells of oysters and mussels It cuts the muscle between the two halves of the shell together or it crashes the shell against a rock and eats the oyster inside 

Kart racing or karting is a type of open wheel motor sport It uses small open four wheeled vehicles called karts go karts or gearboxshifter karts depending on the design They are usually raced on scaled down kart circuits Karting is commonly seen as the stepping stone to the higher and more expensive ranks of motorsports

Karts vary widely in speed Some known as Superkarts can reach speeds exceeding convert160mphkmh Go karts for the general public used for fun may be limited to speeds of convert15mphkmh 

Art Ingels is generally accepted to be the father of karting He was a long time hot rodder and a race car builder at Kurtis Kraft He built the first kart in Southern California in 1956 

The chassis are made of steel tube There is no suspension The chassis must flex enough to work as the suspension 

Braking is achieved by a disc brake mounted on the rear axle Front disc brakes are becoming popular Some classes do not allow them

Amusement park go karts can be powered by 4 stroke engines or electric motors Racing karts use small 2 stroke or 4 stroke engines

Karts do not have a differential Both rear wheels turn at the same speed Because of this one rear tire must slide while cornering 

Power is transmitted from the engine to the rear axle by way of a chain

Wheels and tires are much smaller than those used on a normal car 

Like other motorsports karts use different tires for the track conditions Slicks are used for dry weather Rain tires or wets are used for wet weather Slicks with grooves cut into them are used for dirt tracks Spiked tires are used for ice 

Kart racing is generally accepted as the most economic form of motorsport available As a fun pastime it can be performed by almost anybody As a motorsport it is regulated by FIA under the name of Commission Internationale de Karting

In the USA many organizations regulate racing such as the International Kart Federation World Karting Association Karters of America Racing Triad and Stars of Karting presented by the Indy Racing League In the UK the Motor Sports Association regulate Karting In Australia kart racing is administered by the Australian Karting Association on the behalf of FIA and Confederation of Australian Motor Sport

Kart racing is usually used as a low cost and relatively safe way to introduce drivers to motor racing Many people think it is for young drivers but adults are also very active in karting Karting is considered a first step in a racers career It can help develop quick reflexes precision car control and decision making skills 

Besides traditional kart racing many commercial enterprises offer karts for rent often called recreational or concession karts The tracks can be indoor or outdoor Karts are rented by sessions they use sturdy chassis completed with bodywork for driver safety 

Outdoor tracks can offer low speed karts strictly for amusement or faster more powerful karts similar to a racing kart Typically these outdoor tracks may also be used for traditional kart races

The Black headed Weaver also known as the Village Weaver is a bird with a black head and golden body The male Black headed Weaver usually does the weaving however and the female sits for the eggs The male stitches strips of straws to make a basket with a roof He uses grasses to tie knots and make sure the nest is completely secure Finally he shows the nest to females in effort to attract a mate The males usually mate with many females during the mating season to get more offspring They all nest in colonies and in the end the females are left to raise their young alone The seeds that the Black headed Weaver tends to feed on is very common so they do not need to stay and defend their familys territory or food

The Rufous Hornero is a kind of bird that lives around South America It builds its nests on high places such as telephone poles or trees When it makes a nest it looks like a cup that has fallen over to the side or like an old fashioned bakers oven To make it the Rufous Hornero mixes grass and animal hair and mud and then leaves it to dry Inside there is a grassy room where it lays its eggs

The Scarlet Tanager is a bird that lives in North America It likes to make its nests in oak trees that are as high as from 8 to 75 feet tall The nests are shaped like cups like most tree nesting birds to prevent eggs from rolling out 

The Western Grebe is a species of Grebe or bird They are well known for their dancing on the top of the water in their early nesting season after mating The two birds will hold long strands of grass or straw in their bills and dance a dance called weed dancing Then at the climax they rise and make a pose which is called rushing and run across the waters surface for a little bit before they dive Males also used this dance when they wanted to protect their territories or fight over the female

The Messier Catalogue is a list of astronomical objects made by French astronomer Charles Messier in 1771 Messier was a comet hunter and was angry by objects which were not comet He put together a list of these objects along with his assistant Pierre Mchain

These objects are very important to astronomers as they include nebulae and galaxies

The objects have M in front He was limited by the objects he could see from France so the list is incomplete by todays standards but it remains popular due to the length of time it has been around and astronomers familiarity with these objects

The first edition covered 45 objects numbered M1 to M45 The total list published by Messier finally contained 103 objects but the list got an independent life with changes by other astronomers The first change came from Camille Flammarion in 1921 who added Messier 104 after finding Messiers side note in his 1781 edition of the catalogue M105 to M107 were added by Helen Sawyer Hogg in 1947 M108 and M109 by Owen Gingerich in 1960 and M110 by Kenneth Glyn Jones M102 was observed by Mchain who gave his notes to Messier later Mchain himself said that this object does not exist and it was simply a re observation of M101 Some sources mention the galaxy NGC 5866 for M102 but its description does not fit with Mchains notes

Messiers last catalog was in the Connaissance des Temps for 1784 These objects are still called by their Messier number from this list

Other catalogues exist most notably the New General Catalogue

In springtime some astronomers conduct Messier Marathons where they try to locate as many of these objects in one night as possible

Barium sulfide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is BaS It contains barium and sulfide ions

Barium sulfide is colorless when pure It can get colored when it is not pure It reacts slowly with water to make barium hydroxide and hydrogen sulfide It reacts with acids to make a barium salt and hydrogen sulfide too

It is made by reduction of barium sulfate with carbon at a high temperature 

It is used to make barium compounds from barium ore

Barium sulfide looks very similar to barium sulfate Barium sulfate is not toxic while barium sulfide is very toxic Barium sulfide dissolves in water to make toxic hydrogen sulfide and toxic barium hydroxide If someone is fed barium sulfide it would kill them

Barium peroxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is BaO2 It contains barium and peroxide ions

Barium peroxide is a gray white solid It reacts with water to make oxygen gas When it is heated very hot it releases oxygen and turns into barium oxide 

It is made by heating barium oxide This process used to be used to get oxygen from the air Barium oxide was heated to around 300C absorbing oxygen and making barium peroxide The barium peroxide was heated above 500C releasing the oxygen Then it could be reused

Barium peroxide can be used to make hydrogen peroxide by reaction with sulfuric acid This also makes the solid barium sulfate 

Peroxide is an ion Its chemical formula is O22 Peroxide can be a reducing agent or an oxidizing agent More often it is an oxidizing agent It can be reduced to oxide or oxidized to oxygen Hydrogen peroxide is the most common peroxide Barium peroxide is another peroxide

There are organic peroxides These are chemical compounds where peroxide is attached to an organic molecule Some of them are explosives

Barium oxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is BaO It contains barium and oxide ions

Barium oxide is a white solid It dissolves in water to make barium hydroxide It reacts with acids to make barium salts 

Barium oxide is made by heating barium carbonate with carbon This prevents barium peroxide from forming when it is heated It can also be made by heating barium nitrate 

Barium oxide can be added to glass instead of lead oxide It is also used in cathode ray tubes It can be used as a catalyst

Barium oxide is very toxic when eaten

Barium nitrate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Ba2 It contains barium and nitrate ions

Barium nitrate is a colorless solid It dissolves in water It is an oxidizing agent It releases a green flame when burned It decomposes when heated to barium oxide oxygen and nitrogen dioxide If it is heated in nitric oxide it makes barium nitrite It reacts with any sulfate or sulfuric acid to make barium sulfate

It is made by reacting barium carbonate with nitric acid It can be made by reacting sodium nitrate with barium chloride

Barium nitrate can be mixed with powdered aluminium and zinc This makes an explosive It is also used in fireworks to make a green color It is also used to make barium oxide

Barium nitrate is very toxic Sulfates can be given if someone eats barium because they turn it into nontoxic barium sulfate

Barium hydroxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Ba2 It contains barium and hydroxide ions

Barium hydroxide is a white solid It dissolves in water to make a basic solution It decomposes to barium oxide when heated in a vacuum It reacts with carbon dioxide to make barium carbonate It reacts with any sulfate to make barium sulfate It reacts with hydrogen sulfide to make barium sulfide

It is made by dissolving barium oxide in water

Barium hydroxide is used in titrations If sodium hydroxide solution is used some sodium carbonate may be in there It is less basic than sodium hydroxide so the titration can be messed up When barium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide to make barium carbonate it forms a white solid that can be removed

It is used as a strong base in organic chemistry It is used to clean up sulfuric acid spills by making barium sulfate

Barium hydroxide is corrosive because it is basic It is also toxic because of barium ions

Barium carbonate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is BaCO3 It contains barium and carbonate ions

Barium carbonate is a white solid It does not dissolve in water It reacts with acids to make barium salts It turns into barium oxide and carbon dioxide when heated It reacts with sulfuric acid to make barium sulfate though 

Barium carbonate occurs as witherite Witherite is the main source of barium salts It is more easily turned into other barium compounds than barium sulfate barite It is heavily mined in Northumberland It turns into barium sulfate when water containing sulfates flows through it 

It can be purified from the natural ore or it can be made by reacting barium sulfide with sodium carbonate It can also be made by reacting barium sulfide with a mixture of carbon dioxide and water 

Barium carbonate is used to poison rats It is also used in making bricks It is also used to glaze ceramics This glaze can make different colors 

Barium carbonate can dissolve in stomach acid so it is toxic There is a controversy over whether it should be used as a glaze

Chris Ivory is an American football running back for the New Orleans Saints of the National Football League He was signed as a free agent by the Saints on May 3 2010 He played college football at Washington State and at Tiffin University in Ohio

Ivory played both football and track and field in high school at Longview High School in Longview Texas

Ivory played three years for Washington State Because of injuries he did not get to play as much as he could have In 22 games he rushed 91 times for 534 yards and 4 touchdowns He also had 23 kickoff returns averaging 228 yards In August 2009 Ivory was kicked off the Washington State team

Ivory then went to Tiffin a Division II school in Tiffin Ohio whose team was coached by Dave Walkosky Walkosky had been a Washington State assistant coach In Ivorys final year of college football he had 39 rushes for 223 yards in five games before hurting his knee which ended his season Walkosky tried to get a medical redshirt exemption for Ivory which would have let Ivory play another year but he did not get one Even though he did not play much at Tiffin some NFL scouts saw Ivorys performance and speed and some people thought he could become the first Tiffin player to be picked in the NFL Draft However this did not happen

Ivory was not drafted but he reached a deal with the Saints immediately after the draft and signed as a free agent on May 3 2010 He played well in training camp and preseason games This included a good game against the San Diego Chargers that included a 76 yard touchdown on a swing pass Chris Ivory made the Saints 53 man roster after beating out Ladell Betts for the last running back position with a great preseason performance

The Advertising Council mostly called as the Ad Council is an American non profit organization that creates public service announcements on behalf of sponsors including non profit organizations and the United States government

The Advertising Council does not make public service advertisements for itself but it acts as a creator of them for others The Advertising Council allows sponsor organizations to create advertising that are on social issues as well

The Advertising Council was created in 1941 and shortly after in February 1942 it was registered as the The War Advertising Council for the purpose of being in the advertising industry in support of the war effort Early ads tried to tell people about the purchase of war bonds and saving of war things

After the Second World War the War Advertising Council changed its name to the Advertising Council and shifted its focus to peacetime ads In 1945 the Ad Council began working with the National Safety Council

Mobile Suit Gundam 00 is the first Gundam series to be animated in widescreen and in high definition as well as the first to be set in the non fictional Anno Domini era The series is set in a futuristic Earth and is centered around the exploits of the fictional paramilitary organization Celestial Being and its efforts to rid the world of war and conflict with a series of unique and extremely advanced mobile suits known as Gundams

The main tagline for the first season is Rebirth Begins Through Destruction

The series is set in 2307 AD As a result of the depletion of fossil fuels humanity had to search for a new source of power The power was found in the form of massive arrays of solar power collectors orbiting the Earth and supported by three orbital elevators each one serving one of the three power blocs on the planet namely Union controlling the region surrounding North America Human Reform League consisting of China Russia and India and AEU which controls mainland Europe

With this nearly inexhaustible source of energy benefiting only the major powers and their allies constant warfare erupts around the globe among minor countries for fuels and energy Countries that once economically relied on the sale of fossil fuels have plunged into poverty Some even believe that solar energy threatened the promised land of God resulting in the 20 year Solar Wars This chaos led to the formation of a private military organization called Soresutaru Bingu dedicated to eradicating war and uniting humanity through the use of four humanoid machines called Gundams Mobile Suit Gundam 00 follows four mobile suit pilots termed Gandamu Maisut sided with Celestial Being The main protagonist is 16 year old a quiet taciturn young man who grew up in the war torn Krugis Republic He pilots the GN 001 Gundam Exia a high mobility mobile suit effective in melee combat

Unable to counter Celestial Beings superior technology the three major powers eventually unite into the in order to counter Celestial Beings armed interventions In order to fight the Gundams the United Nations Army employed the help of Laguna Harvey Harvey a Celestial Being intelligence agent turned traitor provides them with 30 GN X mobile suits equipped with pseudo GN Drives As the United Nations resist Celestial Beings interventions a second team of Gundams known as Team Trinity appears and assists in the Meisters eradication of war albeit in a much more cruel and cold blooded fashion in contrast with the original Meisters less aggressive nature of armed intervention

Alejandro Corner a former Celestial Being observer who plans to make use of the chaos and destruction created by Celestial Being to rule a reconstructed world subsequently takes over Veda Celestial Beings supercomputer which is located on the moon Without the tactical aid from the organizations artificial intelligence Celestial Being is easily overwhelmed and overpowered by GN X units and their superior numbers

The United Nations Army initiates Operation Fallen Angels to destroy the Gundams having discovered the location of the Meisters mothership Ptolemaios During the operation Ali Al Saachez kills Lockon Stratos after a climactic battle Alejandro Corner in his unique custom mobile armor Alvatore attacks Gundam Exia as the GN X units proceed to destroy the Ptolemaios and the remaining Gundams Exia struggles with the monstrous Alvatore but in the end succeeds in killing Alejandro Graham Aker an ace pilot of the United Nations Army then challenges Setsuna to a fight seeking revenge for his fallen comrades and questioning the purpose of Gundams existence The fight results in the destruction of the GN Flag while the Exia is heavily damaged

Four years have passed since the final battle between Celestial Being and the UN Forces Humanity having established the Earth Sphere Federation forms an autonomous peace keeping force A Laws separate from and above the formal Federation army Given unfettered discretion A Laws is charged with the duty to further unify nations enforce the will of mankind and dispose of terrorist cells Unknown to the general public however is that the A Laws misuse their power and employ inhumane tactics to oppress freedoms doctrines and ideologies all in the name of unity

Saji Crossroad has followed the path to becoming a space engineer to keep his promise to Louise Halevy But he ends up being mistaken for a member of the dissident organization Katharon and is unjustly imprisoned Louise herself is compelled to become involved in Federation government reform and joined A Laws as a mobile suit pilot during the four year gap using her family inheritance to fund A Laws research

Meanwhile Setsuna having survived the battle with Graham Aker four years ago and is in hiding has witnessed a change in the world due to the actions of Celestial Being Setsuna tries to confront the A Laws by himself with his battered Gundam Exia but is easily overpowered by their newer models He is soon rescued by Tieria Erde piloting his new mobile suit the Seravee Gundam

Jean Piaget was a Swiss developmental psychologist He is famous for his work with children and how they learn He started a type of study called genetic epistemology which is about where knowledge comes from

At first Piaget was a biologist He was especially interested in mollusks He became more interested in psychology while listening to children talk He wondered how they learned and came up with a theory that they go through stages where they become ready for certain kinds of learning These stages are called stages of cognitive development For example the first stage he came up with is called the sensorimotor stage He believed that from birth to two years old children would learn that they are different from objects and that even if the child left a room things that were in the room would still be there

A spiral galaxy is a kind of galaxy that looks like a flat slowly rotating disk with a bulge in the centre It contains stars gas dust dark matter and a supermassive black hole at its centre 

Galaxies were first listed in the 18th century by William Herschel The spiral galaxy as a type was first described by Edwin Hubble in his 1936 work The Realm of the Nebulae They are named after their shape The spiral arms are where young hot stars are made which is why they are brighter than the center of the galaxy Some spiral galaxies have yellow fossil arms of older stars 

The barred spiral galaxy is an important and common type of spiral galaxy There are three other kinds of spiral galaxies Grand design spiral galaxies have two well shaped arms Multiple arm spiral galaxies have more arms In flocculent spiral galaxies it is hard to see the arms at all 

About 60 of galaxies in the universe near us are spiral and irregular galaxies They are mostly found in low density parts of the universe and are rare in the centers of galaxy clusters

Our own Milky Way has recently been confirmed to be a barred spiral galaxy although the bar itself is difficult to observe from our position in the Galactic disk The most convincing evidence for its existence comes from a recent survey performed by the Spitzer Space Telescope of stars in the Galactic center

Terrence William Terry Buck was an Australian swimmer and coach He represented Australia at the 1964 Summer Olympics in the 400m individual medley and placed eighth He was the first Australian swimmer to participate at the Olympics as both an athlete and a coach He was head coach in the 1984 Summer Olympics and team manager in 1992 and 1996 Buck was also a surf lifesaver and a life member of the Clovelly Surf Club in New South Wales He died in a tractor accident on his farm leaving behind his wife Laraine and three daughters

In 2003 Greg Rogers filed a civil lawsuit against Buck He claimed that Buck had sexually abused him from 1960 when Rogers was 11 and Buck was 16 He also said that his younger brother Neil was sexually abused from when he was eight This was settled outside court After Buck died the Telegraph published an interview with an anonymous Olympic and Commonwealth medalist who said that he had been abused by Buck as a child The person who was interviewed was not named but many knew it was Rogers Police had begun private investigations into the matter in 1998 but stopped the investigation in 2001 saying that it did not have enough proof His wife said that the stories were all untrue She said that she had trusted Rogers who had been the godfather of their late daughter Sarah and that having looked at it from every angle I can say with certainty in my heart that they are lies

Edwin Powell Hubble was an American astronomer Hubbles findings changed the scientific view of the universe 

In 1925 he showed that there are galaxies beyond our own the Milky Way Also he developed a method for classifying galaxies

Then he proved the galaxies were moving away from each other Hubble found the degree of Doppler effect from a galaxy increased in proportion to its distance from Earth Doppler effect is the change in pitch or colour when an object or sound comes in or moves away Redshift is observed in the light spectrum 

In 1929 Hubble formulated the Redshift Distance Law of galaxies nowadays called simply Hubbles law The law states that the greater the distance between any two galaxies the greater their relative speed of separation Today the apparent velocities of galaxies are understood as an increase in proper distance which occurs due to the expansion of space Light traveling through stretching space experiences a Hubble type redshift

This work helped to establish that the universe is expanding Some have incorrectly said that Hubble discovered the Doppler shift in the spectra of galaxies but this had already been observed earlier by Vesto Slipher whose data Hubble used

According to Sandage Hubble achieved four main things 

Hubble himself did not see his 1929 data as evidence for an expanding Universe Even six years later Hubble wrote

Hubbles words were forgotten and the notion of the expansion of the universe became the consensus Until the theoretical developments in the 1980s no one had an explanation for why this seemed to be the case The question why is the universe expanding is now answered by understanding the details of what happened in the first inflationary epoch of the existence of our universe

The Indianapolis Motor Speedway is in Speedway Indiana in the United States It is the home of the Indianapolis 500 race and the Brickyard 400 race

It was built in 1909 It is the original Speedway the first racing facility to use the word Speedway IMS has permanent seating for more than 257000 people The infield raises capacity to approximately 400000 It is the largest and highest capacity sporting facility in the world

The Speedway is considered relatively flat by American standards but high banked by Europeans It is a two and a half mile nearly rectangular oval Each of the four turns are 14 mile Two 58 mile long straight connect turns 2 to 3 and turns 4 to 1 Two 18 mile short straights termed short chutes connect turns 1 to 2 and turns 3 to 4

A modern infield road course was constructed between 1998 and 2000 It used part of the oval and the infield to create a convert2605mikmsingon track In 2008 the road course was changed to add another infield section This is used for motorcycle racing and is a convert2621mikmsingon course 

On the grounds of the Speedway is the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum which opened in 1956 It is also the home of the Brickyard Crossing Golf Resort which originally opened as the Speedway Golf Course in 1929

Indianapolis Motor Speedway was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987 

In addition to the Indianapolis 500 the Speedway also hosts NASCARs Brickyard 400 The Speedway also hosted the United States Grand Prix for Formula One from 2000 to 2007 In 2008 the Speedway added the Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix

After winning his fifth United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis in F12006 Formula One driver Michael Schumacher holds the record for most victories with the Forumula One version of the road course AJ Foyt Al Unser and Rick Mears each won the Indianapolis 500 four times on the traditional oval Jeff Gordon has also won four times on the oval in the Brickyard 400 Johnny Aitken holds the record for total wins at the track with 15 victories during the 1909 1910 and 1916 seasons

The first motorsports event at the track consisted of 7 motorcycle races sanctioned by the Federation of American Motorcyclists on August 14 1909 

The first weekend of automobile races took place August 1921 1909 It was 16 races sanctioned by the American Automobile Association The event almost turned into a disaster because of the surface of crushed stone and tar There were several accidents and five fatalities The final race of the weekend was halted after convert235mikm of its originally scheduled 300 miles

Carl G Fisher was an Indiana native and both a former race car driver and one of the owners of the track He led the work to make the track safer for the drivers and spectators The track surface was paved with 32 million paving bricks This gave the track its popular nickname The Brickyard Today convert3ftm of the original bricks remain at the startfinish line still giving meaning to the brick yard The final brick added to the roadway was a gold plated brick and laid by Governor Thomas R Marshall on December 17 1909

The Speedway reopened in 1910 Sixty six automobile races held during three holiday weekends Each weekend featured two or three races of convert100mikmadjon to convert200mikmadjon distance Several shorter contests were also held Each race was its own event and earned its own trophy All races were sanctioned by the AAA In 1911 a change in marketing focus led to holding only one race per year

An estimated 80000 spectators came to the first Indianapolis 500 Mile Race on Memorial Day May 30 1911 Admission was one dollar Ray Harroun won the race at the average speed of 74602 mph

The next five Indianapolis 500 were held from 19121916 Three of the Indy 500 winners were Europeans These races drew worldwide attention to the Speedway More international drivers began to enter

The 1916 race was shortened to 120 laps for convert300mikm Several things caused the race to be shortened There was a lack of entries from Europe and a lack of oil Another reason was out of respect for the war in Europe

On September 9 1916 the Speedway hosted a day of short racing events These were called the Harvest Classic There were three races held at 20 50 and convert100mikmadjon distances Johnny Aitken in a Peugeot won all three events his final victories at the track After the Harvest Classic no race other than the Indianapolis 500 to be held on the grounds for seventy eight years

Racing was interrupted in 19171918 by World War I The facility served as a military center for repairs

Racing resumed in 1919 Speeds quickly increased In 1925 Peter DePaolo became the first to average 100 mph for the race

By the early 1930s the increasing speeds began to make the track more dangerous In the period 19311935 there were 15 fatalities Part of the bricks were replaced with tarmac During the 19351936 seasons a number of changes were made The inside wall was removed in the corners The outside wall angle was changed to help keep cars inside the track Hard crash helmets became required The first yellow lights were installed around the track

At the beginning of the 1940s the track needed more improvement In 1941 half of the garage area known as Gasoline Alley burned down before the race When the United States joined World War II the 1942 race was canceled In 1942 all auto racing was banned The 500 Mile Race was canceled for the years 19421945 The track mostly abandoned during the war years 

On November 29 1944 three time 500 winner Wilbur Shaw came back to do a convert500mikmsingon tire test for Firestone The test was approved by the government Shaw found the track to be in very bad condition The contacted the owner Eddie Rickenbacker and found that the Speedway was for sale Shaw try to find a buyer that would keep the Speedway as a race track He found Indiana businessman Tony Hulman The Speedway was purchased on November 14 1945 

Major renovations and repairs were made to the Speedway It opened in time for the 1946 race Many improvements have been made since 1946

The 500 Mile Race became part of the Formula One World Championship for 11 years None of the regular Indy drivers raced in Formula One Alberto Ascari from Ferrari was the only F1 driver to race in the 500 during this time

In October 1961 the final remaining brick sections of the track were paved over with asphalt with the exception of a distinct three foot wide line of bricks at the startfinish line The Brickyard thus became known for its Yard of Bricks

From 1919 to 1993 the 500 was the only race run at the Brickyard Tony George inherited the track He brought more racing to the Speedway NASCAR start racing in 1994 with the Brickyard 400 The International Race of Champions event was added in 1998 The last IROC at Indy race was held in 2003

In 2003 the Firestone Indy Lights Series a minor league series of the Indy Racing League started racing at the Speedway They were the first series to race in May other than the 500 since 1910 

In 1998 Tony George made a deal to bring Formula One back to the United States The last time F1 raced in the US was 1991 A new Indy based road course using part of the oval track and part of the infield was built in two years The first United States Grand Prix held at the Speedway was in 2000 The 2001 event reported 185000 fans were reported in attendance The success was even more important with the race The race was held on September 30 2001 It was the largest international sporting event held in the United States after September 11 2001 terrorist attacks

Unlike the oval track the Grand Prix road course is raced in a clockwise direction This follows the general practice of Formula One in where most circuits run clockwise

On July 12 2007 it was announced that Formula One would not return to the Speedway for F12008 Tony George said there were problems meeting the demands of Bernie Ecclestone to continue hosting the event On May 25 2010 it was announced that Formula One would return to the United States in 2012 at a new purpose built track in Austin Texas 

In 2005 there was a big problem with some of the Formula One tires During practice there was a big crash at turn 13 This part of the F1 circuit is the turn 1 of the oval track This is also the only banked corner on the F1 calendar Michelin realized their tires could not handle the banking They would fail after a few laps The cars using Bridgestone tires did not have the problem

The Michelin teams could not solve the problem Michelin wanted to add a chicane before the turn The FIA would not allow the track to be modify Everyone involved tried to fix the problem right up to race Michelin told their teams the tires were not safe to race with 

The Michelin teams lined up on the starting grid They drove around the track for the slow parade lap At the end of the lap they pulled into the pits and parked their cars This left only the three Bridgestone teams to run the race The two Ferrari cars were the only cars on the lead lap at the end of the race 

On July 16 2007 the Speedway announced that it would host a round of Grand Prix motorcycle racing beginning in 2008 The race was backed by Red Bull and known as the Red Bull Indianapolis GP This was the first motorcycle racing event at the facility since its first month of operation in August 1909

Modifications approved by the FIA and FIM were made to the former Formula One circuit The new circuit now has 16 turns The motorcycle course runs counter clockwise the same direction as the oval track It bypass the banking of the oval with a new infield section inside Turn 1 Also the double hairpin at the Hulman Straight was replaced with traditional S turns The construction was finished before the opening day of the 2008 Indianapolis 500

The city of Indianapolis has hosted a half marathon It includes one lap around the Speedway 

The Speedway Golf Course has hosted a PGA Tour event and an LPGA event A Champions Tour event was hosted there from 19941999

In video games first person means the player sees the game from the eyes of the character he or she is playing as This is different than third person where the player watches what the character does from a virtual camera The player is supposed to feel like he or she is inside the character 

A common type of first person game is first person shooter In a first person shooter the player can usually see his or her arms holding a gun or other weapon Some games such as Call of Duty let the player look right down the sights of the gun to aim

Many simulation games where the player controls a vehicle are first person This includes most flight simulators and many racing video games The player can often see the controls and instruments of the vehicle such as the steering wheel and speedometer in a car or the joystick and altimeter in an airplane

The one child policy or family planning policy is a policy introduced in the Peoples Republic of China in the year 1979 After the Second World War the Chinese population grew a great deal The policy was introduced to control population growth and says that Chinese families should only have one child There are several exceptions to this rule According to a spokesperson about 36 of the Chinese population is affected by the rule The policy does not apply in Hong Kong Macau or Tibet

If the limit is exceeded the family must pay money to the government Since 1979 the policy has prevented 250 million births from occurring 76 of the Chinese population support the policy along with many members of the Chinese governmentfactdateOctober 2010

Dads Army is a comedy programme made by the BBC which was shown on British television between 1968 and 1977 It is about a Home Guard platoon during World War II It was very popular at the time and is still repeated It starred several well known British actors including Arthur Lowe John Le Mesurier John Laurie and Clive Dunn

It was written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft based partly on Jimmy Crofts experience in the Home Guard but also on the work of comedians such as Will Hay 

The Home Guard were set up in 1940 to protect Britain in the case of invasion Because young men were in the regular army Home Guard platoons were usually made up of older people The show followed the Walmington on Sea platoon led by Captain Mainwaring a bank manager who appoints himself leader 

His platoon is made up of his posh sergeant Wilson elderly butcher Lance Corporal Jones several senior citizens as well as a spiv and a mothers boy as well as other men who dont say much The humour is derived from their antics as well as the relationship between Mainwaring and his upper class sergeant 

In early episodes the humour was based on the difficulty of starting the platoon without any weapons In later episodes the comedy was often based on the characters Because the platoon rarely encountered the Nazis their enemy was usually the grumpy ARP Warden Hodges played by Bill Pertwee

Counter terrorism also spelled as counterterrorism is work to prevent and fight against terrorism Counter terrorism is usually done by governments militaries police forces and special counter terrorism units

There are many different ways to do counter terrorism An important goal is to stop terrorism before it happens This is done by trying to find out about plans to commit terrorism If the plan is discovered sometimes the terrorists can be arrested or security can be sent to protect the target of the terrorism

Sometimes no one finds out about the terrorist plot until it starts to happen When this happens police or counter terrorist soldiers may be sent to try and stop the terrorists from completing the plan which usually leads to combat

The history of astronomy describes the ideas of earlier civilisations It also discusses the beginnings of modern astronomy

The Babylonian astronomers viewed the Universe as a flat disk floating in the ocean and this forms the start for early Greek maps like those of Anaximander and Hecataeus of Miletus

Greek philosophers seeing the movement of heavenly bodies developed models of the Universe based more on empirical evidence The first coherent model was proposed by Eudoxus of Cnidos According to this model space and time are infinite and eternal the Earth is spherical and stationary and all other matter is confined to rotating concentric spheres 

This model was brought into agreement with astronomical observations by Ptolemy However not all Greek scientists accepted the geocentric model of the Universe The Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus thought the center of the Universe was a central fire around which the Earth Sun Moon and Planets revolved in uniform circular motion The Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos was the first known person to propose a Heliocentric model of the universe Though the original text has been lost a reference in Archimedes book The Sand Reckoner describes Aristarchus heliocentric theory Archimedes wrote

 You King Gelon are aware the Universe is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the Earth while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth This is the common account as you have heard from astronomers But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses wherein it appears as a consequence of the assumptions made that the universe is many times greater than the Universe just mentioned His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit and that the sphere of fixed stars situated about the same center as the Sun is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface 

Aristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away and saw this as the reason why there was no visible parallax that is an observed movement of the stars relative to each other as the Earth moved around the Sun The stars are in fact much farther away than was generally assumed in ancient times which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with telescopes The rejection of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong as the following passage from Plutarch suggests

 Cleanthes a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the Stoics thought it was the duty of the Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the universe ie the Earth  supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the earth to revolve in an oblique circle while it rotates at the same time about its own axis The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia He was a Babylonian astronomer a century after Aristarchus According to Plutarch Seleucus was the first to prove the heliocentric system through reasoning but it is not known what arguments he used Seleucus arguments for a heliocentric theory were probably related to the phenomenon of tides According to Strabo Seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon and that the height of the tides depends on the Moons position relative to the Sun 

The Aristotelian model was accepted in the Western world for about two thousand years until Copernicus revived Aristarchus theory that the sun was placed at the center of the Solar System

As noted by Copernicus himself the suggestion that the Earth rotates was very old dating at least to Philolaus About a century before Copernicus Nicholas of Cusa also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book On Learned Ignorancep754 

The first empirical evidence for the Earths rotation on its axis using the phenomenon of comets was given by Tusi

Copernicus heliocentric model allowed the stars to be placed uniformly through the space surrounding the planets as first proposed by Thomas Digges in his Perfit Description of the Caelestiall Orbes according to the most aunciente doctrine of the Pythagoreans latelye revived by Copernicus and by Geometricall Demonstrations approved Giordano Bruno accepted the idea that space was infinite and filled with solar systems similar to our own for the publication of this view he was burnt at the stake in Rome on 17 February 1600

This cosmology was accepted provisionally by Isaac Newton Christiaan Huygens and later scientists although it had several paradoxes which were resolved only with general relativity The first paradox was that it assumed that space and time were infinite and that the stars in the universe had been burning forever however since stars are constantly radiating energy a finite star seems inconsistent with the radiation of infinite energy Secondly Edmund Halley noted that the assumption of an infinite space filled uniformly with stars would lead to the prediction that the nighttime sky would be as bright as the sun itself this became known as Olbers paradox in the 19th century Third Newton himself showed that an infinite space uniformly filled with matter would cause infinite forces and instabilities causing the matter to be crushed inwards under its own gravity This instability was later clarified in 1902 

A significant astronomical advance of the 18th century was the realization by Thomas Wright Immanuel Kant and others that stars are not distributed uniformly throughout space rather they are grouped into galaxiesp756

The modern era of physical cosmology began in 1917 when Albert Einstein first applied his general theory of relativity to model the structure and dynamics of the universe 

An uppercut in the boxing is a punch that usually has as target the opponents chin and therefore it is known in the common language also as hook to the chin

In the technical language one does not use the expression hook to the chin because as a rule rule one calls a hook a punch from the side with the lead hand and almost always the chin is the target of punches

The uppercut becomes often used for begin or close a combination of punches

The uppercut is led from the region of navel in a going up move therefore the shape of hook remains before the fist reaches the opponents or body Other variants for example in the Thai boxing are not striked from the region of stomach Instead the boxer drops the fist from the cover only so long outside as is necessary for shooting with enough force Pulling down the fist to the stomach extends the way increases the needed time and therefore the opponents chance to use the open cover in his favor for a punch

An uppercut is very best performed in the closeness then as the distance to the opponent increases the chance to not strike him arises An uppercut causes as a rule the biggest damage if it reaches the opponents chin but also torso nose and eyes are typical targets

It belongs for this reason to the techniques of infight

Almost always it concerns uppercuts of the rear hand but there are also boxers as Aaron Pryor and Ricardo Lpez who outside the normal play regularly stroke a left uppercut Michel Trabant succeeded with a left uppercut a knock out of single punch against the fiercely attacking Marc Waelkens

Among others Joe Louis was known for his uppercut

Chlorite is an ion Its chemical formula is ClO2 It is an oxidizing agent It contains chlorine in its 3 oxidation state They can be known as salts of chlorous acid Some chlorites are explosives It can be made by dissolving chlorine dioxide in a base It can also be made by reduction of chlorate with hydrogen peroxide Sodium chlorite is the most common chlorite

Chlorite can refer to either chlorite an ion or chlorite a group of minerals

Chlorous acid is a chemical compound It is an acid Its chemical formula is HClO2 It contains chlorite ions It is not stable It easily disproportionates to hypochlorous acid and chloric acid It is a strong oxidizing agent Chlorites are made by reacting chlorous acid with a base They are more stable It can be made by reacting barium chlorite with sulfuric acid This makes insoluble barium sulfate and chlorous acid

Sodium chlorite is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is NaClO2 It contains sodium and chlorite ions

Sodium chlorite is a colorless solid It is a powerful oxidizing agent It disproportionates sometimes It forms the unstable chlorous acid when reacted with a strong acid 

It is made by reducing chlorine dioxide in a basic solution of hydrogen peroxide 

Sodium chlorite can be used to disinfect water Since chlorine dioxide is too reactive to store sodium chlorite is stored and converted to chlorine dioxide before use It is also used as a disinfectant It can be used in oxidation reactions in organic chemistry

It is similar to chlorates in toxicity Ingestion of about 10 grams would be fatal A smaller amount could make someone very sick

Chloric acid is a chemical compound It is also an acid Its chemical formula is HClO3 It contains chlorate and hydrogen ions

Chloric acid is a colorless solution It cannot be made pure It only can be mixed with water It is very reactive Chloric acid can decompose when warmed to make perchloric acid chlorine chlorine dioxide and oxygen It is a powerful oxidizing agent It can make things like sugar burn when it is mixed with them Sulfur can make explosive mixtures with potassium chlorate because chloric acid can be made

It can be made by reacting barium chlorate with sulfuric acid The insoluble barium sulfate is filtered out It can also be made by heating hypochlorous acid

Chloric acid does not have many uses as it is too explosive and reactive

Barium chlorate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Ba2 It contains barium and chlorate ions

Barium chlorate is a colorless solid It is very toxic because it has barium ions in it It also is an oxidizing agent It makes oxygen gas when it is heated

Barium chlorate can be made by reacting sodium chlorate and barium chloride It can also be made by electrolytic oxidation of barium chloride similar to the chloralkali process It can also be made by reacting ammonium chlorate an unstable compound with barium carbonate This mixture is boiled converting the ammonium carbonate to ammonia and carbon dioxide

Barium chlorate is used in fireworks to make a green color It is also used in matches to make oxygen and make the match burn faster

Ammonium chlorate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is NH4ClO3 It contains ammonium and chlorate ions 

It is a colorless solid The chlorate is an oxidizing agent and the ammonium is a reducing agent making it a little explosive It explodes when in sunlight for a few minutes It should never be crystallized as it can explode without any detonation It can catch flammable things on fire It decomposes completely to nitrogen chlorine and oxygen when heated gently

It can be made by reacting ammonia or ammonium carbonate with chloric acid 

It is used to make barium chlorate

Ammonium carbonate also known as bakers ammonia or sal volatile is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is2CO3 It contains ammonium and carbonate ions

Ammonium carbonate is a white solid It dissolves in water It reacts with acids to make an ammonium salt and carbon dioxide It has a slight smell of ammonia It reacts with bases to make ammonia gas

Ammonium carbonate is made by reacting ammonium sulfate ammonium chloride and calcium carbonate in a furnace The ammonium carbonate is exposed to air to decompose any bicarbonate and then is sold It can also be made by reacting carbon dioxide with ammonia

It is used to make bread rise It can also be used in cough syrup

Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is NH4NO3 It contains ammonium and nitrate ions The nitrogen is in the 3 and 5 oxidation states

Ammonium nitrate is a colorless solid It dissolves in water It makes water cold when it dissolves It is an oxidizing agent When it is heated gently it turns into water and nitrous oxide It can detonate when heated strongly There were several disasters where ammonium nitrate exploded Ammonium nitrate fertilizers were banned in some places because they were used to make explosives

Ammonium nitrate is made by reacting ammonia with nitric acid This reaction is very violent It can be made by reacting sodium nitrate with ammonium sulfate This makes a solution of ammonium nitrate and sodium sulfate When the mixture is cooled the sodium sulfate is crystallized and can be filtered 

Ammonium nitrate is used as a fertilizer It contains more nitrogen than most fertilizers It is also used in explosives used by terrorists It can be used as an oxidizer in rockets 

Chlorine dioxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is ClO2 The Cl means 1 chlorine ion and the O2 means two oxide ions The chlorine is in its 4 oxidation state That means that when the chemical compound was made four electrons were taken from the chlorine and given to the oxygens

It is a yellowish gas It has a bad smell It can explode easily It reacts many other chemicals It explodes when it is more than 15 concentration in air When light is shined on it it can explode It dissolves easily in cold water 

It is made by oxidation of sodium chlorite by chlorine gas 

It can also be made by reduction of sodium chlorate in an acidic solution There are some reducing agents that can be used Methanol sulfur dioxide hydrochloric acid or hydrogen peroxide can be used 

There are even more ways to make chlorine dioxide Sodium chlorite can react with a mixture of sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid to make chlorine dioxide 

Sodium chlorite reacts with hydrochloric acid to make chlorine dioxide 

Electrolysis of a chlorite solution like sodium chlorite makes chlorine dioxide 

Chlorine dioxide can explode easily That is why it is normally made when it is needed It is not normally packaged and sent to people that need it

Chlorine dioxide is used to bleach wood pulp to make paper It can also be used to disinfect water There are some ways it is better than chlorine It is less corrosive than chlorine and does not make as many bad things in water 

Chlorine dioxide can explode easily It is toxic in large amounts

Chlorine compounds are chemical compounds containing chlorine ions Chlorine exists in several oxidation states 1 1 3 4 5 and 7

Normally these are chlorides Chlorides are unreactive and very common

Hypochlorites are the chemical compounds containing chlorine in its 1 oxidation state Only one is common They are strong oxidizing agents and unstable

Chlorites are in the 3 oxidation state 

Chlorine dioxide is one of the only chlorine compounds in the 4 oxidation state

Chlorates are the most common 5 chlorine compounds

Perchlorates are the most common 7 chlorine compounds

Aluminium compounds are chemical compounds containing aluminium ions

Potassium perchlorate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is KClO4 It contains potassium and perchlorate ions 

Potassium perchlorate is a colorless crystalline solid It dissolves in water only a little It is an oxidizing agent It can react with glucose to make carbon dioxide potassium chloride and water It can be mixed with sulfur while potassium chlorate cannot safely be mixed 

It is made by reacting potassium chloride with sodium perchlorate This makes the potassium perchlorate crystals

It is used as a rocket propellant It can also be used in fireworks and other explosives Ammonium perchlorate is used more though

The Pact of Steel or formally the Pact of Friendship and Alliance between Germany and Italy was an agreement between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany signed on May 22 1939 by the foreign ministers of each country and witnessed by Count Galeazzo Ciano for Italy and Joachim von Ribbentrop for Germany

There are two parts in the Pact The first section was the formal text which said that the two would continue helping each other while the second the two agreed to make their military and economy policies to be the same way It was said to be a Secret Supplementary Protocol 

The name of the Pact came from Italian leader Benito Mussolini who thought that its original name the Pact of Blood would likely less popular in Italy

A firing squad is a group of people with guns who shoot and kill a criminal who has been sentenced to death penalty The person being shot is often blindfolded Firing squads have often used in the military for crimes such as desertion and cowardice 

Few countries use firing squads anymore Many countries have either stopped using the death penalty or switched to using lethal injection For example in the United States the state of Utah used to use firing squads but it now uses lethal injection However some countries such as Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates still use firing squads

In computing an exception is an event that may change the program flow One layer of the system uses an exception to give another layer information about special states the system is currently in The different layers of software or hardware have contracts that tell what can be expected this is generally known as Programming by Contract In the context of exception handling a program is said to be exception safe if exceptions that occur will not produce side effects will not change stored data so that it becomes unreadable or generate output that is invalid There are different levels of exception safety

Time Spectrum Theory is a way of explaining the universe using mathematical models A model is a collection of mathematical equations and concepts that can be used to describe nature TST attempts to explain the universe by resolving issues regarding the direction of time in physics

Imagine you are playing an old video game At one point you are required to go up one ladder and only one ladder in order to continue the mission Now imagine that there are multiple ladders to choose all parallel to each other You can change position horizontally to change what ladder you will go up This is the basic idea behind Time Spectrum Theory

In TST time is treated like a two dimensional sheet rather than a one dimensional arrow This allows time to be treated like other dimensions such as length width and height In a video game you may only go up one ladder even though there are multiple ladders to go up Just like in the video game you may only travel along one time path although multiple paths exist

Treating time as a sheet allows physicists to treat time like a manifold thus resolving many issues in popular scientific theories

Robert Geoffrey Edwards is a British scientist who won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work in developing in vitro fertilisation This method is sometimes called making test tube babies He began work on his ideas in the 1950s and the first test tube baby Louise Brown was born on July 25 1978 His research partner from 1968 was Patrick Steptoe By 2010 more than 4 million babies had been born using the IVF method 

Edwards served in the military in World War II In 1948 after the war Edwards went to study at the University of Wales then to the University of Edinburgh in 1951 where he completed his PhD His studies had been on how embyros developed in mice He had a research position at the California Institute of Technology in 1957 In 1958 he returned to England and began work for the National Institute of Medical Research While at the Institute he began to study human fertilisation In 1962 he took a up a new job at the University of Glasgow but in 1963 went to Cambridge University In 1965 he went back to the US where he was a visiting scientist at John Hopkins University and later at the University of North Carolina he returned to Cambridge and taught physiology from 1969

While scientists had some success in fertilising rabbit eggs in a laboratory Edwards soon discovered that the process for humans was quite different and much more complex He spent many years studying the human egg and how it could best be fertilised by sperm outside the body He succeeded in fertilising an egg in 1969 but they did not develop Patrick Steptoe was a British gynecologist who had done a lot of work using a laparoscope to investigate the ovaries Using the laparoscope he was able to take eggs directly from the ovaries Edwards was able to use these eggs and successfully fertilize them in a test tube actually a cell culture dish This discovery caused a lot of debate and discussions about whether this sort of study should be allowed to continue

he developed in vitro fertilisation

Theodore Sturgeon was an American science fiction author 

He used a special writing style called rhythmic prose Prose writing tells a story but rhythmic writing is often poetry His prose text would fit into a standard poetry rhythm or meter This made subtle shift in mood Usually the reader would not notice how the timing of the words changed their feeling

His most famous novel is More Than Human

Sturgeon was born Edward Hamilton Waldo in Staten Island New York in 1918 His name was legally changed at age eleven after his mothers divorce and remarriage to William Dicky Sturgeon Theodore Sturgeon is occasionally misidentified as a pseudonym it was in fact his legal name

He sold his first story in 1938 to the McClure Syndicate which bought much of his early work his first genre appearance was Ether Breather in Astounding Science Fiction a year later At first he wrote mainly short stories primarily for genre magazines such as Astounding and Unknown but also for general interest publications such as Argosy Magazine He used the pen name E Waldo Hunter when two of his stories ran in the same issue of Astounding A few of his early stories were signed Theodore H Sturgeon

Sturgeon ghost wrote an Ellery Queen mystery novel The Player on the Other Side This novel gained critical praise from critic HRF Keating who had almost finished writing Crime and Mystery the 100 Best Books in which I had included The Player on the Other Side placing the book squarely in the Queen canon when he learned that it had been written by Sturgeon Similarly William DeAndrea author and winner of Mystery Writers of America awards selecting his ten favorite mystery novels for the magazine Armchair Detective picked The Player on the Other Side as one of them He said This book changed my life and made a raving mystery fan out of me The book must be one of the most skilful pastiches in the history of literature An amazing piece of work whomever did it

Sturgeon wrote the screenplays for the Star Trek episodes Shore Leave and Amok Time The latter is known for his invention of the pon farr the Vulcan mating ritual the first use of the sentence Live long and prosper and the first use of the Vulcan hand symbol Sturgeon also wrote several episodes of Star Trek that were never produced One of these was notable for having first introduced the Prime Directive He also wrote an episode of the Saturday morning show Land of the Lost The Pylon Express in 1975 Two of Sturgeons stories were adapted for The New Twilight Zone One A Saucer of Loneliness was broadcast in 1986 and was dedicated to his memory Another short story Yesterday was Monday was the inspiration for the The New Twilight Zone episode A Matter of Minutes His 1944 novella Killdozer was the inspiration for the 1970s made for TV movie Marvel comic book and alternative rock band of the same name

The Battle of Britain is the name given to the air campaign waged by the German Air Force against Britain during the summer and autumn of 1940 

The first objective of the campaign was to gain air superiority over the Royal Air Force especially Fighter Command 

The name comes from a famous speech delivered by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the House of Commons The Battle of France is over I expect the Battle of Britain is about to begin 

The Battle of Britain was the first major campaign to be fought entirely by air forces and was also the largest and most sustained aerial bombing campaign to that date 

From July 1940 coastal shipping convoys and shipping centres such as Portsmouth were the main targets A month later the Luftwaffe shifted its attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure As the battle progressed the Luftwaffe also targeted aircraft factories and ground infrastructure 

Coastal radar stations were bombed so that at one point only one radar mast was standing The British used a back up system of human observers to get information to the operational centres of Fighter Command Most historians agree this part of the campaign went in Germanys favour

Eventually the Luftwaffe switched to attacking population centres such as towns and cities as well as factories After the RAF bombed Berlin and German air force bases in France Adolf Hitler withdrew his directive not to bomb population centres and ordered attacks on British citiesp305 The attacks on civillians was terror bombing tactics designed to cause panic and damage morale 

On 7 September 1940 a massive series of raids with nearly four hundred bombers and more than six hundred fighters targeted docks on the Thames in London day and night 

The RAF 11 Group rose to meet them in greater numbers than the Luftwaffe expected 12 Groups Big Wing took twenty minutes to gain formation missing its intended target but encountering another formation of bombers while still climbing They returned apologetic about their limited success and blamed the delay on being requested too late 

The Luftwaffe began to abandon their morning raids with attacks on London starting late in the afternoon for 57 consecutive nights of attacks

Fighter Command had been at its lowest ebb short of men and machines and the break from airfield attacks allowed them to recover This meant that week by week the defenders were getting stronger and the losses suffered by the Lufwaffe were growing

On 15 September two massive waves of German attacks were decisively repulsed by the RAF with every aircraft of 11 Group being used on that day The total casualties on this critical day were 60 German and 26 RAF aircraft shot down The German defeat caused Hitler to order two days later the postponement of preparations for the invasion of Britain Henceforth in the face of mounting losses in men aircraft and the lack of adequate replacements the Luftwaffe switched from daylight to night time bombing

On 27 September a Junkers Ju 88 returning from a raid on London was shot down in Kent the last action between British and foreign military forces on British mainland soil

The keystone of the British defence was the detection command and control which ran the battle This was the Dowding System after its chief architect Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding the leader of RAF Fighter Command

The core of Dowdings system was the use of Radio Direction Finding Its use plus by information by the Royal Observer Corps was crucial It allowed the RAF to intercept incoming German aircraft Radar operators were linked via telephonep47 to an operational centre This centre was Fighter Command control at Bentley Priory During the Battle several Coastal Command and Fleet Air Arm units came under Fighter Command control

The Luftwaffes Messerschmitt Bf 109E and 110C squared up against the RAFs workhorse Hurricane Mk I and the less numerous Spitfire Mk I The Bf 109E had a better climb rate and was 10 to 30 mph faster than the Hurricane depending on altitudep266 In September 1940 the more powerful Mk IIa series 1 Hurricanes started entering service although only in small numbers This version was capable of a maximum speed of 342 mph some 25 to 30 mph faster than the Mk I

The performance of the Spitfire over Dunkirk came as a surprise although the German pilots retained a strong belief that the 109 was the superior fighter However the Bf 109E had a much larger turning circle than either the Hurricane or the Spitfire The two British fighters were equipped with eight Browning 303 machine guns while most Bf 109Es had two machine guns and two wing cannons The Bf 109E and the Spitfire were superior to each other in key areas for instance at some altitudes the Bf 109 could out climb the British fighter

The failure of Nazi Germany to achieve its objectives of destroying Britains air defences or forcing Britain to negotiate an armistice or an outright surrender is considered its first major defeat and one of the crucial turning points in the warp388 

If Germany had gained air superiority Adolf Hitler might have launched Operation Sea Lion a planned amphibious and airborne invasion of Britain

Thermite is an incendiary mixture It is not an explosive but can burn very fast and very hot

It is made of an oxide of a less reactive metal mixed with a more reactive metal One of the most common mixtures is iron oxide aluminium The iron oxide oxidizes the aluminium being reduced to iron in the process The aluminium is oxidized to aluminium oxide 

Many other metal oxides and metals can be used for thermite Some metals that can be used are boron magnesium calcium titanium zinc or silicon Some metal oxides that can be used are copper oxide chromium oxide iron oxide manganese oxide silicon dioxide boron trioxide or lead oxide A metal cannot be used with its metal oxide The metal has to be more reactive than the metal in the oxide or the thermite will not work 

The reaction for an aluminium iron oxide thermite is this

It is difficult to ignite thermite It needs to be very hot Ribbons of magnesium metal are used A mixture of potassium permanganate and glycerin can be used to ignite thermite It can be ignited by a flint lighter or a childs sparkler It can be mixed with sulfur to make thermate which makes it easier to melt the iron 

Contrary to popular opinion metals can burn They need to be powdered though or they will conduct the heat away too fast to start a fire 

The thermite reaction was discovered in 1893 German chemist Hans Goldschmidt patented it in 1895 People called it the Goldschmidt reaction or Goldschmidt process Goldschmidt was trying to make very pure metals without the use of carbon in smelting He soon discovered the value of thermite in welding It started to be used in the early 1900s to weld train tracks

Thermite is used for welding railroad rails together It is also used to make some metals Chromium can be made by a thermite reaction between chromium oxide and aluminium The first uranium was made by a thermite It is also used to weld wires together

Thermite was used in the military as an incendiary weapon It is mainly used to destroy buildings and equipment as it melts the metal easily Barium nitrate can be added to thermite to make an easier burning mixture This mixture is used in the military People dropped thousands of little bomblets containing thermite on cities starting fires everywhere

We may also use this because fireworks use it to explode

Thermite is not safe to make at home It releases ultraviolet light which can damage the eyes It also makes a very hot flame that can melt iron It is extremely difficult to extinguish Streams of molten iron can flow out of a thermite mixture igniting everything around it Some metals can boil and burst into flames when placed in thermite such as zinc If it is preheated then ignited thermite can burn very fast releasing a huge amount of heat and light If it is dropped in water it can boil water very fast making an explosion Dropping it on ice can make the ice explode

LED is an electronic device that emits light when sufficient current flows throughout the object

We know that in each diode there is a recombination of electrons and holes This recombination of electrons and holes releases some energy which is invisible in most of the diodes but in some diodes it is visible in the from of light When light is emitted on forward biasing of a P N junction than it is known as electroluminance In this way the frequency of emitted light from the diode may be in visible spectrum or in invisible spectrum Emitted light from the diode can be divided into two parts light which is visible to humans and light which is invisible to humans The frequency range visible to a normal man is 400nm to 700nm Light is generally coloured in this range The waves of light with wavelengths below 400nm are known as ultraviolet and waves of light with length greater than 700nm are known as infrared Light emitted from LED depends upon two factors

Coloured LEDS are generally used as indicator and light source for photo detectors Infrared and ultraviolet LEDS are used for transmitting invisible signals These are also used for photo detectors in the form of invisible light source In the remote control system infra red and ultraviolet LEDS are used generally LEDS which are used generally have the current capacity of 20mA and maximum forward voltage capacity of 16V LED emits light only when sufficient current flows through it On low current either no light or dim light will be received from the LED Red coloured LEDS are used for warning yellow green and orange coloured LEDS are used for other different purposes If these are used in parallel with the speakers than they glows according to the signal Now a days computerized display board which are used for advertisement have LEDS LEDS are also used in the graphic equalizer of a stereo audio system whenever it is to be used as supply indicator than a proper value resistance must be connected in series with it so that forward voltage and current can be controlled Otherwise the LEDS will become defective

Osteoarthritis normally affects older people it is the disease where joints wear out As the joint surface wears away it sheds particles which stimulate the joint lining to produce fluid This causes the knee to swell When the joint cartilage wears away the core of the bone becomes exposed The exposed bone rubs against other exposed bone 

Joints will be stiff and painful and may be swollen The pain may be worse after exercise You may find you cant move the joint as much or as easily as before

The First Indochina War was fought in French Indochina from December 19 1946 until August 1 1954 Other names for the war are the French Indochina War Anti French War Franco Vietnamese War Franco Vietminh War Indochina War Dirty War in France and Anti French Resistance War in contemporary Vietnam The war was fought between the French Unions French Far East Expeditionary Corps led by France and supported by Emperor Bo is Vietnamese National Army on one side and the Vit Minh led by H Ch Minh and V Nguyn Gip on the other Most of the fighting took place in Tonkin in Northern Vietnam but the conflict spread over the entire country and also extended into the neighboring French Indochina protectorates of Laos and Cambodia

The French reoccupied Indochina after the Second World War The territory had been part of the Empire of Japan before The Vit Minh launched a rebellion against the French authority The first few years of the war involved a low level rural insurgency against French authority However after the Chinese communists reached the Northern border of Vietnam in 1949 the conflict turned into a conventional war between two armies equipped with modern weapons supplied by the United States and the Soviet Union 

French Union forces included colonial troops from the whole former empire French professional troops and units of the French Foreign Legion The use of metropolitan recruits was forbidden by the governments to prevent the war from becoming even more unpopular at home It was called the dirty war by supporters of the Left in France and intellectuals during the Henri Martin Affair in 1950

The French had the stategy of pushing Vit Minh into attacking a well defended base in a remote part of the country at the end of the logistical trail This strategy was validated at the Battle of Na San The big problemsof the war was the lack of construction materials Because of difficult terrain witohut roads tanks could not be used and providing air cover was difficult This made it almost ipmossible to effectively defend the area

After the war the Geneva Conference on July 21 1954 made a provisional division of Vietnam at the 17th parallel The Vit Minh received control over the north in a territory called Democratic Republic of Vietnam under H Ch Minh The area south of the 17th parallel was turned into State of Vietnam under Emperor Bo i This was done to prevent H Ch Minh from gaining control of the entire country A year later Bo i would be deposed by his prime minister Ng nh Dim creating the Republic of Vietnam Diems refusal to enter into negotiations with North Vietnam about holding nationwide elections in 1956 as had been suggested by the Geneva Conference would eventually lead to war breaking out again in South Vietnam in 1959  the Second Indochina War

Piquet Jr raced in the GP2 Series in 2005 and 2006 He drove for the Renault Formula One team for the F12008 before being dropped midway through the F12009 season After losing his ride it was revealed that he had crashed on purpose at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix The crash helped his team mate Fernando Alonso win the race

Piquets parents separated soon after he was born He lived in Monaco with his Dutch mother Sylvia Tamsma until he was eight years old He then moved to Brazil with his father They kind of swapped me My mother wanted me to get to know my father she wanted me to know Brazil and the language and she realised life in Brazil would be better for a child Piquet has two sisters Kelly and Julia and four brothers Geraldo Laszlo Pedro and Marco He lived in Braslia and attended the American School of Braslia When he was 16 years old he decided to pursue his racing career full time

Piquets racing career started in 1993 in Brazilian karting In 2001 when he moved to Formula Three Sudamericana He raced in part of the 2001 season and won the 2002 championship In 2002 he also entered one race of the Brazilian Formula Renault series

In 2003 Piquet moved to the UK and joined the British Formula Three Championship He went on to finish the championship in third place with six wins five podiums and eight pole positions A test with the Williams Formula One team followed

In 2004 Piquet won the British Formula Three Championship He became the youngest driver to win the championship at 19 years and 2 months

In 2005 Piquet took part in the A1 Grand Prix for A1 Team Brazil He won both the Sprint and Main races at the 2005 06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations Great Britain the first ever A1 race He also set the fastest lap He drove in the GP2 Series winning his first race at Spa Francorchamps in Belgium and tested for the BAR Honda Formula 1 team

In 2006 Piquet was second in the GP2 championship to Lewis Hamilton

Throughout hes eary careet Piquet was able to race for his own team His father purchased the teams he raced for

During the 2007 season he was the official test and reserve driver for the Renault Formula One team For 2008 season Piquet was promoted to the Renault race team He drove alongside returning double World Champion Fernando Alonso 

The first race of the 2008 season in Australia saw Piquet start 21st and damage his car in a collision on the opening lap He finally retired on lap 31 This was exactly the same result as his father achieved in his first race at the F11978 German Grand Prix Piquet qualified in 10th for the Spanish Grand Prix his first top 10 qualifying position of his career Piquet scored his first points in F1 with a 7th place finish at the French Grand Prix He passed his team mate Alonso in the last few laps At the German Grand Prix finished in second place and his first podium finish

The Battle of Pharsalus was the decisive battle of Caesars Civil War On 9 August 48 BC at Pharsalus in central Greece Gaius Julius Caesar and his allies formed up opposite the army of the republic under the command of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus Pompey had the backing of a majority of senators and his army significantly outnumbered the experienced Caesarian legions

Although Pompey had a larger army he knew that Caesars troops were more experienced and might win in a pitched battle Instead Pompey waited Caesars troops out attempting to starve them by cutting off Caesars supply lines Caesar made a near disastrous attack on Pompeys camp and was forced to pull away to regroup

Pompey did not immediately follow up on his success An indecisive winter of blockade and siege followed Pompey eventually pushed Caesar into Thessaly and urged on by his senatorial allies he confronted Caesar near Pharsalus Pompeys allies disagreed with Pompey over whether to fight at Pharsalus Pompey who wanted to starve Caesars soldiers had his hand forced by his allies

There was significant distance between the two armies according to Caesar Pompey ordered his men not to charge but to wait until Caesars legions came into close quarters The idea was to tire Caesars men before the battle started

Seeing that Pompeys army was not advancing Caesars men without orders stopped to rest and regroup before continuing the charge Caesar in his history of the war would praise his own mens discipline and experience and questioned Pompeys decision not to charge

When the lines joined Labienus ordered the cavalry to attack At first they did well then Caesar ordered his cavalry to withdraw Light troops fiercely attacked Pompeys cavalry The first line of the Pompeiian horse were panicked by the cohorts javelins and caused the entire cavalry to fall into disorder When the cavalry retreated Caesars men slaughtered the light troops who supported them They attacked Pompeys left flank and rejoined by their cavalry were able to get behind and attack Pompeys army from the rear Caesar raised the pressure further by ordering his as yet uninvolved third line to relieve the front ranks The remaining Pompeiian soldiers fled and soon the main battle was done

Pompey retreated to his camp and ordered the garrison to defend it Caesar urged his men to capture the enemy camp They furiously attacked the walls The Thracians and the other auxiliaries who were left in the camp defended bravely but they were not able to fend off the enemy assault Pompey fled with a group claiming that he had been betrayed Caesar had won his greatest victory having lost only about 200 soldiers and 30 centurions 

Pompey fled from Pharsalus to Egypt where he was assassinated on the order of Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII Ptolemy XIII sent Pompeys head to Caesar in an effort to win his favor but Caesar was not pleased with the gift Pompey was the widower of Caesars only daughter Nor did Ptolemy take into account that Caesar was granting amnesty to many of the senators and their men men who once considered him an enemy 

The Battle of Pharsalus ended the wars of the First Triumvirate The Roman Civil War however was not ended Pompeys two sons and the Pompeian faction led now by Labienus survived and fought their cause in the name of Pompey the Great Caesar spent the next few years mopping up remnants of the senatorial faction After finally completing this task he was assassinated in a conspiracy arranged by Brutus and Cassius

The Battle of Philippi was the final battle in the Wars of the Second Triumvirate between the forces of Mark Antony and Octavian against the forces of Julius Caesars assassins Brutus and Cassius in 42 BC at Philippi in the Roman province of Macedonia The Second Triumvirate declared this civil war to avenge Julius Caesars murder

The battle consisted of two engagements in the plain west of the ancient city of Philippi The first occurred on the first week of October Brutus faced Octavian while Antonys forces were up against those of Cassius 

At first Brutus pushed back Octavian and entered his legions camp But to the south Cassius was defeated by Antony and committed suicide after hearing a false report that Brutus had also failed Brutus rallied Cassius remaining troops and both sides ordered their army to retreat to their camps with their spoils The battle was essentially a draw but for Cassius suicide This deprived the Liberatores of their best commander

A second encounter on 23 October finished off Brutuss forces and he committed suicide in turn leaving the triumvirate in control of the Roman Republic The Battle of Philippi marked the highest point of Antonys career at that time he was the most famous Roman general and the senior partner of the Second Triumvirate Antonys life was defined in this moment

A Galileo thermometer or Galilean thermometer is a thermometer that uses the density of liquids to measure temperature The thermometer was invented by Galileo Galilei who had noticed that the density of a liquid changes with temperature The thermometer is made of a glass container filled with a liquid Inside there are other containers usually with other liquids When the temperature changes so does the density of the container liquid As a consequence the smaller containers may fall to the floor or rise to the surface

Usually such thermometers are calibrated to either 2 or 1 The temperature is then that of the bulb with the lowest temperature floating above

Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers also known as The Heartbreakers were an American rock band They formed in New York in May 1975 They were one of the first punk rock bands One of their most popular songs was called Chinese Rocks Dee Dee Ramone and Richard Hell wrote this song about heroin in 1976

Johnny Thunders and Jerry Nolan had quit the New York Dolls That same week Richard Hell was kicked out of Television The three musicians joined to make the new band After a few shows Walter Lure from a group called The Demons joined the band also In 1976 Hell left group He was replaced by Billy Rath Hell went on to form his own band The Voidoids

The Heartbreakers came to Europe to tour just as the UK punk scene was growing The Heartbreakers got many fans by playing in and around London The Sex Pistols invited them to play first on the Anarchy Tour Many things went wrong on this tour

They soon signed a contract with Track Records Their debutand onlystudio album LAMF had all the Heartbreakers popular live songs Making and selling this album caused problems for the band Some band members were angry about the poor quality of the sound Several members of the band left at this point The Heartbreakers reformed in 1979 for a few goodbye shows at Maxs Kansas City with drummer Ty Stix replacing Nolan These shows were recorded and became the album Live at Maxs Kansas City 79 The Heartbreakers song London Boys insulted the Sex Pistols This was to answer the Sex Pistols song New York that insulted the New York Dolls

The band got back together sometimes to play at New York clubs until Johnny Thunders died in 1991 Jerry Nolan died in 1992 These live shows often had songs from the New York Dolls or from Thunders solo career Hell rarely plays music live concentrating instead on writing and spoken word performances Lure became a stockbroker on Wall St but still performs once in a while when he is not working at his regular job In 2007 Lure went on a short European tour

The Battle of Actium decided the final war of the Roman Republic It was fought between the forces of Octavian and the combined forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra 

The battle took place on 2 September 31 BC on the Ionian Sea near the Roman colony of Actium in Greece Octavians fleet was commanded by Agrippa while Antonys fleet was supported by the ships of his lover Queen Cleopatra of Egypt

Octavians victory enabled him to consolidate his power over Rome and its dominions To that end he adopted the title of Princeps As a result of the victory he was awarded the title of Augustus by the Roman Senate 

As Augustus he would keep the trappings of a restored Republican leader However historians view this as the end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire

Intellectual disability is a permanent condition There are different definitions of what is considered an intellectual disability In general these definitions consider two main factors

The cause of such an illness usually lies in childhood or in genetic disorders Intellectual disability is different from dementia In dementia people forget things and they lose skills they once had People with an intellectual disability never learn those skills 

There is currently no cure Those affected can learn to cope and do many things if they get enough support and are taught well There are no specific drugs that can be taken to treat the condition Many people with an intellectual disability have other health problems for which they will be given specific drugs As an example autisic children with developmental delay may use anti psychotics or mood stabilizers to help with behavior Giving drugs to intellectual disability people needs to be monitored side effects often occur and are wrongly diagnosed as problems with behaviour or as psychiatric problems

Gaius Cassius Longinus was a Roman Senator a leader of the plot to kill Julius Caesar and the brother in law of Brutus

Little is known of Gaius Cassiuss early life He studied philosophy at Rhodes and became fluent in Greek He was married to Tertulla who was a half sister of his co conspirator Brutus They had one son

Cassiuss first office was as quaestor under Marcus Licinius Crassus in 53 BC and he proved a good military leader He travelled with Crassus to the province of Syria and attempted to dissuade him from attacking Parthia suggesting that they secure a base at the Euphrates 

Crassus ignored Cassius and led the army into the Battle of Carrhae during which he also ignored Cassius plans for strengthening the Roman line The result was the most famous Roman rout since the Second Punic War

Cassius managed to save the remnants of the army with the help of Crassus legate Gaius Octavius Crassus was killed but Cassius managed to escape with 500 cavalry and meet up with the surviving legionaries

For two years afterwards Cassius governed the province of Syria as Proquaestor defending the border against Parthian incursions until the new proconsul arrived The last incursion resulted in the death of the Parthian commander Osaces and split the Parthian troops Cicero then governor of Cilicia sent Cassius a note of congratulations for the victory

Cassius returned to Rome two years later The outbreak of the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great saved Cassius from being brought to trial by his enemies for extortion in Syria Cassius was elected Tribune of the Plebs in 49 BC and threw in his lot with Pompey fleeing Italy as Caesar crossed the Rubicon He met Pompey in Greece and was made commander of his fleet

In 48 BC Cassius sailed his ships to Sicilia where he attacked and burned a large part of Caesars navy He then proceeded to harass ships off the Italian coast News of Pompeys defeat at the Battle of Pharsalus caused Cassius to head for the Hellespont Cassius was overtaken by Caesar en route and was forced to surrender unconditionally

Caesar made Cassius a legate employing him in the North Africa but Cassius refused to join in the fight against Cato and Scipio in Africa choosing instead to retire to Rome

Cassius spent the next two years without office and apparently tightened his friendship with Cicero In 44 BC he became praetor peregrinus with the promise of the Syrian province for the ensuing year The appointment of his junior Brutus as praetor urbanus deeply offended him

Although Cassius was the moving spirit in the plot against Caesar winning over the chief assassins Brutus became their leader On the Ides of March 44 BC Cassius urged on his fellow liberators and struck Caesar in the face He and his fellow conspirators referred to themselves as the Liberators

Although they succeeded in assassinating Caesar the celebration was short lived Mark Antony seized power and turned the public against them In letters written during 44 BC Cicero frequently complains that Rome was still subjected to tyranny because the Liberators had failed to kill Antony According to some accounts Cassius had wanted to kill Antony at the same time as Caesar but was dissuaded by Brutus

Cassiuss reputation in the East made it easy to amass an army from other governors in the area By this point the Senate had split with Antony and cast its lot with Cassius making him as governor of Syria Cassius was now secure enough to march on Egypt but on the formation of the triumvirate Brutus requested his assistance Cassius quickly joined Brutus in Smyrna with most of his army leaving his nephew behind to govern Syria

The conspirators decided to attack the triumviris allies in Asia Cassius set upon and sacked Rhodes while Brutus did the same to Lycia They regrouped the following year in Sardis where their armies proclaimed them emperor They crossed the Hellespont marched through Thrace and encamped near Philippi in Macedon 

Octavian and Mark Antony soon arrived Cassius planned to starve them out by using his superior position in the country However they were forced into a pair of battles by Antony in the Battle of Philippi Brutus was successful against Octavian and took his camp Cassius however was defeated and overrun by Antony Cassius unaware of Brutus victory committed suicide He was mourned by Brutus as the Last of the Romans Brutus like Octavian was not an experienced military commander and ten days later Antony completed the victory Brutus also committed suicide

Among that select band of philosophers who have managed to change the world writes David Sedley it would be hard to find a pair with a higher public profile than Brutus and Cassius brothers in law fellow assassins and Shakespearian heroes adding that it may not even be widely known that they were philosophers

Cassius converted to the school of thought founded by Epicurus Arnaldo Momigliano called Cassius conversion a conspicuous date in the history of Roman Epicureanism a choice made not to enjoy the pleasures of the Garden but to provide a philosophical justification for assassinating a tyrant

The inconsistencies between traditional Epicureanism and an active approach to securing freedom could not be resolved and during the Empire the philosophy of political opposition tended to be Stoic This circumstance Momigliano argues helps explain why historians of the Imperial era found Cassius more difficult to understand than Brutus and less admirable

In Dantes Inferno Cassius is one of three people deemed sinful enough to be chewed in one of the three mouths of Satan in the very center of Hell for all eternity as a punishment for killing Julius Caesar The other two are Brutus his fellow conspirator and Judas Iscariot the Biblical betrayer of Jesus Christ In Shakespeares play Julius Caesar he is depicted as a ruthless manipulator Caesar says of him Yon Cassius has a lean and hungry look He thinks too much such men are dangerous

A braided river is a network of small channels separated by islands that are often not fixed They can be found in places where the river carries a lot of sediment or when it quickly slows down and spreads out like in a river delta

Large braided river systems are found in only a few places around the world

All these regions contain young mountains that face quick erosion

Europe contains two braided rivers the Narew in Poland and Belarus and the Tagliamento in northeastern Italy

Marcus Junius Brutus usually referred to as Brutus was a politician of the late Roman Republic He is best known for his leading role in the assassination of Julius Caesar

Brutus father was killed by Pompey the Great after he had taken part in the rebellion of Lepidus His mother was the half sister of Cato the Younger and later became Julius Caesars mistress Some sources refer to the possibility of Caesar being his real father His uncle adopted him in about 59 BC 

Brutus held his uncle in high regard and his political career started when he became an assistant to Cato during his governorship of Cyprus During this time he enriched himself by lending money at high rates of interest He returned to Rome a rich man where he married Claudia Pulchra From his first appearance in the Senate Brutus aligned with the Optimates against the First Triumvirate of Marcus Licinius Crassus Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus and Gaius Julius Caesar

When civil war broke out in 49 BC between Pompey and Caesar Brutus followed his old enemy and present leader of the Optimates Pompey When the Battle of Pharsalus began Caesar ordered his officers to take him prisoner if he gave himself up voluntarily and if he persisted in fighting against capture to let him alone and do him no violence 

After the disaster of the Battle of Pharsalus Brutus wrote to Caesar with apologies and Caesar immediately forgave him Caesar then accepted him into his inner circle and made him governor of Gaul when he left for Africa in pursuit of Cato and Scipio In 45 BC Caesar nominated Brutus to serve as urban praetor for the following year

Also in June 45 BC Brutus divorced his wife and married his first cousin Porcia Catonis Catos daughter According to Cicero the marriage caused a semi scandal as Brutus failed to state a valid reason for his divorce from Claudia other than he wished to marry Porcia The marriage also caused a rift between Brutus and his mother who resented the affection Brutus had for Porcia

Around this time many senators began to fear Caesars growing power following his appointment as Dictator for life Brutus was persuaded into joining the conspiracy against Caesar by the other senators Eventually Brutus decided to move against Caesar his wife was the only woman who knew about the plot

The conspirators planned to carry out their plot on the Ides of March that same year On that day Caesar was delayed going to the Senate because his wife tried to convince him not to go The conspirators feared the plot had been found out Brutus persisted however waiting for Caesar at the Senate and allegedly still chose to remain even when a messenger brought him news that would otherwise have caused him to leave When Caesar finally did come to the Senate they attacked him The conspirators attacked in such numbers that they even wounded one another Brutus is said to have been wounded in the hand

After the assassination the Senate passed an amnesty on the assassins This amnesty was proposed by Caesars friend and co consul Mark Antony Nonetheless uproar among the people caused Brutus and the conspirators to leave Rome Brutus settled in Crete from 44 to 42 BC

In 43 BC after Octavian received his consulship from the Senate one of his first actions was to have the people that had assassinated Julius Caesar declared murderers and enemies of the state Cicero angry at Octavian wrote a letter to Brutus explaining that the forces of Octavian and Mark Antony were divided Antony had laid siege to the province of Gaul where he wanted the governorship In response to this siege Octavian rallied his troops and fought a series of battles in which Antony was defeated Upon hearing that neither Antonius nor Octavian had an army big enough to defend Rome Brutus rallied his troops which totaled about 17 legions 

When Octavian heard that Brutus was on his way to Rome he made peace with Antony Their armies which together totaled about 19 legions marched to meet Brutus and Cassius The two sides met in two engagements known as the Battle of Philippi The first was fought on 3 October 42 BC in which Brutus defeated Octavians forces Cassius was defeated by Antony and committed suicide because he thought Brutus had also failed 

The second engagement was fought on 23 October 42 BC and ended in Brutus defeat After the defeat he fled into the nearby hills with only about four legions Knowing his army had been defeated and that he would be captured Brutus committed suicide 

Antony as a show of respect ordered Brutus body to be wrapped in his most expensive purple mantle Brutus was cremated and his ashes were sent to his mother

The well known phrase Et tu Brute is famous as Caesars last utterance in Shakespeares play Julius Caesar

The Indian rupee is the official currency of the Republic of India The issuance of the currency is controlled by the Reserve Bank of India Before July 2010 the rupee was abbreviated as Rs During the past 15 years the value has ranged from 1 USD 3549 INR or 1 euro 4468 INR

The modern rupee is sub divided into 100 paise The coins have common values of 5 10 20 25 and 50 paise as well as 1 2 5 and 10 rupees The bank notes are available in values of 1 2 5 10 20 50 100 500 and 1000 rupees The Indian rupee symbol is an amalgam of both the Devanagari consonant and the Latin letter R without the vertical bar The design was presented to the public by the government of India on 15 July 2010 Previously the abbreviation Rs was used

The word rupee is derived from the Sanskrit word meaning silver or made of silver Many Indian languages use this root word for example  in Telugu in Tamil in Hindi in Gujarati in Kannada and Tulu in Malayalam and in Marathi However in West Bengal Tripura Mizoram Orissa and Assam the Indian rupee is officially known by names derived from the Sanskrit word which means money Thus the rupee is called in Bengali in Assamese and in Oriya and is written as such on Indian banknotes

On March 5 2009 the Government of India announced a contest to create a symbol for the rupee During the 2010 Union budget of India Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee mentioned that the proposed symbol would reflect and capture the Indian ethos and culture Five symbols were shortlisted and the Cabinet selected the definitive symbol created by D Udaya Kumar on July 15 2010 The symbol is derived from a combination of the Devanagari letter and English letter R The parallel lines at the top make an allusion to the tricolor and also depict an equality sign which symbolizes the nations desire to reduce economic disparity The Indian government has plans to adopt the symbol within six months in the country and globally within 18 to 24 months Before the adoption of the symbol the most commonly used symbols for the rupee were Rs Re or if the text was in an Indian language then an appropriate abbreviation in that language

In Indian English values at or above a hundred thousand Indian rupees are counted in terms of lakhs and crores For example the amount 3258472925 is read as three crores twenty five lakhs eighty four thousand seven hundred and twenty nine rupees and twenty five paise The use of million or billion as is standard in American or British English is not very common

India was one of the earliest issuers of coins The first rupee is believed to have been introduced by Sher Shah Suri based on a ratio of 40 copper pieces per rupee Among the earliest issues of paper rupees were those by the Bank of Hindustan the General Bank of Bengal and Bihar and the Bengal Bank amongst others Until 1815 the Madras Presidency also issued a currency based on the fanam with 12 fanams equal to the rupee

Historically the rupee derived from the Sanskrit word raupya which means silver was a silver coin This had severe consequences in the nineteenth century when the strongest economies in the world were on the gold standard The discovery of vast quantities of silver in the US and various European colonies resulted in a decline in the relative value of silver to gold Suddenly the standard currency of India could not buy as much from the outside world This event was known as the fall of the rupee

India was not affected by the imperial order in council of 1825 that attempted to introduce the British sterling coinage to the British colonies British India at that time was controlled by the British East India Company The silver rupee continued as the currency of India throughout the entire period of the British Raj and beyond In 1835 British India set itself firmly upon a mono metallic silver standard based on the rupee His decision was influenced by a letter written in the year 1805 by Lord Liverpool that extolled the virtues of mono metallism

Following the Indian Mutiny in 1857 the British government took direct control of British India Since 1851 gold sovereigns were being produced in large numbers at the Royal Mint branch in Sydney New South Wales In the year 1864 in an attempt to make the British gold sovereign become the imperial coin the treasuries in Bombay and Calcutta were instructed to receive gold sovereigns These gold sovereigns however never left the vaults As was realized in the previous decade in Canada and the next year in Hong Kong existing habits are not easy to replace And just as the British government had finally given up any hopes of replacing the rupee in India with the pound sterling they simultaneously realized and for the same reasons that they couldnt easily replace the silver dollar in the Straits Settlements with the Indian rupee as had been the desire of the British East India Company

Since the great silver crisis of 1873 a growing number of nations had been adopting the gold standard In 1898 following the recommendations of the Indian Currency Committee British India officially adopted the gold exchange standard by pegging the rupee to the British pound sterling at a fixed value of 1 shilling 4 pence In 1920 the actual silver value of the rupee was increased in value to 2 shillings In British East Africa at this time the decision was made to replace the rupee with a florin No such opportunity was however taken in British India

In 1927 the peg was once more reduced this time to 18 pence This peg was maintained until 1966 when the rupee was devalued and pegged to the US dollar at a rate of 75 rupees 1 dollar This peg lasted until the US dollar devalued in 1971

The Indian rupee replaced the Danish Indian rupee in 1845 the French Indian rupee in 1954 and the Portuguese Indian escudo in 1961 Following independence in 1947 the Indian rupee replaced all the currencies of the previously autonomous states Some of these states had issued rupees equal to those issued by the British Other currencies included the Hyderabad rupee and the Kutch kori The nominal values during British rule were

In East Africa Arabia and Mesopotamia the Rupee and its related coins were current at various times The usage of the Rupee in East Africa extended from Somalia in the north to as far south as Natal In Mozambique the British India rupees were overstamped In Kenya the British East Africa Company minted the rupee and its fractions as well as pice The rise in the price of silver immediately after the First World War caused the rupee to rise in value to two shillings sterling In 1920 in British East Africa the opportunity was then taken to introduce a new florin coin hence bringing the currency into line with sterling Shortly after that the Florin was split into two East African shillings This assimilation to sterling did not however happen in British India itself In Somalia the Italian colonial authority minted rupia to the exact same standard and called the pice besa

The Straits Settlements were originally an outlier of the British East India Company The Spanish dollar had already taken hold in the Straits Settlements by the time the British arrived in the nineteenth century however the East India Company tried to introduce the rupee in its place These attempts were resisted by the locals and by 1867 when the British government took over direct control of the Straits Settlements from the East India Company attempts to introduce the rupee were finally abandoned

With Partition the Pakistani rupee came into existence initially using Indian coins and Indian currency notes simply overstamped with Pakistan In previous times the Indian rupee was an official currency of other countries including Aden Oman Kuwait Bahrain Qatar the Trucial States Kenya Tanganyika Uganda the Seychelles and Mauritius

The Indian government introduced the Gulf rupee also known as the Persian Gulf rupee as a replacement for the Indian rupee for circulation exclusively outside the country with the Reserve Bank of India Amendment Act 1 May 1959 This creation of a separate currency was an attempt to reduce the strain put on Indias foreign reserves by gold smuggling After India devalued the rupee on 6 June 1966 those countries still using it Oman Qatar and the Trucial States replaced the Gulf rupee with their own currencies Kuwait and Bahrain had already done so in 1961 and 1965 respectively

The Bhutanese ngultrum is pegged at par with the Indian rupee and both currencies are accepted in Bhutan The Indian rupee is also accepted in towns in Nepal which lie near the border with India However the Indian Rupee denominations of 500 and 1000 are banned in Nepal

Officially the Indian rupee has a market set exchange rate However the RBI trades actively in the USDINR currency market to impact effective exchange rates Thus the currency regime in place for the Indian rupee with respect to the US dollar is a de facto controlled exchange rate This is sometimes called a managed float Other rates such as the EURINR and INRJPY have volatilities that are typical of floating exchange rates It should be noted however that unlike China successive administrations have not followed a policy of pegging the INR to a specific foreign currency at a particular exchange rate RBI intervention in currency markets is solely to deliver low volatility in the exchange rates and not to take a view on the rate or direction of the Indian rupee in relation to other currencies

Also affecting convertibility is a series of customs regulations restricting the import and export of rupees Legally foreign nationals are forbidden from importing or exporting rupees while Indian nationals can import and export only up to 5000 rupees at a time and the possession of 500 and 1000 rupee notes in Nepal is prohibited

RBI also exercises a system of capital controls in addition to the intervention in the currency markets On the current account there are no currency conversion restrictions hindering buying or selling foreign exchange On the capital account foreign institutional investors have convertibility to bring money in and out of the country and buy securities Local firms are able to take capital out of the country in order to expand globally But local households are restricted in their ability to do global diversification However owing to an enormous expansion of the current account and the capital account India is increasingly moving towards de facto full convertibility

There is some confusion regarding the interchange of the currency with gold but the system that India follows is that money cannot be exchanged for gold in any circumstances or any situation Money cannot be changed into gold by the RBI This is because it will become difficult to handle it India follows the same gold interchange principle as Great Britain and America

The CategoryISO standards has pages about standards set by the International Organization for Standardization

ISO 4217 is the international standard describing three letter codes to define the names of currencies as established by the International Organization for Standardization The ISO 4217 code list is the common way in banking and business all over the world for defining different currencies In many countries the codes for the more common currencies are so well known by the general public that exchange rates written in newspapers or posted in banks use only those codes to define the different currencies instead of translated currency names or currency symbols ISO 4217 codes are used on airline tickets and international train tickets to remove any uncertainty about the price

The first two letters of the code are the two letters of ISO 3166 1 alpha 2 country codes The third letter is usually the initial of the currency itself So Japans currency code is JPY JP for Japan and Y for yen This eliminates the problem caused by the names dollar franc and pound being used in dozens of different countries each having significantly differing values Also if a currency is revalued the currency codes last letter is changed to distinguish it from the old currency In some cases the third letter is the initial for new in that countrys language to distinguish it from an older currency that was revalued the code sometimes outlasts the usage of the term new itself Other changes can be seen however the Russian ruble for example changed from RUR to RUB where the B comes from the third letter in the word ruble

There is also a three digit code number assigned to each currency in the same manner as there is also a three digit code number assigned to each country as part of ISO 3166 This numeric code is usually the same as the ISO 3166 1 numeric code For example USD has code 840 which is also the numeric code for the US

The standard also defines the relationship between the major currency unit and any minor currency unit Often the minor currency unit has a value that is 1100 of the major unit but 11000 is also common Some currencies do not have any minor currency unit at all In others the major currency unit has so little value that the minor unit is no longer generally used This is indicated in the standard by the currency exponent For example USD has exponent 2 while JPY has exponent 0 Mauritania does not use a decimal division of units setting 1 ouguiya 5 khoums and Madagascar has 1 ariary 5 iraimbilanja

ISO 4217 includes codes not only for currencies but also for precious metals and certain other entities used in international finance eg Special Drawing Rights There are also special codes allocated for testing purposes and to indicate no currency transactions These codes all begin with the letter X The precious metals use X plus the metals chemical symbol silver for example is XAG ISO 3166 never assigns country codes beginning with X these codes being assigned for privately customized use onlyfor instance the ISO 3166 based NATO country codes use X codes for imaginary exercise countries ranging from XXB for Brownland to XXR for Redland as well as for major commands such as XXE for SHAPE or XXS for SACLANT Consequently ISO 4217 can use X codes for non country specific currencies without risk of clashing with future country codes

Supranational currencies such as the East Caribbean dollar the CFP franc the CFA franc BEAC and the CFA franc BCEAO are normally also represented by codes beginning with an X The euro is represented by the code EUR The predecessor to the euro the European Currency Unit had the code XEU

In 1973 the ISO Technical Committee 68 decided to develop codes for the representation of currencies and funds for use in any application of trade commerce or banking At the 17th session of the related UNECE Group of Experts agreed that the three letter alphabetic codes for International Standard ISO 4217 Codes for the representation of currencies and funds would be suitable for use in international trade

Over time new currencies are created and old currencies are discontinued Frequently these changes are due to new governments treaties between countries standardizing on a currency or revaluation of the currency due to excessive inflation As a result the list of codes must be updated from time to time The ISO 4217 maintenance agency SIX Interbank Clearing is responsible for maintaining the list of codes

The following is a list of active codes of official ISO 4217 currency names

The following is a list of active unofficial codes that emulate the ISO 4217 format

The US dollar actually has three codes assigned USD USS and USN According to UNCEFACT recommendation 9 paragraphs 8 9 ECETRADE203 1996 available online

A number of territories are not included in ISO 4217 because their currencies are not per se an independent currency but a variant of another currency a legal tender only issued as commemorative banknotes andor coinage or a currency of an unrecognized or partially recognized state These currencies are

The following non ISO codes are however sometimes used commercially

A number of currencies were official ISO 4217 currency codes and currency names until their replacement by the euro or other currencies

Note that the currency names used below may not match the currency names used in the ISO standard itself but the codes do match

Terrestrial locomotion has evolved as animals adapted from aquatic to terrestrial places Movement on land makes different problems than that on water with less friction instead being the effects of gravity

There are three basic forms of movement found among land animals

Movement on legs is the most common form of land movement It is the simple form of movement of two big groups with many members the vertebrates and the arthropods

There are a number of land and amphibious limbless vertebrates and invertebrates These animals due to lack of legs use their bodies to move These movements are sometimes called to as slithering or crawling

Although animals have never have wheels for locomotion some animals will move by rolling their whole body

The fastest terrestrial animal is the cheetah which can get speeds of about 104 kmh

This category contains the names of the caliphs of the Muslim Empire

Qualitative chemistry is about the chemical reactions used to find out what an unknown chemical is Qualitative chemistry is used in many jobs It is very useful for testing for drugs and poisons

Many reactions are used in qualitative chemistry For example fire or sodium hydroxide can be used to learn what metals are in the compound The scientist would know what metal was in an unknown compound by the colour of the flame silver nitrate can show what group seven ions are in a compound

Qualitative chemistry can be easily confused with Quantitative chemistry

An elephant gun is a large caliber gun which could be a rifle Elephant guns were first made to be used by big game hunters who were hunting elephants and other large animals 

As people from Europe began exploring Africa in the early 1800s guns were made to handle the very large animals that people saw This was for people to protect themselves to shoot animals for food and later and most commonly sport The first guns were the simple shotgun designs already used for birds They were loaded with solid balls of lead that could shoot long animals Because they did not kill large animals very easily elephant guns were soon made into larger caliber black powder smoothbores The caliber was still measured in bore or gauge  or the guns were named by how much the projectiles weighed in ounces The projectiles were lead round balls or short slugs shaped like cones Sometimes antimony was put in them to make them harder

These very large and heavy firearms were the first to be known as the elephant guns of the black powder era They were not only used to kill elephants They were also used to kill dangerous animals such as the rhinoceros the hippopotamus and the cape buffalo Because black powder and lead cannot go faster than about convert1500fts  the only way to make the projectiles go deeper into the animals skins was to make a larger gun Although they were very powerful the short slugs which did not go very fast still had problems going fully into their targets This was especially hard for the toughest shot of all  going through the bone when an elephants head was shot around the brain area 

Nitro Express elephant guns were first made around 1895 They used smokeless powder which was new at the time With smaller metal cased bullets with sizes from 400 to 620 and speeds around convert2000ftsabbron they had a much better trajectory and penetration over the black powder guns In a few years the big bore guns disappeared from the gamefields The safari heyday of the early 20th century Nitro era records much writing on such calibres as the 577 Nitro Express 375 HH Magnum 416 Rigby 404 Jeffery 505 Gibbs 450 Nitro Express 470 Nitro Express and many others These rifles came out in single shot bolt action and double rifle ways and was used until ivory hunting died off in the mid 20th century Then the guns switched roles to tools for game wardens and as backup firearms for professional hunters guiding international hunters

The American gun market made several famous dangerous gun cartridges around this time such as the 458 Winchester Magnum 378 Weatherby Magnum and 460 Weatherby Magnum Many of these were wildcatted The rest of the old Nitro express calibers faded to obscurity until people starting safari hunting in the 1970s and 1980s Then elephant guns like the 416 Weatherby Magnum and the 416 Remington Magnum were made again The 700 Nitro Express and the new brass manufacturers made even more powerful elephant guns such as the 585 Nyati by Ross Seyfried 577 Tyrannosaur by Colonel Art Alphin and 585 Gehringer by Karl Gehringer to be made by wildcatters The 600 Overkill made by Rob Garnick shows the biggest power that could come from from a standard hunting action Other wildcats based on the heavy machine gun 50 BMG and similar anti materiel rounds have been devised which are much more powerful though they are not generally useful hunting arms because they are heavier than convert25lbabbron

All elephant guns have one idea in common to have enough stopping power to prevent harm to the hunter in the case of charging game The necessities for the gun are not only very high power but that it can be carried for long periods shot from any position and be well balanced enough to track on rapidly moving animals It is really no more than a very big hunting rifle with the same use as any hunting rifle

During World War I both the British and Germans used elephant gunsCitation neededdateSeptember 2008 taken from their African colonies when they tried to break the stalemate in the trenches The British used elephant guns as a means of getting around the German tactic of having their snipers advance towards Allied lines under the cover of a large 6 10 millimeter thick steel plate Though normal guns didnt do anything to the plate the elephant guns had enough force to punch through it Likewise the Germans used a mass produced anti tank rifle the Mauser 1918 TuF Gewehr to knock out lightly armored British tanks

During the African campaign of World War II in 1941 the Italians in East Africa fought against the British The Commander  The Duke of Aosta  gave his personal collection of elephant guns to his Italian soldiers to shoot armored cars because they didnt have enough antitank guns

The Finnish 20 mm anti tank gun Lahti L 39 had the nickname Norsupyssy during the Winter War because of its stopping power It is not a true elephant gun though since it was not made for elephant hunting but as a military weapon

Fuji Speedway Corporation was established in 1963 as Japan NASCAR Corporation At first the circuit was planned to hold NASCAR style races in Japan The track was designed to be a convert4kmabbron high banked superspeedway There was not enough money to complete the project and only one of the banked turns was ever designed Mitsubishi Estate Co invested in the circuit They took over the management rights on October 1965

The track was converted to a road course Fuji speedway opened in December 1965 The banked turn was somewhat dangerous and caused several major accidents According to Vic Elford The reason that banking was so horrific was that at the end of the straight we went over a blind crest at around 190200 mph and dropped into the banking At other tracks you climb up the banking

A new part of track was built to fix the problem The new convert4359kmabbron course was more successful In 1966 the track hosted a USAC Indy Car non championship race won by Jackie Stewart The speedway brought the first Formula One race to Japan at the end of the F11976 season Mario Andretti won the race and James Hunt earned enough points to win the world championship title

In F11977 Gilles Villeneuve was involved in a crash that killed two spectators on the side of the track Formula One stopped racing at the speedway and Japan When Japan was added back to the F1 schedule ten years later it went to Suzuka instead F1 didnt return to Fuji until F12007

Fuji remained a popular sports car racing venue FIA World Sportscar Championship visited the track between 19821988 Fuji was often used for national races Two chicanes were added to the track to slow down the speeds Even with these changes the main feature of the track remained its long convert15kmmiabbron straight one of the longest in all of motorsports

The long pit straight has also been used for drag racing NHRA exhibitions were run in 1989 Local drag races are common on the circuit

The track is still used for Japanese national races In 2000 the majority of the shares of stock were bought by Toyota Toyota was making plans for future motor racing

The circuit hosts the NISMO Festival for historic Nissan racers Toyota also hosts its own historic event a week before the NISMO called Toyota Motorsports Festival Nearby is a drifting course which was built as part of the refurbishment 

The only time the circuit is run on a reverse direction is during the D1 Grand Prix drifting round The series has hosted its rounds since 2003 with the exception of the 2004 closure The circuit became the first to take place on an international level racetrack and the first of the three to take place on an F1 circuit 

As part of the 2003 renovations most of the old banked section of track was removed Only a small section remains

Following both poor ticket sales and bad weather it was decided by FOM that the Japanese Grand Prix would be shared between Fuji Speedway and Suzuka on alternate years Suzuka would hold the next race on 4 October 2009 After the global recession and its own financial problems Toyota decided to stop hosting of Japanese Grand Prix

In the first 1800 years of church history Christians often enjoyed alcoholic drinks as a part of their everyday life and almost always used wine in the Eucharist They taught that according to both the Bible and Christian tradition alcohol is a gift from God that makes life happier but that drinking too much of it and becoming drunk is a sin In the mid 19th century some Protestant Christians moved away from this traditional belief that drinking a moderate amount of wine was not bad They either decided that not drinking wine at all was wisest or that drinking any alcohol was sinful Today all three of these positions are in Christianity but most people still believe in the traditional position

The Bible often mentions alcoholic drinks Sometimes it is simply mentioning real wine and sometimes it uses wine for poetic expressions The Bible says that alcohol is a blessing from God that makes people happy but it can also be dangerously and sinfully used Most Christians opinions about alcohol depend on the way they understand what the Bible says about it so the Bible is an important source about it

The languages in the Bible have several words for alcoholic drinks Though prohibitionists and some abstentionists disagree most people agree that the words were usually meant to be about intoxicating drinks

Wine was an important and common drink in biblical times as the Bible shows by using it for metaphors about good and bad Wine can be used as a symbol for good things like abundance and health However the Bible also calls wine a mocker and beer a brawler Drinking a cup of strong wine and getting drunk are also used sometimes as a symbol of Gods anger

Wrought iron is a type of iron It has a very little carbon in it Most steels have much more carbon It also has some slag in it This gives it a fibrous look similar to how wood looks It is tough malleable ductile and can be welded easily It was most common in the old days when cast iron was the only other type of iron Now mild steel is used instead If it contains too much sulfur it becomes very brittle when heated Wrought iron has a rough surface that can hold paint and zinc for galvanization much more easily

Wrought iron was one of the most common types of iron in the medieval times Its popularity has declined It is needed to make historical items look historical

Slag is a liquid residue from making iron It consists of calcium silicate The silicon dioxide in iron has to be taken away The calcium oxide reacts with the silicon dioxide solid to make liquid calcium silicate which is lighter than iron It is drained out of the blast furnace Slag can be used to make concrete Air can be blown through molten slag to make a fluffy insulation made mineral wool

The rectus abdominis muscle is a muscle in the human body It is commonly referred to as Abs It is a paired muscle that runs vertically from the lower chest to the pubic region 

Commander is a rank of naval officer It may also be used as a general term for a leader 

Commander is a rank used in many navies and some air forces It is rarely used as a rank in armies except in special forces for a team leader 

The title originated in the 18th century Royal Navy for naval officers who commanded ships of war too large to be commanded by a Lieutenant but too small to warrant the assignment of a Post captain 

In practice these were usually unrated sloops of war of no more than 20 guns The Royal Navy shortened Master and Commander to Commander in 1794 however the term Master and Commander remained in common use for many years A corresponding rank in some navies is frigate captain In the 20th and 21st centuries the rank has been assigned the NATO rank code of OF 4

A Commander in the Royal Navy is above the rank of Lieutenant Commander below the rank of Captain It is equivalent in rank to a Lieutenant Colonel in the British Army and Wing Commander in the Royal Air Force A Commander may command a frigate destroyer submarine aviation squadron or shore installation or may serve on a staff

The Federalist Papers were a series of newspaper articles written about the United States Constitution Many talked about how the Constitution would solve Americas political problems Most of them were published in newspapers in New York and Virginia states were it was not clear whether or not the Constitution would pass Most were written by Alexander Hamilton or James Madison though a few were written by John Jay One of the most famous of the Papers is Federalist No 10 It was written by Madison and says that the Constitution would keep the United States from being run by small groups called factions 

The papers are often thought of as one of the most important works of American political thought Sometimes they are used by Supreme Court justices to try to say what the founders were thinking

The Korean Demilitarized Zone is a piece of land running across the Korean Peninsula that serves as a buffer zone between North and South Korea The DMZ cuts the Korean Peninsula almost in half crossing the 38th parallel The west end of the DMZ is south of the parallel and the east end is to the north of it It is convert250kmmiabbrnone long and about convert4kmmiabbron wide and is the most highly militarized border in the world The border between both Koreas in the Yellow Sea and its coastline is known as the Northern Limit Line Both sides of the Northern Limit Line are also heavily guarded 

The 38th parallel north cuts the Korean peninsula routhly in half The parallel was the original boundary between the US occupied and Soviet occupied areas of Korea at the end of World War II When the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea were created in 1948 this line became a de facto international border between the two countries It was also one of the most tense fronts in the Cold War

Both the North and the South remained heavily dependent on their sponsor states from 1948 to the outbreak of the Korean War The conflict claimed over three million lives and divided the Korean Peninsula along ideological lines On June 25 1950 a Soviet sponsored DPRK invasion crossed the 38th parallel The conflict ended three years later International troops had been deployed and pushed the frontline back to near the 38th parallel In the ceasefire of July 27 1953 the DMZ was created Each side agreed in the armistice to move their troops back convert2000mydabbrin from the front line creating a buffer zone convert4kmmiabbron wide The Military Demarcation Line goes down the center of the DMZ and indicates exactly where the front was when the agreement was signed

In theory this is a stalemate Neither side won or lost Because of this both sides of the conflict are still ennemies and a large number of troops is still stationed along both sides of the line The armistice agreement explains exactly how many military personnel and what kind of weapons are allowed in the DMZ Soldiers from both sides may patrol inside the DMZ but they may not cross the MDL Sporadic outbreaks of violence due to North Korean hostilities killed over 500 South Korean soldiers and 50 US soldiers along the DMZ between 1953 and 1999

Tae Sung Dong and Kijong dong were the only villages allowed by the armistice committee to remain within the boundaries of the DMZ Residents of Tae Sung Dong are governed and protected by the United Nations Command and are generally required to spend at least 240 nights per year in the village to maintain their residency In 2008 the village had a population of 218 people The villagers of Tae Sung Dong are direct descendants of people who owned the land before the 1950 53 Korean War

Inside the DMZ near the western coast of the peninsula is a place called Panmunjeom The Joint Security Area is located there Originally it was the only connection between North and South Korea In 2007 a Korail train crossed the DMZ to the North on the new Donghae Bukbu Line built on the east coast of Korea

There are several buildings on both sides of the Military Demarcation Line A few are built right on top of the MDL The Joint Security Area is the location where all negotiations since 1953 have been held including statements of Korean solidarity which have generally amounted to little except a slight decline of tensions The MDL goes through the conference rooms and down the middle of the conference tables where the North Koreans and the United Nations Command meet face to face

Though generally calm the DMZ has been the scene of much saber rattling between the two Koreas over the years Several small skirmishes have occurred within the Joint Security Area since 1953 The Axe Murder Incident in August 1976 involved the attempted trimming of a poplar tree which resulted in two deaths and Operation Paul Bunyan Beforehand the soldiers of both sides were permitted to go back and forth across the MDL inside of the JSA a privilege since revoked as a result of this incident 

Another incident occurred on November 23 1984 when a Soviet tourist who was part of an official trip to the JSA ran across the Military Demarcation Line shouting that he wanted to defect North Korean troops immediately chased after him opening fire Border guards on the South Korean side returned fire eventually surrounding the North Koreans as they pursued the Russian national One South Korean and three North Korean soldiers were killed in the action The defector was not captured

In late 2009 South Korean forces and the United Nations Command began renovation of its three guard posts and two checkpoint buildings within the JSA compound Construction was designed to enlarge and modernise the structures Work was undertaken a year after North Korea finished replacing four JSA guard posts on its side of the MDL

South Korea has discovered tunnels that cross the DMZ To bulid these tunnels explosives were used This left certain traces called blasting lines The orientation of these blasting lines shows that the tunnels were bulit from north to south North Korea built them In total four tunnels have been discovered the first on November 15 1974 North Korea claimed that the tunnels were used for coal mining No coal has been found in the tunnels All tunnels were dug in a rock called granite Some of the tunnel walls have been painted black to give the appearance of anthracite

It is believed the tunnels were built to allow a North Korean military invasion Each tunnel is big enough so an entire infantry division can pass in one hour but the tunnels are too small for tanks or other vehicles All the tunnels run in a north south direction and do not have branches Engineering within the tunnels following each discovery has become progressively more advanced For example the third tunnel sloped slightly upwards as it progressed southward to prevent water stagnation Today visitors may visit the second third and fourth tunnels through guided tours

The first of the tunnels was discovered by a South Korean Army patrol noticing steam rising from the ground The initial discovery was met with machine gun fire from North Korean soldiers Five days later during a subsequent exploration of this tunnel US Navy Commander Robert M Ballinger and ROK Marine Corps Major Kim Hah Chul were killed in the tunnel by a North Korean explosive device The blast also wounded five Americans and one South Korean from the United Nations Command 

The tunnel which was about convert12mft0abbron high by convert09mft0abbron wide extended more than convert1000mydspusabbron beyond the Military Demarcation Line into South Korea The tunnel was reinforced with concrete slabs and had electric power and lighting There were weapons storage and sleeping areas A narrow gauge railway with carts had also been installed Estimates based on the tunnels size suggest it would have allowed approximately 2000 KPA soldiers to pass through it per hour

The second tunnel was discovered on March 19 1975 It is of similar length to the first tunnel It is located between convert50and160mftspusabbron below ground but is larger than the first approximately convert2by2mft0spusabbrin

The third tunnel was discovered on October 17 1978 Unlike the previous two the third tunnel was discovered following a tip from a North Korean defector This tunnel is about convert1600mydspusabbron long and about convert150mftspusabbron below ground Foreign visitors touring the South Korean DMZ may view inside this tunnel using a sloped access shaft

A fourth tunnel was discovered on March 3 1990 north of Haen town in the former Punchbowl battlefield The tunnels dimensions are 2m x 2m and it is 145m underground the method of construction is almost identical in structure to the second and the third tunnels

Both North and South Korea maintain peace villages in sight of each others side of the DMZ In the South Daeseong dong is administered under the terms of the DMZ Villagers are classed as Republic of Korea citizens however they are exempt from paying tax and other civic requirements such as military service 

In the North Kijong dong features a number of brightly painted poured concrete multi story buildings and apartments with electric lighting These features represented an unheard of level of luxury for rural Koreans north or south in the 1950s The town was oriented so that the bright blue roofs and white sides of the buildings would be the most distinguishing features when viewed from the border However scrutiny with modern telescopic lenses reveals that the buildings are mere concrete shells lacking window glass or even interior rooms with the building lights turned on and off at set times and the empty sidewalks swept by a skeleton crew of caretakers in an effort to preserve the illusion of activity 

Until 2004 massive loudspeakers mounted on several of the buildings continuously delivered DPRK propaganda broadcasts directed towards the south as well as propaganda radio broadcasts across the border 

Within the JSA are a number of UN buildings called Conference Row these are used for direct talks between the two Koreas Facing the UN buildings is DPRKs Panmungak and ROKs Freedom House In 1994 North Korea enlarged Panmungak by adding a third floor In 1998 South Korea built a new Freedom House for its Red Cross staff and to possibly host reunions of families separated by the Korean War The new building incorporated the old Freedom House Pagoda within its design

In the 1980s the South Korean government built a convert984mft0abbron flagpole in the village of Daeseong dong The North Korean government responded by building a taller one the tallest in the world at convert160mft0abbron in Kijong dong

The Korean wall is a concrete barrier that was allegedly built along the length of the DMZ in South Korea between 1977 and 1979 Dutch journalist and filmmaker Peter Tetteroo shows footage of what he believes to be the Korean Wall North Korea contends  In the area south of the Military Demarcation Line which cuts across our country at its waist there is a concrete wall which stretches more than convert240kmmi0abbron from east to west is convert5 8mft0abbron high convert10 19mft0abbron thick at the bottom and convert3 7mft0abbron wide in the upper part It is set with wire entanglements and dotted with gun embrasures look outs and varieties of military establishments the South Korean rulers built this wall over a period of many years from 1977 In December 1999 Chu Chang Jun North Koreas longtime ambassador to China repeated claims that a wall divided Korea He said the south side of the wall is packed with soil which permits access to the top of the wall and makes it effectively invisible from the south side He also claimed that it served as a bridgehead for any northward invasion

According to the United States the wall does not exist although there are anti tank barriers along some sections of the DMZ

Panmunjeom is the site where the negotiations that ended the Korean took place It is the main centre of human activity in the DMZ today The village is located on the main highway and near a railroad connecting the two Koreas

The railway which connects Seoul and Pyongyang was called the Gyeongui Line before Korea was divided in the 1940s Currently the South uses the original name but the North refers to the route as the Pyngbu Line Today the railway is mainly used to carry materials to the industrial complexes at Kaesong South Korea workers also use it to commute there When it was reopened in the early 2000s this was seen as a sign that the relations between both countries were improving However in November 2008 North Korean authorities closed the railway because of growing tensions with the South When former South Korean president Kim Dae jung had died a delegation from North Korea also attended his funeral On that occasion talks were held with South Korean officials In September 2009 the Kaesong rail and road crossings were reopened

The road at Panmunjeom which was known historically as Highway One in the South was originally the only access point between the two countries on the Korean Peninsula Passage is comparable to the strict movements that occurred at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin at the height of the Cold War Both North and South Koreas roads end in the Joint Security Area neither highway meets because there is a convert20cmin0abbroffadjon concrete line that divides the entire site People given the permission to cross this border must do so on foot before continuing their journey by road

In 2007 on the east coast of Korea the first train crossed the DMZ on the new Donghae Bukbu Line The new rail crossing was built next to the road which took South Koreans to Kmgangsan a region that has significant cultural importance for all Koreans More than one million civilian visitors crossed the DMZ until the route was closed after a 53 year old South Korean tourist was shot in July 2008 The North Korean government did not want that both police forces investigate the shooting together so the South Korean government stopped offering tours to the resort Since then the resort and the Donghae Bukbu Line have effectively been closed by the North

In the past half century the Korean DMZ has been a deadly place for humans making habitation impossible Only around the village of Panmunjeom and more recently the Dong Bukbu Line on Koreas east coast have there been regular incursions by people 

This natural isolation along the convert155mi length of the DMZ has created an involuntary park which is now recognised as one of the most well preserved areas of temperate habitat in the world

Several endangered animal and plant species now exist among the heavily fortified fences landmines and listening posts These include the extremely rare Red crowned Crane and the White naped crane as well as potentially the extremely rare Korean Tiger Amur leopard and Asiatic black bear Ecologists have identified some 2900 plant species 70 types of mammals and 320 kinds of birds within the narrow buffer zoneAdditional surveys are now being conducted throughout the region 

The DMZ owes its varied biodiversity to its geography which crosses mountains prairies swamps lakes and tidal marshes Environmentalists hope that by the time reunification occurs the former DMZ will be conserved as a wildlife refuge with a well developed set of objective and management plans vetted and in place In 2005 CNN founder and media mogul Ted Turner on a visit to North Korea said that he would financially support any plans to turn the DMZ into a peace park and a UN protected World Heritage Site

Captain Robert Falcon Scott CVO RN was a Royal Navy officer and explorer who died on an expedition to the South Pole He is widely known as Scott of the Antarctic the title of a 1948 film

Scott led two expeditions to the Antarctic regions the Discovery Expedition 190104 and the ill fated Terra Nova Expedition 191013 Before his appointment to lead the Discovery Expedition Scott had followed the conventional career of a naval officer in peacetime Victorian Britain where opportunities for career advancement were keenly sought after by ambitious officers 

It was the chance for personal distinction that led Scott to apply for command of the Discovery His name became associated with the Antarctic his field of work for the final twelve years of his life

During this second venture Scott led a party of five which reached the South Pole on 17 January 1912 only to find that Roald Amundsens Norwegian expedition had got there first On the return journey Scott and his four comrades died from exhaustion starvation and extreme cold

After his death Scott became a British hero a status he kept for more than 50 years In a more sceptical age at the end of the 20th century the legend was reassessed Attention focused on the causes of the disaster and whether Scott was responsible Scott became a figure of controversy with questions raised about his competence and character 

In particular Scotts decision to take ponies and motorised sleds as well as dogs was a disaster The ponies proved almost useless and the sleds eventually froze up The dogs of which there were far too few were left behind on the final attempt on the Pole Scotts instructions to the men he left at the base camp were unclear They did not know whether they should use the dogs to rescue Scotts party when they were overdue The final group of four died on the way back after running into a blizzard which stopped their progress

A widespread view is that his reluctance to rely on dogs despite the advice of expert ice travellers was a critical factor It lost him the race to the pole and ultimately the lives of his party Amundsen on the other hand had plenty of dogs When food ran short he was able to kill a couple of dogs to feed the men and the rest of the pack

One author thought there was devastating evidence of bungling and that Scott doomed his companions then covered his tracks with rhetoric Commentators in the 21st century have so far regarded Scott more positively

The standard state is a common way for measuring properties of chemicals Standard state normally is room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure Normally when no temperature or pressure is given standard state is implied If an article says bromine is a liquid it means bromine is a liquid in the standard state

Tellurium trioxide also known as tellurium oxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is TeO3 It contains tellurium and oxide ions It contains tellurium in its 6 oxidation state

Tellurium trioxide can come in two forms There is a yellow red form and a gray form The yellow red form is more reactive It is a powerful oxidizing agent It reacts with strong bases to make tellurates It releases oxygen to turn into tellurium dioxide when heated 

It is made by taking the water from telluric acid The gray form can be made from this by reacting the yellow red form with sulfuric acid and air

Tellurite is an ion Its chemical formula is TeO32 They are some of the more stable tellurium compounds They are weak oxidizing agents In slightly acidic conditions it makes hydrogen tellurite HTeO3 When it is very acidic it makes tellurous acid They are normally made by reacting tellurium dioxide with a metal oxide 

Tellurite is also a rare mineral This mineral consists of tellurium dioxide It is a yellow to white mineral It is in areas that tend to oxidize minerals Otherwise telluride or native tellurium would be there

Tellurium compounds are chemical compounds containing tellurium ions Tellurium comes in several oxidation states 2 2 4 and 6 Tellurium chemistry is similar to selenium chemistry

Tellurides are the most common 2 tellurium compounds Tellurides are strong reducing agents They are the common ores of tellurium Most natural tellurides are not pure so they are much less reactive

Tellurium forms some halides in the 2 oxidation state They are the rarest oxidation state

Polychlorinated biphenyls are organic chemical compounds that contain chlorine atoms They were used in industrial chemistry and to make certain transformers capacitors and cooling fluids The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants declared them to be among the worst chemical polluants Their use has been banned worldwide since 2001 The mode of action of these substances is similar to that of dioxin 

Polychlorinated biphenyls were widely used and they can be found in the atmosphere the soil and the bodies of water anywhere on the earth In the short term these substances are not very toxic but they accumulate in the body They are teratogens and may cause cancer 

A teratogen is a substance that can cause congenital defects This means the child is born with deformities it would not otherwise have had

Certain Viruses certain chemicals and ionizing radiation can also have this effect

In a group of hills or mountains a pass is a path for crossing a mountain It is usually a saddle point between two higher areas Many of the worlds mountain ranges have always made travel difficult so passes have been important throughout history in trade war and migration

A pass has the general form of a saddle between two mountains They are often found just above the source of a river making a sort of bridge over to the headwaters of another river Passes may be very short with steep slopes to the top of the pass or valleys of many kilometers

Roads and railways have been built through passes Some high and rugged passes may have tunnels dug underneath to let traffic move faster

The top of a pass is often the only flat ground in the area so it is often a good site for buildings For countries whose borders lie on a mountain range the pass is often part of the border As well as making travel easy between valleys passes also provide a route between two mountain tops so it is common for tracks to meet at a pass this often makes them good routes even when travelling between a summit and the valley floor

Some of the best known passes are Great St Bernard Pass at convert2473mft in the Alps the Khyber Pass at convert1027mft between Afghanistan and Pakistan and the Khardung La at convert5359mft in Jammu and Kashmir India

A blast furnace is a special type of furnace It is very tall  up to 60 m  and can be up to 15 m by its diameter Blast furnaces are used on making iron from ore In many languages the blast furnace is called as high oven The blast furnace is the biggest chemical reactor which there is

It normally is a steel case with bricks made of magnesia lining it Magnesia is very heat resistant and does not melt The furnace is cooled with water running inside the channels of the case and lining

The ironmaking process is simple Ore is basically iron oxide so iron is produced by taking the oxygen off the iron leaving crude iron called pig iron left This process where oxygen is stripped off its compounds is called reduction The reducing agent is carbon as it can easily strip the oxygen off the ore in extremely hot temperatures

FileVysokaPecjpgthumbright250pxBlast furnace diagram 1 Hot blast from Cowper stoves 2 Melting zone 3 Reduction zone of ferrous oxide

6 Feed of ore limestone and coke

A blast furnace is fed at the top with ore carbon in form of coke and limestone as layers At the same time hot air called wind is blown inside the furnace with special nozzles called tuyeres at the bottom of the furnace This process is called blasting hence the name blast furnace The coke ignites and burns creating carbon monoxide as there is too little oxygen to make carbon dioxide The carbon monoxide then reduces the metal oxide to the metal and makes carbon dioxide This process is used to make iron The limestone forms a substance called slag with the rock substance of the iron ore

When the bottonmost part of the furnace called hearth has filled with molten pig iron and molten slag the iron is drained away First the slag is removed This is called skimming Slag is lighter than iron and floats on it A hole is drilled on the hearth at the level of the slag and the liquid slag runs into a collecting vessel called slag pot The iron is then collected This is called tapping Similarly a hole is drilled on the bosh and the liquid pig iron is let run away It is either run directly into a converter for steelmaking collected into a special railway wagon called torpedo car or cast into molds When all the pig iron has been drained the taphole and skimhole are then plugged with fire resistant clay which solidifies immediately in the immense heat

The furnace is again fed with ore coke and limestone and the reaction cycle begins again Normally a blast furnace can work continuously for 10 to 20 years This is called campaign

Pig iron contains some carbon and is too hard and brittle to be used right on It must first be refined into steel for further use This is made in special furnaces called converters

Wocawek is a town in northern Poland with a population of 117785 It has a large Jewish community In 1939 when the Nazis invaded the Jewish people of this town were the first to have to wear yellow Stars of David

This town is twinned with the following places

Hurricane Carla was one of two Category 5 tropical cyclones It hit the Texas shore in the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season as a Category 4 hurricane becoming one of the most powerful storms to ever strike the United States Hurricane Carla was the second strongest storm to ever hit the Texas shore The storm caused over 2 billion in damages but because over 500000 people who lived there moved out only 43 were killed

A tropical depression started in the western Caribbean Sea on September 3 from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone It moved northwestward to become Tropical Storm Carla on the 5th and Hurricane Carla on the 6th After touching the Yucatn Peninsula as a weak hurricane Carla moved into the Gulf of Mexico and headed for the US Gulf Coast

As it moved slowly across the Gulf of Mexico Carla got stronger to its peak of 175 mph winds on September 11 Just before landfall it weakened but Carla was still a very strong and unusually large Category 4 hurricane when it touched the shore between Port OConnor and Port Lavaca Texas on the 11th At the time Carla became the largest hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin Along the whole Texas shore hurricane warnings were given and people were moved out of their homes in low lying areas

Storm surge was measured at 22 feet near the heads of bays in some places reaching 10 miles inland Because of its large size the whole Texas shore was hit and damage was seen as far away as Dallas Winds were reported to be 115 mph in Matagorda 110 mph in Victoria and 88 mph in Galveston Wind gusts as high as 170 mph were recorded at Port Lavaca Pressure at landfall was measured at 931 mb making it the eighth most intense hurricane to strike the United States in the 20th century Then little known newsman Dan Rather reported live from the Galveston Seawall during the storm an act that would be imitated by later reporters This marked the first live television broadcast of a hurricane

Much of the damage was done well away from the landfall site as Carla caused one of the largest hurricane related tornado outbreaks on record at the time when 26 tornadoes touched down within its circulation One F4 tornado ripped through downtown Galveston killing several Outside the protection of the Galveston Seawall structures on the island were severely damaged by storm surge Damage was reported as far east as the Mississippi River delta

As Carla weakened it dropped heavy rain in the Midwest causing some flooding

Carla killed 43 people 31 of them in Texas The low number of deaths was due to what was then the largest movement of people out of their homes in US history except during a war One half million people moved inland from exposed coastal areas Carla caused a total of 325 million in damage not much considering Carlas strength at landfall

Owing to the intensity of and destruction by the storm the name Carla was retired and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane It was replaced by Carol in the 1965 season 

Shimane prefecture is in the western Chugoku region of the main Japanese island Honshu It has the second smallest population of any prefecture in Japan

Shimane Prefecture is in Chugoku and is part of the Sanin area Sanin means the shady side of the mountains There is a mountain range separating Shimane and neighboring Tottori from Hiroshima and Okayama That means that the weather here is much wetter than further to the south

The history of Shimane starts with Japanese mythology In these myths the Shinto god kuninushi lived in Izumo an old province in Shimane Izumo Shrine honors this god The current Shimane prefecture was divided into three parts Iwami Izumo and Oki That lasted until the the han system was stopped in 1871 

Later on in the Kamakura period the Kamakura Shogunate forced Emperor Gotoba and Emperor Godaigo into exile on Oki Island Emperor Godaigo got away from Oki and successfully fought back against the shogunate

During the Muromachi period many clans fought over this area because there was a lot of silver The Kyogoku clan controlled Izumo and Oki However after the nin War the Amago clan in Gassan Toda castle increased in power and the Masuda clan controlled Iwami Iwami Ginzan Silver Mine was in between Amago clan territory and Masuda clan territory so there were many battles between these lords for the large amount of silver However in 1566 Mori Motonari conquered Izumo Iwami and Oki After over 30 years of Mori control in 1600 Horio Yoshiharu entered Izumo and Oki after the Battle of Sekigahara which Mori lost Horio Yoshiharu decided to move and build Matsue Castle instead of Gassan Toda The castle was completed soon after Yoshiharus death Later in 1638 the grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu Matsudaira Naomasa entered the castle because the Horio clan had no heir Matsudairas family ruled until the end of the han system 

The Iwami area was split into 3 clans The mining district was under direct control of the Shogunate The Hamada clan and the Tsuwano clan each controlled their own areas Iwami Ginzan produced silver and was one of the nations largest silver mine by the early 17th century The Hamada clan was on the shogunates side in the Meiji Restoration and the castle was burned down The Tsuwano clan despite the Matsudaira rule was on the emperors side in the restoration

Shimane Prefecture Introduction to Shimane 

Matsue is a city in Japan on the Japan Sea coast It is the capital of Shimane Prefecture It is known for its historic castle and as the home of Lafcadio Hearn

The nin no Ran was a civil war in Japan It lasted 10 years during the Muromachi period Hosokawa Katsumoto and Yamana Szen had a conflict that grew into a war throughout the country The Ashikaga shogunate and some daimyo in many regions of Japan were fighting in this war 

The war started the Sengoku jidaior the Warring States Period This period was a very long struggle for control by individual daimyo Different houses made huge efforts to dominate all of Japan Three powerful individuals emerged during this time These great daimyo of the Sengoku Period eventually united Japan under one government They were Oda Nobunaga Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu

Gregory Dale Bear is an American science fiction author He has written about war across the galaxy artificial universes consciousness and evolution

Bear was born in San Diego California From 1968 to 1973 he attended San Diego State University where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree In 1975 he married Christina M Nielson but they divorced in 1981 He remarried in 1983 to Astrid Anderson the daughter of science fiction author Poul Anderson They have two children Erik and Alexandra They live outside of Seattle Washington

Bear is often called a hard science fiction author because he uses many scientific details in his work

Bear often answers major questions in contemporary science and culture with fictional solutions For example The Forge of God tries to explain the Fermi paradox If the galaxy is filled with intelligences that could be very dangerous young civilizations could only survive by staying quiet so nobody would notice them and attack In Queen of Angels Bear examines crime guilt and punishment in society He does this by examining consciousness and awareness Part of the novel is about highly advanced computers that begging to become intelligent and aware of themselves as they communicate with humans In the two books Darwins Radio and Darwins Children he writes about the problem of overpopulation with a mutation the human genome making basically a new series of humans The books bring up the question of cultural acceptance of something brand new that cannot be stopped

One of Bears favorite themes is how observers effect or create reality In Blood Music reality becomes unstable as the number of observerstrillions of intelligent single cell organismsgets higher and higher Both Anvil of Starsa sequel to The Forge of Godand Moving Mars propose a physics based on information exchange between particles capable of being altered at the bit level In Moving Mars this knowledge is used to remove Mars from the solar system and transfer it to an orbit around a distant star

Blood Music has also been credited as being the first account of nanotechnology in science fiction The short story described microscopic medical machines He described DNA as a computer system that could be changed In Queen of Angels and Slant Bear gives a detailed description of a near future nanotechnological society This historical sequence continues with Headswhich may contain the first description of a quantum logic computerand with Moving Mars These books also show the historical development of self awareness in AIs One AI character called Jill is in all of these books Bear was influenced by Robert A Heinleins self aware computer Mycroft Holmes in The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress when creating Jill

More recent works such as the two novels Darwins Radio and Darwins Children stick closely to the known facts of molecular biology of viruses and evolution These books are about the impact of a strange disease that appears to make evolutionary transitions happen Bear includes some very speculative ideas but he wrote about them so carefully that Darwins Radio gained praise in the science journal Nature

Bear Gregory Benford and David Brin wrote a series of three novels that take place before Isaac Asimovs famous Foundation series Bear is named as the author of the second of the three books

While most of Bears writing is science fiction he also wrote in other genres Two of his early works The Infinity Concerto and The Serpent Mageare clearly fantasies These are now published together as one novel called Songs of Earth and Power Psychlone is horror Bear called his story Dead Lines a high tech ghost story He has received many accolades including five Nebula awards and two Hugo awards for science fiction

0999 is one of the ways the number 1 can be written Even though it is written like this it is still the same as one

It is hard for many people to understand why 0999 is the same as 1 There are many proofs that show why they are the same number but many of these proofs are very complex

When 1 is divided by 3 the answer is Fraction13 Since the answers are the same that means that 0999 and 1 are the same Another way of thinking about it is if Fraction13 0333 and Fraction23 0666 then Fraction33 0999 1 There are many other ways of showing this

As the Internet developed arguments about 0999 are often on newsgroups and message boards Even newsgroups and message boards that do not have much to do with math argue about this In the newsgroup scimath arguing about 0999 is a popular sport It is also one of the questions in its FAQ

Ophthalmosauridae were a family of Ichthyosaurs which lived from the Middle Jurassic to the Upper Cretaceous period

Within Ophthalmosauridae there are two lineages one including Aegirosaurus and Ophthalmosaurus and the other including Brachypterygius Caypullisaurus and Platypterygius

Only three genera survived the end Jurassic extinction event Caypullisaurus Maiaspondylus and Platypterygius They did however have a worldwide distribution The last to survive was Platypterygius This genus became extinct about 30 million years before the end of the Upper Cretaceous period It happened when there was a deep ocean anoxic event which wiped out all the animals below pelagic waters Ichthyosaurs being reptiles came to the surface to breath but the extinction event removed their prey species

Anoxic events occur when the Earths oceans become completely depleted of oxygen below the surface levels They may be called Oceanic anoxic events or Deep ocean anoxic events

Anoxic events have happened Although anoxic events have not happened for millions of years the geological record shows that they happened many times in the past 

Anoxic events may have caused mass extinctions These mass extinctions were so characteristic that they have been used by geologists as markers in biostratigraphic dating It is believed oceanic anoxic events are strongly linked to climate warming and greenhouse gases

There are several places on earth today that show the features of anoxic events on a localized level Dead zones exist off the East Coast of the United States in the Chesapeake Bay in the Scandinavian strait Kattegat the Black Sea in the northern Adriatic and off the coast of Louisiana Typically oceanic anoxic events last for under half a million years before a full recovery

Metriacanthosaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in Europe during the Middle Jurassic period about 160 million years ago Its name means Moderate spined lizard because its back vertebrae are taller than other meat eating dinosaurs such as Allosaurus but shorter than those of other meat eating dinosaurs such as Acrocanthosaurus Like most theropods Metriacanthosaurus was a meat eater It had three fingers on each hand Each finger ended in a sharp hook like claw that was used to grab prey before giving the killing bite with its jaws It probably preyed on the large long necked sauropods such as Pelorosaurus that lived in the same time and place as it It was originally classified as a megalosaurid but recent studies show that it belongs to its own family the Metriacanthosauridae

In Jurassic Park one of the vials of dinosaur DNA that Dennis Nedry steals is labeled Metriacanthosaurus However this may refer to either M parkeri or Yangchuanosaurus shangyouensis which Gregory S Paul then classified as a species of Metriacanthosaurus

Acrocanthosaurus was a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in North America during the Early Cretaceous period Its name means High spined lizard referring to the spines on its vertebrae that formed a sail or hump when the animal was alive Its classification is uncertain It was originally classified as a spinosaurid because the spines on its back resembled those of Spinosaurus However Acrocanthosaurus is now classified as a carnosaur Most paleontologists believe that it was a carcharodontosaurid However some alternatively classify it as a member of the Allosauridae Acrocanthosaurus was 39 feet long almost as large as Tyrannosaurus rex It was the largest theropod in North America before the evolution of the tyrannosaurids There is a famous trackway in Paluxy Texas that shows an Acrocanthosaurus stalking its prey a Pleurocoelus 

Acrocanthosaurus was featured in an episode of the television documentary Monsters Ressurected It was depicted as the top predator in Early Cretaceous North America A juvenile was scared away from its kill by a pack of Deinonychus and was forced to hunt more difficult prey such as a Sauropelta

A flood basalt or trap basalt is the result of a giant volcanic eruption or series of eruptions that coats large stretches of land or the ocean floor with basalt lava 

Flood basalts have covered areas as large as a continent in prehistory creating great plateaus and mountain ranges Flood basalts have erupted at random intervals throughout Earth history and are clear evidence that the Earth undergoes periods of enhanced activity rather than being in a uniform steady state 

One explanation for flood basalts is that they are caused by the combination of continental rifting and its associated melting in conjunction with a mantle plume also undergoing decompression melting producing vast quantities of a basaltic magma These have a very low viscosity which is why they flood rather than form taller volcanoes 

The Deccan Traps of central India the Siberian Traps and the Columbia River Plateau of western North America are three regions covered by prehistoric flood basalts The two largest flood basalt events in historic time have been at Eldgj and Lakagigar both in Iceland The largest and best preserved continental flood basalt terrain on Earth is part of the Mackenzie Large Igneous Province in Canada The maria on the Moon are additional even more extensive flood basalts Flood basalts on the ocean floor produce oceanic plateaus

The surface covered by one eruption can vary from around 200000 km to 1500000 km The thickness can vary from 2000 metres to 12000 m These are smaller than the original volumes due to erosion 

Flood basalts originate at between 100 and 400 km depth in the asthenosphere To get a partial melting as large as that of the traps expelling huge quantities of lava it is necessary to have a large heat input Such melting can take place near a hotspot resulting in a mixture of magma from the depths of the hotspot with superficial magma produced by a mantle plume

Monterrey is a city in northern Mexico It is the capital of the state Nuevo Len It is the third largest city in Mexico and has a population of 2056538

The Siberian Traps form a large region of volcanic rock known as a large igneous province in the Russian region of Siberia 

The massive eruptions which formed the traps were one of the largest known volcanic events of the last 500 million years of Earth history They continued for a million years and spanned the Permian Triassic boundary about 251 to 250 million years ago It was the same time as the PermianTriassic extinction event which is estimated to have killed 90 of species existing at the time The eruption of the Siberian Traps is a possible cause of this Great Dying

The term traps is derived from the Swedish word for stairs referring to the step like hills forming the landscape of the region which is typical of flood basalts

Vast volumes of basaltic lava paved over a large expanse of primaeval Siberia in a flood basalt event Today the area covered is about 2 million km roughly equal to western Europe in land area and estimates of the original coverage are as high as 7 million km The original volume of lava is estimated to range from 1 to 4 million km

The source of the Siberian Traps basalt was probably a mantle plume at the base of the crust which erupted through the Siberian craton Helium isotope analysis from the basalts indicates a plume origin The scientific debate continues There is a minority controversial theory which argues that the traps were caused by a large asteroid impact

This massive eruptive event spanned the Permian Triassic boundary about 250 million years ago and is widely cited as a cause of the Permian Triassic extinction event This extinction event also called the Great Dying affected all life on Earth and is estimated to have killed 90 of species living at the time Life on land took 30 million years to recover from the environmental disruptions caused by the eruption of the Siberian Traps

The Siberian Traps are considered to have erupted through numerous vents over a period of a million years or more probably east and south of Norilsk in Siberia The giant Norilsk nickel copper palladium deposit formed within the magma flows in the main Siberian Traps The presence of extensive tuff and pyroclastic deposits suggests that a number of large explosive eruptions occurred during or before the eruptions of basaltic lavas The presence of silicic volcanic rocks such as rhyolite is also indicative of explosive eruptions

Yangchuanosaurus was a genus of theropod dinosaur from the Upper Jurassic of China 

It was the largest member of the family Sinraptoridae It was a fairly typical carnosaur with a large head sharp serrated teeth and relatively short arms 

Yangchuanosaurus probably preyed on sauropods such as Mamenchisaurus or stegosaurs such as Tuojiangosaurus 

There are two known species Y shangyouensis and Y magnus In 1988 in his book Predatory Dinosaurs of the World Gregory S Paul classified Yangchuanosaurus as a species of Metriacanthosaurus However this classification was not adopted by other paleontologists and has since been abandoned 

Pelorosaurus conybeari is the name given to a few sauropod dinosaur bones from the Lower Cretaceous period about 138112 million years ago 

Bones of Pelorosaurus have been found in England and Portugal It was a Brachiosaurid and had front legs that were longer than its hind legs like Brachiosaurus 

The name has been challenged and has been the subject of long lasting dispute Some palaeontologists prefer the name Cetiosaurus brevis

The taxonomic status of Pelorosaurus is as a result very problematic Technically Cetiosaurus brevis is its type species The position of Pelorosaurus is further undermined by the fact that several researchers hold that the genus is a nomen dubium

Pelorosaurus was one of the first dinosaurs described and the naming procedures were not so well developed at the time Its life style is assumed to be similar to other brachiosaurs eating from the higher branches of tall conifer trees

A crumpet is a kind of flat small round bread that is raised by yeast They are about the same size as an English muffin They are made in crumpet rings that are four inches wide and usually one inch deep Crumpets are usually baked on a griddle and served toasted A well baked crumpet has a brown bottom and a spongey top that has many tiny holes Crumpets are toasted whole while English muffins are split and then toasted After the baking crumpets are spread with butter or cream and jam 

The word of crumpet may come from the Middle English word crompid or curled Or it may come from the past participle of the Middle English verb crumpen which means to curl up It could also have come from crumb crump or crooked all Old English Crumpet is also used as British slang for a particularly sexually attractive woman It Australian slang it is part of the expression not worth a crumpet meaning that somebody or something is useless

The first recipe for crumpets was long ago referred to frequently as the crompid cake by many The Oxford English Dictionary traced the history back to 1382

The Oxford Companion to Food also says that the earliest published recipe for crumpets was by Elizabeth Raffald in 1769 There the crompid cake is mentioned as well with buckwheat griddle cakes so it is believed that there is a connection between crumpets and the buckwheat pancake

Elizabeth Raffald mentions it in her book of The Experienced English Housekeeper Her recipe is very similar to the modern crumpet recipe especially in the baking buttering and serving

A homologous trait is any characteristic which is derived by evolution from a common ancestor This is contrasted to analogous traits similarities between organisms that were evolved separately 

The term existed before 1859 but got its modern meaning after Darwin established the idea of common descentp45 The pre Darwinian naturalists Cuvier Geoffroy and Richard Owen also used the idea

According to Russell we owe to Richard Owen the first clear distinction between homologous and analogous organs Owens definitions were

The distinction is made clear by examples such as the ear ossicles of mammals These little bones have in the course of several hundred million years of evolution made their way from the gill covers of fish to the rear jaw bones of Synapsids to their present position in the ear of mammals In the fossil record is evidence of this and also in embryology As the embryo develops the cartilage hardens to form bone Later in development tiny bone structures break loose from the jaw and migrate to the inner ear area

This rather extraordinary story was first proposed nearly two hundred years ago by Geoffroy who looked at fish and tried to discover the homologies of their bones with that of land vertebrates

A trait may be both homologous and analogous depending on the level at which the trait is examined For example the wings of birds and bats are homologous as forearms in tetrapods However they are not homologous as wings because the organ served as a forearm in the last common ancestor of tetrapods 

By definition any homologous trait defines a cladea monophyletic taxon in which all the members have the trait and all non members lack it

A homologous trait is often called a homolog In genetics the term homolog is used both to refer to a homologous protein and to the gene encoding it

The Body Volume Index is a proposed alternative to the Body Mass Index The BMI is used as an indicator for weight problems such as being overweight or underweight The BMI puts a persons total weight in relation to their height This measure does not take into account where on the body the mass is located Recent studies have shown the limitations of BMI as an indicator of individual health risk

The BVI was made in 2000 as an alternative to the BMI With the data a computer should be able to check whether a person is obese The BVI measures the BMI the circumference of the waist and the waist hip ratio 

The BVI is used on a 3D full body scanner to determine the health risk of the person scanned Using the scanner the BVI can differentiate between people with the same BMI but with a different shape or weight distribution The BVI is currently being tested in different hospitals in the US and Europe a two year project was started to see whether it would be as useful as the BMI

The BMI can be measured manually using the height and weight of a person The BVI is calculated automatically based on data from the 3D scanner The total weight or total fat content are not used Scienmtific studies showed that fat content of the abdomen and mass around it pose a greater health risk This fact is commonly known as central obesity A full body surface scanner determines the three dimensional outline of a persons exterior surface so that computation can be used to calculate the part volumes and the part body composition of that person BVI makes an inference as to the bodys distribution of fat and weight using complex and detailed Body Composition data 

Most body scanners take a number of images from different angles Different lighting as well as patterns projected onto the body are used to determine the body shape and the distribution of the weight in the body of the patient

The Discovery Channel is a television channel about science history and nature It has programs such as Man vs Wild A Haunting The Last Day of the Dinosaurs MythBusters and Dirty Jobs

The Last Day of the Dinosaurs is a 2010 Discovery Channel television documentary about the extinction of the dinosaurs It portrays the asteroid as the cause of the extinction

In the Pacific Northwest of North America a Quetzalcoatlus is flying above the landscape looking for food It finds a nest of Tyrannosaurus babies that have just hatched It picks them up in its beak and starts eating them Suddenly the father appears and starts fighting the Quetzacoatlus He grabs it by the wing but it manages to escape 

Meanwhile the asteroid is getting closer to Earth The narrator says that it was caused by the collision of two asteroids 150 million years ago One of the fragments is heading towards Earth

In the Pacific Northwest two male Triceratops fight for mating rights One of them wins The loser walks away Suddenly two T rexes attack and kill the Triceratops They start feeding on its carcass

In what is today central Mexico a herd of Alamosaurus is roaming the plains in search of food They are giants even by dinosaur standards They are 60 feet long and 40 feet tall and they weigh 30 tons Their huge size demands that they eat a lot of vegetation to maintain their bulk Meanwhile the asteroid enters the Earths atmosphere It is burning brighter than a million suns The scorching light sears the Alamosaurus eyeballs blinding them 

Then the asteroid hits the Earth in the Gulf of Mexico near the Yucatan Peninsula In a fraction of a second it disentegrates into the planet The air temperature near the crash site now reaches 600 degrees Fahrenheit The Alamosaurus are burned alive In the Pacific Northwest the Quetzalcoatlus can see the impact

Meanwhile Mongolia is 8000 miles away from the point of impact A herd of Charonosaurus is drinking at a watering hole They are protecting their eggs Suddenly a Troodon appears Its brain to body weight ratio is among the highest of any dinosaur It steals an egg but is seen by the mother It runs into a cave A second Saurornithoides is in the cave The two predators start chasing the Charonosaurus They jump on its neck and slash with their retractable toe claws killing their prey Then they start feasting on the carcass

Millions of tons of dust and rock were thrown up into the air by the asteroids impact This is the ejecta cloud In Mongolia the ejecta cloud causes the temperature to become hotter As the air temperature reaches 120 degrees the Troodons run inside the cave The temperature ticks upward every second The Charonosaurus go into the cave Inside the cave it is cooler However the Charonosaurus and Troodon are forced to share the cave with each other even though they are enemies

Back in the Pacific Northwest fires burn across the forest floor at 9 miles per hour The Tyrannosaurus and the Triceratops are running to get away from the fire The panicked animals race up the valley slopes 

In Mongolia the temperatures are finally starting to decrease The Troodon run outside and start feeding on a Charonosaurus corpse Soon the Charonosaurus follow However one stays near the protection of the cave However the dinosaurs are not safe yet The ejecta cloud has caused a huge sandstorm As it hits the Troodons are small enough to crouch for cover But the Charonosaurus are out in the open The harder they struggle and the deeper they gasp for oxygen the more sand fills their lungs until finally they cant breathe Its hours before the winds die down The last Charonosaurus protected once again by the cave finds that its the last of the herd But its not the last remaining dinosaur in the neighborhood The Troodons were sheltered from the worst of the storm They have survived

Instinct drives the Troodon back to their prime hunting spot the watering hole where the last remaining Charonosaurus is drinking The Troodon are desperate for food One of them has the confidence to attack The Troodon runs to theCharonosaurus and leaps on it It starts slashing at its neck The Charonosaurus is still too exhausted to run Suddenly the Charonosaurus crashes to the ground crushing the Troodon to death under its weight The remaining Troodon starts eating the dead body of its companion

A week after impact food is in very short supply across the entire planet In the Pacific Northwest two Triceratops are searching for food Their hunger drives them to the Pacific coast They see an island Protected from the fires by the surrounding ocean the island is lush and green It has all the food that the Triceratops need But when the asteroid hit the Earth it caused an earthquake under the ocean This causes a huge tsunami The ocean is dragged back hundreds of feet The path to the island is suddenly dry land The Triceratops walk across the land bridge to the island However the tsunami crashes down on them flooding the land The Triceratops drown

In the days and weeks that follow few dinosaurs remain In Mongolia the starving Charonosaurus stays close to the cave that has saved it twice in the past Suddenly it collapses but not from starvation Bubbling to the surface from hot springs is one of natures most toxic gases Hydrogen Sulfide The Troodon runs up to the dead Charonosaurus Then it too dies from inhaling the poisonous gas

In the Pacific Northwest only a handful of dinosaurs patrol the gray wasteland An Ankylosaurus severely weakened by hunger is searching for food All it can find is a small bush But even that wont come without a fight A Triceratops roars at the Ankylosaurus Suddenly a T rex appears It roars at the herbivores Then it kills the Triceratops The Ankylosaurus tries to defend itself with its heavy tail club but its too weak to fight The Tyrannosaurus flips the Ankylosaurus over and bites its soft underbelly killing it Then the Tyrannosaurus collapses from hunger It falls on the Triceratops horn and is impaled by it 

In Mexico the first region to be hit by the asteroid life still remains Buried in the cool ground inside its egg an Alamosaurus baby has survived And so has an adult Alamosaurus All around the world small handfuls of dinosaurs try to start over But their species are already considered extinct In order to survive any species needs to maintain a critical mass of population If it falls below that threshold then theres no way to climb back from certain extinction

But life on Earth isnt completely destroyed Out of the ruins nature starts over A group of animals that have long been limited in success by the dinosaurs now become the new rulers of the Earth mammals Eventually they multiply and diversify 10000 species explode across the planet And one species humans branches off from its relatives and comes down from the trees They walk on two legs evolve bigger brains and eventually they rule the planet They build cities that touch the sky vehicles that can leave the planet and weapons that can destroy it

In the end the narrator says that humans would never have existed if a chance collision in space 150 million years ago hadnt occurred sending an asteroid hurtling towards Earth and dooming the dinosaurs to extinction
