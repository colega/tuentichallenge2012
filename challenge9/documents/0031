Rickets is a disease in young children It is caused by lack of vitamin D and calcium Rickets causes larger gaps inside bones and turns them dry and spongy It also makes a curve on the legs

The word rickets comes from the Greek word rhakhis which means spine People can get rickets if they

Bile or gall is a green yellow fluid It is secreted from the liver of most vertebrate animals and is often stored in the gall bladder Bile helps digest fat

The components of bile are

The name gall comes from the Greek word chol meaning green or yellow The term cholesterol and the illness cholera were named after gall Bile is also stored in bile ducts Often after liver transplants bile comes out of the body

The dental pulp is the part in the center of a tooth It is made up of living soft tissue and cells It is surrounded by dentine and contains nerves and blood vessels

Protoplasm is the living substance that makes up a cell In plant cells it is surrounded by a cell wall In animal cells the whole cell is made of protoplasm surrounded by a cell membrane Protoplasm in living beings is made up of about 75 80 percent water The semifluid translucent substance that forms the living matter in all plant and animal cells Composed of proteins fats and other substances suspended in water it includes the cytoplasm and the nucleus

Amylase is an enzyme It is found in saliva and pancreatic juice It can break down starch into maltose It stops working at 60CIt works in the mouth and small intestine during digestion

A variegated leaf is a leaf which contains green and non green parts As the green parts contain chlorophyll they can photosynthesise but the non green parts do not contain chlorophyll so they can not photosynthesise

A variegated leaf is useful in conducting experiments that can show that chlorophyll is needed for photosynthesis There are no other known uses of variegated leaves

A seam ripper is a cutting tool It is used for removing stitches in sewing and cutting open buttonholes made on a sewing machine Sometimes it is also called a thread ripper

The tool usually has a handle shaft and head The head has two points one flattened to form a pointed blade and the other forming a small point 

To use a seam ripper to remove sewn threads the blade is placed underneath the thread to be cut The thread slips down between the two points and the tool is then lifted upwards allowing the blade to cut through the thread Then the loose thread ends can be removed

Plaque is a sticky white film or fluid on the teeth It is a mixture of bacteria and food It causes tooth decay It is very harmful for teeth

A pin cushion is small cushion used for holding pins and needles It is used so that the pins and needles are stored safely and can be taken out by pulling the head

A chemical cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy Most batteries are chemical cells A chemical reaction takes place inside the battery and causes electric current to flow

There are two main types of batteries  those that are rechargeable and those that are not

A battery that is not recharageable will give electricity until the chemicals in it are used up Then it is no longer useful It can be rightly called as use and throw

A rechargeable battery can be recharged by passing electric current backwards through it it can then be used again to produce more electricity It was Gaston Plante a French scientist who invented these rechargeable batteries in 1859

Batteries come in many shapes and sizes from very small ones used in toys and cameras to those used in cars or even larger ones

Das Lied der Deutschen also known as Das Deutschlandlied is a song written by Joseph Haydn and Hoffmann von Fallersleben Part of this song is the national anthem of Germany

A line from this song Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit is the motto of Germany

The music was written by Haydn in 1797 as the anthem of Austria It was called Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser The words which are used today were written by the poet August Heinrich Hoffman von Fallersleben in 1841 

Today the first line Germany Germany above all sounds too strong for some people and is often misunderstood Fallersleben wanted a united Germany when he wrote it At that time Germany was not one country but many small countries So Germany above all meant that the most important thing to do was to have a unified Germany Also the poet was in Heligoland where people spoke German but were ruled by the British

Fallerslebens music was very popular in Germany during the second part of the 19th century This song was not a national anthem then but a song for people who loved the idea of a strong and united Germany In 1918 it replaced the anthem of the German Empire Heil Dir im Siegerkranz when the Emperor Wilhelm II lost power at the end of the First World War In 1921 a fourth stanza a new part or verse was written by poet Albert Matthai with words about the difficult life in Germany at that time It was not sung very often

During the time of Hitler only the first part of the song was used This was often followed by a Nazi party song This part of the song was difficult for some people who were not Germans because it has words describing Germany as a country that included land that was in other countries

After the Second World War Germany was divided into two countries In 1949 the new Western Germany tried to get a new song for the national anthem Another song was chosen written by poet Rudolf Alexander Schrder It was not very popular Finally the third part of the Fallersleben song was made into the national anthem

In the other part of Germany the Eastern Germany the words of poet Johannes R Becher were used with a song written by Hanns Eisler It was not very popular and from the 1970s the words were not sung because of the line Germany our unified fatherland

After East and West Germany united again in 1990 the Fallersleben song again became the national anthem of Germany but only the third part is used Today the first part of the song is popular with nationalist extremists

A cavity is a hole

It can also mean

Evidence is something that is used to support an argument It gives examples of why something is true

For example if someone come across a cup of spilled milk that person could look for evidence as to how the milk was spilled If hairs of a cat and paw prints were found on the ground they could be evidence that suggested that a cat was the cause of the spilled milk

A dyadic is a math function that needs two things in order to give something out Addition and multiplication are dyadic Powers are also dyadic There are many more functions that are dyadic

Dyadic may specifically refer to

A hill is a landform that is higher than the surrounding terrain and that is smaller than a mountain Normally it is not as steep as a mountain The surface of a hill is much more stable than that of a dune

Enzymes are protein molecules in cells which work as catalysts Enzymes speed up chemical reactions in the body but do not get used up in the process 

Almost all biochemical reactions in living things need enzymes With an enzyme reactions work faster than they would without

The substances at the start of the reaction are called substrates The substances at the end of the reaction are the products Enzymes work on the substrates and turn them into products

Enzymes are large molecules made from many amino acids The amino acids link together in a long chain which is folded up into a complex structure Enzymes have a part which holds the substrate a claw cleft hollow or knob to grasp hold stretch and bend the molecule it acts on the substratep37 

There are thousands of different enzymes Enzymes have names which show what they do Enzyme names usually end in ase to show that they are enzymes Examples of this include ATP synthase It makes a chemical called ATP Another example is DNA polymerase It reads an intact DNA strand and uses it as a template to make a new strand 

One example of an enzyme is amylase found in saliva It breaks down starch molecules into smaller glucose and maltose molecules Another kind of enzyme is lipase It breaks down fats into smaller molecules 

The proteases are a whole class of enzymes They break down other enzymes and proteins back into amino acids 

Enzymes are not only for breaking large chemicals into smaller chemicals Other enzymes take smaller chemicals and build them up into bigger chemicals and do many other chemical tasks The classification below lists the main types 

Biochemists often draw a picture of an enzyme to use as a visual aid or map of the enzyme This is hard to do because there may be hundreds or thousands of atoms in an enzyme Biochemists can not draw all this detail Instead they use ribbon models as pictures of enzymes Ribbon models can show the shape of an enzyme without having to draw every atom 

Most enzymes will not work unless the temperature and pH are just right In mammals the right temperature is usually about 37oC degrees The correct pH can vary greatly Pepsin is an example of a enzyme that works best when pH is about 15

Heating an enzyme above a certain temperature will destroy the enzyme permanently It will be broken down by protease and the chemicals will be used again 

Some chemicals can help an enzyme do its job even better These are called activators Sometimes a chemical can slow down an enzyme or even make the enzyme not work at all These are called inhibitors Most drugs are chemicals that either speed up or slow down some enzyme in the human body

The general equation for an enzyme reaction is

An example Sucrase 400 times the size of its substrate sucrose splits the sucrose into its constituent sugars which are glucose and fructose The sucrase bends the sucrose and strains the bond between the glucose and fructose Water molecules join in and make the cleavage in a fraction of a second Enzymes have these key features

There are five main ways that enzyme activity is controlled in the cell

Cofactors or coenzymes are helper molecules which are needed to make an enzyme work They are not proteins and may be organic or inorganic molecules Both types of molecules sometimes contain a metal ion at the centre such as Mg2 Cu2 Mn2 or iron sulphur clusters This is because such ions may act as electron donors and this is important in many reactions The need of enzymes for various little helpers is the basic reason why animals including ourselves need trace elements and vitamins

Enzymes have been classified by the International Union of Biochemistry Their Commission on Enzymes has grouped all known enzymes into six classes

The individual enzymes are given a four figure number which classifies them in the databasep145

A mountain is a natural rise of the Earths surface that usually has a summit It is usually steeper and taller than a hill Mountains are often thought of as being a hill of over 600 metres but this thought is not the same in every country

Mountains are important to life on Earth because most rivers begin in mountains and carry water from the mountains down to the sea 

Mountains can symbolize hard things to overcome or an obstacle It may also symbolize loneliness being brave and more

The forming of a mountain is called orogeny Mountains are formed when rock layers are pushed from opposite sides and they push the crust up A mountain range is a large group of mountains beside each other There are threefour ways a mountain may be made

The height of a mountain is measured as distance above sea level The tallness of a mountain is from the center

The highest mountain in the solar system is the Olympus Mons on Mars The highest mountain in the world is Mount Everestwhich is in NepalTibet in Asia The highest mountain in North America is Mount McKinley in Alaska in the USA The highest in South America is Aconcagua in Argentina For Africa it is Kilimanjaro of Tanzania In Europe the highest mountain is in Russia called Elbrus Antarcticas highest mountain is Vinsin Massiff In Oceania a mountain called Puncak Jaya is the highest there This particular mountain is in Papua New Guinea Indonesia

There are five main types of mountains 

Some people say there are six types as domed mountains can be a plutonic dome or a tectonic dome

Volcanic mountains are mountains that form when molten rock erupts onto the Earths surface They can either form on land or in the ocean The Cascade Range in Washington Oregon and northern California is made of volcanoes Some of the largest volcanoes are on divergent boundaries which form the mid ocean ridges The mid ocean ridges have big volcanic mountain chains that run through the Atlantic Pacific and Indian Oceans The mountains in the mid ocean ridges can actually grow tall enough to create islands such as Iceland or the Azores

Other volcanic mountains can form over hot spots which are pockets of magma beneath the crust that erupt onto Earths surface The Hawaiian Islands are actually the tops of really high volcanic islands that have formed over a hot spot on the sea floor The main Hawaiian island is actually a volcano that is about 9 km above the ocean floor with a base that is about 160 km wide Almost 4 km of this island is above sea level

Dome mountains like those in the Black Hills of South Dakota and the Adirondack Mountains of New York are an unusual domish type of mountain that is formed when molten rock rises through the crust and push up the rock layers above it This creates a circular dome on the Earths surface The molten rock later cools off and forms hardened rock When the pushed up rocks are worn away the hardened rock is shown This hardened rock then wears away in places When it wears away it leaves mountains and they are called dome mountains

Folded mountains make up some of the highest mountains in the world Folded mountains commonly form along boundaries where 2 continents meet Some really complex folds are in parts of the Andes Alps Himalayas Appalachians and Russias Ural Mountains These long mountain chains also show lots of signs of folding

Plateau mountains are formed a bit like folded mountains They are large areas of flat topped rocks that have been lifted high above the crust by continental plates Most plateaus are near folded mountains

Fault block mountains are formed when parts of the Earths crust has been broken off into large block mountains They are also formed when two blocks of land rise above or fall down leaving its middle part behind and when magma pushes up by the lava and forces top layers of rock up with it Domed mountains although have broken and move up as a chunk A fault block mountain is a mountain or range formed as a horst when it was elevated between parallel normal faults A horst is the raised fault block bound by normal faults

Machine code or machine language is the name for commands They can directly be executed by a processor Usually they are 1s and 0s Their order tells the computer what to do This code is the lowest level of software All other kinds of software need to be translated into machine code before they can be used 

Each processor has its own machine code

Each instruction is made up of an opcode and operand An instruction tells the computer to do one thing The operands are usually memory addresses An instruction set is a list of the opcodes used in a computer Machine code is what assemble code Other programming languages are compiled to or interpreted as

Program builders turn code into another language or machine code Machine code is sometimes called native code This is used when talking about things that work on only some computers

Machine code can be written in different forms

Machine code usually offers many kinds of instructions

Many modern processors use microcode for some of the commands More complex commands tend to use it This is often done with CISC architectures

Every processor or processor family has its own machine code instruction set Instructions are patterns of bits They correspond to the different commands that can be given An instruction set is specific to a processor or a family of processors that have a similar set up Newer processors often copy all of its instructions Processors that try to be similar to the original processor can also copy all of its instructions Often newer processors add more instructions not present in the original design 

Sometimes a newer processor will change the meaning of an instruction Sometimes it will no longer support it This can change the compatibility of the code Some old code will no longer work on the newer processor Processors that are similar will sometime act different This is rarely a problem Many systems may also be different in other ways Their access to the memory or its arrangement may be different Computer hardware may be connected in a different way Also the access to other hardware could be changed A program normally relies on such factors For this reason different systems will typically not run the same machine code This is true even when the same type of processor is used

Most instructions have one or more opcode fields They specify the basic instruction type Other fields may give the type of the operands the addressing mode and so on There may also be special instructions They are contained in the opcode itself These instructions are called immediates

Processor designs can be different in other ways Different instructions can have different lengths Also they can have the same length Having all instructions have the same length can simplify the design

The MIPS architecture has instructions which are 32 bits long This section has examples of code The general type of instruction is in the op field It is the highest 6 bits J type and I type instructions are fully given by op R type instructions include the field funct It determines the exact operation of the code The fields used in these types are

rs rt and rd indicate register operands shamt gives a shift amount The address or immediate fields contain an operand directly

Example add the registers 1 and 2 Place the result in register 6 It is encoded

Load a value into register 8 Take it from the memory cell 68 cells after the location listed in register 3

Area is the amount of space a two dimensional surface takes up It is useful because it is how much of a material is needed to make a hollow container for example how much wood is needed to make a wardrobe

You can use different formulas to find the area of different shapes

The area of a flat object is related to the surface area and volume of a three dimensional object

The area under a curve can be found using integration from calculus

Air space is the area of the air that is controlled by a country or organisation You have to have the permission of the controller to enter their air space in an airplane The air traffic controllers make sure the aeroplanes go in the right place and do not crash Some countries are very protective of their air space

Swamp coolers are simple type of air conditioning device that can cool a room of a house or a car by using the cooling effect of the evaporation of water Swamp coolers can cool the air temperature in a small space by drawing the air through wet pads using an electric fan

Swamp coolers work best in dry climates such as the American Southwest and the American South They are usually much cheaper to buy and operate than refrigerated air conditioning devices

Saskatoon is a city in Saskatchewan Canada Saskatoon is the biggest city in Saskatchewan Saskatoon though is not the capital of Saskatchewan Regina is the capital of Saskatchewan  The South Saskatchewan River flows through the centre of the city and many people enjoy boating biking and walking in this area The University of Saskatchewan is also in Saskatoon

Glass rods are sometimes used as stirrers in laboratory environments

Glass rods are often used to spread liquids evenly onto something An example would be to coat glass surfaces with liquids to look at them under a microscope

Glass rods rubbed with silk or fur were used in early demonstrations of electrical energy 

The glass rod may look similar to a thermometer but it does not have the numbers and lines along the side

It is a solid glass tube of 3 mm diameter

We use a thermometer to find how hot or cold a thing person or animal is 

In the past the traditional thermometer was a mercury in glass thermometer People put the end of this in their mouth under their arm or in their rectum For those readers who do not have a clue what the rectum is its your behind 

It is only possible to find oral temperatures on patients who can hold the thermometer correctly in their mouth So small children cannot use this method It is also a problem for people with a cough or people who are vomiting In the past it was a big problem because mercury thermometers needed a long time to find the temperature Today digital thermometers are faster If a person drinks something hot or cold wait before testing their oral temperature 

When finding a persons rectal temperature it helps to use a cream on the thermometer Rectal thermometers are usually more reliable since these arent as much influenced by other factors In some countries people think it is embarrassing to use them for people older than two or three In other countries it is normal for children and adults to use rectal thermometers

In the 1990s people in many countries thought mercury thermometers were too risky as mercury is harmful to humans Today we use electronic thermometers Sometimes thermometers with liquids are used but not with mercury 

There are other kinds of medical thermometers tympanic thermometers test the temperature of the tympan with infrared band thermometers test a persons temperature on the front of their head

A week is seven days in connecting order There are usually fifty two weeks in a year

In the English language the days of a week are named after the gods in Norse mythology except Saturday which is named after a Roman god

Saturday and Sunday are called the week end

A suffix is a few letters put at the end of a word to change its meaning It is a type of affix

Verb examples

Adjective examples

Compare to prefix Prefixes are letters put at the beginning of a word to change its meaning

Japanese Nihon go or Nippon go in Japanese is the language spoken on the island nation of Japan in East Asia A theory about its origin is that Japanese Mongolian and Turkish come from the same family of Altaic languages 

In English the order of the words is very important For example the sentences Is it and It is mean different things In Japanese a lot of these differences are made by adding or changing the endings of words So a Japanese word has a stem called a body and additional parts By changing the suffix you can change the meaning of the word

Japanese has five vowel sounds that can have two different lengths They are ah ee oo eh and o Lengthening a vowel changes the meaning of the word ojisan and ojiisan Japanese has a sound which is like the English L sound but it is also like the English R sound Japanese has a sound which is not common in English which is usually written Tsu This sound appears in tsunami the Japanese word for large ocean waves caused by earthquakes or extreme weather

In Japanese the verb is at the end of the sentence and the subject is at the beginning In many sentences there is no subject The listener can guess what the subject is by thinking about the context and the form of the verb

In Japanese Japan is called Nihon and the Japanese language is called Nihongo Sometimes the words Nippon and Nippongo are also used but today these words are thought of as more nationalist while Nihon is a more neutral word The kanji characters of the word mean sun origin This is because Japan is at the eastern edge of Asia and to observers in China the sun rose from the direction of Japan For this reason Japan is called The Land of Rising Sun

Spice is something that adds flavor to food It is usually used to enrich or alter the quality of something

Examples of a spice would be cinnamon and nutmeg

Spices can be used to give food an interesting and exciting taste

Spices can also be used to hide or cover up bad tastes in the food because it is rotten or affected by fungi eg marzipan

Flavour or Flavor is the quality of anything which affects the taste When someone remarks on the flavor of something they are trying to describe the specific way something tastes

Flavor can also be used to describe the act of adding a taste alteration to something This is usually done by adding spices or sugars though in processed food there are oftentimes artificial flavors

A bank is a place where money can be saved or loaned out from Someones money can be placed in the bank for safe keeping Or the bank can give out loans to people for an agreement to pay the bank back at a later time usually with interest The people who run a bank are called bankers

Banks also can use the money they have from deposits to invest in businesses in order to make more money

In most of the modern world a bank settled by the government but independent of the state administrators controls how much money appears at a time Such a kind of bank is called a national bank A national bank ordinarily issues bills andor coins In some countries issuing money is the task of the government

The word bank comes from an Italian word banco meaning a bench since Italian merchants in the medieval talked on borrowing and lending money between each others beside a bank and money was placed on that bank

Traces of the Phoenician civilization showed a form of currency exchange among troc exchanges it is believed that merchants from Alexandria deposited their valuables in Phoenicia 

Halleys Comet is a comet which comes round every 75 or 76 years When it is near it can be seen with the naked eye It will return in 2061 

The comet is named after Edmond Halley an English astronomer who predicted the comets return Halleys Comet was the first comet to be recognized as periodic

When the comet came close to the Earth in 1986 it was visited by several space probes The probe Giotto from the European Space Agency managed the closest approach to the comet

The number of years that the comet finishes its full cycle can vary depending on the variable of being obstructed by another planets gravitational pull 

The Hubble Space Telescope is a famousproveit telescope It is the first optical telescope orbiting the Earth Being above the atmosphere means it can see the sky more clearly than a telescope on the ground because the atmosphere blurs starlight before it reaches earth Named after the astronomer Edwin Hubble the Hubble Space Telescope can observe 24 hours a day The telescope can take pictures of things so far away it would be nearly impossible to see them from anywhere else

It actually observes less than 20 of the time It was made by both NASA and the ESA working together It is 600 km in space and was launched April 24 1990 It completes a full orbit of Earth every 97 minutes That means it travels at 5 miles per second If you were going this speed on Earth you would be able to get from New York to San Francisco in 10 minutes

The Hubble itself is the size of a large school bus but still small enough to fit inside the cargo bay of a Space Shuttle It was repaired in 1993 due to imperfections in the picture quality

The telescope was launched in 1990 by a space shuttle When it entered orbit everything seemed fine But there was a problem with the telescope that was not discovered until it started taking pictures

When the HST took its first pictures astronomers were so happy to see the images but they were not as sharp and as crisp as expected They noticed a problem with the telescopes mirror The mirror was not curved right but only by 0002 inches Still this was enough to cause the images to be blurred Some said unkindly that Hubble was nearsighted

Another space shuttle was sent up shortly after to repair the space telescope The repair was far from easy What the astronauts would do is install cameras and other optical equipment to compensate for the wrongly curved mirror When astronaut Story Musgrave opened one of the doors on Hubble to install a new camera the door would not close so Musgrave and the other astronauts had to think of a creative way to get around the problem Eventually Hubble was fixed

Repairs and servicing missions have been made to the Hubble Space Telescope now and then

Hubble will soon be replaced by other better and more complex telescopes like the NGST and the Terrestrial Planet Finder

A motion sensor is a sensor device It is used for studying motions It is connected to a data logger The data logger is connected to a computer The computer runs a data logging program The computer is connected to power and a security system Motion sensors have many uses including security

An arm is a limb Most humans have two arms each coming out of their body just below the neck On the end of each arm is a hand Humans use arms and hands to do things to other objects this is called manipulation The main purpose of the hand is to grasp objects Some other primates have arms which they use to move around by holding onto trees or supporting themselves as they walk along the ground

An arrow is a shape used to point to something Arrows look like this  Double headed arrows look like this 

  

Golf is a game played in an open field where the golfer plays his golf ball into a hole by using different types of clubs The book Rules of Golf reads The Game of Golf consists in playing a ball from the teeing ground into the hole by a stroke or successive strokes in accordance with the Rules

In golf a golfer plays a number of holes in a given order 18 holes played in an order controlled by the golf course design normally make up a game On a nine hole course two nine hole rounds make up a normal game

The two common forms of playing golf are match play and stroke play In match play two golfers play holes one at a time The golfer with the lower number of strokes wins that hole If the two have the same number of strokes the hole is halved The golfer that has the greatest number of holes wins In stroke play the golfer with the smallest number of strokes all together wins There are different forms of these rules some given in the Rules of Golf making them official

The four different clubs are woods irons putters and wedges A golfer uses about 3 woods about 10 irons and a putter The rules do not let the golfer use over 14 clubs in a game

Golfers call the four biggest tournaments in professional golf majors and they play them at nearly the same time every year The four majors are

Spirituality is a name given to matters of the spirit Some people use this word instead of religion while others see a difference

Matters of the spirit may not include the meaning in a persons life and how to find and improve on it They may also include someones search for God the supernatural a broken wikt linkdivinedivine influence in their lives or information about the afterlife and how to best deal with each Matters of the spirit may also include how to live among others as a group or in a certain environment

Some who do not believe in an organized religion may still be interested in the spirits of humanity or of nature and live a certain way or pay broken wikt linkhomagehomage to ancestors or creation because it helps their broken wikt linkmoralemorale or gives them a sense of happiness to do so

Another common usage refers to people who ascribe to ideals greater than themselves For many this leads to a pursuit of some form of enlightenment often through meditation yoga philosophy or in some cases a study of Metaphysics

Many philosophers work to find answers to spiritual questions although some may deny the existence of a god or any supernatural influences Throughout the world however philosophers have often had ideas about spirituality The following are a few 20th century examples

Gregory Bateson  philosopher focused on the interplay of nature ecology and psychology

Jiddu Krishnamurti  renowned Indian scholar known as a great thinker in the realm of life and religion

OshoShri Rashneesh  Indian scholar who while a very public critic of religion worked diligently to create a new and revolutionary spiritual movement

Some spiritual based religions

The year 2007 was called

Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows

1989 was a common year starting on Sunday of the Gregorian calendar It was also the last year of the 1980s decade

A common year is a year that is not a leap year In the Gregorian Calendar a common year has 365 days This means a common year has 52 weeks and one day So if a certain year started on a Monday the following year will start on a Tuesday Stated differently a common year always begins and ends on the same day of the week 

In the Gregorian calendar 303 out of every 400 years are common years In the Julian calendar 300 out of every 400 years were common years All the other years are special and known as leap years

These are the 12 months in a year

There are 7 months with 31 days There are 4 months with 30 days There is 1 month with 28 days Every 4 years there is 29 days in February which is called a leap year This happens because every year is 365 and 14 days but instead of us having a spare quarter of a day in each year we add them all up every 4 years and make an extra day to avoid confusion and make things easier for everyone

A decade is a period of 10 years The word comes from the Ancient Greek word for ten deka 10 decades make a century Decades in the 20th century are normally called the eighties or the nineties and written the 80s or the 90s Decades in other centuries are written in full eg the 1890s

The 19th century is the century from 1801 to 1900 Most of this century is normally called the Victorian period because Queen Victoria ruled the United Kingdom The Industrial Revolution started in this century in most western countries

Note years before or after the 19th century are in italics

The 21st century is the century that began on January 1 2001 and will end on December 31 2100 It is the current century

Note The years before or after the 21st century are in italics

STP are the conditions most often used in chemistry to study or test a chemical

STP is 0 C and 1 atm

STP may refer to

A human or human being is a person The scientific name for the human species is Homo sapiens which means wise man in Latin 

Humans are bipedal which means they walk on two legs Humans have a complex brain which lets them use language make ideas and feel emotions This brain and the fact that arms are not needed for walking lets humans use tools which they do more than any other species 

There are over 7 billion people alive on planet Earth as of 2011 There are humans living on every continent 

Humans are part of the animal order of primates Apes are also primates and are the nearest animal relations to humans 

Humans like other primates are social animals They usually live in groups helping and protecting each other and caring for their offspring 

Humans have a long period of development after birth Partly this is because they have a great deal to learn Their life depends less on instinct than other animals and more on learning 

Humans are born with their brains not so well developed as other mammals There is a good reason for this If their brains were better developed they would be larger and this would make birth more difficult In birth the babys head has to get through the birth canal which is a passageway through the mothers pelvis

Many animals use signs and sounds to communicate with each other Humans have developed a special system called language It allows them to express ideas by using words Humans are capable of making abstract ideas and communicating them to others Human language can express things that are not present or talk about events that are not happening at that time The things might be elsewhere and the events may also have occurred at another place or time No known animals have a system of communication that is as elaborate as human language

By using words to communicate with each other humans make complex communities with laws traditions and customs Humans like to understand the world around them They try to explain things through religion science and philosophy Wanting to understand things has helped many humans make important discoveries 

Humans are the only species living today known to build fires to cook their food and wear clothes Humans use more technology than any other animal on Earth ever has Humans like things that are beautiful and like to make art literature and music Humans use education and teaching to pass on skills ideas and customs to the next generations

Humans are part of the animal kingdom They are mammals which means that they give birth to their young ones rather than laying eggs like reptiles or birds and the female humans are able to feed their babies with breast milk Humans belong to the order of primates Apes like gorillas and gibbons are also primates The closest living relatives of humans are the two chimpanzee species the Common Chimpanzee and the Bonobo Scientists have examined the genes of humans and chimpanzees and compared their DNA The studies showed that 95 to 995 of the DNA of humans and chimpanzees is the same  

Biologists explain the similarity between humans and other apes by their descent from a common ancestor In 2001 a hominid skull was discovered in Chad The skull is about 7 million years old and has been classified as Sahelanthropus tchadensis This skull may show that the date at which humans started to evolve from other primates is 2 million years earlier than scientists had previously thought

Humans are part of a subfamily called homininae inside the hominids or great apes 

Long ago there used to be other types of hominins on Earth They were like modern humans but not the same Homo sapiens are the only type of hominins who are alive today The earliest known fossils of genus Homo have been called Homo habilis The first fossils of Homo habilis were found in Tanzania Homo hablilis is thought to have lived about 22 to 17 million years ago Another human species thought to be an ancestor of the modern human is Homo erectus There are other extinct species of Homo known today Many of them were likely our cousins as they developed differently than our ancestors A theory called the Sahara pump theory has been used to tell how different species of plants and animals moved from Africa to the Middle East and then elsewhere Early humans may have moved from Africa to other parts of the world in the same way

 Out of Africa  The first truly modern humans seem to have appeared between 200000 and 130000 years ago These early humans later moved out from Africa By about 90000 years ago they had moved into Eurasia and the Middle East This was the area where Neanderthals Homo neanderthalensis had been living for a long time

By about 42 to 44000 years ago Homo sapiens had reached western Europe including Britain In Europe and western Asia Homo sapiens replaced the Neanderthals by about 35000 years ago The details of this event are not known

At roughly the same time Homo sapiens arrived in Australia Their arrival in the Americas was much later about 15000 years ago All these earlier groups of modern man were hunter gatherers

Early human history is commonly divided into three ages The time periods are labeled with the material used for tools

The Stone Age is commonly subdivided into the Paleolithic Mesolithic and Neolithic periods

Up to about 10 thousand years ago most humans were hunter gatherers That means they hunted for their food or gathered it from wild plants Most humans at this time did not live in one place but moved around as the seasons changed The start of planting crops for food called farming meant that some people chose to live in broken wikt linkstaticstatic settlements This also led to the invention of metal tools and the training of animals About 6000 years ago the first proper civilisations began in places like Egypt India and Syria The people formed governments and armies for protection They competed for area to live and resources and sometimes they fought with each other About 4000 years ago some states took over or broken wikt linkconqueredconquered other states and made empires Examples include ancient Greece and the Roman Empire 

Some modern day religions also began at this time such as Judaism and Hinduism From the Middle Ages and beyond humanity saw an explosion of new technology and inventions The printing press the car the train and electricity are all examples of this kind of invention As a result of the developments in technology modern humans live in a world where everyone is connected for example by telephone or by internet People now control and change the environment around them in many different ways

In early times humans usually settled near to water and other natural resources In modern times if people need things they can transport them from somewhere else So basing a settlement close to resources are is no longer as important as it once was Since 1800 the number of humans or population has increased by six billion Most humans live in Asia The rest live in the Americas Africa Europe and Oceania 

Most people live in towns and cities This number is expected to get higher In 2005 the United Nations said that by the end of that year over half the world would be living in cities This is an important change in human settlement patterns a century earlier in 1900 only 14 of people lived in cities in 2000 47 of the worlds population lived in cities In developed countries like the United States 80 of the population live in cities 

Humans have a large effect on the world Humans are at the top of the food chain and are generally not eaten by any animals Humans have been described as Super Predators because of this Because of industry and other reasons humans are said to be a big cause of global climate change 

Human body types can be very different from each other The average height of an adult human is between 5 and 6 feet The average weight is between 76 and 83 kg for males and 54 64 kg for females

Human hair grows on the underarms the genitals and the top of the head in both genders and on the chest legs back and face of males Although it might look like humans have less hair than most primates they actually do not The average human has more hair follicles where hair grows from than most chimpanzees Human hair can be brown red blonde or most commonly black  Modern humans can also have their hair in many different colours by using dye When humans get older hair can turn grey or even white 

Human skin colours vary greatly They can be a very pale pink all the way up to dark brown Human skin can get darker when under sunlight Sunlight is part UV radiation The UV radiation in the light makes the skin change colour over a long time This is called a sun tan 

Humans are not as strong as other primates the same size An average female orang utan is at least three times as strong as an average human man

The average human male needs 7 to 8 hours sleep a day People who sleep less than this are generally not as healthy A child needs more sleep 9 to 10 hours on average

The human life cycle is quite like most other mammals The young grow inside the female mother for nine months After this time the baby is pushed out of the womans vagina Unlike most other animals human childbirth is quite dangerous Because human brains are so big babys heads are wide The mothers pelvis bones are also not very wide because people walk on two legs This combination means that quite often either mother andor baby die in childbirth The number of mothers dying in childbirth is less in the 21st century This is because of better medication and treatment In many poor countries the number of mothers dying is very high Sometimes it is up to 10 times as many as richer countries

The average human baby weighs 3 4 kg at birth and is 50 60 cm tall This is often less in poorer countries Many babies in poor countries often die early because of this

Humans have four stages in their lives infancy adolescence adulthood and old age 

Life expectancy is how long you are expected to live for This depends on many things including where you live The highest life expectancy is for people from Hong Kong The lowest is for people from Swaziland where mainly because of AIDS life expectancy is only 31 years

Psychology is the study of how the human mind works The human brain controls everything the body does Everything from moving and breathing to thinking is done by the brain Neurology is the study of how the brain works psychology is the study of how and why people think and feel

Human behaviour is hard to understand so sometimes psychologists study animals because they may be simpler and easier to understand Psychology overlaps with many other sciences including Medicine Biology Computer Science and Linguistics

Language at its most basic is talking reading and writing The study of language is called linguistics Humans have the most complicated languages on Earth Human language is much more complicated than any other species There are 7300 languages spoken around the world as of 2008 The worlds most spoken first language as of 2008 is Mandarin Chinese however the most spoken language is English

Art has existed almost as long as humans People have been doing some types of art for thousands of years as the picture on the right shows Art represents how someone feels in the form of a painting a sculpture or a photograph 

Music has also been around for thousands of years Music can be made with only your voice but most of the time people use instruments Music can be made using simple instruments only such as simple drums all the way up to electric guitars keyboards and violins Music can be loud fast quiet slow or many different styles Music represents how the people who are playing the music feel 

Literature is anything made or written using language This includes books poetry legends myths and fairy tales Literature is important as without it many of the things we use today such as Wikipedia wouldnt exist

Humans often categorize themselves by race or ethnicity Human races are questionable as valid biological categories Human racial categories are based on both ancestry and visible traits such as skin color and facial features These categories may also carry some information on non visible biological traits such as the risk of developing particular diseases such as sickle cell disease Current genetic and archaeological evidence generally support a recent single origin of modern humans in East Africa Current genetic studies show that humans from Africa are most genetically diverse But human gene sequences are very similar compared to many other animals 

Ethnic groups are often linked by linguistic cultural ancestral and national or regional ties Race and ethnicity can lead to different social treatment called racism

Religion is the belief in a higher being spirit or anything for which there is no proof Because there is no proof for these things people need faith Faith can bring people together because they all believe in the same thing Some of the things religions talk about are what happens after death why humans exist how humans began and what is good to do and not to do Some people are not religious some people are very religious and some people believe a mixture of science and religion 

Technology is the things people make to help them do things Science is understanding how the universe and the things in it work Technology used to be quite simple It was passed on by people telling other people until writing was invented This allowed technology to develop much quicker Now people understand more and more about the world and the universe The invention of the telescope by Galileo Einsteins theory of relativity and the big bang theory are all big technological  to do with technology  discoveries Technology has come forward enough to allow things such as the internet space travel and television

A war is a conflict between large groups of people usually countries or states A war often involves the use of dangerous force as both sides try to kill each other It is estimated that during the 20th century between 167 and 188 million humans died because of war The people who fight in wars are called soldiers 

Modern wars are very different from wars a thousand or even a hundred years ago Modern war involves sabotage terrorism propaganda and guerrilla warfare In modern day wars civilians  people who are not soldiers  are often targets An example of this is the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II The bombs killed as many as 140000 people in Hiroshima and 80000 in Nagasaki by the end of 1945 about half on the days of the bombings Since then thousands more have died from wounds or illness because of exposure to radiation released by the bombs In both cities the overwhelming majority of the dead were civilians In Germany Austria and Great Britain conventional bombs were used About 60595 British and 550000 German civilians were killed during bombings of cities from warplanes

The jungle is a forest in a tropical place In jungles it rains a lot Scientists think that more types of animals and plants live in the jungles than everywhere else Jungles are hot most of the time When many people talk about jungles they may also mean rainforests

Light is a type of energy It is a form of electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength which can be detected by the human eye In physics the term light sometimes refers to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength whether visible or not Light exists in tiny packets called photons It shows properties of both waves and particles The study of light known as optics is an important research area in modern physics

Five main properties of light are intensity frequency or wavelength polarization phase and orbital angular momentum

In a vacuum light moves at the speed of light which is 299792458 meters or about 186282 miles per second This means it takes about 8 minutes for light to reach Earth from the Sun In glass it travels at about two thirds as fast

Light moves in a straight line creating shadows when the path of light is blocked More solid things will have a darker shadow things that are more clear have a lighter shadow and transparent things will have none or very little shadow Light can pass through transparent things the most easily Our eyes react to light when we see something we see the light it reflects or the light it emits For example a lamp gives off light and everything else in the same room as the lamp reflects its light

Every colour of light has a different wavelength The shorter the wavelength the more energy the light has The speed at which light moves does not depend on its energy Going through partly clear objects can slow light down by a very small amount

White light is made up of many different colors of light added together When white light shines through a prism it splits up into different colors becoming a spectrum The spectrum contains all of the wavelengths of light that we can see Red light has the longest wavelength and violet light has the shortest

Light with a wavelength shorter than violet is called ultraviolet light X rays and Gamma rays are also forms of light with even shorter wavelengths than ultraviolet Light with a wavelength longer than red is called infrared light Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength even longer than infrared light The microwaves that are used to heat food in a microwave oven are also a form of electromagnetic radiation Our eyes cannot see those kinds of energy but there are some cameras that can see them The various forms of light both visible and invisible are the electromagnetic spectrum

When light is refracted in raindrops a rainbow is made The raindrop acts like a prism and refracts the light until we can see the colors of the spectrum

Stockholm is the capital city of Sweden It is also the biggest city in Sweden It is on the east coast of the country The city is built on islands with canals and open water in the inner city Stockholm is found between Swedens third largest lake Mlaren and the Baltic Sea

Tyresta National Park is near Stockholm

Central Stockholm has four different parts  Kungsholmen Sdermalm Norrmalm and stermalm Kungsholmen and Sdermalm are islands while Norrmalm and stermalm are parts of the mainland Also there are several smaller islands in the inner city  Gamla Stan Riddarholmen Djurgrden and Skeppsholmen Since Stockholm has so many islands it is sometimes referred to as the Venice of the North

Gamla Stan is the oldest part of the city  the name means Old Town and is usually called that in English Djurgrden is mostly a large park but there are buildings on the island Most of these are museums that commemorate Swedens and Stockholms past  like Skansen a zoo with a Swedish theme Skeppsholmen is an island that used to be a training ground and military school but most of the buildings are now used for museums and art galleries such as the Modern Museum or the East Asian museum Riddarholmen is a part of Gamla Stan but actually a different island

All of the islands in Stockholm are connected by several bridges The biggest one is Vsterbron going from Kungsholmen to Sdermalm 

Birger Jarl is considered the founder of Stockholm It is believed that he rebuilt a defense building in the 13th century on what is today the island of the Old town Around the fortification a town grew The town grew mainly because of its sea and land trading

Rain are droplets of water falling from clouds in the sky that are bigger than 05 mm Droplets of water that are about 02mm to 05mm big are called drizzle Rain is a kind of precipitation Precipitation is any kind of water that falls from clouds in the sky like rain hail sleet and snow Rain is part of the water cycle

Convectional rain happens in places of the world that are hot and wet Sometimes it also takes place in tropical deserts and inland areas during summer when temperatures are hot During the day the sun makes the ground very hot Air near the ground surface is heated by conduction The heated air expands becoming less dense and rises in a strong upwards air current When the temperature of the rising air falls to the dew point water vapor shrinks into thick clouds and forms convection rain Depending on the temperature it may fall as sleet or snow

Relief rain usually happens along coastal areas where a line of hills runs along to the coast When wet onshore wind from the sea meets a mountain hill or any other sort of barrier it is forced to rise along the slope and cools When the air temperature falls to its dew point water vapor condenses to form clouds When the clouds can no longer hold the water droplets relief rain begins to fall on the windward slope of the mountain On the leeward slope air sinks it is warmed and further dried by compression Therefore the leeward slope is known as rain shadow Moist winds blow in from the sea and are forced to rise over the land The air cools and the water vapour condenses forming rain drops Relief rain is also a very dense and cold mixture of precipitation As well as frontal rain the UK is also affected by relief or orographic rain

Relief or orographic rain is formed when air is forced to cool when it rises over relief features in the landscape such as hills or mountains As it rises it cools condenses and forms rain The highest rainfall totals of over 1600 mm per year occur in the mountain areas along the west coast There is often a rain shadow effect whereby the leeward slope receives a relatively small amount of rain

Frontal rain is when a cold front meets a warm air front The less dense warm air rises and condenses forming clouds These clouds get heavier and it eventually rains The cold air front tends to come from the north west and the warm air front comes from the south west

A Rainstorm is a sudden heavy fall of rain It may cause floods on land which is not much above the level of the sea for example flat coastal land and river basins Too much water can make rivers overflow and cause floods Also landslides may happen This is bad news as people may drown For example over 6 million people died just last year from rainstorms

2009 was a common year starting on Thursday of the Gregorian calendar It was also the last year of the 2000s decade

2009 was designated as the

Gambling is a contest where a player bets on the result of an event The bet is generally in the form of money The outcome is dependent on the predictability of the event The rules and the amount of money bet are decided on before the event happens

There are three variables common to all gambling

There are many types of gambling Casino games parimutuel games sports betting and state lotteries are some of the most common forms of gambling

Generally the odds are not in favor of the gambler

Many people gamble for fun and entertainment For others it becomes an addiction and a financial burden 

Investments such as stocks bonds and real estate are not usually considered forms of gambling

Monty Python also known as The Pythons is a group of British actors who have acted in several comedy movies and had a television show Monty Pythons Flying Circus which was originally between 1969 and 1974 and is still well known and watched around the world

The members of Monty Python are John Cleese Eric Idle Graham Chapman Terry Gilliam Terry Jones and Michael Palin

Time zones give specific areas on the Earth a time of day that is earlier or later than the neighboring time zones This is because when it is day time on one side of the Earth it is night time on the other side There are 39 time zones dividing the Earth into different times each with its own name like the North American Eastern Time Zone The North American Eastern Time Zone contains large cities in North America like New York City and Miami

Greenwich Mean Time is the time in London and is often used for things that involve more than one time zone

Rapid travel across several time zones often causes Jet Lag a disorder of the circadian rhythms causing disturbed sleep and mood

A market is a place where people go to buy or sell things When people have products to sell they set up a market place There may be a special building for the market place or the market may be held in an open space where the sellers can put up a stall and then take the stall down at the end of the day

The word market can also have a more general meaning in the economy It can mean the way things are bought or sold There is a big market for dishwashers means that lots of people want to buy dishwashers so therefore a business that makes dishwashers is likely to be able to make a lot of money When things are sold people buy the product and this stimulates the economy The market needs to balance supply and demand There is no point in supplying lots of dishwashers if people do not want them In the market prices may change quickly if supply or demand changes

If a seller of a good cannot supply what costumers want or ask for too high of a price other sellers may try to supply that good If other sellers enter the market for that good in competition that will tend to fulfill demand and lower prices Sellers do not like competition and may try to kill the competition Sellers that kill competition want to earn profits that they should not get and they must be stopped by laws

An electron is a very small piece of matter and energy Its symbol is e 

The electron is a subatomic particle It is believed to be an elementary particle because it cannot be broken down into anything smaller It is negatively charged and may move almost at the speed of light 

Electrons take part in gravitational electromagnetic and weak interactions The electricity that powers radios motors and many other things consists of many electrons moving through wires or other conductors

Electrons have the smallest electrical charge An electron has a mass of about 11836 times a proton One way to think about the location of electrons in an atom is to imagine that they orbit at fixed distances from the nucleus This way electrons in an atom exist in a number of electron shells surrounding the central nucleus Each electron shell is given a number 1 2 3 and so on starting from the one closest to the nucleus Each shell can hold up to a certain maximum number of electrons The distribution of electrons in the various shells is called electronic arrangement Electronic arrangement can be shown by numbering or an electron diagram

The electron is one of a class of subatomic particles called leptons The electron has a negative electric charge and a mass that is approximately 12000 of the mass of the proton The electron has another property called spin Its spin value is 12 which makes it a fermion

While most electrons are found in atoms others move independently in matter or together as cathode rays in a vacuum In some superconductors electrons move in pairs When electrons flow this flow is called electricity or an electric current 

An object can be described as negatively charged if there are more electrons than protons in an object or positively charged when there are more protons than electrons Electrons can move from one object to another when touched They may be attracted to another object with opposite charge or repelled when they both have the same charge When an object is grounded electrons from the charged object go into the ground making the object neutral This is what lightning conductors do

Electrons in their shells round an atom are the basis of chemical reactions Complete outer shells with maximum electrons are less reactive Outer shells with less than maximum electrons are reactive The number of electrons in atoms is the underlying basis of the chemical periodic table

Electric charge can be directly measured with a device called an electrometer Electric current can be directly measured with a galvanometer The measurement given off by a galvanometer is different from the measurement given off by an electrometer Today laboratory instruments are capable of containing and observing individual electrons

In laboratory conditions the interactions of individual electrons can be observed by means of particle detectors which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy spin and charge In one instance a Penning trap was used to contain a single electron for 10 months The magnetic moment of the electron was measured to a precision of eleven digits which in 1980 was a greater accuracy than for any other physical constant

The first video images of an electrons energy distribution were captured by a team at Lund University in Sweden February 2008 The scientists used extremely short flashes of light called attosecond pulses which allowed an electrons motion to be observed for the first time The distribution of the electrons in solid materials can also be visualized

The antiparticle of the electron is called a positron This is identical to the electron but carries electrical and other charges of the opposite sign When an electron collides with a positron they may scatter off each other or be totally annihilated producing a pair of gamma ray photons

The effects of electrons were known long before it could be explained The Ancient Greeks knew that rubbing amber against fur attracted small objects Now we know the rubbing strips off electrons and that gives an electric charge to the amber Many physicists worked on the electron JJ Thomson proved it existed in 1897 but another man gave it the name electron

Chile is a long thin country which is on the western side of South America The people there speak Spanish

Chile which claims a part of the Antarctic continent is the longest country on earth The Atacama Desert in the north of the country is the driest place on earth The average rainfall there is less than 005 mm per year The center of Chile with the two cities Santiago and Valparaso has a Mediterranean climate with an average temperatures of 28 C in January and 11 C in July In the middle of Chile the country is very fertile  

There are about 169 million people living in Chile in 2009 About 10 million people live in the center of Chile around Valparaso and Santiago on about 20 of the total territory Chile is a well educated country Only 27 are not able to read or write Some believe that Chile has one of the best school systems in South America 

About 95 of Chileans are Caucasian mostly Spanish and Italian Around 3 of the population is Native American and about 2 European immigrants The majority of people are Roman Catholic About 10 are Protestant and there are some Jews as well The countrys official language is Spanish Chili did not derive from this country although it shares a common name 

Chiles currency is the Chilean peso

An ambassador is a person sent by the government of a country to a different country The ambassador is the official representative of their country The ambassador speaks to officials of the other country about any problems and issues between the two countries

In past years communication between countries could take days or weeks It was necessary to have a person in each foreign capital to have meetings and make negotiations between countries These days communication is much faster and often governments can be in direct contact with each other But it is still true that many problems require person to person meetings so ambassadors are still needed

Often an ambassador will live in the foreign country for a number of years An embassy is where the ambassador lives and it is most often located in the capital of the foreign country An ambassador may bring people with him to help him and work at the embassy Some of the high ranking people may be called embassy officials

It is both tradition and law that the ambassador and many embassy officials have diplomatic immunity They cannot be arrested or prosecuted in the foreign country The only possibility is to send a person back to their own country

Monday is the second day of the week in some countries In other parts of the world such as some countries in Europe Monday is said to be the first day of the week

A nuclear war is a war in which the opposing sides fight with nuclear weapons No full scale nuclear war has ever happened but because nuclear weapons are extremely powerful and could cause destruction throughout the world the possibility of nuclear war has had a great effect on international politics

Nuclear bombs were first invented during the Second World War and were used by the United States to bring about the surrender of Japan Two bombs were dropped one each on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki They are still the only nuclear weapons that have ever been used in fighting a war At that time only the USA had the technology needed to make the bomb but within a few years the Soviet Union had developed it too This led to the Cold War in which the USA and the Soviets were enemies and each had large stockpiles of nuclear weapons but did not dare to use them against each other either directly or by attacking the other countrys allies Since either country could be completely destroyed by the others weapons nuclear war could no longer be limited to the use of only one or two bombs if they were used anywhere by one side the other would attack with its own nuclear weapons and the fighting would almost certainly escalate This situation came to be known as the balance of terror or Mutually Assured Destruction and prevented conflicts between the two superpowers from leading to a third world war

Since the end of Communist rule in Russia and Eastern Europe tensions between America and Russia have eased and war has become less likely However today there is more worry about the spread of bomb making technology Countries around the world who already have their own bombs include Britain France China Israel India Pakistan and North Korea as all kinds of technology tend to become cheaper and easier to get hold of there is a fear that nuclear weapons could become available to countries with unstable governments There is also the possibility that terrorists might be able to build nuclear weapons and use them

Ever since the end of World War Two writers film makers and artists have created works imagining how a nuclear war might happen and what life would be like afterwards Most have pictured widespread death and destruction and a grim post holocaust world where a few survivors struggle to live without power medicine or food Some have pictured civilisation breaking down completely and primitive societies developing with the past world becoming forgotten

Tax is money that people are forced to pay to the government

In ancient times people from one city or region would attack people from another place and make them pay tribute Tribute meant that the conquered people would pay money and the conqueror would stop attacking them A famous tribute was the Danegeld when people from Denmark conquered part of England and made the English pay thousands of silver coins In a tax the government makes the people of a country state or city pay money This money goes to pay people who work for the government and to pay for things that the government does

There are lots of different kinds of taxes Some taxes are based on how much money a person earns The more money is earned the more a person must pay This is called an income tax 

There are three different types of income taxes

Other taxes are based on how much a person buys This is a sales tax or value added tax Some people suggest replacing the income tax with a larger sale tax That idea is called the fair tax 

There are also taxes based on how much a person owns called property tax Things like houses have a property tax on them 

In the United States for example the national government has an income tax most states have an income tax or a sales tax or both and cities and towns may have a sales tax or a property tax In some states such as Ohio the sales tax is different in each county

The government uses the money collected from taxes to pay for things For example people who work for the government must be paid so some taxes are used to pay these people Taxes are sometimes also used in ways that help everybody like to pay for education health care and to keep things like roads bridges sewers and certain buildings in good shape

Florida is a state in the southeast United States It is a peninsula which means that water surrounds the state on three of four possible sides To the west is the Gulf of Mexico to the south is the Florida Straits and to the east is the Atlantic Ocean As of 2010 the population of Florida is 18801310 

Florida is a very flat state It has no mountains Northern Florida has hills because it is at the very end of the Appalachian Mountains The highest hill in Florida is Britton Hill in northern Walton County near the town of Lakewood Florida It is 345 feet above sea level It is the shortest of the highest points in all other states

Florida has a very long coastline which means lots of beaches The Gulf Stream ocean current goes through the Atlantic Ocean near the east coast of Florida so the water there is very warm compared to the Pacific Ocean The Gulf of Mexico on the west coast of Florida is also very warm because it is small and easily heated by the sun

In the center of southern Florida is a very big lake called Lake Okeechobee It is the seventh largest freshwater lake in the United States and the second largest freshwater lake entirely within the lower 48 states Okeechobee is 730 square miles about half the size of the state of Rhode Island and is very shallow for a lake of its size with an average depth of only 9 feet

A lot of south Florida used to be covered by a swamp called the Everglades When Florida was first being settled farmers found out the soil there was very good for growing plants So they could use more of the land to plant they drained a lot of the water away in 1882 In 1947 the state put in levees and canals to make more room for farming and houses The Everglades is now about half the size it used to be Most of what is left is now the Everglades National Park Lots of animals live there including alligators and Florida panthers Recently Florida has been trying to restore the Everglades

At the southernmost tip of Florida is a chain of islands called the Florida Keys There are 4500 islands in the Keys The most famous one is Key West

Florida is the Sunshine State The reason for this nickname is its warm temperature During the summer temperatures may rise up to as high as 109 degrees Fahrenheit Its average temperature is much warmer than many of the other states but during winter temperatures occasionally fall below 32 degrees Fahrenheit In Florida there are many palm trees Palm trees grow in places that have a warm climate and a lot of sunshine Florida has both a rainy season and a dry season Southern Florida does not have four separate seasons

Floridas sunny climate is very popular with visitors The summer is great for surfing the waves and enjoying the beaches The most popular sport in Florida is fishing A lot of people also like to visit the beaches on the west side of Florida near Tampa

Florida also gets a lot of hurricanes Florida is surrounded by warm water which makes hurricanes get stronger Hurricane season is from June 1 to November 30 but sometimes a hurricane will hit outside of the season Hurricane Andrew was a very bad hurricane that hit Florida on August 23 1992 Floridas most active recorded hurricane season was in 2004 when it was hit by hurricanes Charley Frances Ivan and Jeanne

Florida has many types of wildlife including

In the 1930s the Red imported fire ants were accidentally brought from South America to North America Since then they have spread to most of the Southern United States including Florida They are more aggressive than most native ant species and have a painful sting

A lot of non native snakes have been released in the wild In 2010 the state created a hunting season for Burmese Indian and African rock pythons green anacondas and Nile monitor lizards

The capital of Florida is Tallahassee and Jacksonville is the states largest city Tallahassee is in the part of Florida called the panhandle or the narrow part in the northwest There are other big cities in Florida like Tampa Orlando and Miami 

Orlando is home to many amusement and theme parks like Walt Disney World Resort Sea World and Universal Studios Millions of tourists visit Orlando each year There is also Busch Gardens in Tampa 

The oldest city in Florida is St Augustine which was founded by the Spanish in 1565

Mario usually saves Princess Peach the Mushroom Kingdom and he usually has to defeat villains like Bowser in lots of different kingdoms Most characters in the games know who he is because he acts like a hero as shown in Mario Luigi Superstar Saga where they are called superstars or celebrities

In Mario vs Donkey Kong 2 March of the Minis it is said that Mario has a toy making company that earns him money

Since his first game Mario has to save the damsel in distress of the game Originally he had to rescue his girlfriend Pauline in Donkey Kong Pauline was soon replaced by a new damsel in distress Princess Peach in Super Mario Bros Pauline returned in the Game Boy remake of Donkey Kong in 1994 and later Mario vs Donkey Kong 2 March of the Minis in 2006 although the character is now said to be Marios friend

Mario has rescued Princess Peach lots of times since Super Mario Bros In a role reversal Peach rescues Mario in Super Princess Peach Some people say the two could be a couple

Luigi is Marios younger brother He is usually a companion on many of Marios adventures and the character whom players play as in two player sessions of many of the video games His demeanor is sometimes that of a scaredy cat who sets off to help Mario but instead needs rescuing himself though he has also had to rescue Mario occasionally as displayed in Mario is Missing and Luigis Mansion Yoshi is another one of Marios friends

Mario rescued Princess Daisy in Super Mario Land for the Game Boy In Super Smash Bros Melee the text explaining Princess Daisys trophy states that after her appearance in Mario Golf some gossips portrayed her as Luigis answer to Marios Peach although Luigi and Daisy were previously paired as a romantic couple in the live action Super Mario Bros film

During the development of Donkey Kong Mario was known as Jumpman Jumpingboth to access places and as an offensive moveis a common gameplay element in Mario games especially the Super Mario Bros series

Marios most commonly portrayed form of attack is jumping to stomp on the heads of enemies first used in Mario Bros This jump stomp move may entirely crush smaller enemies on the stage and usually deals damage to larger ones sometimes also causing secondary effects This attack often enables Mario to knock the turtle like Koopa Troopas into their shells which can slide into and damage other enemies or Mario

Subsequent games have elaborated on Marios jumping related abilities Super Mario World added the ability to spin jump which allows Mario to break blocks beneath him Later the Game Boy version of Donkey Kong allows Mario to jump higher with consecutive jumps and perform a back flip In Super Mario 64 Mario has several jumping abilities such as a sideways somersault a ground pound and the Wall Kick which propels him upwards by kicking off walls

Mario uses many items which give him various powers The most prominent of these is the Super Mushroom which allows Mario to grow to twice his size becoming the eponymous Super Mario and can sustain damage before shrinking back down to regular Mario Additionally collecting a Fire Flower transforms Mario into Fire Mario and allows him to throw fireballs at enemies and a Starman renders Mario temporarily impervious to harm 

A recurring theme in the Mario series power ups is the fact that many items give Mario a semi animal appearance sometimes related to the item depiction itself for example Super Mario Bros 3s Frog Suit which turns Mario into a frog and Super Mario Land 2s Power Carrot which transforms Mario into a rabbit Other times the item may not be related to the power for example the Raccoon Leaf gives him raccoon ears a tail and the power of flight Other power ups are more practical in Super Mario World the Cape allows Mario to fly and glide and a balloon in a later game in the series allows similar effects New Super Mario Bros introduced other types of Mushroom power ups such as the Mega Mushroom which causes Mario to grow to screen filling proportions and the Mini Mushroom that makes him shrink to a very small size

When Mario reached the three dimensional format Super Mario 64 introduced a feature that made Mario take extra damage without his signature hat on in addition to this different types of caps gave him powers of flight invincibility and invisibility Along with these basic features caps gave more practical abilities as well For example the Metal cap allowed Mario to sink to sea floors and the Invisibility cap allowed him to walk through thin surfaces such as iron grates

The first video game ever is often said to be a computer game called Spacewar In fact some ideas of video games can be found before people made Spacewar

In the 50s when the first computers began to be made three people had some ideas to create the basis of actual video games

In 1951 Ralph Baer an American engineer of Loral Electronics tried to create the best television proposing to add a gaming module but his employer did not like his idea Even if his idea was never realised he is the first man to have thought of the idea of video games

Later in 1952 AS Douglas of the Cambridge University in the UK made a video game on a computer in order to illustrate one of his speeches The game called OXO was a tic tac toe game and one of the players was the computer

In 1953 Willy Higinbotham made a game called Tennis For Two to entertain the visitors of the National Laboratory of Brookhaven

One of the most famous video games ever is called Space Invaders Space Invaders was one of the very earliest video games Space Invaders was made in 1978 as a coin operated machine but a version has been made for almost every different game console and home computer ever available

There have been some arguments over the violence and sex in video games Video games that have lots of violence or sex have not been sold in certain countries Some games such as these can be sold to people but only to adults

An oboe is a woodwind instrument with a double reed It looks very similar to the clarinet and may be confused with it While the clarinets shape remains cylindrical the oboes body is conical The sounds produced by clarinets and oboes are very different An oboes sound is produced by blowing air through the double reed at the upper end of the instrument which forces the two reeds to vibrate together which produces the sound The oboe has four parts the bell lower joint upper joint and the reed A person that plays the oboe is called an oboist A typical orchestra may have two oboes but sometimes three Sometimes there is also a cor anglais which sounds a fifth lower than the oboe Very occasionally there is also a bass oboe which sounds an octave below the oboe Gustav Holst used one in his Suite The Planets

The oboe came from the shawm which was a medieval and Renaissance instrument It became popular in the Baroque period Bach and Handel both used it in most of their orchestral music Many Italian composers such as Antonio Vivaldi wrote concertos for the instrument and it is used in a lot of chamber music At this time it hardly had any keys but gradually more keys were added which made it easier to play the sharps and flats

Later composers to write for the oboe as a solo instrument include Mozart Weber Richard Strauss Vaughan Williams and Francis Poulenc

It is usual for the principal oboist in an orchestra to play the note A for the rest of the orchestra to tune their instruments to

The name oboe comes from French language hautbois meaning high wood a high pitched woodwind instrument

A lake is a large body of water within a body of land Because a lake is not connected to any ocean it is not a sea Some lakes are very big and people in the past sometimes called them seas Lakes do not flow like rivers but it is common that rivers flow into or out of them

Most lakes on the surface of the Earth are fresh water and most are in the Northern Hemisphere More than 60 of the lakes of the world are in Canada Finland is known as The Land of the Thousand Lakes

Many lakes are man made and are built to produce electricity for recreation to use the water in the industry farming or in houses

If there are not rivers flowing out of the lake or they are few and small the lake loses water only by evaporation or because the water flows through the soil pores Where the water evaporates rapidly and the soil around the lake has a high salt level as in very dry places the water of the lake has a high concentration of salt and the lake is called a salt lake Examples of salt lakes are the Great Salt Lake the Caspian Sea the Aral Sea and the Dead Sea

East is one of the 4 main directions on a compass East is normally to the right on most maps Japan is east of China Saudi Arabia is east of Egypt and Sweden is east of Norway The countries in the Eastern Mediterranean and around the Red Sea and the Gulf of Arabia are usually called the Middle East China India Japan and other countries in that part of the world make up the Far East The sun and moon rise in the east

A tire is the part of a wheel which is made of rubber There are tires on many vehicles such as cars airplanes bicycles wheelbarrows and other things that need to move around smoothly

Tires need to be changed after their treads wear away Driving with worn tires is very dangerous It can cause the tire to explode and the driver to lose control 

Tires are made of different types of rubber Softer rubber is used in summer or when the tires need better traction for example in auto racing Tires made of harder rubber are made for long lasting performance There are many different types of tires They come in different sizes and have different tread patterns 

There are many different sizes of tires They are marked with 3 numbers and might look like 22560R16 The first number is the width in millimeters of the tire at the widest point when it is mounted and inflated The second number is the sidewall height as a ratio or percentage of the width The last number is the wheel diameter in inches

Tire size 22560R16

Very large tires use different units For example 5980R63 The first number is the width in inches of the tire The second number is the sidewall height as a ratio of the width The last number is the wheel diameter in inches

Most tires today do not have a tube inside of them There are grooves in the wheel that let the tire be popped into place and hold a lot of air pressure If there is a crack in the tire it will not be able to hold its air Tire leaks are very common The most common cause is a hole from a nail or screw This can usually be fixed by patching the inside of the tire so that it can hold air again If the hole is close to or in the side of the tire it can not be fixed This is because the sides of the tire flexes to support the weight of the vehicle A patch will not be able to handle the stress

A population is the number of living things that live together in the same place A citys population is the number of people living in that city These people are called inhabitants or residents The population includes all individuals that live in that certain area

Population density is the average number of people in a place In areas with a high population density people live close to each other such as in a big city In areas with a low population density people usually live far away from each other such as in rural areas out in the countryside

Usually population is about the number of animals or humans there are in a certain area The maximum population that can be supported in an area is called the carrying capacity

The world population reached seven billion people in 2011 Global population is going up but the population growth rate is declining all over the world Currently India has 32 cities with populations above one million Increasing population leads to higher health care expenditures

Snow is a form of ice Snow forms when water in the atmosphere becomes frozen Snow comes in all different shapes and sizes

At the freezing point of water snow melts and becomes water Sometimes the snow will melt very fast and become water vapor This is called sublimation The opposite where water vapor becomes snow is called deposition

Snow is needed for some winter sport activities like skiing and sledding People can also play with snow and build things out of it

Snow can also be dangerous as it can lower visibility and make driving hard to do When it snows the snow will melt a little during the daytime and freeze again at night This makes ice which can make cars slide and crash Snow plows are used to remove snow from roads to make driving easier and safer Also sand or salt may added to the road Sand can make tires better at gripping the road When salt is mixed with snow the snow will melt easier This is because salt water has a lower melting point than fresh water

A snow storm is a dangerous type of weather A snow storm produces heavy snow and strong winds and a snow storm can produce thunder snow which is snow with lightning A snow storm can be like a rain storm except for a snow storm has snow instead of rain yet on one side of a snow storm there can be a lot of rain too

A president is the leader of a country or a company or other group A president is usually elected by the people in that group Voting is one way to elect a president

The United States has a president He is elected by the electoral college Companies have presidents They are elected by the people who own part of the company In some companies the people who are workers for the company elect their company president

The president of a country is not the same thing as a prime minister A prime minister is part of a parliament but a president is not In some countries the president has more power and responsibility than anyone else In other countries to be president is more of an honor or a symbol and the position has no real power The president is often called the nations chief executive As chief executive the president must take an active role in all phases of government

Most countries that have a King or Queen as their monarch have no president 

The American President is restricted by the written United States Constitution which can be changed but only if two thirds of congress as well as the President and three fourths of the states agree to it The American constitution was created to make sure that the American executive never became as powerful as the British system it had broken away from The British Prime Minister is part of both the Legislature and Executive whereas the American President is the head of the Executive The American governmental system shows a clear separation of powers unlike the British system

So despite having a large nuclear arsenal the American president can not carry out policy and introduce legislation as freely as the British prime minister

Galileo Galilei was an Italian astronomer and instrument maker He ran into conflict with the Catholic Church of his day and was put on trial for heresy by the Inquisition

Some people believe that Galileo was the first person to build a telescope This is not true but he was the first person to publish his observations of objects in the sky like the Moon stars and other planets He discovered that the Milky Way is made of many stars that the Moon has hills and he found four moons around Jupiter now called the Galilean moons Later scientists found many others He also discovered sunspots which are dark areas of the Sun He saw that the planet Venus has light and dark phases just like the Moon This helped people to know that the Sun is at the center of the Solar System as Copernicus said 

Galileo also studied natural forces and other things that are now called principles of physics A legend says that he climbed the Leaning Tower of Pisa and dropped cannonballs of different weights to see which would strike the ground first Even though their weights were not the same they hit the ground at the same time Galileo found that objects fall to the ground at the same rate unless things like wind resistance change the rate This went against the views of Aristotle an ancient philosopher whose theory was different Galileos findings were ignored by most people and Aristotles view was still accepted as correct until Isaac Newton proved Galileo was right This also led to Newton creating his Law of Gravity

Galileo also tried to determine the speed of light He climbed a hill and had an assistant climb another hill both carrying lanterns with closed shutters He then opened the shutter of his lantern His assistant opened his own shutter when he saw Galileos lantern Galileo then measured the time it took for his assistants shutter to open Knowing the time difference and the distance between the hills he tried to estimate the speed of light However this did not work

Galileo came to accept the findings of Copernicus that the Sun was the center of the then known universe and not the Earth Because he promoted this and other ideas he came to the notice of the Committee of Propaganda the dreaded Inquisition The Church taught that the Earth stood still while everything in the sky moved around it The Inquisition ruled that other theories could only be discussed as possibilities not facts

Galileo later defended his views in his most famous work Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems published in 1632 The book was in the form of conversations between three men The man representing the Churchs point of view was called Simplicio At this the Inquisition took action He was arrested and put on trial They found him vehemently suspect of heresy They reminded him of the fate of Giordano Bruno who had been burnt at the stake for heresy Brunos heresy was to believe the Earth went round the Sun and that there were many other stars The Inquisition forced Galileo to recant under the threat of execution and to withdraw his works from publication Galileo spent the rest of his life under house arrest

In time more and more of Galileos findings were accepted as true Late in the 20th century Pope John Paul II called Galileo the father of modern physics and made a public apology for how the Church treated him earlier

When people feel or think the same way about something they agree Sometimes it is important to write down or make a promise to what has been agreed on This is called an agreement Agreements are common in law and business For example when a person takes out a loan or hires someone to work an agreement is usually signed so everyone understands what must be done and in what time it must be done

When a person agrees to do something or to not do something that person is making a promise A promise can be made broken wikt linkverbalverbally or it can be written down as a contract Breaking a promise or not keeping it is often just bad manners but it can sometimes be illegal such as when a contract is not kept

A vow is a special promise It is mostly used in a religious sense or in ceremonies such as marriages when the couple who are being married make their marriage vows promising to be faithful to one another

An oath is a promise in the legal sense When someone has to give evidence in a court of law they swear an oath This means that they promise they will tell the truth

A cloud is water in the atmosphere that we can see It is where rain and snow comes from

Water on the earth evaporates and rises up into the sky Higher up where the air is colder the water condenses it changes from a gas to drops of water or crystals of ice We see these drops of water as clouds The drops fall back down to earth as rain and then the water evaporates again This is called the water cycle

The atmosphere always has a little bit of water vapor that humans can not see Clouds form when the atmosphere can no longer hold all the invisible air vaporPage needed Any more water vapor condenses into very small water drops That is what a cloud is

Warm air holds more water vapor than cool air So if warm air with lots of water inside cools it can form a cloud These are ways air can cool enough to form clouds

Clouds are heavy The water in a cloud can have a mass of several million tons Every cubic metre of the cloud has only about 5 grams of water in it Cloud droplets are also about 1000 times heavier than evaporated water so they are much heavier than air They do not fall but stay in the air because there is warm air all round the heavier water droplets When water changes from gas to droplets this makes heat Because the droplets are very small they stick to the warm air

Sometimes clouds appear to be brilliant colors at sunrise or sunset This has shown to be due to pollution in the air

Clouds are classified according to how they look and how high the base of the cloud is in the sky This system was suggested in 1802 There are different sorts of clouds because the air where they form can be still or moving forward or up and down at different speeds Very thick clouds with large enough water droplets can make rain or snow and the biggest clouds can make thunder and lightning

There are three basic types of clouds based on how they look

The following is a summary of the main cloud types arranged by how high they form

High clouds will form from convert10000to25000ftabbron 3 in cold places convert16500to40000ftabbron 3 in mild regions and convert20000to60000ftabbron 3 in the very hot tropics

High level clouds include

Middle clouds usually form at convert6500ftabbron 3 in colder areas However they may form as high as convert25000ftabbron 3 in the tropics where its very warm all year

Medium level clouds include

Low level stratus clouds are usually seen near ground level When very low stratus cloud touches the ground it is called fog Cumulus clouds are usually higher and can be found as high as convert6500ftabbron 3 and sometimes higher They may rise into the medium level when the air is very dry Medium level cumulus that forms in this way does not have alto added to its name Layers of very flat cumulus are called stratocumulus

Low level clouds include

These are clouds of medium thickness that can form anywhere from near ground level to as high as convert10000ftabbron 3 The tops of these clouds are usually not much higher than convert20000ftabbron 3 Vertical clouds often create rain and snow They are made mostly of water droplets but when they push up through cold higher levels they may also have ice crystals

Moderate vertical clouds include

These clouds are very tall with tops usually higher than convert20000ftabbron 3 They can create heavy rain and snow showers Cumulonimbus the biggest clouds of all can also produce thunderstorms These clouds are mostly made of water droplets but the tops of very large cumulonimbus clouds are often made mostly of ice crystals

Towering vertical clouds include

In the Bible clouds are often a sign of Gods presence

The water cycle is the cycle water goes through on Earth It makes the rain clouds and most of our weather Water is essential for life as we know it It is present throughout the solar system and was part of the Earth from its formation The source of the water was the same as the source of the Earths rock the cloud of particles which condensed at the start of the solar systemChapter 14 

Water vapor is water that is in the form of a vapor or gas It is a part of the water cycle When liquid water is heated to boiling temperature 100 degrees Celsius it all turns into vapor Water vapor can also be produced directly from ice this is called sublimation Steam is water vapor but clouds are liquid water Water vapor affects weather conditions

Water vapor weighs less than air which is part of the reason clouds float high in the sky

Water vapor is transparent The small droplets that look white like mist are actually liquid

Warer vapor is a big cause of the greenhouse effect

Solid is one of the four common states of matter The molecules in solids are closely bound together they can only vibrate This means solids have a definite shape that only changes when a force is applied This is different to liquids and gases which move randomly a process called flow 

When a solid becomes a liquid this is called melting Liquids become solid by freezing Some solids like dry ice can turn into gas without turning liquid first This is called sublimation

The forces between the atoms in a solid can take many forms For example a crystal of sodium chloride is made up of ionic sodium and chlorine which are held together by ionic bonds In diamond or silicon the atoms share electrons and make covalent bonds In metals electrons are shared in metallic bonding Some solids like most organic compounds are held together with van der Waals forces coming from the polarization of the electronic charge cloud on each molecule The dissimilarities between the types of solid come from the differences between their bonding

Metals are mostly are strong dense and good conductors of both electricity and heat The mass of the elements in the periodic table those to the left of a diagonal line drawn from boron to polonium are metals Mixtures of two or more elements in which the big component is a metal are known as alloys

People have been using metals for many purposes since prehistoric times The strength and broken wikt linkreliabilityreliability of metals has led to their widespread use in making of buildings and other things as well as in most vehicles many tools pipes road signs and railroad tracks Iron and aluminium are the two most commonly used metals They are also the most common metals in the Earths crust Iron is most commonly used in the form of an alloy steel which has up to 21 carbon making it much harder than pure iron

Since metals are good conductors of electricity they are valuable in electrical tools and for carrying an electric current over long distances with little energy loss Because of this electrical power grids rely on metal cables to get electricity Home electrical systems for example are wired with copper for its good conducting uses The high thermal conductivity of most metals also makes them useful for stovetop cooking utensils

Minerals are natural solids formed through many geological processes under high pressures To be thought as a true mineral a substance must have a crystal structure with uniform physical things throughout Minerals differ in composition from pure elements and simple salts to very complex silicates with thousands of known forms In contrast a rock sample is a random aggregate of minerals andor mineraloids and has no specific chemical composition Most of the rocks of the Earths crust have quartz feldspar mica chlorite kaolin calcite epidote olivine augite hornblende magnetite hematite limonite and a few other minerals Some minerals like quartz mica or feldspar are common while others have been found in only a few places in the world The largest group of minerals by far is the silicates which are made largely of silicon and oxygen also with ions of aluminium magnesium iron calcium and other metals

Evaporation is when a liquid becomes a gas When the molecules in a liquid are heated they move faster This makes them full of energy and so the particles collide with each other and eventually they become so far apart that they become a gas 

For example a water left in a bowl will slowly disappear The water evaporates into water vapor the gas phase of water The water vapor mixes with the air 

Evaporation is a type of phase change in which matter changes from a liquid to a gas Some liquids evaporate more quickly than others Liquid with high boiling points tend to evaporate more slowly than those with lower boiling temperatures

Water boils at around 100 degrees Celsius There are many factors that affect the evaporation rate Different liquids evaporate at different temperatures For example aluminum evaporates at 87 degrees Celsius When water is evaporating it transforms into a gas called water vapor The reverse of evaporation is condensation 

Evaporation is a very essential part of the water cycle When water is boiling in a closed container sometimes evaporation happens at the same time as condensation

Evaporation is vital in nature and is always the same as temperature and vapour pressure in nature This means that if there is a lot of evaporation the temperature goes down Alternatively if there is hardly any evaporation there will be a temperature increase

The rate of evaporation are affected by the liquids exposed surface area the humidity of surroundings the presence of wind and the temperature

A contract is an agreement or promise that the law can enforce The law will enforce some agreements but not others For example in most places if a parent promises to take a child to get ice cream the law will not enforce that promise as a legal contract

The legal rules about which promises are enforced by the law can be different in different places but a contract is usually enforced only if it is made by people or groups who want it to be enforced and who know what they are doing

Sometimes a contract is written down and signed by the people agreeing to it but it does not always need to be People usually sign a contract when something important or costly is being done For example when people take a job they will sometimes sign a contract with their employers The contract will show what the person must do as part of his job how much he will be paid and so on The person and the employer will sign the contract and it will become a legal promise

If someone breaks a contract another person might sue him or her In a lawsuit about a contract the court will look at the contract listen to what the people who made the contract say about it and then make a decision about what the contract means

The face is a part of the body located at the front of the head 

It is the part of us that others interact with On the face are organs of sight smell hearing Especially in a four legged animal the face is the part which goes first into the world and that is why the sense organs and the mouth are there

In the human case include the hair forehead eyebrow eyelash eyes nose ears cheeks mouth lips teeth skin and chin

The clock face is the part of an analog clock that displays the time

The surface where the mining work is advancing called face

Kolkata is the capital city of the Indian state of West Bengal It is the second largest city in India after Mumbai It is located on the East bank of the River Hooghly When it is called Calcutta it includes the suburbs This makes it the third largest city of India This also makes it the worlds 8th largest metropolitan area as defined by the United Nations Kolkata served as the capital of India during the British Raj until 1911 Kolkata was once the center of industry and education However it has witnessed political violence and economic problems since 1954 Since 2000 Kolkata has grown due to economic growth Like other metropolitan cities in India Kolkata struggles with poverty pollution and traffic congestion

The discovery of the nearby Chandraketugarh an archaeological site has proved that people have lived there for over two millennia The history of Kolkata begins when the English East India Company arrived in 1690 Job Charnock an administrator with the Company is traditionally known as the founder of this city However some academics say that Charnock is not the citys founder

At that time Kolkata ruled by the Nawab of Bengal Siraj Ud Daulah had three villages They were Kalikata Govindapur and Sutanuti The British in the late 17th century wanted to build a fort near Govindapur This was to become more powerful than Dutch the Portuguese and the French In 1702 the British completed the construction of old Fort William which was used to station its troops and as a regional base Calcutta was declared a Presidency City and later became the headquarters of the Bengal Presidency When regular fights with French forces started in 1756 the British began to upgrade their fortifications When this was protested the Nawab of Bengal Siraj Ud Daulah attacked and captured Fort William This led to the infamous Black Hole incident A force of Company sepoys and British troops led by Robert Clive recaptured the city the next year Calcutta became the capital of British India in 1772 However the capital shifted to the hilly town of Shimla during the summer months every year starting from the year 1864 Richard Wellesley the Governor General between 17971805 helped in the growth of the city and its public architecture This led to the description of Calcutta as The City of Palaces The city was a centre of the British East India Companys opium trade during the 18th and 19th century locally produced opium was sold at auction in Kolkata to be shipped to China

A pencil is a hexagonal prism or cylinder shaped tool used to write and draw usually on paper 

A pencil is usually made with a piece of carbon mixed with clay that has a wood case around it Coloured pencils are a type of pencil that instead of greyish silver the tip is a different color Coloured pencils or crayons are usually meant for drawing rather than writing

An important difference between pens and pencils is that the tip of a pencil is made of graphite and pens have tips made of metal with ink coming out of the bottom Pencil writings do not smudge or wash away if the paper gets wet unlike pens which have ink Writing with a pen will usually smudge Writing from a pencil can be erased but writing from a pen usually cannot Finally while pens have been around for thousands of years pencils have only been around for about three hundred

The archetypal pencil may have been the stylus which was a thin metal stick often made from lead and used for scratching in papyrus a form of early paper They were used extensively by the ancient Egyptians and Romans The word pencil comes from the Latin word pencillus which means little tail 

Some time before 1565 an enormous deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish Cumbria England The locals found that it was very useful for marking sheep This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid and it could easily be sawn into sticks This remains the only large scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead Consequently it was called plumbago The black core of pencils is still referred to as lead even though it never contained the element lead In German the word for pencil still is Bleistift literally lead stick

The value of graphite was soon realized to be enormous mainly because it could be used to line the moulds for cannonballs and the mines were taken over by the Crown and guarded When sufficient stocks of graphite had been accumulated the mines were flooded to prevent theft until more was required Graphite had to be smuggled out for use in pencils Because graphite is soft it requires some form of case Graphite sticks were at first wrapped in string or in sheepskin for stability The news of the usefulness of these early pencils spread far and wide attracting the attention of artists all over the known world 

Although deposits of graphite had been found in other parts of the world they were not of the same purity and quality as the Borrowdale find and had to be crushed to remove the impurities leaving only graphite powderCitation neededdateMarch 2008 England continued to enjoy a monopoly on the production of pencils until a method of reconstituting the graphite powder was found The distinctively square English pencils continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graphite into the 1860s The town of Keswick near the original findings of block graphite has a pencil museum

The first attempt to manufacture graphite sticks from powdered graphite was in Nuremberg Germany in 1662 It used a mixture of graphite sulphur and antimony 

Residual graphite from a pencil stick is not poisonous and graphite is harmless if consumed

The number 2 pencil got its title from the shade of darkness it has from pencil 1 5 This pencils shape is typically hexagonal and is frequently wood cased They can write under water upside down and in space They can also write up to 45000 wordsCitation neededdateMarch 2010

The Italians first thought of wooden holders An Italian couple in particular named Simonio and Lyndiana Bernacotti were believedWhodateJuly 2009WhendateJuly 2009 to be the ones to create the first blueprints for the modern carpentry pencil for the purpose of marking their carpentry pieces however their version was instead a flat oval more compact type of pencil They did this at first by hollowing out a stick of juniper wood Shortly thereafter a superior technique was discovered two wooden halves were carved a graphite stick inserted and the two halves then glued togetheressentially the same method in use to this dayCitation neededdateJuly 2009

English and German pencils were not available to the French during the Napoleonic Wars France under naval blockade imposed by Great Britain was unable to import the pure graphite sticks from the British Grey Knotts mines the only known source in the world for solid graphite France was also unable to import the inferior German graphite pencil substitute It took the efforts of an officer in Napoleons army to change this In 1795 Nicholas Jacques Cont discovered a method of mixing powdered graphite with clay and forming the mixture into rods that were then fired in a kiln By varying the ratio of graphite to clay the hardness of the graphite rod could also be varied This method of manufacture which had been earlier discovered by the Austrian Joseph Hardtmuth of Koh I Noor in 1790 remains in useCitation neededdateJuly 2009

In England pencils continued to be made from whole sawn graphite Henry Bessemers first successful invention was a method of compressing graphite powder into solid graphite thus allowing the waste from sawing to be reused 

American colonists imported pencils from Europe until after the American Revolution Benjamin Franklin advertised pencils for sale in his Pennsylvania Gazette in 1729 and George Washington used a three inch pencil when he surveyed the Ohio Territory in 1762Citation neededdateOctober 2009 It is said that William Munroe a cabinetmaker in Concord Massachusetts made the first American wood pencils in 1812 This was not the only pencil making occurring in Concord According to Henry Petroski transcendentalist philosopher Henry David Thoreau discovered how to make a good pencil out of inferior graphite using clay as the binder this invention was prompted by his fathers pencil factory in Concord which employed graphite found in New Hampshire in 1821 by Charles Dunbar 

Munroes method of making pencils was painstakingly slow and in the neighbouring town of Acton a pencil mill owner named Ebenezer Wood set out to automate the process at his own pencil mill located at Nashoba Brook along the old Davis Road He used the first circular saw in pencil production He constructed the first of the hexagon and octagon shaped wooden casings that we have today Ebenezer did not patent his invention and shared his techniques with whomever asked One of those was Eberhard Faber of New York who became the leader in pencil production 

Joseph Dixon an inventor and entrepreneur involved with the Tantiusques granite mine in Sturbridge Massachusetts developed a means to mass produce pencils By 1870 The Joseph Dixon Crucible Company was the worlds largest dealer and consumer of graphite and later became the contemporary Dixon Ticonderoga pencil and art supplies company 

By the end of the 19th century over 240000 pencils were used each day in the United States alone The favoured timber for pencils was Red Cedar as it was aromatic and did not splinter when sharpened In the early 1900s supplies of Red Cedar were dwindling so that pencil manufacturers were forced to recycle the wood from cedar fences and barns to maintain supply Britain went as far as declaring the use of pencil sharpeners illegal to discourage unnecessary sharpeningCitation neededdateApril 2009 It was soon discovered that Incense cedar when dyed and perfumed to resemble Red Cedar was a suitable alternative and most pencils today are made from this timber which is grown in managed forests Over 14 billion pencils are manufactured worldwide annually

On 30 March 1858 Hymen Lipman received the first patent for attaching an eraser to the end of a pencil In 1862 Lipman sold his patent to Joseph Reckendorfer for 100000 who went to sue the pencil manufacturer Faber Castell for infringement In 1875 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled against Reckendorfer declaring the patent invalid

The metal band used to mate the eraser with pencil is called a ferrule

The first attempt to manufacture graphite sticks from powdered graphite was in Nuremberg Germany in 1662 They used a mixture of graphite sulfur and antimony Though usable they were not as good as the English pencils

English and German pencils were not available to the French during the Napoleonic wars It took the efforts of an officer in Napoleons army to change this In 1795 Nicholas Jacques Cont discovered a method of mixing powdered graphite with clay and forming the mixture into rods which were then fired in a kiln By varying the ratio of graphite to clay the hardness of the graphite rod could also be varied This method of making pencils is still used today

Today pencils are made industrially by mixing finely ground graphite and clay powders adding water forming long spaghetti like strings and firing them in a kiln The resulting strings are dipped in oil or molten wax which seeps into the tiny holes of the material resulting in smoother writing A juniper or incense cedar plank with several long parallel grooves is cut to make something called a slate and the graphiteclay strings are inserted into the grooves Another grooved plank is glued on top and the whole thing is then cut into individual pencils which are then varnished or painted

Logic is the science of reasoning Logic helps people decide whether something is true or false 

Finally those talking about logic talk about statements A statement is simply something like Aristole is human or all humans are mortal Statements have a truth value they are either true or false but not both Mistakes in logic are called fallacies

A logical proof is a list of statements Each statement in the proof is either an assumption or has been proven to follow from earlier statements in the proof A proof shows that one statement the conclusion follows from the assumptions One can for example prove that Aristotle is mortal follows from Aristotle is a man and All men are mortal

Logic is used by computers in what is called an algorithm An algorithm is sort of like a cooking recipe it tells the computer what to do and when to do it

Logic is used in mathematics People who study math create proofs that use logic to show that math facts are correct There is an area of mathematics called mathematical logic that studies logic using mathematics 

Logic is also studied in philosophy 

Communism is a political way of thinking and an idea of how society should work and be organized Communism is a kind of socialism that says that there should not be social classes or states Communism says that the people of any and every place in the world should all own the tools factories and farms that are used to produce goods and food This social process is known as common ownership In a communist society there is no private property

After workers established a government in the interests of all they would slowly bring all of the tools of production under their control until a classless and stateless society was created 

This is an old idea but it became popular after the French Revolution and other popular movements in Europe in the early 1800s

Some socialists believed that socialists could take state power in democratic elections so they tried to make socialist parties in their own countries win elections Others thought that state was created to maintain capitalism and that capitalists would never allow communists to take power so there needed to be a war or revolution in order to create a new workers state 

Many countries have claimed to be workers states but many communists debate this Most of these countries did hold elections but in most cases the only candidates that were allowed belonged to the communist party so the elections were not free ones Some of these countries leaders such as Stalin or Mao Zedong had lots of strict laws and a secret police force to keep themselves in power People could be sent to prison or killed for speaking against the government 

Most of these countries had a legislature to make laws Most of the time the legislature usually did not have any real power and usually just approved the proposals of the leaders The Communist Party had all the real political power 

Most of the countries that claimed to be workers states either had a violent revolution or were invaded by a country that left behind a government Some democratic countries today have active communist parties such as in India Italy and France 

In some countries especially those that used to be ruled by communist parties the communist party is illegal or discouraged from holding power

In 1848 Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote The Communist Manifesto a short book with the basic ideas of communism Most socialists and communists today still use this book to help them understand politics and economics Many non communists read it too even if they do not agree with everything in it Karl Marx said that for society to change into a communist way of living there would have to be a transitional period During this transitional period the workers would rule their country Marxs ideas were liked by many groups and individuals and in 1917 Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky led a Russian group called the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution which got rid of the provincial government of Russia which was formed after the February Revolution against the Tsar and established the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics

The Soviet Union was the first country claiming to have established a workers state but in reality the country never became communist in the way that Marx and Engels described People who support communism say that this is because these countries lacked democracy People who do not support communism usually say that the example of the Soviet Union and other similar countries proves that communism is dangerous and does not work 

During the 20th century many people tried to establish workers states In the late 1940s China also had a revolution and created a new government with Mao Zedong as its leader In the 1950s the island of Cuba had a revolution and created a new government with Fidel Castro as its leader At one time there were many such countries

Since 1989 when the Berlin Wall was torn down most countries that used to call themselves workers states have given up on communism so that communism has much less influence around the world In 1991 the Soviet Union broke up However around a quarter of the worlds people still live in states controlled by a communist party most of these in the Peoples Republic of China The other countries include Cuba Vietnam and Laos There are also communist movements in Latin America and South Asia

Many people have written their own ideas about communism Vladimir Lenin of Russia thought that there had to be a group of hard working revolutionaries to lead a socialist revolution worldwide and create a communist society everywhere Leon Trotsky also from Russia argued that socialism had to be international and it was not important to make it happen first in Russia He also did not like Joseph Stalin who became the leader of the USSR after Lenins death in 1924 Trotsky was made to leave the Soviet Union by Stalin in 1928 and then killed in 1940 This scared many people and lots of communists argued about whether this was right and whose ideas should be followed

Stalin thought that it was important to make the Soviet Union powerful first then spread it around the world when it was stronger Many communists said that Stalin was not a real communist because the original idea of communism needed small groups of workers voting and deciding on things together and Stalin in no way supported voting or democracy Yet there are communist schools of thought which agree with Stalin mainly because of his rapid industrialization and victory over Germany

Mao Zedong of China thought that other classes would be important to the revolution in China and other third world countries because the working classes in these countries were small Maos ideas on communism are usually called Maoism or Mao Zedong Thought After the death of Stalin in 1953 Mao saw himself as the leader of worldwide communism until he died in 1976 Today the Chinese government is still ruled by the Communist Party but they actually have what is called a mixed economy and they have borrowed many things from capitalism The government in China today does not follow Maoism but revolutionaries in other countries like India and Nepal like his ideas and are trying to use them in their own countries

The color red is a symbol of communism around the world A red five pointed star sometimes also stands for communism The hammer and sickle is a well known symbol of communism and was on the flags of many countries that claimed to be building communism Some communists also like to use pictures of famous communists from history such as Marx Lenin and Mao Zedong as symbols of the whole philosophy of communism 

A song called The Internationale was the international song of communism It has the same music everywhere but the words to the song are translated into very many languages

There is also a special kind of art and architecture found in many communist and former communist countries Paintings done in the style of socialist realism are often done for propaganda to show an ideal version of a countrys people and political leader Art done in the socialist realism style such as plays movies novels and paintings show hard working happy and well fed factory workers and farmers Movies plays and novels in this style often tell stories about workers or soldiers who sacrifice themselves for the good of the country Paintings often showed heroic portraits of the leader or landscapes showing huge fields of wheat Stalinist architecture was supposed to represent the power and glory of the state and its political leader Some non communists also enjoy this kind of art

Resurrection means bringing back to life

Christians believe that Jesus Christ was resurrected They also believe in resurrection for all people after death  

The resurrection of Jesus Christ is documented by various authors in the New Testament The resurrection is a key part of Christian faith because it signifies that God was fully satisfied with the work of Jesus in dying on the cross to save mankind It is also important because it prefigures the resurrection of all Christian believers But most importantly the fact that Jesus Christ was resurrected to an imperishable state means that he lives for ever As such there is a man in heaven at the current time He is the advocate for us before the throne of God He is also with us by his Spirit in this world

In both the case of Jesus Christ and everyone elses resurrection the bible makes it clear that the resurrected body is changed from the original This is because the human body in its current form is understood to be weak and frail However the resurrected person lives for ever

In illustration Saint Paul refers to a seed and its tree This lifes body is like a seed and the resurrection body is like the tree which comes from it From this analogy Paul illustrates two important principles 

A monarchy is a kind of government where a monarch a kind of hereditary ruler is the head of state Monarchs usually rule until they die or resign Most monarchies are hereditary but some are elected The most famous elected monarch is the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church Some common titles for monarchs are King Queen Emperor Empress Czar Kaiser Shah Emir and Sultan

Monarchy is one of the oldest kinds of government Most historians agree that the first monarchies were tribes or small groups of people who decided to let a war chief or other leader pass on their office to their children Over time the rules for deciding who got to become the next monarch became more complicated In general the oldest son or in some countries daughter gets to become the next monarch when the old one dies Kings and other kinds of monarchs have been around for many thousands of years there are many for example mentioned in the Bible as well as ancient historical records Three of the oldest countries with monarchs that still hold office are the United Kingdomwhere the present line of Kings and Queens has been around for nearly 1000 years Denmark where the royal line has remained unbroken for almost 1200 years and Japan which has records showing a line of Emperors dating back even farther

Many monarchs today perform mostly the ceremonial jobs of a head of state while the head of government who is usually elected passes and enforces laws It is also very important in other parts of the country

An absolute monarchy is a form of government where only the monarch himself or herself is the only source of all laws and the monarch can make any law they want just by deciding it Any other institution in the country cannot make laws that affect the monarch unless the monarch decides to allow it Sometimes the monarch is also the head of the state religion and makes religious laws also All land and property in the country can be taken or given away by the monarch at any time for any reason The army and navy is under the personal control of the monarch and can be used for any purpose at any time The monarch can also pick who gets to be the next monarch and can change the rules at any time There is usually no elected government or Parliament and if there is one it has no real power This kind of government is very rare today The people do not have a lot of power in it

Countries that are examples of an absolute monarchy are Vatican City Brunei Qatar Saudi Arabia Oman and Swaziland

A constitutional monarchy is a form of government that is usually a democracy and has a constitution with the monarch as head of state Either the monarch has to obey the laws like everyone else or if the monarch does not have to obey the same laws as the rest of the people there are special laws that say what the monarch can and cannot do The monarch usually can not decide their special laws on their own There may be laws about who the monarchs children can marry for example that are passed by the Parliament or Congress For example in the Netherlands if a member of the royal family marries without the permission of Parliament they cannot become king or queen themselves The army and navy may swear an oath to the monarch but the real power to control it is given to the elected government There are laws about property and succession that can only be changed by the elected government Usually the monarch must sign laws into effect but they are required to follow the will of the elected government 

A constitutional monarchy usually has separation of power and the monarch often has only ceremonial functions such as representing the country while traveling or acting as a symbol for the whole country Constitutional monarchs usually do not vote even when it is legal for them to do so Voting would mean that they picked a side in political arguments and then could not claim to represent everyone in the country Some constitutional monarchies give the power to veto laws to the monarch but in most countries where this is the case it is a power that is very rarely used In countries where the monarch can dismiss or appoint governments this is usually only done to make sure that the democratic process is respected without taking sides in politics Appointments to public office made by constitutional monarchs are generally approved by the democratically elected government beforehand

North Korea or the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea is a country in the northern part of Korea North Korea borders China Russia and South Korea The capital city of North Korea is Pyngyang

Before World War II Korea was part of Japan After World War II Japan left and the Soviet Union and United States occupied Korea In the north the Soviet Union helped build North Korea North Korea became a socialist country In the south the United States helped build South Korea The Soviet Union and the USA left Korea in 1948cndateJanuary 2012

In 1950 North Korea invaded South Korea North Korea wanted to re unite Korea and Korean families They wanted South Korea to be Communist The United Nations sent troops to Korea These soldiers came from many countries The countries did not like Communism If South Korea became Communist then maybe other countries would also Douglas MacArthur led the US troops 

First North Koreas troops occupied most of South Korea Next with foreign help South Korea took back their land and also occupied most of North Korea to the Yalu River the border with China Last China helped North Korea North Korea took back their land In 1953 North and South Korea stopped fighting They signed an armistice The border between North and South changed a little

North Korea is a socialist country but most countries in the world agree that it is a totalitarian Stalinist dictatorship

Kim Il Sng was the first leader of North Korea He was the founder of Juche In 1994 he died and his son Kim Jng Il took over Kim Jng Il died on Saturday December 17th 2011 while riding a train His son will take his place

Songun is a North Korean idea It means army first The job of every North Korean person is to feed the Army The Army can steal food from civilians Kim Jong Il is the Chairman of the National Defense Commission of North Korea He is like a king and can do what he wants The average North Korean citizen makes 900 1000 dollars a year Kim Jong Il makes 650000 800000 a year He also lives in a palace

Korean people also do not have freedom of speech The government does not give people the right to move freely within the country either The government also tries to keep ideas from other countries out of North Korea An article in The New York Times quoted a North Korean woman who said that her neighbor spent six months in a labor camp for watching a Jackie Chan movie

In parts of the country there is not enough food Currently foreign countries give food to some people in North Korea This is called foreign aid 

It is hard for foreigners to visit North Korea Visitors must be guided by two army members called minders

In October 2006 North Korea said that it tested a nuclear weapon Although the government says that the test was not dangerous many other countries and the UN were very angry In 2002 American president George W Bush called North Korea part of an axis of evil

On the 25th of May 2009 North Korea continued nuclear testing a violation of Resolution 1718

In 2010 a South Korean warship sank killing over 40 soldiers An international investigation concluded that North Korea had sunk a South Korean warship with a torpedo North Korea strongly said that it did not have anything to do with the sinking When the US and South Korea planned defensive military practices North Koreas National Defence Commission threatened on 24 July 2010 to start sacred war of their own style with nuclear deterrent because of the US imperialists and the South Korean puppet forces deliberately pushing the situation to war

A parliament is a type of legislature The most famous parliament is probably the one in the United Kingdom which is sometimes called the Mother of all Parliaments this phrase was originally used as a criticism in the 19th century  as in this parliament is of the old generation Nowadays people tend to assume it is a compliment as in it was one of the first parliaments and many other countries have set their own up in the same way The word parliament comes from the French word parlement which means a talk

The Parliament of the United Kingdom is split into three separate parts the House of Commons the lords and the Monarch Most legislative power concentrated in the House of Commons It is made up of 646 Members of Parliament These people are elected by the people of the United Kingdom to represent them in the House of Commons The leader of the political party who commands a majority of MPs is usually made the Prime Minister but not the Head of State a position reserved for the Sovereign The House of Commons starts most Bills the remainder originating in the House of Lords and decides rates of taxation as a result of election by the other hereditary peers and two other hereditary peers who have ceremonial jobs in the House of Lords They are the Earl Marshal who is always the Duke of Norfolk and the Lord Great Chamberlain the Marquess of Cholmondeley The House of Lords has the power to reject Bills except Money Bills and make the House of Commons reconsider them If the House of Lords vetoes a bill twice or delays a public Bill for more than one year then the House of Commons can force the Bill through under the terms of the Parliament Acts unless it originated in the House of Lords The monarch is the sovereign in a constitutional monarchy and theoretically is the fount of all power in the United Kingdom Bills must receive the Royal Assent before becoming Acts of Parliament and the monarch is responsible for summoning proroguing and dissolving Parliament normally upon the advice of the incumbent Prime Minister It is now very rare for a monarch to object but the sovereign still retains this prerogative for use if necessary

Other parliaments have copied the UK and work similarly They have three levels  a lower house which makes the law an upper house which reviews the law and a head of state who is mostly for show and who starts and ends each year of parliament The Prime Minister is almost always the person whose party has the most seats but if the lower house does not think he is doing a good job they can call a vote of no confidence and ask him to leave his job as Prime Minister or have an election

Sometimes people use the word parliament to describe a legislature even if it is not a real parliament A parliament is a type of legislature which has a Prime Minister 

A parliament is a lot like a congress but a congress cannot ask the head of the government to leave his job Also a congress runs for a number of years according to the countrys constitution but a parliament can be stopped as long as enough members agree Elections are held after this happens

The Turing test is a test to see if a computer can trick a person into believing that the computer is a person too Alan Turing thought that if a human could not tell the difference between another human and the computer then that computer must be as intelligent as a human

A person has a telegraph and is connected to two communication partners One of the two correspondents is a machine The person can ask anything with the telegraph If the person cannot tell which of the two is the machine more than 50 of the time then the machine is said to be intelligent

Later on people narrowed down the test A human is unlikely to know everything Therefore both the human and the machine would be specialists in some field of knowledge So would the person asking

As of 2009 no one has made a computer that can pass the Turing test However Elbot came close to 30

A fuel is a substance that is changed in some way to produce heat electricity or other forms of energy This is usually by being burnt although there are exceptions such as nuclear fuel Fuel can be divided into two main types fossil fuels and other fuels

There are several kinds of fossil fuels

Some people do not want us to use fossil fuels because they may pollute the environment Because all fossil fuels are made out of carbon burning them makes carbon dioxide Some people think that too much carbon dioxide in the air may cause a greenhouse effect Fossil fuels are also non renewable or renew extremely slowly This means that we will eventually run out of fossil fuels

Other fuels are not made from fossils Some of these like nuclear and hydrogen do not have carbon in them Others like wood or ethanol do have carbon in them Some examples of these fuels are

These fuels are renewable This means that we can make more of them if we run out For instance if we run out of ethanol we can grow some more corn and make some more ethanol

Latvia is a country in Northern Europe The capital is Riga It is one of the Baltic States together with Estonia in the north and Lithuania in the south Latvias neighbours to the east are the countries Russia and Belarus Latvia is split into four parts called Kurzeme Vidzeme Zemgale and Latgale

People from Latvia are called Latvians They speak the Latvian language which is a little like the Lithuanian language though not close enough to be understood

Latvia was settled by the Baltic tribes thousands of years ago They mainly fished hunted and traded

German traders and crusaders came to Latvia at the end of the 12th century Latvians lost control of their homeland Over the next 800 years Germans Danes Swedes Poles and Russians all invaded Latvia Latvia finally became independent in 1918

The Soviet Union invaded Latvia during World War II and killed or took away many of its people to Siberia and other places far away from their homes Nazi Germany invaded and killed half of Latvias Jews The Soviet Union then invaded again and occupied Latvia until 1991 when the Soviet Union fell apart and Latvia became an independent country again

In Copenhagen on 13 December 2002 Latvia and nine other countries were invited to join the European Union On 20 September 2003 Latvians held an election to vote on joining Two thirds of Latvians voted to join and on 1 May 2004 Latvia became a member of the EU

Latvia has been a NATO member since 29 March 2004

Lithuania is a country in northern Europe on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea Lithuania is a member of the European Union NATO and several other organizations

Vilnius is the capital and largest city About 3500000 people live there The official language is Lithuanian which is spoken by more than 82 of the people

The colors of the Lithuanian flag are yellow for the sun green for the fields and red for the blood of Lithuanians fighting for its independence

Lithuania began to turn into a country in the 7th9th centuries from Baltic nations group The Baltics the ancestors of Lithuanians and Latvians came to area between Nemunas Daugava rivers and the Baltic sea from a supposed original homeland of the Proto Indo Europeans Many scientists think they came there sometime in the 3rd millennium BC

The traditional date of the beginning of the country is 1236 when the Battle of iauliai took place and was won by the Lithuanians

Lithuania had made a Treaty with Poland in 1569 The country was taken over by the Russian Empire in 1795 It got back its independence on the February 16 1918 It was taken over by Soviet Union in June 16 1940 after Germany from 1941 1944 and then the Soviet Union from 1944 1990 Lithuania re declared its independence on March 11 1990 Currently Lithuania is an independent semi presidential democratic republic

Lithuania has been a member of NATO and the European Union since 2004 

Lithuania is a semi presidential republic that restored its independence and democracy in 1990 Since then very important reforms were made and Lithuania is now declared as a democratic state that grants the human rights 

The Constitution that was adopted in 1992 declares that the leader of the country is the President who must be elected to take his office The elections are held each 5 years If President broke their oath they can be fired by the Parliament The President also represents Lithuania and he is also a commander in chief 

The legislative power of Lithuania is Seimas or the Parliament There are 141 members of Seimas who are elected for 4 year terms Seimas passes the laws that must be executed by the Government that is formed in Seimas and it must be accepted by the President The Prime Minister is set and fired by the President

The justice is under the power of the courts The supreme court in Lithuania is the Constitutional Court

Lithuania is divided into 10 counties 60 municipalities and 500 elderates The counties are 

The county governor rules the county He or she must be appointed by the central government Municipalities are governed by the Municipal Councils that are elected for 4 year terms The head of a municipality is the mayor The elderates are governed by the elders The elders are appointed by the municipal councils

Lithuania is a country in northern Europe Its neighbours are Poland in the south west Russia in west Latvia in north and Belarus in the east Lithuania borders the Baltic sea and 99 kilometres of it belong to Lithuania The highest hill is Auktojas the largest lake is Drkiai Lake 31 of the land suitable for farms 

Lithuania is divided into 5 cultural regions according to their past and traditions 

Lithuania has a fast growing economy It grew up to 7 in the first quarter of 2008 

GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity is estimated to be 19 730 in 2008 The nominal GDP per capita is estimated to be 14 213 at the same year According to these numbers Lithuanian per capita GDP reaches only 61 of EU average However it is impressive that only in 8 years since 2000 it grew up from 30 of EU average 

Emigration still contains a problem Acoording to the official data emigration in 2006 was 30 lower than previous year with 3 483 people leaving in four months

About 80 of people in Lithuania are Lithuanians There are large national minorities

Lithuanian is spoken by 82 of the people and it is the only official language Polish is used mostly in Vilnius County where Polish politicians are elected to represent the Polish minority The documents and street names must be in Lithuanian 

The biggest cities are Vilnius 542287 people Kaunas 358107 people and Klaipda 185899 people

The nursery schools and the kindergartens are the first level education forms However they are not compulsory The children aged 7 start attending the primary school where educational programs last for 4 years then they must start attending the secondary school After finishing 8th or 10th grade the student can continue learning at the high school or choose courses at the vocational college The students who finish the high school can join colleges and universities Higher education is free for the students whose annual median of grades is 8 or higher The others have to pay 500 Litass per semester at least 

The higher education schools are universities and colleges The main universities are

Malta is an island country in Europe It is near the center of the Mediterranean Sea south of Sicily The capital of Malta is Valletta About 400000 people live in Malta Malta is one of the most densely populated countries in the world Because of this it has many cities and towns that grew into each other over time The largest of these is possibly Birkirkara

Malta has two official languages Maltese and English

Malta had its own currency called the Maltese Lira until 2008 The Maltese Lira was better known as the Maltese Pound because of the strong links to the United Kingdom One Maltese Lira consisted of 100 cents In 2008 Malta joined the Euro countries in adopting the Euro as the National Currency

People have lived in Malta since at least 5200 BC The island has some key archaeological locations dating from early times

Malta became well known as the base of the Knights of St John They moved to Malta after being forced to leave Palestine and then Rhodes in Greece The knights and the Maltese people survived a great attack by the Turks The history of the knights at Malta continued the strong Roman Catholic beliefs in the country that were started by the Norman and Spanish rulers

In 1798 Napoleon took control of Malta The French rule was not popular and in 1800 Maltese rebels invited the English Royal Navy to come to the island This lead to 200 years as a British colony and independent Commonwealth member Some Maltese wanted the union of Malta with Italy like Carmelo Borg Pisani 

During the Second World War Malta was again attacked this time by the Axis forces The entire island was symbolically given the George Cross for heroism

In 2004 Malta joined the European Union and in 2008 Malta joined the Euro

In normal cosmology comoving distance or proper distance is one of several distances measured by cosmologists to define distances between objects 

To talk about the shape of the Universe scientists want to forget that the Universe is expanding So they separate the shape from time and pretend that the Universe is not expanding They remember that really the Universe is expanding but they write this in a variable called the scale factor Then the distances they talk about while putting the scale factor to the side are called comoving distances When they think about the Universe using comoving distance they think of the Universe as not expanding This way some calculations are easier

When the part of the Universe which we can see today started it was very small Everything in this part of the Universe was much closer together than today It was also very hot and photons were moving in different directions Light moves very fast but the light speed is limited and the Universe was expanding very fast

Think of two ants on the surface of an expanding balloon One ant starts moving towards another but the balloon itself is also expanding After a long time the balloon starts expanding more slowly Eventually one ant reaches another Thats like photons in our universe Some of the light from the stars you see at night traveled for billions of years to reach your eye Surprisingly it started very close to where you were but just could not keep up with the universe expansion Of course if something else started out very close to where you were but was not traveling toward you it would be very far away from you now because of the expansion

George Walker Bush was the 43rd President of the United States of America He is a Republican During Bushs presidency Dick Cheney was his Vice President Bush is from Midland Texas He has a ranch in Crawford Texas which is near Waco He is the son of former US President George H W Bush Before he was President Bush was Governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000 He is married to Laura and they have twin daughters Jenna and Barbara

Bush was born in New Haven Connecticut He went to school at Yale University from 1964 to 1968 He lived in Midland Texas on a ranch but not for a long time He joined the Texas Air National Guard in 1968 during the Vietnam War but did not fight in Vietnam He left the Texas Air National Guard in 1973 In 1978 Bush tried to get elected to Congress in West Texas but lost After that he ran some oil companies and was one of the owners of the Texas Rangers baseball team He thought about trying to become the commissioner of Major League Baseball but went into politics instead In 1994 he was elected to be Governor of Texas

Bush ran against then Vice President Al Gore in the 2000 United States presidential election More than 100 million people voted on November 7 2000 But the election was very close When they began counting the votes it became clear that whoever got the most votes in the state of Florida would win the election But there were many issues with the ballots in Florida Gore sued to get Florida to count the votes again For more than a month no one knew who won the election The Supreme Court made a decision to stop recounting votes Gore decided to accept his loss and Bush was declared the winner Because of the many issues with the law in this election people still argue about whether the courts made the right decision

While he was President George W Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act into law It gave more money to American schools It also made students take more tests to measure their progress 

He added Part D to Medicare which gives older people free medicine if they can not afford it 

He also signed very large tax cuts during his presidency These tax cuts and the government spending more money made it so that the government spent more money than it took in and it had to borrow money

Bush did not approve of abortion In 2004 he signed the Unborn Victims Of Violence Act which made it so that if a pregnant woman is murdered her murderer can also charged with killing the fetus that the woman was carrying

His first foreign policy test came when an American spy plane crashed in China Bush peacefully negotiated the release of the plane crew

Eight months after Bush became president the World Trade Center was attacked This happened on Sept 11 2001 Because of this President Bush declared a War on Terror

Bush tried to do many things to stop another terrorist attack from happening He ordered an invasion of Afghanistan He did this because the leaders of Afghanistan were helping Osama bin Laden the person who was responsible for attacking America on 911 Bush asked Congress to do more to stop terrorism As a result Congress passed a law that made the Department Of Homeland Security a government department which tries to prevent terrorist attacks from happening It also responds to emergencies such as floods or diseases 

He signed the Patriot Act Many people were against it because it took away freedom from people and many people were for it because it was for the safety of the country This led to a debate of whether or not it was worth it to give up some freedom for safety

President Bush claimed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction After Saddam refused to cooperate with the United Nations Bush decided to invade Iraq Although the United Kingdom supported the invasion many other countries did not People called Bushs idea of invading a country the Bush Doctrine Saddam Hussein was removed from power and Iraq turned into a democracy

In the 2004 presidential election Bush won again His opponent was Massachusetts Senator John Kerry a Democrat 

In 2005 Hurricane Katrina happened It caused over 1800 deaths and caused billions of dollars of destruction George W Bush was strongly criticized for taking too long to respond but he did sign several acts into law which would help Hurricane Katrina victims

In the Iraq War no weapons of mass destruction were found and the Bush Administration was criticized for being wrong about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction Bush added more American troops to Iraq to speed up the war The surge was successful and in result Iraq had less violence

Although the economy was doing very well during much of his presidency in early 2008 the economy was slowing down Bush signed a bill into law which would gave 600 to every American citizen hoping that people would go out and spend the money so that it would prevent a recession from happening

Later in 2008 stock market crashed and the country fell into its worst recession since the Great Depression Bush helped create a 700 billion dollar bailout which would give money to corporations to prevent them from being bankrupt and to try to prevent the recession from getting worse

Bushs approval ratings were at an all time low during the end of the time he was President Bush said that the current opinion polls do not matter and that history would be the judge of his presidency

Bush publicly supported Republican candidate John McCain during the 2008 presidential election but Barack Obama won the election

During the last few days he was President Bush gave his farewell address He said that his achievements were having two dictatorships turned into democracies and said that in the seven years after September 11 2001 the United States had not faced another terrorist attack

On January 20 2009 Barack Obama replaced Bush as President

After his presidency Bush stayed away from the spotlight and did not want much attention He said that he was not going to criticize President Obama He began to build his presidential library

After over a year and a half of silence in November of 2010 Bush appeared on several television interviews and released a book called Decision Points The book focuses on fourteen big decisions he made including quitting drinking running for president Hurricane Katrina invading Iraq and his response to the financial meltdown in 2008

Organic compounds are carbon based compounds Organic compounds contain carbon bonds in which at least one carbon atom is covalently linked to an atom of another type Most polymers are organic compounds

The name broken wikt linkorganicorganic is a historical name from the 19th century

People believed that only living things could make organic compounds and dead things could make inorganic compounds However Friedrich Whler proved this wrong because certain compounds in urine were thought to be inorganic but urine came from a living thing

There are natural organic compounds and synthetic ones Their structure may be described by using names and making diagrams 

One way of showing the molecule is by drawing its structural formula Because molecules can have complicated structures people have made ways to show them in simple language One way is to use line diagrams Each atom is shown by a letter and connected by a line to each atom with wnich it is has a covalent bond One line means a single bond two lines means a double bond and so on 

Because there is in an infinite   number of possible organic compounds language is needed to give a unique name to each one The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry or IUPAC made a system for doing this Although an IUPAC name makes every single possible molecule unique the names are often long and complicated so in everyday life trivial names unofficial but widely understood names are used such as the trivial names Paracetamol Tylenol and Acetaminophen which are used for a compound whose IUPAC name is N acetamide

Natural compounds are compounds made by plants or animals These could also be made in a lab but many of these compounds are taken from nature because it is easier and less expensive to do it that way Commonnatural compounds are amino acids proteins carbohydrates many antibiotics like Penicillin and Amoxicillin

Synthetic compounds are those made by people Sometimes this is done by taking something natural and changing the molecule in a small way such as making glycerine from vegetable oils Other compounds are synthesized in long complicated reactions with many steps Plastics are sometimes mostly natural and other kinds are manufactured

Since a compound is often first discovered in nature instead of being made on purpose in a lab people may know the compound exists and even know what it does sometimes but not know exactly what atoms it is made of and how it is arranged There are several ways of taking an unknown compound and finding out this structure

Coal is a black rock and a solid fossil fuel 

It is usually very hard Coal is made of 65 95 carbon It also has hydrocarbons and some other compounds in it 

Coal is a metamorphic rock formed from peat by the pressure of rocks laid down later on top The harder forms of coal such as anthracite have been changed by higher temperature as well as pressure 

Peat and therefore coal is formed from the remains of plants which lived millions of years ago in tropical wetlands such as those of the late Carboniferous period A similar substance made from wood by heating it in an airless space is called charcoal

Coal can be burned for energy or heat About two thirds of the coal mined today is burned in power stations to make electricity Coal is becoming less popular in new power plants as less expensive and less polluting technologies such as natural gas and hydroelectricity take over

Coal can be dry distilled to produce coke Coke is even better fuel than coal and coke can be used in smelting for reducing metals from ores

Under suitable conditions plant material is transformed step by step into

Petroleum also called crude oil is a thick and black liquid It is mainly made of hydrocarbons Most petroleum is found in the Middle East North America and Russia It is the most important world energy source It supplies 38 of the worlds energy at the moment

Petroleum can be split into less complex but more useful mixtures by fractional distillation The process is called oil refining

Petroleum can be easily transported by pipeline Treated petroleum can be used as fuels mainly gasoline for cars Diesel fuel for Diesel engines used in trucks trains and ships kerosene fuel for jets and as lubricants

Other uses of petroleum

Petroleum resource is limited and non renewable Some believe it will run out within 70 years Burning petroleum adds the carbon in the oil to the oxygen in the air to create carbon dioxide The carbon can be removed from the carbon dioxide by plants

Crude is chemically speaking a mixture of lots of different chemicals most of which burn well It is separated by fractional distillation in oil refineries to give separate chemicals such as gasoline for cars kerosene for airplanes and bitumen for roads The bitumen gives crude oil its dark black colour most of the other chemicals in crude are slightly yellow or colourless 

There is a lot of crude oil left underground Oil companies quote reserves which some people confuse with the actual amount of oil underground but are more to do with extraction costs Most of the crude left underground is in the Middle East which is not a politically stable part of the world Some governments with lots of oil reserves work together through OPEC to keep production low and prices high Policitians complain about high oil prices because voters complain However many environmentalists worry about the damage being done by using oil as a fuel source and are therefore happy that prices are kept high so that people use less oil

Natural gas is a mixture It consists mainly of hydrocarbons The main component is methane Natural gas is often found in the ground together with petroleum

Most natural gas is burnt directly to produce energy It burns with a clean blue flame It causes little pollution

The main uses of natural gas are to produce electricity cook and heat buildings It is also used as fuel for cars and to make fertilizers

When natural gas is burned in a power station it heats a tub of water Steam from the hot water rushes up and spins a turbine that turns a generator to make electricity

Natural gas is also used to make many plastic products It is used for many vehicles such as trucks boats cars excavators big rigs and airplanes

Energy is a word with more than one meaning

Energy is something that can do work

There are two basic forms of energy

When energy changes from one form to another the amount of energy stays the same Energy cannot be made or destroyed This rule is called the conservation law of energy

Here is an example

The measurements of energy at the start and end will always be the same

Scientists now know that matter can be made into energy and energy into matter through processes like nuclear fission and nuclear fusion The law of conservation of energy has therefore been extended to become the Law of conservation of matter and energy Albert Einstein was the first to mathematically derive this in the formula E mc2

Scientist have identified many types of energy and found that they can be changed from one kind into another For example

Energy can be measured That is the amount of energy a thing has can be given a number

As in other kinds of measurements there are measurement units The units of measurement for measuring energy are used to make the numbers meaningful

The SI unit for both energy and work is the joule It is named after James Prescott Joule 1 joule is equal to 1 newton metre In terms of SI base units 1 J is equal to 1 kg m2 s2

The energy unit of measurement for electricity is the kilowatt hour One kWh is equivalent to 3600000 J

Jewels are rare minerals They are usually coloured They can be shaped to make jewellery

Pearls amber and coral are sometimes also called gemstones

Xenon is a non metal chemical element It has the chemical symbol Xe and atomic number 54

This element was discovered by Sir William Ramsay and MW Travers in 1898 The elements name came from the Greek word xenos which means stranger

Xenon is a noble gas Noble gases are very unreactive However chemists have found that xenon can react with fluorine under special conditions since 1962 It is not known why xenon changed its behavior like that

Xenon gas is used in electron tubes bactericidal lamps stobe lamps and lamps used to excite ruby lasers

Kuala Lumpur is the capital city of Malaysia Malaysia is a country in Asia With the completion of Putrajaya in the late 1990s the administrative capital has been moved to Putrajaya Kuala Lumpur is home to one of the tallest buildings in the world the Petronas Twin Towers

Kuala Lumpur is located in the climatic region of tropical wetlands

The annual range of temperature in Kuala Lumpur is small only 1C There is no distinct seasonal difference in temperature in the city Kuala Lumpur is hot throughout the year The annual mean temperature are 265 C 

The annual rainfall in Kuala Lumpur is high The rainfall distribution is even in the city with heavy rainfall all the year In April and November the monthly rainfall is slightly higher

Since Kuala Lumpur became a Federal Territory of Malaysia on February 1 1972 the city has been led by seven mayors They are

The speed of light is the speed at which light travels in empty space This is 299792458 meters per second A photon travels at this speed in a vacuum 

According to special relativity c is the maximum speed at which all energy matter and physical information in the universe can travel It is the speed of all massless particles such as photons and associated fieldsincluding electromagnetic radiation such as lightin a vacuum It is predicted by the current theory to be the speed of gravity Such particles and waves travel at c regardless of the motion of the source or the inertial frame of reference of the observer In the theory of relativity c interrelates space and time and appears in the famous equation of massenergy equivalence E mc2

The theory of relativity is based on the prediction so far upheld by observations that the measured speed of light in a vacuum is the same whether or not the source of the light and the person doing the measuring are moving relative to each other This is sometimes expressed as the speed of light is independent of the reference frame

This behavior is different from our common ideas about motion as shown by this example

George is standing on the ground next to some train tracks There is a train rushing by at 30 mph George throws a baseball at 90 mph in the direction the train is moving Tom a passenger on the train has a device to measure throwing speeds Because he is on the train Tom is already moving at 30 mph in the direction of the throw so Tom measures the speed of the ball as only 60 mph

In other words the speed of the baseball as measured by Tom on the train depends on the speed of the train

In the example above the train was moving at 13 the speed of the ball and the speed of the ball as measured on the train was 23 of the throwing speed as measured on the ground

Now repeat the experiment with light instead of a baseball that is George has a flashlight instead of throwing a baseball George and Tom both have devices that are the same to measure the speed of light

George is standing on the ground next to some train tracks There is a train rushing by at 13 the speed of light George flashes a light beam in the direction the train is moving George measures the speed of light as 186000 miles per second Tom a passenger on the train measures the speed of the light beam What speed does Tom measure

Intuitively you may think that the speed of the light from the flashlight as measured on the train should be 23 the speed measured on the ground just like the speed of the baseball was 23 But in fact the speed measured on the train is the full value 186000 mile per second not 124000 miles per second

It sounds impossible but thats what one measures Part of the reason is that light is energy which acts and moves in ways very different than matter or solid objects such as a baseball

Maxwells equations predicted the speed of light and confirmed Michael Faradays idea that light was an electromagnetic wave From these equations we find that the speed of light is related to the inverse of the square root of the permittivity of free space and the permeability of free space

A consequence of this fact is that nothing can go faster than the speed of light Another consequence is that for objects that have weight no matter how much energy is used to increase the speed of an object it will get closer and closer but it will never reach the speed of light These ideas were discovered in the early 1900s by Albert Einstein whose work completely changed our understanding of light

The index of refraction of a clear material is the ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum and the speed of light in that material

Ole Christensen Rmer used an astronomical measurement to make the first quantitative estimate of the speed of light When measured from Earth the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it The distance travelled by light from the planet to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit the difference in distance being the diameter of the Earths orbit around the Sun The observed change in the moons orbital period is actually the difference in the time it takes light to traverse the shorter or longer distance Rmer observed this effect for Jupiters innermost moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earths orbit

Another method is to use the aberration of light discovered and explained by James Bradley in the 18th century This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source and the velocity of its observer A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position Since the direction of the Earths velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around From the angular difference in the position of stars it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earths velocity around the Sun This with the known length of a year can be easily converted to the time needed to travel from the Sun to the Earth In 1729 Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit or equivalently that it would take light 8 minutes 12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth

Nowadays the light time for unit distancethe inverse of c expressed in seconds per astronomical unitis measured by comparing the time for radio signals to reach different spacecraft in the Solar System The position of spacecraft is calculated from the gravitational effects of the Sun and various planets By combining many such measurements a best fit value for the light time per unit distance is obtained As of2009 the best estimate as approved by the International Astronomical Union is

The relative uncertainty in these measurements is 002 parts per billion equivalent to the uncertainty in Earth based measurements of length by interferometry Since the metre is defined to be the length travelled by light in a certain time interval the measurement of the light time for unit distance can also be interpreted as measuring the length of an AU in metres The metre is considered to be a unit of proper length whereas the AU is usually used as a unit of observed length in a given frame of reference

The finite speed of light is a major constraint on long distance space travel Supposing a journey to the other side of the Milky Way the total time for a message and its reply would be about 200000 years Even more seriously no spacecraft could travel faster than light so all galactic scale transport would be effectively one way and would take much longer than than any modern civilisation has existed

The speed of light can also be of concern over very short distances In supercomputers the speed of light imposes a limit on how quickly data can be sent between processors If a processor operates at 1 gigahertz a signal can only travel a maximum of about convert30cmft0 in a single cycle Processors must therefore be placed close to each other to minimize communication latencies this can cause difficulty with cooling If clock frequencies continue to increase the speed of light will eventually become a limiting factor for the internal design of single chips

Denial in psychology means that someone denies that something has happened or is happening although he really knows it is true Usually this happens because admitting it would cause a lot of pain

Denial is usually the first state of coping with loss For example if someone close to a person dies the survivors first feeling might be denial or refusal to accept the fact that the person is really dead

 Tokyo is the capital of Japan Ten percent of the Japanese people live in Tokyo and as many as twenty percent of the population live around it As of 2007 the population was 12790000 Tokyo is the center of business trade and industry of Japan and also of Asia The city is the center of the largest metropolitan area in the world

Tokyo is in a part of Japan called the Kanto plain It faces Tokyo bay Two rivers run through Tokyo One is the Sumida River which runs from the north to the south and flows into Tokyo bay The other is the Tama River which runs from the west to the east The Tama River is a border between Tokyo and its neighbor city Kawasaki 

Tokyo means the Eastern capital in Japanese It became the capital city of Japan in the middle of 19th century when its name changed from Edo to Tokyo Before then Kyoto was the capital of Japan The emperor of Japan Tenno lived in Kyoto Edo was the place where the Tokugawa Shoguns lived The city grew up under the control of the Shoguns Before then it was a small town on the sea Edo means the mouth of a river in Japanese

Tokyo was destroyed by fires started by the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923 It was also badly damaged by bombs during World War II After Japan lost the war the city was rebuilt

Tokyo began as a small fishing village named Edo Edo was in the old Musashi Province 

The Edo clan built wals to protect the town in the late 12th century In 1457 ta Dkan built Edo Castle In 1590 Tokugawa Ieyasu made Edo his base He became shogun in 1603 and the town became the center of his military government This marked the beginning of the Edo period During this time Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world More than one million people lived there by the 18th century

Edo was not the capital of Japan The emperor lived in the capital Kyoto However Edo had more power After about 263 years the Meiji Restoration removed the shogun from power In 1869 the 17 year old Emperor Meiji moved to Edo The old Edo Castle became the Imperial Palace The city of Tokyo was established It was the capital until government changes in 1943 That year Tokyo City and the special Metropolitan Prefecture of Tokyo combined into one

Central Tokyo is built around major railway stations Suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level There are some expressways but the basic design has not changed

Tokyo suffered two major catastrophes in the 20th century The 1923 Great Kant earthquake left 140000 dead or missing World War II was the other disaster for the city The Bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 killed between 75000 to 200000 people and destroyed half the city This was almost as much damage as the atomic bombs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined

Tokyo was completely rebuilt after the war The 1964 Summer Olympics were a major world event New high rise developments such as Sunshine 60 started in the 1970s Narita International Airport opened at Narita in 1978 but is far outside the city

Tokyo has many international residents As of 2005 the most common groups in Tokyo are Chinese Koreans and Filipinos Americans British Brazilian and French are less common

The special wards of Tokyo are the same area that had been called Tokyo City On July 1 1943 Tokyo City was merged with Tky fu to become a special government area Therefore these wards are different from other wards in Japan Other city wards are part of a larger city government but these are not Each ward is a municipality with its own mayor and assembly like the other cities of Japan The special wards often use the word city in their official English name eg Chiyoda City

The wards have a different government role from usual cities They have a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government The Tokyo Metropolitan Government manages some public works such as water sewer and fire fighting To pay for these things the prefecture collects municipal taxes usually collected by a city

The special wards of Tokyo are

Three wards of Tokyo make up the central part of the city They are Chiyoda Ch and Minato

Tokyo has many site seeing spots but very few of them are old There are very few buildings in Tokyo that are more than 50 years Popular places for visitors range from Tokyo Tower in the center of the city to Mount Takao out in the western countryside Tokyo Sky Tree is a new tower and is the tallest in the world Traditional religious sites such as Meiji Shrine and Sens ji attract many tourists The Imperial Castle can be seen in the middle of the city but is not open to the public 

Tokyo is the cultural business and political center of the country It is also the center of many transportation systems There are many air rail sea and road transportation links in and out of the city Tokyo is at the center of many of these systems Local subway and bus systems serve every part of the city

Two commercial airports serve Tokyo Haneda Airport is in the city limits next to Tokyo Bay This airport is mostly for domestic travel Most international flights to and from Tokyo go through Narita Airport in Chiba Prefecture

Several Shinkansen lines begin at Tokyo Station including the Tkaid Shinkansen going west and Thoku Shinkansen going northeast

Tokyo has a busy international and domestic port but more traffic goes through the nearby port of Yokohama There are domestic ferries to the islands of Tokyo but also to other parts of the country such as Hokkaido

Many highways meet in Tokyo including the Ch Kan Etsu Thoku and Tmei Expressways All highway distances in Japan start from zero at a marker in Nihonbashi Tokyo

Lao Zi was one of the most famous Chinese philosophers although it is not confirmed if he was actually a single person or if the ideas associated with Lao Zi were actually those of several different people As a result his birth date is unknown He was the author of a book called Tao Te Ching According to this book Tao does not change and it is the universal truth His Taoism has been enormously influential in China Lao Zi is also known as Senior Lord in Taoism of the general public The Chinese name Lao Zi is translated as Old Master in English

Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc Some types of brass are called bronzes

Brass has a golden appearance It is harder than pure metals It costs more than zinc

There are some common brasses

Things brass are used to make

A body is the physical material of a person or organism It is only used for organisms which are in one part or whole There are organisms which change from single cells to whole organisms for example slime moulds For them the term body would mean the multicellular stage Other uses

The body of a dead person is also called a corpse or cadaver The dead bodies of vertebrate animals and insects are sometimes called carcasses

The human body has a head neck torso two arms two legs and the genitals of the groin which differ between males and females

The study of the body is anatomy

The study of the workings of the body is physiology

Here are the names of the body parts of a woman and a man 

The word body is sometimes used in other ways For example a lake is a body of water

An alloy is a uniform mixture It is made up of two or more chemical elements of which at least one is a metal An alloy has properties different from the metals it is made of

Most alloys are made by melting the metals mixing them while they are liquid to form a solution then leaving them to cool and turn solid again

Combining a metal with one or more metals or non metals is called alloying Alloying a metal often makes its properties better For example steel is an alloy made from iron but it is stronger than iron Physical properties like density reactivity and electrical and thermal conductivity may not be much different than the elements which make the alloy But properties like strength can be very much different

The first alloy to be discovered was Bronze Bronze is made from copper and tin Bronze was discovered a very long time back in history Then bronze was being used for making tools and weapons This period was known as Bronze Age But in time better alloys were discovered which replaced bronze for making tools and weapons Nowadays bronze is used for making ornaments statues and bells Brass is another alloy made from copper and zinc

Melting point is the temperature at which a solid changes to liquid Most alloys do not have a single melting point They have a melting range in which the alloy is a mixture of solid and liquid stages The temperature at which melting just starts is called solidus and the temperature at which the melting is just finished is called liquidus

The term alloy means a mixture of atoms in which the main substance or the primary constituent is a metal This primary metal is called the base or matrix

If an alloy has only two types of atoms like copper nickel alloy then such an alloy is called binary alloy If an alloy has three types of atoms like iron nickel and chromium then it called a ternary alloy An alloy with four types of atoms is called a quaternary alloy and an alloy with five types of atoms is called a quinary alloy

Different varieties or forms of alloys can be made from the same constituent materials These different forms or varieties can be formed by using different amounts of the constituents The whole range of possible varieties of an alloy is called a system All the forms of alloy having only two constituents are called a binary system All forms of an alloy having three constituents are called a ternary system

There are some common alloys

A material is something used to make things When we speak about material we mean physical substances 

We call cloth for making clothes material Raw materials are materials before we process them  change them into something different

Information can be material For example a writer looks for material when writing a book

Material desire is a feeling in people when they want a physical material so badly that they can never go away from it For example addiction can be a material desire

The brain is a part of the body that allows us to make sense of the world around us and to change our behavior to respond to it Our brain is the control center of the whole body It receives messages from all parts of our body and sends out necessary commands to control the bodys actions The brain is made up of a special type of cells They are connected with each other and with the nerves in our body The delicate brain is protected on the outside by strong skull bones

The brain does the thinking learning and feeling for the body It is the source of consciousness but it also controls basic body actions like breathing that happen without a person realizing it All the information about the world gathered by our five senses is sent through nerves into the brain allowing us to see hear smell taste and feel things The brain processes this information so that we can experience it as pictures sounds and so on The brain also uses nerves to tell the body what to do for example by telling muscles to move or our heart to beat faster

Most animals have brains in some way or another Some animals however like jellyfish do not have brains Over time animals brains have become more complicated because of evolution

Humans might have the most complicated brain People used to think that only humans had a sense of humor but apparently the octopus also has a sense of humor Over time animals brains also gained the ability to have emotions but scientists are still not sure what defines emotions and which animals have them

In human beings the brain is made of three main parts the cerebrum the cerebellum and the brainstem The cerebrum is where intelligence and thought is The cerebrum lets us learn reason remember create and think It also controls the senses and the muscles The cerebellum connects all the muscles so they can work together The brain stem is something that connects the brain with the spinal cord It has lots of different parts that control different jobs in the body for instance the brain stem controls breathing heartbeat sneezing eye blinking and swallowing Body temperature and hunger are also controlled by parts of the brain stem

A human brain accounts for about 2 of the bodys weight but it uses about 20 of its energy It has about 50 100 billion nerve cells along with roughly the same number of support cells called glia The job of neurons is to receive and send information to and from the rest of the body while glia provide nutrients and guide blood flow to the neurons allowing them to do their job Each nerve cell has contact with as many as 10000 other nerve cells through connections called synapses

The volume of the human brain is very large compared to that of most other animals The human brain also has a very large surface for its size which is possible because it is very wrinkled If the human cortex were flattened it would be close to a square meter in area Some other animals also have very wrinkled brains such as dolphins and elephants Some people believe that what makes humans so smart is the large volume or surface area of their brains but there is no evidence for a relationship among animals between size of the brain and intelligence eg the brain of a blue whale is much heavier than a human brain but it is not seen as being more intelligent than a humans brain As an additional note Einsteins brain weighed only 1230 grams which is less than the average adult male brain

A neuron is a cell that carries electrical impulses Neurons are the basic units of the nervous system and its most important part the brain 

Every neuron is made of a cell body dendrites and an axon Dendrites and axons are nerve fibres There are about 100 billion neurons in the human brain which comprises roughly 10 of all brain cells The neurons are supported by microglia and astrocytes 

There are three classes of neurons afferent neurons efferent neurons and interneurons

Sensory neurons carry signals from sense organs to the spinal cord and brain

Relay neurons carry messages from one part of the CNS

Motor neurons carry signals from the CNS to muscles motor neurons are connected to the relay neurons The signal passes between the neurons via synapses Synapses are microscopic voids between cells where chemicals are released from the axon terminal of one cell to specialized chemical receptors on the dendrite of the receiving cell

The Middle East is an area of land and group of countries in southwestern Asia and north Africa 

Today people usually call these countries Middle Eastern

Sometimes people also call these countries Middle Eastern Algeria Morocco and Tunisia in North Africa and the countries Afghanistan and Pakistan Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in Central Asia

Ancient civilizations began in the Middle East These were Sumer Babylonia and Assyria in the area called Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt The three religions that believe in one God also came from the Middle East Judaism and Christianity began in ancient Israel and Islam began in Arabia

Today the Middle East is very important because a lot of the oil that other countries need comes from here There are also many arguments and fights here such as the Arab Israeli Wars and the Iraq War

Warsaw is the capital of Poland It is also the biggest city in that country There are about 2000000 people living there People from Warsaw are called Varsovians

Warsaw lies near the middle of Poland on both sides of the Vistula river and about 350 km from the Baltic Sea It is about 100 m above sea level

Warsaw is home to 4 universities and 62 colleges and many theatres and art galleries

People began living in this place in the 13th century By the 15th century Warsaw had grown enough to be called a city It became the capital of Poland in 1596

The city was destroyed several times in its history but every time it was rebuilt The most important of these times was during the Second World War Poland had been occupied by Germany between 1939 and 1944 On 1 August 1944 the people of Warsaw started fighting to free their city

There are lot of attractions in the capital of Poland The most famous monument of Warsaw is Palace of Culture and Sciencist You can aslo go to a Palace in Wilanow The king of Poland Jan III Sobieski was living there Lot of people like going to the Mueum of Warsaw uprising The uprising started in 1944 at the Second World War

The Hindu Arabic numeral system is a numeral system This system has ten basic symbols they are 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9

The Hindu Arabic numeral system was first developed by the Hindus Later It was introduced to the western world by the Arabs This system is now commonly used all over the world

A different set of symbols are used to represent the numeralsThere were also different types of numerals through out the centuries

The Hindu Arabic numeral system is one of the only numeral systems that use a place value system

A point is a position in space Imagine touching a piece of paper with a sharp pencil or pen without making any sideways movement We know where the point is but it has no size to speak of

In geometry a point has no size but has a position This means it has no volume area or length We usually represent a point by a small cross X or by a small dot In geometry points are always labelled by capital letters 

Mathematicians say two points can be

and are always

Three points can be

and are always

Four points can be 

Compare line plane

A line is the path of one point moving A line has length but no width A line is a type of geometric figure 

A line is made up of an endless number of points 

  

A line segment is part of a line An example of a straight line segment

A line can be straight or curved The word line usually means a straight line A straight line is the shortest distance between two points A straight line is the direction of a point moving in a direction that does not change 

A curved line is sometimes called a curve

For example the edge of a circle is not straight The edge of a circle bends in a curve

Lines can get their names from any two points on the line For example if a line has a point named A on the line and a point named B on the line then the line can be called either AB or BA 

Sometimes lines are also named with just one letter for example line A

Two lines can be

Compare point plane

A plane is a perfectly flat surface extending in all directions Try to imagine the ceiling of a room only extended into all directions infinitely A plane has two dimensions length and width All planes are flat surfaces If a surface is not flat it is called a curved surface 

In geometry a plane is made up of an infinite number of lines It has no thickness

A plane figure is part of a plane It is named by the capital letters that are put at its corners

Mathematicians say two planes can be

In mathematics a plane is a fundamental two dimensional object Intuitively it looks like a flat infinite sheet of paper There are several definitions of the plane They are equivalent in the sense of Euclidean geometry but they can be extended in different ways to define objects in other areas of mathematics The only 2 dimensional figure in our 3 dimensional world is a shadow

In some areas of mathematics such as plane geometry or 2D computer graphics the whole space in which the work is carried out is a single plane In such situations the definite article is used the plane Many fundamental tasks in geometry trigonometry and graphing are performed in the two dimensional space or in other words in the plane

A plane is a surface such that given any three distinct points on the surface the surface also contains all of the straight lines that pass through any two of them One can introduce a Cartesian coordinate system on a given plane in order to label every point on it with a unique ordered pair which is composed of two numbers and is the coordinate of the point

Within any Euclidean space a plane is uniquely determined by any of the following combinations

An angle is the space between two lines that meet each other When two lines meet at a point an angle is formed The two lines are called the arms of the angle The point they meet is called the vertex

To measure the size of an angle we use degree Degree is a standard unit Degree is denoted by the symbol A degree can be divided into 60 minutes and a minute can be also be divided into 60 seconds In mathematics angles are usually measured in radians

An acute angle is an angle less than 90 A right angle is an angle equal to 90 An obtuse angle is an angle greater than 90 A straight angle is an angle equal to 180 A reflex angle is an angle greater than 180 but less than 360

Supplementary angles are two angles with the sum equal to 180

Two angles that sum to one right angle are called complementary angles 

Two angles that sum to one full circle are called explementary angles or conjugate angles 

People usually use a protractor to measure and draw angles Sometimes people use an angle ruler to measure angles

Astronomical telescopes are divided into subgroups All telescopes work by collecting electromagnetic radiation and focussing it into an image which may be seen or photographed The purpose is to see things which are far away in the universe

The traditional types all work to collect visible light from the sky Recent types may work outside the visible spectrum They all have their different advantages and disadvantages and they are used in different areas of astronomy

Dioptrics Telescopes which create their image with an objective that is a convex lens are said to be dioptric telescopes

Catoptrics Optical systems using mirrors uses reflected light to form the image

Catadioptrics 

These types can be mounted on different types of mounts

A list of endangered languages

In order to judge if a language is actually endangered the number of speakers is less important than the distribution among age cohorts There may be 200000 mother tongue speakers of the Breton language over 50 years of age but fewer than 2000 under 25 years of age  thus it is likely Breton will die out in the next half century On the other hand while there are 30000 Ladin language speakers left almost all children still learn it as their mother tongue  thus Ladin is not endangered in the 21st century

Within the North Atlantic ocean tropical or subtropical cyclones are named by the National Hurricane Center when they are judged to have intensified into a tropical storm with winds of at least 65 kmh Six lists of names are used in alphabetical order and maintained by the World Meteorological Organization with them rotating on a yearly basis Significant tropical cyclones have their names removed from the lists with a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee meeting If all of the names on a list are used storms are named after the letters of the Greek alphabet Greek names unlike the names in the regular lists cannot be removed If a storm ever reached the magnitude that might otherwise have led to retirement the storm would be listed with the retired names with a footnote indicating the Greek letter would still be available for future storms

Within the Eastern Pacific Ocean two offices of the United States National Weather Service assign names to tropical cyclones when they are judged to have intensified into a tropical storm with winds of at least 65 kmh Tropical cyclones that become tropical storms between the coast of Americas and 140W are named by the National Hurricane Center whilst tropical cyclones intensifying into tropical storms between 140W and 180 are named by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists and a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee meeting

When a tropical depression intensifies into a tropical storm to the north of the Equator between the coastline of the Americas and 140E then it will be named by the NHC Six lists of names are maintained by the World Meteorological Organization with them rotating on a yearly basis Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists with a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee meeting If all of the names on a list are used storms are then named after the letters of the Greek alphabet Greek names unlike the names in the regular lists cannot be retired If a storm ever reached the magnitude that might otherwise have led to retirement the storm would be listed with the retired names with a footnote indicating the Greek letter would still be available for future storms

When a tropical depression intensifies into a tropical storm to the north of the Equator between 140W and 180 it is named by the CPHC Four lists of names are maintained by the World Meteorological Organization rotating without regard to year with the first name for a new year being the next name in sequence that was not used the previous year Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists with a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization Regional Association IV Hurricane Committee meeting The last name to be used from this list was Omeka whilst the next will be Pewa

Within the Northwestern Pacific Ocean there are two separate agencies who assign names to tropical cyclones which often results in a cyclone having two names The Japan national weather service names tropical cyclones should they be judged to have 10 minute sustained wind speeds of 65 kmh to the north of the equator between the 180 and 100E The Philippine national weather service also assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135E and 115E and between 5E 25E even if the cyclone has had a name assigned to it by the Japanese national weather service

Tropical cyclones are named from the following lists by the Japanese national weather service once they become a tropical storm Names are contributed by members of the ESCAPWMO Typhoon Committee Each of the 14 nations or territories submitted 10 names which are used in alphabetical order by the English name of the country

The Philippine national weather service uses its own naming scheme for tropical cyclones in their area of responsibility PAGASA assigns names to tropical depressions that form within their area of responsibility and any tropical cyclone that moves into their area of responsibility Should the list of names for a given year prove to be insufficient names are taken from a reserve list of names with the first ten published every year

Within this basin when a deep depression is judged to have become a Cyclonic Storm it will be named by the Indian national weather service The list of names were selected between 2000 and 2004 by the countries of the WMOESCAP Panel on tropical cyclones before the actual naming of tropical cyclones began in September 2004

Within the South west Indian Ocean tropical and subtropical depressions that are judged to have 10 minute sustained windspeeds of 65 kmh or more for at least 6 hours by the national weather service of Reunion Island are usually assigned a name However it is the Mauritius and Madagascan national weather services who name the systems The National weather service of Mauritius name the storm should it intensify into a moderate tropical storm between 55E and 90E if the storm should intensify into a moderate tropical storm between 30E and 55E then the national weather service of Madagascar assigns the appropriate name to the storm Tropical cyclones moving into this region from the Australian Region are renamed by the Sub Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Center in Mauritius however tropical cyclones moving into the Australian region do not get renamed New name lists are used every year whilst a name is normally only used once so thus no names are retired

Within the Australian Region there are five different offices that assign names to tropical cyclones However as three of the offices are run by the Australian national weather service only 3 lists of names are operated A tropical depression is judged to have intensified into a tropical cyclone if winds reach 65 kmh and it is clear that gales are occurring more than halfway around the center Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists and a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization Regional Association V Tropical Cyclone Committee meeting

When a tropical depression intensifies into a tropical cyclone between the Equator and 10S and between 90E and 125E then it will be named by the Indonesian national weather service Should a tropical low intensify into a tropical cyclone between the Equator and 10S and between 141E and 160E are assigned names by the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Port Moresby Papua New Guinea Tropical Depressions intensifying into tropical cyclones in all other areas between 90E and 160E as well as the Equator and 40S are named by the Australian national weather service Should a tropical cyclone pass from one warning center to another it will retain its original name except when moving into the South West Indian Ocean where the Mauritius Meteorological Service will rename the system

When a tropical depression intensifies into a tropical cyclone between the Equator and 10S and between 90E  125E it will be named by the Indonesian Weather Service Names are currently assigned in sequence from list A while list B is a list of names that will replace names on list A that are retired

When a tropical low intensifies into a tropical cyclone between 10S and 40S and between 90E  160E then it will be named by one of three Australian national weather service offices in Perth Darwin or Brisbane Starting with Anika the names are assigned in alphabetical order with the lists used in rotating order without regard to year

When a tropical low intensifies into a tropical cyclone between the equator and 10S and between 141E  160E then it will be named by the Papua New Guineas national weather service Names from List A are assigned in a random order while list B details replacement names for list A which will be added in the bottom of list A to maintain the alphabetical order

Within the Southern Pacific a tropical depression is judged to have reach tropical cyclone intensity should it reach winds of 65 kmh and it is evident that gales are occurring at least halfway around the center Tropical depressions that should intensify into a tropical cyclone between the Equator and 25S and between 160E  120W are named by the Fiji national weather service Should a Tropical Depression intensify to the south of 25S between 160E and 120W it will be named in conjunction with the Fijian national weather service by the New Zealands national weather service Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists and a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization Regional Association V Tropical Cyclone Committee meeting whilst tropical cyclones that move into the Australian region will retain its original name

Tropical cyclone formation is rare within the Mediterranean sea South Atlantic and to the east of 120W in the Southern Pacific as a result there are no official naming lists for these areas although in 2004 2010 when tropical cyclones formed within the South Atlantic they were named as Catarina and Anita

This is a list of some comets in the solar system

Periodic comets visit us again and again Non periodic comets visit us only once On this list there is a P in front of the periodic comets In front of non periodic comets there is a C There is sometimes a number in front of the P it shows the number of times people saw the periodic comet visiting us 

Periodic comets have a special place in astronomy because their orbits are often the same We know when they will visit us and we can plan to watch them and send space probes to look at them 

On August 24 1994 the International Astronomical Union standardized the way we give names to this type of comets It made a system of letters and numbers This system tells us which comet is which The IAU chose the letter P for periodic comets and D for periodic comets that were lost or which broke into pieces Other letters are C for non periodic comets and X for comets where we do not know their orbits It also allows for type changes by using A for objects people say are asteroids Each name starts with a number counting up and make the name unique no two comets have the same name

The following is a list of main sequence stars with confirmed extrasolar planets Note that the masses of the planets are lower bounds only If a planet is detected by the spectral line displacement method referred to above no information is gained about the inclination of the planets plane of orbit around its star and a value for this is needed to calculate the mass It has become customary to arbitrarily assume that the plane is exactly lined up with the line of sight from Earth

This is a list of tallest structures in the world past and present of any type Most of the structures are television broadcasting masts There are also the taller tower type structures and the taller high rise buildings 

The list also includes some other structures like oil platforms electrical towers bridge towers etc List is organized by absolute height since it includes many different classes of structures

This list includes quite a few masts A mast is a man made support structure commonly used on sailing ships as support for sails or on land as radio masts and towers used to support telecommunication equipment such as radio antennas

There is often ambiguity between the terms tower and mast A tower is a self supporting or cantilevered structure while a mast is held up by stays or guys Both towers and masts have limited floor space and are non building structures as opposed to regular buildings which have greater floor space for occupancy The terminology is further confused through misuse Skyscrapers are often referred to as towers and some towers use the term mast Ironically skyscraper has some etymology from references to high sailboat masts

An acid is something that has a pH less than 70 

Sometimes the abbreviation HA is used to mean an acid

The chemistry definition of an acid is a substance that donates a hydrogen ion to another substance which is called a base 

Acids can be commonly found in nature Some of these include

Some acids are strong and others are weak The weak acids hold on to some of their protons while the strong acids let go of all of them Weak acids generally have a pH value of 4 6 while strong acids have a pH value of 1 3

Acids can have different strengths some are more reactive than others More reactive acids are often more dangerous

Acids can have a lot of different properties depending on their molecular structure Most acids

Acids can burn the skin The burn can be serious or minor depending on the kind of acid and how concentrated it is Burns like this can be a serious problem Chemical burns like this need medical attention immediately

Acids are important Nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA contain the genetic code These molecules determine many characteristics of an organism they are passed from the parents to offspring DNA contains the plans how to build proteins which are made of amino acids 

Fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology These contain long chains of hydrocarbons and a carboxylic acid group on one end The cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a phospholipid bilayer a micelle of hydrophobic fatty acid chains with polar hydrophilic phosphate head groups

In humans and many other animals hydrochloric acid is a part of the gastric acid secreted within the stomach It can help hydrolyze proteins and polysaccharides It can also convert the inactive pro enzyme pepsinogen into the enzyme pepsin Some organisms produce acids for defense for example ants produce formic acid

A white dwarf is a star The colour of a white dwarf is like most other stars but not as bright White Dwarfs were discovered in the 19th century and the first ones found were white The colour of a star is a measure of how hot it is white stars are like the Sun blue stars are hotter and red stars are cooler White dwarfs are not very bright because they are smaller than many brighter stars  not because they are cold Some white dwarfs are blue instead of white

Many white dwarfs are about the same size as the Earth and about 100 times smaller than the Sun They may weigh the same as the sun which would make them very dense The heavier the white dwarf is then the smaller its size will be

A star like our Sun will become a white dwarf when it has run out of fuel Near the end of its life it will go through a red giant stage and then lose most of its gas until what is left settles down and becomes a young white dwarf 

White dwarf stars are extremely hot so they emit bright white light This heat is what is left of the heat made when the star collapsed Because white dwarfs are extremely small it takes them a long time to cool down Eventually all white dwarfs will cool down into what is called a black dwarf These are what is left of the star after all of its heat and light has gone away 

A beach is an area of lakeshore or seashore which is fairly open slopes smoothly to the water and is free of trees large boulders or anything else which might make walking difficult or impossible Many beaches are made of sand but some beaches are made of gravel Most people enjoy beaches as a place to swim to work on their tan or just to relax The most popular beaches have fine white or light colored sand and warm water to swim in Beaches may also be popular because of the excellent opportunities for diving or for seeing marine life

Among the worlds most popular and well known beaches are Aruba Long Beach Copacabana Beach Hot Water Beach Megan Bay Kailua Beach Zandvoort Beach and Bondi Beach

Over the past years many beaches have changed their rules about dress and most countries now have naturist beaches where clothing is optional or even where clothing is not allowed

A mental illness is an illness of the mind People with a mental illness may behave in strange ways or have strange thoughts in their view or the view of others Mental illnesses develop during the life of a person This may be linked to genes and experience What is considered as a mental illness has changed over time What is considered to be a mental illness may not be one in a different culture

People with a mental illness sometimes have problems dealing with other people or leading what is called a normal life Treatment and certain medications can help people with certain mental illnesses lead a better life

The Presidents New Freedom Commission on Mental Health in the US said that major mental illnesses including major depression body dysmorphic disorder bipolar disorder schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder are the most common disability

According to National Alliance for the Mentally Ill in the US twenty three percent of North American adults will have a mental illness in a given year But less than half of them will be bad enough to disrupt their normal activities

Mental illnesses can be treated by

And all human rights of persons with mental illness are protected by

Depression is a mental illness or mood disorder which makes people feel sad and pessimistic Most people feel sad discouraged or down sometimes but that is not depression In clinical depression these feelings last for a long time and are combined with other symptoms Someone with depression might have these symptoms strong sad feelings or no strong feelings at all feeling guilty feeling helpless or hopeless anxiety fear low self esteem or a loss of interest in life These are symptoms of depression when they last for a long time Most people who have not had depression do not completely understand its effects Instead they see it as simply being sad Since it is not understood many people with depression are criticized by others for not helping themselves

Many people have depression It is the most common form of disability in the world Depression happens most often in people between the ages of 13 and 60 years Although more women as men are diagnosed with depression it is the most common mental illness for both men and women

There are many signs that a person may be suffering from depression One of the most common is a depressed mood which includes feeling sad and having less interest or pleasure in things that are normally enjoyable Other core causes include low self esteem guilt tiredness anxiety or pessimism and sometimes thinking about suicide Some changes are more physical such as changes in how much and when a person eats and sleeps misusing drugs or alcohol or complaining of mental or physical fatigue

Depression in children is harder to see Children who are depressed may have a loss of appetite meaning that they do not want to eat They may also be clearly having more trouble in everyday life than before This can include sleep problems such as nightmares new problems with behaviour or grades at school or being more agitated or easily irritable than usual

Depression is a syndrome of many symptoms that relate to each other and is not just feeling sad Medical measurements have shown that there are big changes in the chemicals in the brain and that the whole brain slows down during depression Depression that is not treated may get worse

Major depressive disorder is also referred to as major biochemical clinical endogenous or biological depression It may also be called unipolar affective disorder

There are many subtypes of depression

Depression comes from the brain but scientists are still trying to find out exactly why it happens

These things can cause depression or make it worse

Depression is usually treated with a combination of medication and other therapy Good exercise helps deal with depression since exercise releases chemicals that put a person in a better mood Having a supportive group of friends and doing outside activities can also help prevent or ease depression

There are many medications that can help with depression Many of these are called antidepressants 

Sometimes antidepressant medicine works better when it is used together with another drug that is not an antidepressant These augmentor drugs are

If people with depression do not take their medicine the right way the depression can get worse A doctor must help when they want to change to another medication or to take a different amount of a medication than before

In psychotherapy someone with depression is helped to understand and solve problems which cause depression 

Psychotherapy can help a person make changes in the way they think in order to help with relationship problems and understand what makes depression worse  The most effective psychotherapy for depression is Cognitive behavioral therapy This teaches a person to think in a more rational positive realistic manner 

Electroconvulsive therapy also called electroshock therapy or shock therapy is used to treat a small percentage of severely depressed people ECT uses a small amount of electricity to cause an epileptic seizure while the patient is under anesthesia This may cause some memory loss

The Quran sometimes spelled Koran is the holy book of Islam The Quran is considered by Muslims to be The Word of Allah This book is different from other religious texts in that it is believed to be written directly by God through the prophet Muhammad 

It has been written and read only in Arabic for more than 1400 years But because many Muslims around the world do not understand Arabic the meaning of the Quran is also given in other languages so that readers can understand better what the Arabic words in the Quran mean These books are like dictionaries to the Quran  they are not read as part of the religion of Islam to replace the Arabic Quran Muslims believe that these translations are not the true Quran only the Arabic copy is the true Quran

Muslims believe the Quran was first revealed to Muhammad by the archangel Gabriel in a cave on the mountain of Hira in Mecca and then over a period of twenty three years until his death 

The Quran was not written all together in book form while Muhammad was alive it was kept by oral communication and brief written records The prophet did not know how to read nor write but according to Muslims the prophets friend Abu Bakr among others used to write the texts on something when Muhammad was alive When Abu Bakr was caliph he had the Quran written down as a book Uthman who was the third caliph further refined its written format

There are 30 parts in the Quran which make 114 suras Each sura has a different number of verses 

According to the Muslim teachingsfactdateJuly 2010 86 of these suras took place in Mecca 24 of these suras took place in Medina The suras which took place in Medina are Al Baqara Al Imran Al Anfal Al Ahzab Al Maida An Nisa Al Mumtahina Az Zalzala Al Hadid Muhammad Ar Rad Ar Rahman At Talaq Al Bayyina Al Hashr An Nasr An Nur Al Hajj Al Munafiqun Al Mujadila Al Hujraat At Tahrim At Taghabun Al Jumua As Saff Al Fath At Tawba Al Insan 

The first verse revealed is Read with the Name of Allah Who has created He created man from a hanging mass like a leech Read and your Lord is Most Generous Who taught man by the pen Who taught man which he did not know

The last verse revealed is Who believe fulfil obligations Lawful unto you are all four footed animals Dead meat blood pig any food which has been blessed by a god other than Allah an animal whose death resulted from strangulation bludgeoning arrows falling or bloodloss an animal which was partly consumed by a wild animal or an animal which is sacrificed on a stone altar are forbidden However if faced with starvation exceptions are allowed

Anthony Charles Lyton Blair usually called Tony Blair is a former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom He was born in Edinburgh He was Prime Minister from May 1997 until June 2007 and was succeeded by the former Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown

As leader of the Labour party he won three general elections in the UK in 1997 2001 and 2005 He is married to Cherie Booth They met on the top deck of a double decker bus in 1975 Cherie claimed It was a double decker and we went upstairs It was completely empty and by the time we got off we knew each other better than when wed got on And even better the next morning He was a very good looking young man tall and slim yet broad in the shoulders A really strong body Cherie Blair is a lawyer who graduated from the London School of Economics with a first class honours degree Blair himself left Oxford University with a second class degree They have four children Euan Nicky Kathryn and Leo There was a controversy over Blair sending his eldest son Euan to a grant maintained school As a result of this Alastair Campbell discovered Blair standing stark naked reading the Daily Mail

He attributes his success in politics to a pair of lucky brogues which he wore for every single Prime Ministers Questions of his leadership He claimed that cheap shoes are a false economy

An accident is when something goes wrong when it is not meant to Physical accidents are things like collisions injuries and falling Non physical accidents are things like accidentally telling someone a secret forgetting something important or deleting an important computer file

Often accidents are investigated so that we can learn how to avoid them in the future

An accident at work is defined as an external sudden and violent event Work accidents happen while an employee is working It causes injury or the death of the employee Also there can be a biological accident That is if a woman becomes pregnant and she does not want it

For an accident to be a work accident there must be a direct or indirect relationship of cause and effect between the accident and the work

Many accidents happen in the merchant marine

A bicycle accident happens when a bicycle ride goes wrong A bicycle can fall over because of a loss of balance or crash into something like a car

Acne is an infection of the skin caused by changes in the sebaceous glands The most common form of acne is called acne vulgaris which means common acne The redness comes from the inflammation of the skin in response to the infection

Oils from the glands combine with dead skin cells to block hair follicles Under the blocked pore oil builds up Skin bacteria can then grow very quickly This infection makes the skin become swollen and red which becomes visible

The face chest back and upper arms are most common places for acne to happen

Acne is common during puberty when a person is turning from a child into an adult because of high levels of hormones Acne becomes less common as people reach adulthood

Exactly why some people get acne and some do not is not completely known These can cause acne or make it worse

There are many incorrect ideas about the causes for acne Many people believe these false ideas

Many things are sold to treat acne the most popular being benzoyl peroxide Many of these things have not been scientifically proven to help acne However a mix of commercial and homemade treatments can help with acne for various reasons 

Popping a pimple should not be done by anyone but a qualified dermatologist Pimple popping irritates skin can make the bacteria spread and can cause scars If you must pop a pimple yourself it is advised to apply warm water to the area before popping it and to wash your hand thoroughly before beginning so as to avoid spreading bacteria via the hands Applying warm water will open up the pores and reduce the damage because it will require less force to pop it

Bad acne often leads to bad scars where the skin has the shape of a volcano It is difficult and expensive to treat acne scars

These are some ways acne scars can be treated

Dinosaurs a type of Archosaur reptile were the dominant land animals of the Mesozoic era 

Dinosaurs became the top land vertebrates in the Upper Triassic 230 million years ago By the early Jurassic they dominated most environments on land They continued until the sudden KT extinction event 65 million years ago 

Birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs all the terrestrial dinosaurs are extinct

Dinosaurs are united by at least 21 characters of their skulls and skeletons These common characters are the reason palaeontologists are sure dinosaurs had a common origin

However as soon as dinosaur fossils appear the group has already split into two great orders the Saurischia and the Ornithischia The Saurischia keep the ancestral hip arrangement inherited from their Archosaur ancestors and the Ornithischia have a modified hip sructure

A Eoraptor an early saurischian B Lesothosaurus a primitive ornithischian C A saurischian pelvis D Lesothosaurus pelvis

The Archosaurs evolved into two main clades those related to crocodiles and those related to dinosaurs 

The first known dinosaurs were bipedal predators that were one to two metres long

Spondylosoma from the Middle Triassic may or may not be a dinosaur The skull is not known and the remains are dated at about 230 232 million years ago

The earliest confirmed dinosaur fossils include saurischian dinosaurs Saturnalia 225 232 Ma Herrerasaurus 220 230 Ma Staurikosaurus possibly 225 230 Ma Eoraptor 220 230 Ma and Alwalkeria 220 230 Ma Saturnalia may be a basal saurischian or a prosauropod The others are basal saurischians

Among the earliest ornithischian dinosaurs is Pisanosaurus 220 230 Ma Although Lesothosaurus comes from 195 206 Ma skeletal features suggest that it branched from the main Ornithischia line at least as early as Pisanosaurus

It is clear from this figure that early saurischians resembled early ornithischians but not modern crocodiles Saurischians are distinguished from the ornithischians by retaining the ancestral configuration of bones in the pelvis Another difference is in the skull the upper skull of the Ornithischia is more solid and the joint connecting the lower jaw is more flexible both are adaptations to herbivory and both can already be seen in Lesothosaurus

Dinosaurs were a varied group of animals Paleontologists have identified over 500 different genera and 1000 species of non avian dinosaurs Their descendants the birds number 9000 living species and are the most diverse group of land vertebrates

The largest dinosaurs were plant eaters such as Apatosaurus and Brachiosaurus They were the largest animals to ever walk on dry land Other plant eaters had special weapons to help them fight off the meat eaters For example Triceratops had three horns on its head shield Ankylosaurus was covered in boney plates and Stegosaurus had spikes on its tail 

The carnivores were bipedal though not as we do Their body was more towards the horizontal balanced at the back by their tail Some were very large like Tyrannosaurus and Spinosaurus but some were small like Compsognathus It was the smaller sized meat eaters that may have evolved into birds The first fossil bird Archaeopteryx had a skeleton which looked much like that of a dinosaur

Dinosaurs were primitively bipedal their probable ancestors were small bipedal Archosaurs The date of the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor at 230 million years ago is important Eoraptor probably resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small bipedal predators The discovery of primitive pre dinosaur types in Middle Triassic strata supports this view Analysis of their fossils suggests that the animals were indeed small bipedal predators

Those dinosaurs which returned to four legged stance kept all four legs under their body This is much more efficient than the sprawling legs of a lizard 

The big sauropods could never have reached so large a size without their pillar like legs

A major change in outlook came in the 1960s when it was realised that small theropods were probably warm blooded The question of whether all theropods or even all dinosaurs were warm blooded is still undecided

It is now certain that small theropods had feathers This fits well with the idea that they were warm blooded and that the origin of birds can be traced to a line of small theropods

Warm blooded animals have a high metabolic rate They can be more active and for longer than animals who depend on the environment for heating Therefore the idea of warm blooded dinosaurs insulated by feathers led to the idea that they were more active intelligent and faster runners than previously thought

Main stream palaeontologists have followed this view for small theropods but not for larger herbivores Since we know that the size of a Stegosaurs brain was about the size of a walnut there is good reason to think its intelligence was limited

The extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were caused by one or more catastrophic events such as massive asteroid or meteorite impacts or increased volcanic activity 

Several impact craters and massive volcanic activity such as that in the Deccan Traps in India have been dated to the approximate time of the extinction event These geological events may have reduced sunlight and hindered photosynthesis leading to a massive disruption in Earths ecology

Books about dinosaurs have been popular especially with children but adults have also enjoyed these kinds of books In Edwardian times Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a novel about a plateau filled with dinosaurs which he called The Lost World

Several movies are about dinosaurs such as Jurassic Park

The Stone Age was an ancient time period when people made tools from stone Wood bones and other materials were also used for tools but stone was used to cut things 

The period began with the first stone tools about 27 million years ago Some groups of people were still in the stone age into the 20th century They also killed animals for food and clothing 

The time after the Stone Age is the Bronze Age named after the metal bronze The Stone Age ended when people discovered the art of smelting The first metal was copper followed by bronze People probably began using bronze instead of just stone in the Middle East sometime between 3000 and 2000 BC 

The Stone Age is divided by archaeologists into three sections Paleolithic Mesolithic and Neolithic Pottery was invented during the Neolithic Stone Age Some people also believe the art of writing began in the Neolithic Stone Age

The Palaeolithic is a prehistoric era distinguished by the development of stone tools It covers the greatest portion of humanitys time on Earth from about 27 million years ago to about 20000 years ago It was followed by the Mesolithic and Neolithic cultures

The Nazis created a dictatorship called the Third Reich In 1933 they blocked out all of the other political parties They killed their enemies or put them in concentration camps Hitler and his men also persecuted and killed Jews and other ethnic religious and political minorities In what is called The Holocaust the Nazis killed six million Jews gypsies homosexuals and other groups of people Because of the invasion of Poland the world was lead into World War II which harmed many parts of Europe Because of Hitler at least 50 million people died During World War II Hitler was the Commander in Chief of the whole German forces and made all important decisions This was part of the so called Fhrerprinzip

Hitlers family was originally from Waldviertel in Upper Austria Not many people spoke German there At the time the name Hitler changed in this region several times between Httler Hiedler Hittler and Hitler The name was commonly in the German speaking area of Europe in the 19th century The literature says that this name is descended from the Czech name Hidlar or Hidlarcek

Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 as the fourth child of six in Braunau am Inn This is a small town near Linz in the province of Upper Austria It is close to the German border in what was then Austria Hungary His parents were Klara Plzl and Alois Hitler Because of his fathers job Hitler moved from Braunau to Passau later to Lambach and finally to Leonding He attended several Volksschules Hitlers mother Klara Plzl was the third wife of Alois Hitler and also his cousin Hitlers father died in 1903 Hitler failed high school exams in Linz twice In 1905 he left school without an exam He became interested in the anti Semitic Pan German teachings of Professor Leopold Poetsch In September 1907 he went to Vienna and took an entrance examination On 1 and 2 October he failed the second examination Hitler went back to Linz at the end of October In December 1907 Hitlers mother died and because of that he was depressed

In 1909 Hitler again went to Vienna to study art He attempted to become a student at the Academy of Arts but failed the first entrance examination Hitler said he first became an anti Semite in Vienna This town had a large Jewish community

Hitler was been influenced by Martin Luthers On the Jews and their Lies In Mein Kampf Hitler refers to Martin Luther as a great warrior a true statesman and a great reformer

In 1913 Hitler was 24 years old At that time all young Austrian men had to join the army Hitler did not like the Austrian army so he left Austria for Germany He lived in the German city of Munich

On 16 August 1914 Hitler joined the Bavarian army He fought for Germany in World War I Hitler served in Belgium and France in the 16th Bavarian Reserve Regiment He spent nearly the whole time on the Western Front He was a runner one of the most dangerous jobs on the Front That means he ran from one position to another one to carry messages On 1 November 1914 Hitler became a Gefreiter The government awarded him the Iron Cross Second Class on 2 December 1914 

On 5 October 1916 he was hurt by a bullet shell Between 9 October and 1 December he was in the military hospital Belitz In March 1917 he went back to the front There he was involved in a battle and was awarded with the Militrverdienstkreuz Third Class with swords

In March 1918 Hitler participated in the Spring Offensive On 4 August 1918 Hitler was awarded with the Iron Cross First Class by the Jewish Hugo Gutmann After the capitulation of Germany Hitler was shocked because the German army still held enemy area in November 1918

After World War I Hitler stayed in the army and returned to Munich There he attended the funeral march of the killed Bavarian prime minister Kurt Eisner In 1919 he participated in a training programme for propaganda speakers from 5 to 12 June and 26 June to 5 July Later that year Hitler joined a small political party called the German Workers Party He became member number 555 He soon won the support of the party members Two years later he became the leader of the party He renamed the party the National Socialist German Workers Party It became known as the Nazi Party

In 1923 Hitler got together several hundred other members of the Nazi Party and tried to take over the Weimar Republic government in the Beer Hall Putsch The coup failed The government killed 13 of his men They also put Hitler in the Landsberg Prison They said that he would stay in prison for five years but they let him leave after nine months While he was in prison he wrote a book with the help of his friend Rudolf Hess At first Hitler wanted to call the book Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies Stupidity and Cowardice In the end he called the book Mein Kampf or My Struggle

In 1933 Hitler was elected into the German government He ended freedom of speech and put his enemies in jail or killed them He did not allow any other party except the Nazi party Hitler and his propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels spread extreme nationalism within Germany All media had to praise the Nazis Also more people were born because Hitler wanted more people of the master race He made Germany a totalitarian Nazi state

Hitler started World War II by ordering the German Army to invade Poland His army conquered Poland and most of Europe including France and a large part of the Soviet Union During the war he ordered the Nazis to kill many people including women and children The Nazis killed six million Jews in the Holocaust Other people that the Nazis killed were Roma homosexuals Slavs such as Russians and Poles and his political opponents

Finally the other countries in the world worked together to defeat Germany Hitler lost all of the land that he had taken and millions of Germans were killed At the end of World War II Hitler gave all people in the Fhrerbunker the permission to leave it Many people followed this and moved to the region of Berchtesgaden They used planes and truck convoys Hitler the Goebbels family Martin Bormann Eva Braun and some other staff remained in the bunker Hitler got married to Eva Braun in April 1945 They both committed suicide in Berlin the day after their marriage Eva Braun used poison to kill herself Hitler shot himself in the face Before this Hitler ordered that their bodies be burned This prevented him from being captured alive by soldiers from the Soviet Union who were closing in on Hitler and his government

Publius Vergilius Maro also called Virgil or Vergil by English speaking people was a writer of poems in the Latin language Virgils most famous epic poem is called the Aeneid His poems are about gods and myths

Stories say that Virgil was born in the village of Andes near Mantua in Cisalpine Gaul Scholars looking at the way he used words think that he may have Etruscan Umbrian or even a Celtic background Study of his name has led to beliefs that his family may have been earlier Roman settlers These modern beliefs are not supported by evidence from his own writings or from writers of his biographies Some scholars have noted that his cognomen or nickname MARO is an anagram of the two main themes in the Aeneid AMOR and ROMA

In chemistry alcohol is a general term which refers to many organic compounds used in industry and science as reagents solvents and fuels Alcohols are carbohydrates which are made of an alkyl group with one or more hydroxyl groups bound to its carbon atoms Alcohol is colorless and also transparent 

There are two ways of naming alcohols Common names and IUPAC names 

The hydroxyl group makes alcohols polar Alcohols are very weakly acidic

The simplest two alcohols are methanol and ethanol which have the following structures

In common usage alcohol often means ethanol or grain alcohol

Other commonly used alcohols include

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was an Austrian composer and pianist Many people think he was one of the best composers of music of all time He was born in the city of Salzburg on January 27 1756 During his short life he wrote over 600 pieces of music including the operas Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute His first work was a minuet that he wrote when he was four and his last piece was the Requiem which he left unfinished Mozart could play the piano when very young and he was known as a great piano player as well as a great composer He died close to 1am on December 5 1791 because of rheumatic fever

Mozart was born into a musical family His father Leopold Mozart was a famous violinist and composer who worked for the Archbishop of Salzburg He had one older sister called Maria Anna whose nickname was Nannerl Mozart was baptized on the morning after his birth in the cathedral in Salzburg The Latin form of his name was Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart He was usually known as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his nickname was Wolfi The house where he was born in the street called Getreidegasse is now a Mozart museum

Mozart was a child prodigy From a very early age he showed extraordinary musical talent His father gave up composing in order to teach his son music Wolfgang was learning the keyboard at the age of three and was soon learning the violin and organ as well There are two short piano pieces written when he was five They were written in his fathers handwriting so it is not easy to say how much help he might have had 

Soon his father started to show off his son making him play in concerts in front of lots of important people Nowadays this would be called exploiting the young genius but in those days people saw nothing wrong with letting a child to be used in this way It is amazing that it seemed to do him no harm and that he grew up to become the great composer that he deserved to be

Mozart played in public in Salzburg when he was five Then he was taken to Vienna when he was six He also played in Linz and Pressburg Twice he played in front of the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria At these concerts he played pieces that adults usually played He played at sight improvised and played with a cloth covering the keyboard played blindfolded and with one hand crossing another He also made up accompaniments to tunes that were put in front of him Many people who heard him wrote about this amazing boy and that is how we know a lot of what happened It is also known that he could remember all the notes on a piece of music after looking at it only once

Soon Mozart was travelling to other countries He played in Munich Prague Paris The Hague and London In London he played to King George III and met a composer by the name of Johann Christian Bach one of the sons of Johann Sebastian Bach He liked Johann Christian Bachs music and he played piano duets with him While Mozart was in London the Royal Society studied him to see if was a child prodigy or just a very small person In 1767 he was in Vienna again where he was ill with smallpox but he recovered and his father saw this as a sign from God that his child would do well He went to Italy where he heard music by many famous Italian composers including Gregorio Allegri who had written a piece called Miserere This piece had been written for the Pope for the choir of the Vatican to sing No one was allowed to see the written music so that no other choir would be able to sing it Mozart heard the piece once and then wrote it all down from memory He met the Pope and was given a knighthood

In 1777 he went on a journey with his mother In Mannheim he fell in love with a girl called Aloysia Weber She was 16 years old and studying singing Mozart wanted to take her to Italy to make her famous but his father wrote him back very stern letters telling him to stop thinking about such nonsense By 1778 Mozart and his mother were in Paris but there his mother died

Mozart wrote some small operas when he was young but his first really important opera was Idomeneo It was first performed in Munich in 1780 The next year he went to Vienna By this time he was working like his father for the Archbishop of Salzburg When he went back to Salzburg he argued with the Archbishop who actually kicked him out Mozart went off to Vienna where he would spend the rest of his life

In 1782 he married Constanze Weber one of the three younger sisters of Aloysia They were to have seven children but five of them died in childhood Mozarts father did not approve of the marriage Constanze was a loving wife but like Mozart she was not good at looking after money so they were often very poor

In that same year 1782 Mozart wrote another very successful opera Die Entfhrung aus dem Serail One famous story tells that after the emperor had heard the opera he told Mozart that there were too many notes Mozart answered Just as many as are necessary Your Majesty

Mozart started a series of concerts in which he played his own piano concertos conducting from the keyboard He met the composer Joseph Haydn and the two men became great friends often playing together in a string quartet Haydn said to Leopold Mozart one day Before God and as an honest man I tell you that your son is the greatest composer known to me either in person or by name He has taste and what is more the most profound knowledge of composition Mozart was in the same Masonic Lodge as Haydn and he dedicated some of his string quartets to him



The audiences in Vienna did not give Mozart much support after a few years so he often went to Prague where the audiences loved him His opera The Marriage of Figaro was very popular and in 1787 he gave the first performance there of his opera Don Giovanni

There are several stories about Mozarts last illness and death and it is not easy to be sure what happened He was working on an opera The Magic Flute which is one of his best works and a very popular opera today It is written in German not Italian like most of his other operas In some ways it is like an English pantomime At the same time that he was working on this he was asked by a stranger to compose a requiem He was told to write this in secret Then he was asked to write an Italian opera La Clemenza di Tito which was performed in Prague during September 1791 At the end of September The Magic Flute was given its first performance Mozart then worked very hard at the Requiem He must have realized that he was already very ill and that in a way the requiem was for himself He died before he could finish it Constanze asked another composer a man called Franz Xaver Sssmayr to finish the work Today we are not sure which bits Sssmayr added but probably most of the music is Mozarts own work

Mozart was buried in an unmarked grave because there was no money for a proper funeral

Mozarts music like that of Haydn is the very best of what is known as the Classical style At the time he started to compose the Baroque period was just coming to an end Tastes were changing in music Form balance and elegance were thought of as more important than counterpoint Mozart was the first great composer to write music for the piano an instrument which had only just become popular He wrote almost every kind of music symphonies operas solo concertos chamber music especially string quartets and string quintets and the piano sonata He also wrote a lot of religious music including masses as well as popular music like dances divertimenti and serenades

When Mozart was young a symphony was usually a short simple piece for entertainment Mozart made the symphony into a carefully worked out piece lasting up to half an hour His last three symphonies are especially fine masterpieces His concertos especially his piano concertos are far more advanced than anything that had been written before Although Mozart behaved in truly childish ways at times he was good at understanding human character This is clear in his operas where he introduced many subtle effects to describe the characters in the story

Mozarts operas are among his greatest works He understood peoples characters very well and was able to write music which tells us everything about the personalities in the operas The three operas in which he set words by Metastasio Don Giovanni Le Nozze di Figaro and Cosi fan tutte each include some very clever ensembles in which several characters are singing at once each one showing his or her view of the situation

As well as many great masterpieces Mozart wrote many pieces in a more popular style including some tunes that everybody knows today His serenade Eine kleine Nachtmusik is known everywhere as is the Turkish Rondo from his Piano Sonata in A the opening of the Symphony no 40 in G minor K550 and the birdcatchers song from The Magic Flute

Some time after Mozarts death a man called Kchel studied all Mozarts music tried to put them in chronological order and gave them a number The number helps us to know exactly which work is meant for example Symphony in G minor K183 is not the same piece as Symphony in G minor K550 The highest Kchel number is 626 his requiem mass

Johann Sebastian Bach was a German composer and organist He lived in the last part of the Baroque period He never traveled very far spending all his life in central Germany but he studied all the music he could find by other composers of his time His own music shows that he learned from the music of Italian French and German composers He spent several years working at courts of noblemen Here he wrote most of his chamber music and orchestral music Most of his life however he worked in a church where he was expected to write church music Bach wrote almost every kind of music except opera During the last part of his life most composers were writing in a new style called the Classical style but Bach always wrote in the Baroque style That made some people at the time think he was old fashioned but today we know that his work is the very best of Baroque music

Bach came from a highly musical family Many of his relatives were professional musicians of some sort violinists and town musicians organists Cantors court musicians and Kapellmeisters Most of them played several instruments Of his twenty children several became quite famous composers especially Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach Johann Christian Bach Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach and Wilhelm Friedemann Bach

We hardly know anything about Johann Sebastians childhood He must have sung in the church choir at Eisenach where he was born He may have learned to play harpsichord and violin from his father When he was ten years old his mother and father both died within eight months of one another He went to live with his brother Johann Christoph Bach in a small town called Ohrdruf nearby Johann Christoph was an excellent teacher and taught the young boy a lot in music In Ohrdruf he visited the Lyzeum There was a good school there and he studied religion reading writing arithmetic singing history and science 

When he was fifteen he went to the large town of Lneburg At first he sang treble in the choir but his voice very soon got lower so he made himself useful playing instruments He learned by listening to famous organists like Reincken and Dietrich Buxtehude Bach got his first job in 1703 in Arnstadt It was a well paid job for a young boy who was 18 years old There was a new organ in the church and Bach already knew a lot about organ building as well as being a brilliant organist They asked him to examine the new organ and then offered him a job Bach spent four years as organist there He composed some organ works Unfortunately the congregation were not musical enough to like it They did not understand the ornamental notes he added to the hymn tunes Bach got rather fed up with the priests who were always complaining about it and so he resigned and took another job in Mhlhausen not far away After a year there he gave up that job and went to a big town called Weimar

Johann Sebastian was made organist to the Duke of Saxeweimar At the Dukes court there was a chapel with an organ Bach composed many of his great organ works at this time He became very famous as an organist as was invited to play in other big churches and to give advice on organ building He was extremely good at improvisation On one occasion he was in Dresden at the same time as a French organist named Louis Marchant There was going to be a competition between the two men to see who was better at improvisation Bach was practicing the day before and Marchant heard him He realized that Bach would win so he ran away

In 1714 the Duke made Bach Konzertmeister He had to write cantatas for church services In 1717 he was offered a job in the town of Cthen where he would earn an even better salary The Duke was angry and did not want him to go but Bach insisted so the Duke put Bach in prison for a month In the end he had to let the musician go

At Cthen Bach worked for Prince Leopold The Prince was very musical and a nice man to work for Bach was Kapellmeister and was treated well The organ was not very good and it was not used much so Bach did not write any organ music during this period The Duke had an orchestra and Bach was in charge Nearly all Bachs orchestral works were written in Cthen the Brandenburg Concertos the violin concertos the orchestral suites the solo music for violin and for cello and a lot of keyboard music for harpsichord or clavichord

During 1719 the great composer George Frideric Handel who had moved to England came to Germany to visit his mother Bach wanted to meet Handel who was only 30 km away but these two famous musicians never met Handel wanted to spend his limited time in Germany with his mother who was old and frail knowing that it would be the last time he would see her

Bachs first wife Maria Barbara Bach died in 1720 The couple had seven children Soon afterwards he married Anna Magdalena with whom he had another thirteen children However several of his children died young

In 1723 Bach moved to Leipzig to take the job of Cantor at the St Thomas Church a very large church in the town As Cantor he was in charge of all the music both at St Thomas and at another church nearby He also had to compose music for the town It was an excellent job and more secure than being at a court The schools were good for his sons Bach stayed in Leipzig until his death He loved his job most of the time and worked very hard He composed many cantatas for the church services These services were very long lasting about three hours Many of the cantatas he wrote last about 30 minutes and that was just one part of a service He had assistants to play the organ Bach himself directed the choir and the orchestra There were probably 16 singers in the choir and 18 players in the orchestra He wrote the St Matthew Passion and the St John Passion Both these works which are very long tell the story of Jesus dying on the cross They are among the most famous pieces of music ever written He also wrote cantatas for special occasions such as weddings or funerals

Life was not always easy and there were sometimes arguments with the people who ruled the church The sub deacon wanted to choose some of the hymns but this was the Cantors job Bach was a sensible man and he managed to get his way without making enemies On another occasion he argued with the headmaster of the school about who was allowed to choose the choir section leaders This actually went to court and Bach won the case

Bach often made journeys to other towns In 1747 he visited the court of Prussian King Frederick the Great near Berlin The king a music lover gave Bach a tune to play on the harpsichord Bach sat down and improvised a piece using this theme The king was very impressed Later Bach wrote a very long composition for flute violin and harpsichord with cello accompaniment in many movements all based on this theme At the end the tune is heard in six voices all together Bach called it The Musical Offering and he sent it to king who was very much pleased In the picture at the top of this article Bach is holding the music of the 6 part movement

Bach loved writing fugues and he decided to write a collection called The Art of Fugue He wanted to publish it and he was making some changes but he died before he could finish it In the last year or two of his life he became blind in spite of two eye operations

Earths atmosphere is the layer of gases around the planet Earth The atmosphere is held in place by Earths gravity It is made up of nitrogen and oxygen with small amounts of argon carbon dioxide water vapor and other gases The atmosphere protects life on Earth by absorbing ultraviolet radiation from the sun and balancing the temperature on earth between day and night

Solid particulates including ash dust volcanic ash etc are small part of atmosphere They are important for the formation of clouds and fog

The atmosphere does not end at a specific place It just gets thinner when you go higher There is no clear line between the atmosphere and outer space 75 of the atmosphere is within 11 km of the Earths surface 

Some parts of the atmosphere are hot or cold depending on height If you were to climb straight up it would get colder then it would get hotter as you got higher These changes of temperature are divided into layers These are like layers of an onion But you can not see any difference going from one layer to another layer You can only feel the change in temperature start getting hotter in the new layer or start getting colder

These are the layers of the atmosphere starting from the ground

Where one layer changes to the next have been named pauses So the tropopause is where the troposphere ends The stratopause is at the end of the stratosphere The mesopause is at the end of the mesosphere These are called boundaries

The average temperature of the atmosphere at the surface of earth is 14 C

The atmosphere has pressure This is because even though air is a gas it has weight The average pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is about 1014 kilopascals

The density of air at sea level is about 12 kilograms per cubic meter This density becomes less at higher altitudes at the same rate that pressure becomes less The total mass of the atmosphere is about 51 1018 kg which is only a very small part of the Earths total mass

The penis is a male sex organ found on the outside of the body It is used for getting rid of urine from the bladder and for sexual reproduction The main sexual function of the penis is to be inserted into a womans vagina and deliver semen to cause pregnancy This activity is called sexual intercourse

The human penis is made up of three types of tissue It has two corpora cavernosa next to each other and a corpus spongiosum between them

The end of the corpus spongiosum forms the GARETH PARKER underneath the foreskin or exposed The area on the bottom of the penis where the foreskin is attached is known as the frenulum

The urethra the tube where urine and semen travel through runs down the corpus spongiosum and opens at the tip of the penis Sperm are made in the testes and stored in the epididymis around the testes During ejaculation sperm are pushed up the vas deferens Fluids are added by the seminal vesicles the prostate gland and the bulbourethral glands to make semen

A penis can become erect if a man is sexually aroused In an erection the penis fills with blood The blood makes the penis become longer thicker and harder Veins taking blood away from the penis get smaller so less blood is taken through Arteries bringing blood to the penis get wider bringing more blood to the penis

Ejaculation is when semen is pushed from the penis It usually happens during an orgasm Muscles push semen from the penis and into the vagina during intercourse It may also occur during masturbation and other forms of sexual stimulation During orgasm semen moves through the urethra and comes out of the hole at the tip of the penis Ejaculation may happen during sleep

Men can ejaculate during sexual intercourse or by masturbation In masturbation men can excite their own penis and other sensitive areas of their body such as the scrotum by rubbing the genital area A man must have started puberty before he can ejaculate

The length and thickness of the penis is different for different men The size of a soft penis is much smaller than when it is erect Some penises grow more when they get hard than other penises In most cases whether a penis is big or small it can still be used for sex It averages out to be around 3 to 6 inches long when not erect The average size of an erect human penis is between 13 16 cm The average circumference of a penis is 123 cm when fully erect

The foreskin is a fold of skin that covers the end of the penis Cutting off the foreskin is called circumcision The foreskin is connected to the head of the penis During circumcision the foreskin is removed from the penis Circumcision is usually performed on infant males for religious or cultural reasons

Some men have the foreskin cut off when they are adults because they have problems with their foreskin Some men have the foreskin cut off because they want to change how their penis looks 

In some religions babies and young boys have their foreskin cut off This is expected in Islam and Judaism It is not required according to Christianity but it is allowed and is quite common among some Christians In Judaism baby boys are required to have their foreskin removed as a sign of the covenant made with God

The Sahara in North Africa is the one of the largest deserts in the world Antarctica is also a desert and is larger 

It is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean the Atlas Mountains the Mediterranean Sea the Red Sea and the Sahel region Inside it are parts of many countries including Morocco Algeria Tunisia Libya Egypt Mauritania Mali Niger Chad and The Sudan Most parts are uninhabited but some people manage to survive in places where there is water

The Sahara Desert is about 9065000 square kilometers in size It has been both larger and smaller at different times Ater the last ice age it became more fertile then dried up again It is the hottest place on the Earth but not the driest The driest is the Atacama Desert in South America The Sahara has about the same size as the whole United States

The highest mountain is 3415 m and is the Emi Koussi in Chad Some mountain peaks in the Sahara Desert have snow even in the summer The main mountain ranges is the Atlas Mountains in Algeria The Saharas lowest point lies in the Qattara Depression in Egypt at about 130 metres below sea level Sand sheets and dunes are about 25 of the Sahara All the other parts are mountains steppes with a lot of stones and oasises

There are several rivers running through the Sahara However most of them come and go through the seasons except for the Nile River and Niger River

Metallic minerals are very important to most Saharan countries Algeria and Mauritania have several major deposits of iron ore There are also bits of uranium while Niger has the largest parts of them A lot of phosphates are in Morocco and Western Sahara Oil is mainly found in Algeria The oil is very important to the economy of the entire country While the mineral exploitation has led to economic growth in Sahara this has rarely helped the indigenous population as skilled workers have been brought from other countries

Of the Saharas around 4 million people most live in Mauritania Western Sahara Algeria Libya and Egypt Dominant groups of people are Sahrawis and Tuareg The largest city is Nouakchott Mauritanias capital Other important cities are Tamanrasset in Algeria and Sebha and Ghat in Libya Only 200000 km of Sahara are fertile oases where dates corn and fruits are grown The few fertile regions today are fed by underground rivers and underground basins Many of Saharas oases rests in depressions allowing water to surface from underground reservoirs artesian wells

The soil in Sahara is low in organic matter The soil in depressions is often saline Animal life is limited to gazelles antelopes jackals foxes badgers and hyena Other sorts of vegetation include scattered concentrations of grasses shrubs and trees in the highlands as well as in the oases and along river beds Some plants are well adjusted to the climate allowing them to germinate within 3 days of rain and sow their seeds within 2 weeks after that Animal life of Sahara include gerbil jerboa cape hare and desert hedgehog barbary sheep oryx gazelle deer wild ass baboon hyena jackal sand fox weasel and mongoose The bird life counts more than 300 species

Paris is the capital city of France and the largest city there Its area is 105 square km and around 215 million people live there If suburbs are counted the population of the Paris area rises to 12 million people

The Seine river runs through the oldest part of Paris and divides it into two parts known as the Left Bank and the Right Bank It is surrounded by many forests

Paris is also the centre of French economy politics traffic and culture Paris has many art museums and historical buildings As a traffic centre Paris has a very good underground subway system airports and stations The Metro was built in 1900 and its total length is more than 200 km

The city has a multi cultural style because 20 of the people there are from outside France There are many different restaurants with all kinds of food

Julius Caesar conquered the Celtic Parisii tribe in 52 BC The Romans called the place Lutetia or Lutetia Parisiorum The place got a shorter name Paris in 212 AD

As the Roman Empire began to fall apart in the West the Germanic tribe called the Franks moved in taking it in 464 In 506 their king Clovis I made it his capital Charlemagne moved his capital to Aachen in Germany but Paris continued as an important town and was attacked by the Vikings twice When Hugh Capet became king of France in 987 he again made Paris his capital For a long time the kings only controlled Paris and the surrounding area as much of the rest of France was in the hands of barons or English During the Hundred Years War the English even controlled Paris from 1420 to 1437 

During the Protestant Reformation a huge massacre of French Protestants started there in 1572 called the Saint Bartholemews Day Massacre Paris saw many other troubles over the years of the Ancien Regime then in 1789 the French Revolution began in Paris leading to more massacres 

Paris was the Capital of the French Empire which as well as France covered Spain Belgium Holland Luxembourg Switzerland Italy most of Germany and some of Austria Croatia Slovenia and Poland The Empire ruled by Napoleon was from 1804 18141815 The Russian army seized Paris from Napoleon in 1814 and the Prussian army captured it in 1871 The next time it was captured was by the Nazi Germans in 1940 The Allies freed the city in 1944 and it has not since been captured

Paris has much to offer for sightseeing Here are five very famous examples

Because the city of Paris is roughly only 6 miles across visitors have a wide range of options when it comes to transportation While much of the more well known attractions are located in the center of the city and are best experienced by walking there are many destinations that require other means of transport While taxis offer a fast and relatively inexpensive means of travel Paris public transportation system offers an enjoyable stress free way to explore the city

The Paris Mtro system was built in 1900 by engineer Fulgence Bienvene and architect Hector Guimard The Mtro covers over 124 miles with 300 stations and 16 lines Servicing over 6 million residents and tourists every day the Mtro was designed to be an efficient and reliable alternative to the congestion of traffic Every building in Paris is less than 500 meters from a train station so accessibility is never a problem The 16 Mtro lines are identified by their final destinations A rider can simply select the appropriate line and take it in the direction she wants The Mtro stations are well marked and there are ticket booths at most entrances

The Holocaust sometimes called The Shoah was when Nazi Germany killed people in a planned and forced way during World War II Six million Jews were killed as well as millions of others that the Nazis said were bad Many were rounded up put in ghettos forced to work in concentration camps and then killed in big gas chambers

The numbers below are not known entirely because many of those killed were never written down The numbers given below are those most thinkers agree on 

Led by Adolf Hitler the Nazis led an unprecedented mass slaying of millions of Jews Jews were forced to wear the golden Star of David on any highly noticeable part of their upper body Jews were rounded up by the thousands and crammed into trains that took them to concentration camps as well as death camps Most of the Jews killed in the Holocaust were not German they were from Poland or the Soviet Union

Millions of Jews were murdered by the usage of gas chambers and ovens where Jews were burned alive Others were sent to dig giant holes in the ground where after days of hard work they were shot buried and burned in a mass grave Others were shot beaten or stabbed to death Still others were trampled by other Jews in merciless marches from one camp to another

Two million other civilians were killed with machine guns torture or were beaten until they died Many Soviet prisoners of war and civilians were killed

On the other hand there were people who saved Jews from The Holocaust out of conscience and with courage against oppression They were later awarded Righteous Among the Nations

Some people say the Holocaust did not happen at all or they say that it is described wrongly This is known as Holocaust denial However almost all historians agree that there is a lot of evidence the Holocaust happened and is described correctly In some countries in Europe it is against the law to say that the Holocaust never happened

Kyoto is a city in Japan This city was the capital of Japan from 794 until 1868 

Kyoto is a major city of the Kansai area of Japan Its population is 15 million people The city of Kyoto is the capital city of the prefecture of Kyoto Kyoto is one of the cultural educational and technology centers of Japan In it are many universities including Kyoto University the second oldest national university of Japan 

After 694 the Japanese Emperors lived in this city which was called Heian ky

In 1868 the city was called Saiky in order to distinguish it from Edo which was the Eastern capital 

There are mountains around the city on the east north and west sides Some people in Kyoto believe that these mountains make Kyotos summer especially hot and humid and Kyotos winter very cold 

We can see many temples and shrines built in traditional Japanese architectural styles here Some of those buildings are registered as World Heritage sites of UNESCO On the other hand since Kyoto was one of biggest and wealthiest Japanese cities in the middle of the 19th century the citizens were eager to import European style and there are many European style buildings in the center of Kyoto for company offices and schools

Kyoto is one of oldest cities in Japan Many tourists from all over the world come to Kyoto Japanese people often come to Kyoto in the spring to see the cherry blossoms and in the autumn to see the leaves change color 

Traditional Kyoto food often uses vegetables McDonalds signbords in Kyoto are brown to preserve the traditional surroundings

The oldest novel in the world Shikibu Murasakis The Tale of Genji is set in Heian Era Kyoto

Kyoto is famous for three great festivals Gion festival Aoi festival in the summer and Jidai festival in the autumn 

Anarchy also used as Anarchasea It is a word that has more than one use Some of its uses are

In the first use an anarchy might be a made up or real society based on a groups beliefs about anarchism

In the second use anarchy has to do with having no political order The CIA World factbook says that there is only one nation Somalia that is in a state of anarchy In Somalia the government is no longer in control and some parts of the country are ruled by mobs and warlords who sometimes fight one another

There are a small number of other places where government is emerging or transitional and were in anomie in the near past The DC says that the Solomon Islands is tending towards anomie because violence corruption and crime have undermined stability and civil society

When there is no political order more than one government or political authority might sometimes compete for the same food oil land or groups of people The word Anarchy to used to describe this However because there is more than one competing authority a better word might be polyarchy The difference between anarchy and polyarchy is important to someone who thinks that true anarchy would work well The word for someone who thinks this is anarchist and the word for this kind of thinking is anarchism Anarchism has been thought about for hundreds of years

The word anarchy comes from the Greek word which means without a leader

While the popular understanding of anarchism is of a violent anti State movement anarchism is a much more subtle and nuanced tradition then a simple opposition to government power Anarchists oppose the idea that power and domination are necessary for society and instead advocate more co operative anti hierarchical forms of social political and economic organisation The Politics of Individualism p 106

DNA short for deoxyribonucleic acid is the molecule that contains the genetic code of organisms This includes animals plants protists archaea and bacteria 

DNA is in each cell in the organism and tells cells what proteins to make A cells proteins determine its function DNA is inherited by children from their parents This is why children share traits with their parents such as skin hair and eye color The DNA in a person is a combination of the DNA from each of their parents

Viruses use either DNA or RNA to infect organisms The genome replication of most DNA viruses takes place in the cells nucleus whereas RNA viruses usually replicate in the cytoplasm

DNA has a double helix shape which is like a ladder twisted into a spiral Each step of the ladder is a pair of nucleotides 

A nucleotide is a molecule made up of

DNA is made of four types of nucleotide

The rungs of the DNA ladder are each made of two bases one base coming from each leg The bases connect in the middle A pairs with T and C pairs with G The bases are held together by hydrogen bonds 

Adenine and thymine can pair up because they make two hydrogen bonds and cytosine and guanine pair up to make three hydrogen bonds Although the bases are always in fixed pairs the pairs can come in any order This way DNA can write codes out of the letters that are the bases These codes contain the message that tells the cell what to do

On chromosomes the DNA is bound up with proteins called histones to form chromatin This association takes part in epigenetics and gene regulation Genes are switched on and off during development and cell activity and this regulation is the basis of most of the activity which takes place in cells

When DNA is copied this is called DNA replication Briefly the hydrogen bonds holding together paired bases are broken and the molecule is split in half the legs of the ladder are separated This gives two single strands New strands are formed by matching the bases to make the missing strands 

First an enzyme called DNA helicase splits the DNA down the middle by breaking the hydrogen bonds Then after the DNA molecule is in two separate pieces another molecule called DNA polymerase makes a new strand that matches each of the strands of the split DNA molecule Each copy of a DNA molecule is made of half of the original molecule and half of new bases

When DNA is copied mistakes are sometimes made these are called mutations There are three main types of mutations

Mutations may also be classified by their effect on the structure and function of proteins or their effect on fitness Mutations may be bad for the organism or neutral or of benefit Sometimes mutations are fatal for the organism the protein made by the new DNA does not work at all and this causes the embryo to die On the other hand evolution is moved forward by mutations when the new version of the protein works better for the organism

DNA is what tells the cell how to make particular proteins Proteins form structures and also form enzymes The enzymes do most of the work in cells Proteins are made out of smaller polypeptides which are formed of amino acids To make a protein to do a particular job the correct amino acids have to be joined up in the correct order A piece of DNA that contains instructions to make a protein is called a gene

Proteins are made by machines in the cell called ribosomes Ribosomes read codons words made of three base pairs that tell the ribosome which amino acid to add Ribosomes are in the main body of the cell but DNA is only in the nucleus of the cell The codon is part of the DNA but DNA never leaves the nucleus Because DNA cannot leave the nucleus the cell makes a copy of the DNA sequence in a similar single strand molecule called RNAThis is smaller and can get through the holes pores in the membrane of the nucleus and out into the cell 

This one stranded copy of DNA is called mRNA for messenger RNA The ribosome scans along an mRNA reading the code while it makes protein Another RNA called tRNA helps match the right amino acid to each codon

DNA was first isolated extracted from cells by Swiss physician Friedrich Miescher in 1869 when he was working on bacteria from the pus in surgical bandages The molecule was found in the nucleus of the cells and so he called it nuclein 

In 1919 this discovery was followed by the discovery by Phoebus Levene of the base sugar and phosphate nucleotide unit In the 1950s Erwin Chargaff found that the amount of thymine present in a molecule of DNA was roughly equal to the amount of adenine present He found that the same applies to guanine and cytosine 

A few years after Chargaffs discovery a British scientist named Rosalind Franklin studied crystals of DNA and how they diffract beams of X rays She found that an X pattern was produced showing that the crystal was probably helix shaped Francis Crick and James Watson were also working on the structure of DNA and with Franklins results and models of the bases they worked out the shape of the molecule How Watson and Crick got Franklins results has been much debated Crick Watson and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1962 for their work on DNA Rosalind Franklin had died in 1958

Karl Heinrich Marx was a German political thinker who wrote about money and power Marx thought that if a place that works together runs on wage labor then there would always be class struggle Marx thought that this class struggle would result in workers taking power His most famous book was the Communist Manifesto He wrote it with Friedrich Engels in 1848 The book sets out the ideas and aims of communism His ideas are called Marxism

His most important work is Das Kapital or Capital He spent many years working on the three parts of the book Das Kapital describes how capitalism works and the problems this creates The book has led to many arguments between those who agree with the book and those who do not Marxs ideas have been thought of as responsible for socialist revolutions

Marxs most popular theory was his Materialism He believed that religion morality social structures and other things are all rooted in economics 

Karl Marx was born in Trier in 1818 but he had to move many times because the government did not like his ideas Marx lived for a long time in London He died there in 1883 After he died his friend Engels finished many of his works

Marx also wrote the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 in his early days

Many people continue to follow and develop Marxs ideas

Bread is a type of baked food It is mainly made from flour and water Usually salt and yeast are added Bread is often baked in an oven

Bread is also used in sandwiches as the outside as the base of a pizza or put into a toaster to make toast There are many different kinds of bread These can be divided into two types

The color and taste of the bread depend on the kind of flour used and the style of baking Flour made from the whole grain gives darker bread Flour made just from the polished wheat grain gives a very white bread Rye and barley flour give darker types of bread The type of flour also changes how long the bread can be kept before going bad Some strains of wheat are resistant to fungus but may not produce a bread as tasty as a weaker strain

Christianity and Judaism have rules about the use of bread in their religions Unleavened bread is eaten by Jews during the Passover and Catholic celebration of the Eucharist uses unleavened wafers

Orthodox churches forbid the use of unleavened bread for the Eucharist and permit leavened bread only as a symbol of the New This was one of the three points of contention that brought about the schism between Eastern and Western churches in 1054

Bread is an important part of life in many countries because so many people eat it In many cultures bread is so important that it is part of their religious rituals 

Cake is made in a similar way to bread but sugar fat and milk are added to the dough and often more ingredients

Shinto or Shintoism is the native religion of Japan They believe there are many Kami translated as gods or nature spirits Some kami are just spirits of certain places and some are the overall kami The word Shinto comes from the Japanese words shin  the word for god and t  the word for the way or path So Shinto means the way of the gods 

State Shinto was the main religion of Japan before World War II Many Shinto customs are not done in Japan today and some are still done every day but they are not meant to be religious actions

A volcano is a mountain where lava comes from a magma chamber under the ground 

Most volcanoes have a crater at the top When they are active materials pour out of it This includes lava steam gaseous compounds of sulphur ash and broken rock pieces 

Volcanoes erupt when magma and pressure come together and the pressure blows off the top of the solid rock and the magma pours out

Volcanoes are also found on planets other than Earth like the Olympus Mons on Mars

The lava and pyroclastic material that comes out from volcanoes can make many different kinds of land shapes There are three basic kinds of volcanoes 

Shield volcanoes are built out of layers of lava from continual eruptions Because the lava is so fluid it spreads out often over a wide area Shield volcanoes do not grow to a great height and the layers of lava spread out to give the volcano gently sloping sides Shield volcanoes can produce huge areas of basalt which is usually what lava is when cooled

Even though their sides are not very steep shield volcanoes can be huge Mauna Kea in Hawaii is the biggest mountain on Earth If it is measured from its base on the floor of the sea Mauna Kea is even taller than Mount Everest the tallest mountain on land

Cinder cone volcanoes are small volcanic cones that are made by pyroclastic material after fairly explosive eruptions The pyroclastic material makes rather steeper slopes and a narrower base than shield volcanoes Cinder cone volcanoes usually erupt for only a short time and often are gathered together usually on the sides of shield and composite volcanoes They erode quickly because the pyroclastic particles are not stuck together firmly by lava

Composite volcanoes sometimes called stratovolcanoes are one of the most well known types of volcanoes They are made by explosive eruptions of pyroclastic material after which lava quietly pours out Both types of eruptions make layers both of pyroclastic material and lava Composite volcanoes like Japans Mount Fuji have big bases and steep sides that get steeper and steeper as it goes near the top

There are two main processes

Volcanoes are made when two tectonic plates come together When these two plates meet one of them goes under the continental plate Afterwards it melts and makes magma and the pressure builds up until the magma bursts through the Earths crust

The second way is when a tectonic plate moves over a hot spot in the Earths crust The hot spot works its way through the crust until it breaks through The caldera of Yellowstone Park was formed in that way so were the Hawaiian Islands

The Big Bang is the name of a scientific theory that explains how the Universe started and then made the groups of stars we see today

In the Big Bang theory the universe begins as very hot small and dense with no stars atoms form or structure Then about 14 billion years ago the space in the universe expanded very very quickly and later atoms formed and then the stars and their galaxies The universe is still expanding today and getting bigger but colder

As a whole space is growing and the temperature is falling as time passes Cosmology is the name given to how the universe began and how it has developed Scientists that study cosmology agree the Big Bang theory matches what they have seen so far

Fred Hoyle called the theory the Big Bang on his radio show He did not believe the Big Bang was correct Scientists who did not agree with him thought the name was funny and used it Since then Fred Hoyles reasons for not liking the theory have been shown to be wrong

Scientists base the Big Bang theory on many different observations The most important is the redshift of very far away galaxies Redshift is when the light from an object moving away from the earth looks like it has lost energy Objects moving towards the earth look like their light has gained energy This is because of the Doppler effect The more redshift there is the faster the object is moving away By measuring the redshift we can work out how fast the object is moving Since everything is moving away from everything else at a carefully measured rate scientists calculate that everything was in the same place 137 billion years ago Because most things become colder when they become bigger the universe must have been very hot when it started

Other observations that support the Big Bang theory are the amounts of chemical elements in the universe Amounts of hydrogen helium and lithium seem to agree with the theory of the Big Bang Scientists also have found cosmic microwave background radiation This radiation is radio waves that are everywhere in the universe It is now very weak and cold but a long time ago it was very strong and very hot

The Big Bang might also have been the beginning of time If the Big Bang was the beginning of time then there was no universe before the Big Bang Other ideas that also have a Big Bang do not have a beginning of time at 137 billion years ago Instead these theories say that the beginning of the universe as we currently know it began at that time Before then the universe may have been very different

Google Mail also known as Gmail is a free e mail service that is run by Google It can be accessed on the web by POP3 or by IMAP Some of the competitors to Gmail are Yahoo Mail HotmailWindows Live Mail and InboxCom The space given to any GMail member is increased a small amount every second and as of December 11 2010 Google provides each account with about 7528 MB of space

Google Apps is a service from Google that was created in February 2006 as Gmail for your domain It is to allow system administrators of a company or organisation to create email accounts for their own domain

In the United Kingdom the trademark Gmail was owned by another company before Gmail by Google was started Thus the United Kingdom uses a domain of googlemailcom for their users and the logo has the words of Google Mail instead of the normal Gmail

In September 2009 Google began to change the branding of UK accounts back to Gmail following the resolution of the trademark dispute

An astronomer is a person who studies astronomy Most astronomers work in observatories with telescopes to collect information from stars planets or galaxies An astronomer has to analyse information she has collected and to use it to help us understand how the universe behaves

An analysis is a process of study or research To do it is to split a complex idea into pieces to see how it is made up It is the opposite of synthesis which is to bring ideas together

Foolish means silly or not wise A fool is a person who is stupid or easily tricked Other words with the same meaning are absurd crazy and nonsensical

A fools errand is a useless piece of work

A fools paradise a happy state for which there is no good reason

The wise fool is a common literary character a person who appears at first to be unintelligent but then reveals him or herself to possess a grest deal of wisdom An example of this is Sancho Panza in Cervantes Don Quixote Sancho is an uneducated peasant who at first seems to have little sense or experience However as the tale unfolds he reveals himself to possess a wealth of common sense first expressed through endless proverbs but then through his own skill In this sense he provides a comic juxtaposition to Quixote himself who is highly educated but insane both of them supply what the other lacks

Aristotle was a Greek philosopher He was one of the most important philosophers in the history of Western civilization It is said that Aristotle wrote many books but only a much smaller number survive Aristotle was the boyhood tutor of Alexander the Great who later sent him plants and animals from parts of his new empire

Aristotles father Nicomachus was the doctor of King Amyntas of Macedonia From his eighteenth to his thirty seventh year Aristotle lived in Athens as a metic and student of Plato

At about the age of eighteen he went to Athens to continue his education at Platos Academy Aristotle remained at the academy for nearly twenty years not leaving until after Platos death in 347 BC He then traveled with Xenocrates to Asia Minor While in Asia Aristotle traveled with Theophrastus to the island of Lesbos where they researched the botany and zoology of the island Soon after Hermias death Aristotle was invited by Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor to his son Alexander the Great in 343 BC

Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of Macedon During that time he gave lessons not only to Alexander but also to two other future kings Ptolemy and Cassander Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest and his attitude towards Persia was ethnocentric In one famous example he advises Alexander to be a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plantsp58

By 335 BC he had returned to Athens establishing his own school there known as the Lyceum Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years It is during this period in Athens from 335 to 323 when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works Aristotle wrote many dialogues only fragments of which survived The works that have survived are in fairly rough form They are generally thought to be lecture notes for his students 

Aristotles combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge It has been suggested that Aristotle was probably the last person to know everything there was to be known in his own time

Near the end of Alexanders life he began to suspect plots and threatened Aristotle in letters Aristotle had made no secret of his contempt for Alexanders pretense of divinity and the king had executed Aristotles grandnephew Callisthenes as a traitor Alexander died in Babylon in 323 without ever having returned to his native land Upon Alexanders death anti Macedonian sentiment in Athens once again flared up and Aristotle fled the city However he died in Euboea of natural causes within the year 322 BC

The three greatest ancient Greek philosophers were Aristotle Plato and Socrates Socrates taught Plato then Plato taught Aristotle These three thinkers turned early Greek philosophy into the beginnings of Western philosophy as it is today Aristotle taught Alexander the Great who later conquered the entire Middle East

Platos main ideas were that knowledge from the senses was always confused and not pure True knowledge can be gotten from the thinking soul that turns away from the world Only the soul can have knowledge of Forms the real way things are The world is only a copy of these Forms and is not perfect

Aristotle thought differently He thought that knowledge from the senses was more important These thoughts became some of the roots of the scientific method after hundreds of years Most of the things Aristotle wrote that we still have today are notes from his speaking and teaching Some of his important writings are Physics Metaphysics Ethics Politics De Anima and Poetics

He also had problems with the atomic theory He did not believe in Democritus theories about the atomic theory He believed that all matter was continuous whereas Democritus stated the all matter was made up of tiny indivisible things called atoms Democritus was proved right by physicist John Dalton in 1804

Aristotle also wrote about logic Aristotle is the father of logic Logic is a type of thought that allows us to decide whether an idea is true or false Still today Aristotles ideas on logic have influence across the world

The works are traditionally listed in this sequence

The history of the work of Aristotle from the time he was born until the 1st century BC is not well known Legends say that Aristotles collection of writings was left to Theophrastus Theophrastus was Aristotles successor Theophrastus hid the things Aristotle wrote to keep them from being taken away or destroyed They were found again in the year 70 BC

Carl Edward Sagan was an American astronomer He tried to make science popular He thought about what life from other planets would be like He said that people should look for life on other planets He is world famous for his popular science books and the television series Cosmos which he co wrote and presented He said people should use the scientific method

Carl Sagan was born in Brooklyn New York where his father Sam Sagan was a Jewish clothes maker and his mother Rachel Molly Gruber was a housewife Sagan attended the University of Chicago earning two degrees in physics He followed with a doctorate in Astronomy in 1960 and taught at Harvard University until 1968 when he moved to Cornell University

Sagan became a teacher and director at Cornell in 1971 He helped many unmanned spacecraft to explore outer space He thought of the idea of putting a message on spacecraft which could be understood by any life from another planet that might find it The first message sent into space was a large gold plated label on the space probe Pioneer 10 He continued to make the messages better The last message he helped with was the Voyager Golden Record that was sent out with the Voyager space probes

He was well known as a writer who warned of the dangers of nuclear winter He helped people learn about the atmosphere of Venus seasonal changes on Mars and Saturns moon Titan He showed that the atmosphere of Venus is very hot and dense He also said that global warming was a growing man made danger like the natural development of Venus into a hot and dangerous planet with greenhouse gases He suggested that the seasonal changes on Mars were due to dust storms 

Sagan was among the first to guess that Titan and Jupiters moon Europa might have oceans or lakes which means that life could be there Europas underground ocean was later confirmed by the spacecraft Galileo

Sagan thought the search for life on other planets was a good idea He said scientists should listen with large radio telescopes for signals from other planets He thought sending probes to other planets was a good idea Sagan was editor Icarus for 12 years He helped start the Planetary Society and was a member of the SETI Institute Board of Trustees

Sagan also believed that the Drake equation suggested that many kinds of intelligent life could form but that the lack of evidence suggests that intelligent beings destroy themselves rather quickly This made him keen to talk about ways that humanity could destroy itself in the hope of avoiding such destruction

Under the name Mr X Sagan wrote about pot smoking in the 1971 book Reconsidering Marijuana Lester Grinspoon told this to Keay Davidson Sagans biographer Sagan said that marijuana helped him write some of his books

Sagan was very good at helping people to understand the cosmos He gave the 19771978 Christmas Lectures for Young People at the Royal Institution He wrote and made the very popular thirteen part PBS television series Cosmos he also wrote books to help science become more popular and a novel Contact that was a best seller and was made into a film starring Jodie Foster in 1997 The film won the 1998 Hugo Award 

After Cosmos Sagan was linked with the catchphrase billions and billions which he never used in the television series He wrote Pale Blue Dot A Vision of the Human Future in Space which was chosen as a notable book of 1995 by The New York Times

Not all scientists agreed with him Although they all liked the way he made science popular some were afraid that people would think that his personal opinions might be confused with real science What he said about the Kuwait oil well fires during the first Gulf War were shown later to be wrong

Later in his life Sagans books showed his skeptical naturalistic view of the world In his book The Demon Haunted World Sagan gave a list of mistakes he had made as an example of how science is self correcting The compilation Billions and Billions Thoughts on Life and Death at the End of the Millennium published after Sagans death contains essays written by Sagan such as his views on abortion and Ann Druyans account of his death as a non believer

Some people thought Sagan had a big ego In 1994 Apple Computer chose a code name Sagan when they developed the Power Macintosh 7100 When Sagan heard this he tried to make Apple Computer use another name Sagan lost the fight in court but Apple engineers did what he asked anyway and named the project Butthead Astronomer Sagan tried to sue Apple again saying they made him look stupid Sagan lost in court again but the name of the project was changed to LAW

Sagan is said to have been an atheist or agnostic but some people have said he was a pantheist because he said things like The idea that God is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous But if by God one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe then clearly there is such a God This God is emotionally unsatisfying it does not make much sense to pray to the law of gravity

Sagan married three times the biologist Lynn Margulis in 1957 artist Linda Salzman in 1968 and author Ann Druyan in 1981 to whom he was married until his death

Sagan purchased a house on the edge of Ithaca Falls which looked like an Egyptian crypt Before it was converted into a house the building served as the lodge for a secret society Sphinx Head

After a long and difficult fight with myelodysplasia Sagan died of pneumonia at the age of 62 on December 20 1996 at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle Washington Sagan was very important because he made science popular and changed the way science was organized and because he defended humanism and argued against seeing things from only one point of view

The landing site of the unmanned Mars Pathfinder spacecraft was renamed the Carl Sagan Memorial Station in honor of Dr Sagan on July 5 1997 Asteroid 2709 Sagan is also named in his honor

The 1997 movie Contact based on Sagans novel of the same name and finished after his death ends with the dedication For Carl

Matsuo Munefusa known as Matsuo Bash was a Japanese poet He is known as the greatest maker of haiku a kind of poetry in 5 7 5 syllables According to Japanese custom he is usually called Basho without his family name and his signature as a poet does not include his house name He signed usually He is one of the greatest writers of the Edo period and he raised the haiku form to its highest level

He was born in Iga now a part of Mie prefecture in a samurai family After many years of samurai life he found that poetry would be his life work and gave up being a samurai He started his life as a poet when he served his lord as a samurai First he named himself Tosei meaning unripe peach in blue Basho took this name because he admired a Chinese poet Li Po whose name means plum in white

He quit he needs a bash 1666 and in 1675 he moved to Edo Tokyo today There in 1678 he got to be a haiku master and began the life of a working poet In 1680 he moved to Fukagawa just outside of Edo He planted a basho tree and called himself Basho because it became his favorite tree in his garden

In his life Basho visited many places Those travels were important for his writings He visited his disciples and taught them by making renga a series of haiku with them He also visited famous places in Japanese history These visits made his writing much stronger

His most famous book is Oku no Hosomichi This book was written after a trip On the trip Basho and his disciple left Edo on March 24 1689 They went around Tohoku and Hokuriku and returned to Edo in 1691 The trip in this book ends in Ogaki Mino with one of his haiku where he hinted that he wanted to visit Ise shrine after staying in Ogaki

Basho died because of disease in early autumn of 1694 in Osaka while staying at a house of his disciple on a trip Before his death he made a haiku as his last words

Colonization is the act of one country settling another place in order to become the new rulers of the new country and to live in the new country

In 1492 Christopher Columbus discovered The Americas This is how the Europeans learned that North America and South America were there The Europeans colonized the Americas Because of this most people now living in North America are the descendents of Europeans

Choreography is the art of making dances It tells dancers how they should dance and move The word has been used since the late 18th century to mean the art of composing dance

A person who does choreography is called a choreographer A choreographer makes a dance based on music or a synopsis They may also act as trainers for professional dancers in ballet stage shows and competitive ballroom dance Their ideas may be recorded in dance notation or on videos

An electrical cell is a device that is used to generate electricity or one that is used to make chemical reactions possible by applying electricity

The simple electrical cells were first developed in 1800s They are also called galvanic cells because an Italian scientist named Luigi Galvani invented these cells

Special chemical reactions which occur inside the electrical cell result in oxidation and reduction of the substances inside the cell This produces electrical energy Normal batteries work like this

Some of the electrical cells produce electricity without using chemical energy For example solar cells produce electricity when they are exposed to sun light

These cells are commonly related with chemical reactions For example a plate of zinc and a plate of copper are immersed in a dilute solution which contains acid or salt The solution acts as an electrolyte When the two plates are connected to a meter with a wire electric current will pass this is because oxidation and reduction processes take place in this chemical reaction turning the zinc plate to a negative electrode and the copper plate to a positive electrode and so the electrons flows from zinc to copper which makes the meter move

Some chemical reactions need high energy to happen An example is the breakdown of water into hydrogen and oxygen An electrical cell is used for these reactions It is a container which has to have a chemical reaction involving electrodes The chemical substances are exposed to high voltage electrical power and the reaction happens inside the electrical cell

Two pieces of metal are placed in water that has a little electrolyte such as hydrochloric acid sulfuric acid sodium bicarbonate or sodium hydroxide added to it An electric current is applied and gas comes out of each electrode Some greenish brown color may be seen too if iron was used This is because of the splitting of water and the oxidation of the pieces of metal

Dry cells are a type of chemical cells Dry cells are commonly used today in the form of batteries Dry cells are used in many electrical appliances

Primary cells are not rechargeable They have to be thrown away after their chemicals are used up

Secondary cells are rechargeable They can be used again See rechargeable battery for details

The Vietnam War lasted from 1955 to 1975 It was fought between North Vietnam and South Vietnam North Vietnam was supported by the USSR China and North Korea while South Vietnam was supported by the United States with its allies Thailand Australia New Zealand and the Philippines This conflict between pro communist and pro Democratic countries was part of the Cold War

Before World War II Vietnam was part of the French colony of Indochina During World War II the Japanese occupied Indochina At the end of World War II the Japanese surrendered After this the French attempted to take back control But the French were opposed by a Vietnamese army called the Viet Minh The Viet Minh had been founded in 1941 by the communist party and was led by H Ch Minh In July 1954 France and the Viet Minh signed the Geneva Peace Accord The Viet Minh became the government of North Vietnam while anti communist Vietnamese especially Catholics regrouped in the South under the leadership of Bao Dai a former emperor of Vietnam who had abdicated in 1945

The United States backed the anti communist government in South Vietnam It began to send military advisers to help train and support the South Vietnamese army The South was fighting against the Viet Cong a communist party based in South Vietnam which was allied with North Vietnam The Viet Cong began a campaign of assassination in 1957 In 1959 North Vietnam dramatically increased its military assistance to the Viet Cong which then began attacking South Vietnamese military units

The US responded by sending more assistance to South Vietnam and also sent soldiers as military advisors But Soviet support for North Vietnam also increased and the communist forces in the South continued to grow stronger In 1965 the first United States combat troops entered Vietnam There would be half a million of them by 1968

Land battles were fought throughout South Vietnam Thousands of North Vietnamese Army troops were sent to fight in South Vietnam There were also thousands of communist soldiers from South Vietnam called Vietcong Because of this it was often hard for American and South Vietnamese troops to tell friendly civilians from dangerous ones A tragic example of this mistrust was the My Lai Massacre in March 1968 in which US Army troops killed hundreds of people in a South Vietnamese village The large number of communist fighters throughout the country meant that American bases were often attacked

The North Vietnamese and Vietcong were supplied by a vast network of hidden trails known as the Ho Chi Minh Trail Supplies and soldiers from North Vietnam were sent through Laos to communists forces in South Vietnam America subjected the Ho Chi Minh Trail to extremely heavy bombing and three million bombs were dropped on Laos

Severe communist losses during the 1968 Tet Offensive made it possible for the US to withdraw many soldiers a policy called Vietnamization South Vietnamese troops were trained and equipped to replace the Americans who left By 1973 95 percent of the American troops were gone

A peace treaty was signed in Paris in January 1973 by all the parties but fighting continued until 1975

The Vietcong used mines and booby traps Many of them were homemade Although most traps were non explosive there were a few explosive traps which all used grenades A trip wire was placed and if a soldier tripped over the wire a grenade pin was pulled out and the grenade would blow and kill the soldier 

Another style of trap was nicknamed Venus Flytrap It had about eight barbs attached to a rectangular frame sitting on a small hole The barbs were facing down so when the soldiers leg got caught in it it wouldnt hurt until he pulled his out When he pulled his leg out the barbs would rip through his leg 

Another Vietcong trap was the Punji trap Two wooden platforms were placed and covered with leaves to camouflaged it There were spikes on the inside of the wood When a soldier came along and walked on the wood it caved in and the spikes would go through the soldiers foot These traps were the most common because they were the cheapest and very effective They also were often contaminated so that the soldier would also become infected

Besides hurting or killing people these traps were good at causing fear and lowering soldier morale

Although the traps were very effective and lethal the Vietcong sometimes fell into their own trap However Ho Chi Minh had once said You can kill ten of my men for every one I kill of yours but even at those odds you will lose and I will win Even with some Vietcong falling into the traps they still helped the Vietcong Today most of the traps are inactive but tourists visiting the Cu Chi tunnels are warned to stay on the paths in case they fall into an undiscovered trap Replicas and recovered traps can be seen at the Cu Chi tunnels just outside of Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam

The Sahel is a narrow belt of land in West Africa It is a strip of dry land about 5500 kilometers long and 450 kilometers wide It lies at the southern edge of the Sahara Desert and is located between the dry desert land to the north and the forest areas to the south The Sahel has a tropical semi arid climate The temperature is high throughout the year There is little rainfall in the Sahel It is concentrated during summer months and can be unreliable It may be very dry in some years especially if a large area of low pressure which brings rain is not carried North over the Sahel by strong winds

The Sahel is the Arabic word for edge or shore

The Sahel is facing a big problem Desertification

The distribution of rainfall in the Sahel region is uneven The rainfall in the region has been below average since 1970 The Sahel is becoming drier on the whole The problem of drought affects most of the countries As a result crops and animals die There is no vegetation to protect the soil which is then removed by flash floods and strong wind This leads to soil erosion Finally the desert spreads towards the surrounding areas

With better medical services the birth rate increases and the death rate decreases in the Sahel As a result the population in the Sahel is growing To meet the ever increasing demand for firewood a lot of trees have been cut down More land has become barren This is called deforestation Because people farm intensively in order to grow more crops the soil becomes dry and infertile In the long run no crops can be grown We called this overcultivation People keep many animals for food However the grass cannot support so many grazing animals We called this overgrazing Finally the desert spreads towards the surrounding areas

This is a list of simple adjectives used in the English language

A chemical change is a change of materials into other new materials with different properties and one or more new substances are formed Burning of wood is a chemical change as new substances which cannot be changed back are formed For example if wood is burned in a fire place there is not wood anymore but ash Other examples include burning of a candle rusting of iron etc Special details that describe how a chemical change takes place are called chemical properties         

Compare Physical change  The opposite of a chemical change is a physical change Physical changes are a change in which no new substances are formed and the substance which is changed is the same For instance if a stick of wood is broken there is still a stick of wood it is just broken More examples include changes of shape changes of states passing electricity through a copper wire breaking of wood shattering of glass pouring of water etc Special details which do not change in a substance without new substances being formed are called physical properties

 ImageNaturalFireplacejpgBurning Wood is an example of a chemical change that is not reversible 

A physical change is a change in which no new substances are formed and most physical changes are reversible Examples changes of shape changes of states passing electricity through a copper wire Special details which do not change in a substance without new substances being formed are called physical properties eg change of water into ice or water vapor change of densityParaffin wax which is solid before heating and liquid after heating Some physical chages are melting freezing and boiling

Ronald Wilson Reagan was the 40th President of the United States and the 33rd Governor of California Reagan was born in Tampico Illinois Reagan was also an actor in films before entering politics Reagan had a successful career in Hollywood as a second rank leading man and appeared in 53 films He was the oldest person elected President of the United States He is known as the Great Communicator because he was a good public speaker Reagan still remains one of the most popular presidents in American history

Ronald Dutch Reagan was born on February 6 1911 to Jack and Nelle Reagan He was the younger of their two sons His brothers name was Neil His father was a Roman Catholic and his mother was a Protestant While Ronald Reagan was a child his family moved to different places in Illinois His family was very poor and Ronald did not have much as a child because they lived through the Great Depression In high school Reagan loved to act He loved athletics and became a life guard who saved 77 lives

After Reagan finished college in 1932 he became a sports announcer at WHO He was known for being good at recreating baseball games and making them interesting At this time all they would get is the scores so it would have been very hard for someone to come up with what happened in the game He was fired for not telling people who the sponsors were but was quickly re hired because they could not find anyone as good as him to re create the baseball games He would send some money back to his parents to help them out because it was the Great Depression

Reagan became a somewhat famous actor featuring in movies such as Kings Row After enjoying moderate success in the film industry he joined the military to fight in World War II After the war he never matched his previous success in acting but since he was a good speaker Reagan was hired to make speeches for General Electric

Reagan was very active in politics near the end of his acting career Although he used to be a Democrat who strongly supported the New Deal and admired Franklin Roosevelt over time he became a conservative Republican because he felt the federal government had too much power and authority He made a famous speech speaking out against socialized medicine 

During the 1964 presidential election Reagan supported Republican candidate Barry Goldwater by making a famous speech called Time For A Choosing In the speech he spoke against government programs and high taxes Even though Goldwater did not win the election Reagan gained popularity from it

At the age of 54 Reagan ran as a Republican against the then governor Pat Brown When Reagan was elected governor he brought the state out of debt made tougher water laws and had the government give more money to the most poor He ran for a second term and won Reagan was a very popular governor He served as the Governor of California from 1967 to 1975

Reagan ran for president in 1972 again in 1976 but his run for president in 1980 was successful He was both nominated by the Republican Party and he defeated Democrat Jimmy Carter to become president

Reagan believed that the government should be small not big  this means that the government should not interfere in peoples lives very much or interfere with what businesses do He believed in supply side economics which was called Reaganomics and Voodoo economics during his term He lowered everybodys income taxes by 25 and cut spending in many government departments He also lowered inflation from 14 to 4 and he vetoed 78 bills Reagans economic plan resulted in a bad economy during the year 1982 but the economy turned around in 1983 and the economy was the greatest it was since many years ago He called it morning in america and was re elected in 1984 

In foreign policy Reagan ended detente by ordering the largest peacetime military buildup in American history The US government had to borrow a lot of money to pay for it He had many new weapons built and began research on a missile defense system which would destroy missiles to prevent a nuclear war from happening The program was called SDI He directed money to anti communist movements all over the world that wanted to overthrow their communist government He ordered multiple military operations including the invasion of Grenada and the Libya bombing Reagans reputation was badly hurt by the Iran Contra Affair but it eventually recovered

In 1985 Mikhail Gorbachev became the new leader of the Soviet Union Reagan had many talks with him and they both became good friends Near the end of his term they both signed the INF treaty

Reagan by public opinion is one of the most popular American presidents His legacy is strongly admired among many conservatives and Republicans The legacy of his economic policies is still divided between people who believe that the government should be smaller and those who believe the government should take a more active role in regulating the economy While some of his foreign policies were controversial many credit Ronald Reagan for peacefully ending the Cold War

Reagans Tear Down This Wall speech was delivered at the Brandenburg Gate in what was then West Berlin Germany on June 12 1987 In the speech he expressed the desire of the western allies to make peace with the Soviet Union Referring to the Soviets SS 20 nuclear weapons Reagan spoke of the possibility of eliminating for the first time an entire class of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth The title of this speech comes from a challenge delivered in the speech to then General Secretary of the USSR Gorbachev Reagan challenged Gorbachev if he was serious about peace to remove open East Berlin and remove the restrictions on travel Referring to the Brandenburg Gate and the Berlin Wall he said

On 20 August 1981 Reagan was the honorable guest of Captain Dennis Brooks commanding officer of the USS Constellation President Reagan arrived on the USS Constellation by helicopter He spoke to the ships crew ate lunch with them and watched a United States Navy tactical display at sea President Reagan then re enlisted some US Navy personnel He then was introduced to Special Agent Craig Goodwin of the Naval Investigative Service He was the Special Agent who was on on board the USS Constellation He was later awarded one of the highest civilian medals for his intelligence work the Meritorious Civilian Service Medal 

The goals of the United Nations are

After World War I the nations of the world formed the League of Nations This organization was a place where nations could talk through their differences calmly However some countries like Germany Italy and Japan ignored the League and tried to solve their problems through war Because members of the League of Nations did not want to go to war to protect other members the League failed and the Second World War began

During World War II the Allied Powers often called themselves the United Nations After the War the winners formed a new organization for world peace On 25th April 1945 in San Francisco they decided on the name United Nations The UN was created on 24th October 1945 and its first meeting was held in January 1946 Since 1947 the 24th of October has been called United Nations Day

The main building for the United Nations is in New York City in the United States of America but the UN also has important offices in Geneva Nairobi and Vienna The UN tries to be peaceful but sometimes when talks do not work the UN unlike the League of Nations will fight too In the 1950s the UN helped South Korea in a war against North Korea and in the 1990s the UN helped to force Iraqi soldiers out of Kuwait At other times the UN has formed peacekeeping forces UN peacekeepers travel to troubled places in the world and try  sometimes successfully sometimes not  to keep the peace Today there are UN peacekeepers working in Afghanistan Cyprus Haiti Liberia and several other countries Through a series of goals resolutions and declarations adopted be member nations of the United Nations the world has a set of commitments actions and goals to stop and reverse the spread of HIV and scale up towards universal access to HIV prevention treatment care and support services

The United Nations has set up six organs

Special agencies of the United Nations

Zeami Motokiyo also called Kanze Motokiyo was a Japanese actor and playwright He wrote what Noh actors should do and made Noh theater finer as an art form Noh is a kind of Japanese musical drama Zeamis books not only tell how actors should play their roles but also talk about art and philosophy based on the spiritual culture of Japan

Zeamis father Kanami was also an actor and playwright Kanami had his own theater and traveled with members He taught Zeami his skills This father and son were the most important persons for Noh theater and they made the Noh what it is today

When Kanamis company played for the Shogun of Japan Ashikaga Yoshimitsu the Shogun offered to let Zeami go to school with the princes for his arts Zeami was a beautiful boy with a good voice and Yoshimitsu loved his beauty and talent After Zeami followed his father and did his work to be the leader of his theater he continued to play and change his style into what Noh is today A mixture of ways to use the voice and ways to move this style has been interesting for the Japanese for hundreds of years

Marco Polo was an Italian trader and explorer He was one of the first Europeans to explore east Asia Many other explorers including Christopher Columbus looked up to him

He went on a 24 year trip to China with his father and uncle during the Mongol Dynasty

As Marco Polos mother died when he was born he grew up in Venice with his father Niccolo Polo who took him on his first journey to Cathey His family was a group of well known merchants not explorers

He started his travels at the age of 17 leaving Venice on a boat that went through the Mediterranean Sea Ayas Tabriz and Kerman Then he travelled across Asia getting as far as Beijing On the way there he had to go over mountains and through terrible deserts Across hot burning lands and places where the cold was horrible He served in Khans court for 17 years and left the Far East and returned to Venice by sea There was sickness on board and 600 passengers and crew died and some say pirates attacked

Some scholars believe that while Marco Polo did go to China did not go to all of the other places described in his book He brought noodles back from China and the Italians formed all new sizes and shapes and called it pasta

Soon after Marco Polo returned from his journeys he fought in a war against Genoa got captured and put in prison When he was in prison he became friendly with a prisoner Rusticello who was a writer of romances and novels Marco told the writer about all his adventures Rusticello wrote down his words which led Marco to the creation of a famous book called The travels of Marco Polo and became famous throughout Europe They found his stories to be very interesting and strange as western people did not know much about the Eastern world

Marco Polos nickname was Marco IL Milione standing for a million lies as the Venetians thought he was lying about his travels

Herpes zoster is a disease in humans The same virus that causes chickenpox also causes shingles The symptoms are pain and a rash with blisters 

Shingles is a viral disease produced by the varicella zoster virus the same virus that causes chicken pox Its symptoms include pain and a blistering rash that occurs along the nerves that contain dormant virus You can not catch shingles however you can catch chicken pox through direct contact with someone who has shingles by touching the area of the rash Most people who get shingles are old It sometimes infects younger people or people with a weakened immune system Stress may trigger shingles The disease starts with tingling itchiness or pain on an infected persons skin After a few days the disease causes a blistering rash This rash may be on the trunk or face The rash grows into small blisters filled with fluid These blisters dry out and crust over for several days The rash causes anything from mild itching to extreme pain The rash stays in one region of the body

The shingles virus is contagious from person to person only by direct contact For this reason persons with shingles are advised to limit contact with those who are not immune to chicken pox those with increased risk are young children and pregnant women Contracting chickenpox when one is pregnant can be dangerous to the unborn child

If people have had chickenpox they cannot get chickenpox from someone else again However it is thought that contact with a shingles patient may trigger a persons own dormant chickenpox virus to become shingles

Doctors recommend antiviral drugs steroids antidepressants anticonvulsants and topical agents to treat shingles The antiviral drugs acyclovir valacyclovir and famcyclovir can reduce the severity of shingles

Shingles can be very painful and itchy It is not very dangerous to healthy people and it usually ends without major problems The rash and pain last 3 to 5 weeks Sometimes serious problems like temporary partial facial paralysis ear damage or encephalitis may occur Persons with shingles on the upper half of the face need immediate medical attention the virus may cause serious damage to the eyes Most people who have shingles have only one attack of the disease in their lifetime However people with AIDS cancer or weak immune systems may have multiple attacks

A Brief History of Time is a book written by the scientist and mathematician Stephen Hawking This book is about physics or the study of laws that predict how things work in the universe It is also about cosmology or how we see the universe and how the universe exists

In this book Stephen Hawking talks about many theories in physics Some of the things that he talks about are the history of physics gravity how light moves in the universe space time elementary particles black holes the Big Bang and time travel

There are two other versions of this book The Illustrated A Brief History of Time and A Briefer History of Time The Illustrated A Brief History of Time has pictures to help explain its ideas It was also updated because new information was found A Briefer History of Time is shorter than the first version and was also updated

This book is very popular and well known This book was on the London Sunday Times bestseller list for over 4 years

In the first part of the book Hawking talks about the history of physics He talks about the ideas of philosophers such as Aristotle and Ptolemy Aristotle unlike many other people of his time thought that the Earth was round He also thought that the sun and stars went around the Earth Ptolemy also thought about how the sun and stars were located in the universe He made a planetary model that described Aristoles thinking Today it is known that the opposite is true the earth goes around the sun The ArisotlePtolemy ideas about the locations of the stars and sun was disproved in 1609 The person who first thought of the idea about the Earth going around the sun was Nicholas Copernicus Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler two other scientists helped to prove that Copernicuss idea was right They looked at how the moons of some planets moved in the sky and they used this to prove Copernicus right Issac Newton also wrote a book about gravity which helped to prove Copernicuss idea right

Hawking also talks a little about the other topics in the book

In this chapter Stephen Hawking talks about space and time He describes the motion of planets moving around the sun and how gravity works between the planets and the sun He also talks about the ideas of absolute rest and absolute position These ideas are about the thought that events stay in place over a period of time This was found not to be true by Newtons laws of gravity The idea of absolute rest did not work when objects move very fast 

The speed of light was found out in 1676 by the Danish astronomer Ole Christensen Roemer The speed of light was found to be very fast but at a finite speed However scientists found a problem when they tried to say that light always traveled at the same speed The scientists created a new idea called the ether which tried to explain lights speed

 The idea of the ether was said to be not needed by another scientist Albert Einstein He said that the idea of the ether was not needed if another idea the idea of absolute time was dropped Einsteins idea was also the same as Henry Poincares idea Einsteins idea is called the theory of relativity

Also in this chapter Stephen Hawking talks about light He says that events can be described by light broken wikt linkconecones The top of the light cone tells where the light from the event will travel The bottom tells where the light was in the past The center of the light cone is the event Besides light cones Stephen Hawking also talks about how light can bend When light goes past a big thing like a star the light changes direction because the star has a lot of gravity

After talking about light Stephen Hawking talks about time in Einsteins theory of relativity One broken wikt linkpredictionprediction that Einsteins theory makes is that time will go by slower when something is near big things like the Earth However when something is farther away from the big thing time will go by faster Stephen Hawking used the idea of two twins living at different places to describe his idea If one of the twins went to live on a high place and another twin went to live at a lower place the twin who went to live on the mountain would be a little bit older than the twin who went to live at the sea

In this chapter Stephen Hawking talks about the expanding universe This means he believes the universe is getting bigger over time One of the things he uses to explain his idea is the Doppler shift The Doppler shift happens when something moves toward or away from another object There are two types of things that happen in Doppler shift  red shifting and blue shifting Red shifting happens when something is moving away from us This is down to the wavelength of the visible light reaching us increasing and the frequency decreasing which shifts the visible light towards the redinfa red end of the electromagnetic spectrum Red shift is linked to the belief that the universe is expanding as the wavelength of the light is increasing almost as if stretched as planets and galaxies move away from us which shares similarities to that of the doppler effect involving sound waves Blue shifting happens when something is moving toward us the opposite process of red shift in which the wavelength decreases and frequency increases shifting the light towards the blue end of the spectrum A scientist named Edwin Hubble found that many stars are red shifted and are moving away from us Stephen Hawking uses the Doppler shift to explain that the universe is getting bigger The beginning of the universe is thought to have happened through something called the Big Bang The Big Bang was a very big explosion that created the universe

This chapter is about the uncertainty principle The uncertainty principle says that the speed and the position of a particle cannot be found at the same time To find where a particle is scientists shine light at the particle If a high frequency light is used the light can find the position more accurately but the particles speed will be unknown If a lower frequency light is used the light can find the speed more accurately but the particles position will be unknown The uncertainty principle disproved the idea of a theory that was deterministic or something that would predict everything in the future

How light behaves is also talked more about in this chapter Some theories say that light acts like particles even though it really is made of waves one theory that says this is Plancks quantum hypothesis A different theory also says that light waves also act like particles a theory that says this is Heisenbergs uncertainty principle

Light waves have crests and troughs The highest point of a wave is the crest and the lowest part of the wave is a trough Sometimes more than one of these waves can broken wikt linkinterfereinterfere with each other  the crests and the troughs line up This is called light interference When light waves interfere with each other this can make many colors An example of this is the colors in soap bubbles

Quarks and other elementary particles are the topic of this chapter 

Quarks are very small things that make up everything we see There are six different flavors of quarks the up quark down quark strange quark charmed quark bottom quark and top quark Quarks also have three colors red green and blue There are also anti quarks which are the opposite of the regular quarks In total there are 18 different types of regular quarks and 18 different types of antiquarks Quarks are known as the building blocks of matter because they are the smallest thing that make up all the matter in the universe 

All particles have something called spin The spin of a particle shows us what a particle looks like from different directions For example a particle of spin 0 looks the same from every direction A particle of spin 1 looks different in every direction unless the particle is spun completely around Stephen Hawkings example of a particle of spin 1 is an arrow A particle of spin two needs to be turned around halfway to look the same The example given in the book is of a double headed arrow There are two groups of particles in the universe particles with a spin of 12 and particles with a spin of 0 1 or 2 All of these particles follow Paulis exclusion principle Paulis exclusion principle says that particles cannot be in the same place or have the same speed If Paulis exclusion principle did not exist then everything in the universe would look the same like a roughly uniform and dense soup

Particles with a spin of 0 1 or 2 move force from one particle to another Some examples of these particles are virtual gravitons and virtual photons Virtual gravitons have a spin of 2 and they represent the force of gravity This means that when gravity affects two things gravitons move to and from the two things Virtual photons have a spin of 1 and represent electromagnetic forces

Besides the force of gravity and the electromagnetic forces there are weak and strong nuclear forces Weak nuclear forces are the forces that cause radioactivity or when matter emits energy Weak nuclear force works on particles with a spin of 12 Strong nuclear forces are the forces that keep the quarks in a neutron and a proton together and keeps the protons and neutrons together in an atom The particle that carries the strong nuclear force is thought to be a gluon The gluon is a particle with a spin of 1 The gluon holds together quarks to form protons and neutrons However the gluon only holds together quarks that are three different colors This makes the end product have no color This is called confinement

Some scientists have tried to make a theory that combines the electromagnetic force the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force This theory is called a grand unified theory This theory tries to explain these forces in one big unified way or theory

Black holes are talked about in this chapter Black holes are stars that have collapsed into one very small point This small point is called a singularity Black holes suck things into its center because its gravity is very strong Some of the things it can suck in are light and stars Only very large stars called supergiants are big enough to become a black hole The star must be one and a half times the mass of the sun or larger to turn into a black hole This number is called the Chandrasekhar limit If the mass of a star is less than the Chandrasekhar limit it will not turn into a black hole instead it will turn into a different smaller type of star The boundary of the black hole is called the event horizon If something is in the event horizon it will never get out of the black hole

Black holes can be shaped differently Some black holes are perfectly spherical  like a ball Other black holes bulge in the middle Black holes will be spherical if they do not rotate Black holes will bulge in the middle if they rotate

Black holes are difficult to find because they do not let out any light They can be found when black holes suck in other stars When black holes suck in other stars the black hole lets out X rays which can be seen by telescopes

In this chapter Stephen Hawking talks about his bet with another scientist Kip Thorne Stephen Hawking bet that black holes did not exist because he did not want his work on black holes to be wasted He lost the bet

This chapter explains more about black holes 

Stephen Hawking realized that the event horizon of a black hole could only get bigger not smaller The area of the event horizon of a black hole gets bigger whenever something falls into the black hole He also realized that when two black holes combine the size of the new event horizon is greater than or equal to the sum of the event horizons of the two other black holes This means that a black holes event horizon can never get smaller

Disorder also known as entropy is related to black holes There is a scientific law that has to do with entropy This law is called the second law of thermodynamics and it says that entropy will always increase in an isolated system The relation between the amount of entropy in a black hole and the size of the black holes event horizon was first thought of by a research student and proven by Stephen Hawking Stephen Hawkings calculations said that black holes emit radiation This was strange because it was already said that nothing can escape from a black holes event horizon

This problem was solved when the idea of pairs of virtual particles was thought of One of the pair of particles would fall into the black hole and the other would escape This would look like the black hole was emitting particles This idea seemed strange at first but many people accepted it after a while

How the universe started and how it might end is talked about in this chapter

Most scientists believe that the universe started in an explosion called the Big Bang The model for this is called the hot big bang model When the universe starts getting bigger the things inside of it also begin to get cooler When the universe was first beginning it was infinitely hot The temperature of the universe cooled and the things inside the universe began to clump together

Stephen Hawking also talks about how the universe could have been For example if the universe formed and then collapsed quickly there would not be enough time for life to form Another example would be a universe that expanded too quickly If a universe expanded too quickly it would become almost empty The idea of many universes is called the anthropic principle

Inflationary models are also discussed in this chapter and so is the idea of a theory that unifies quantum mechanics and gravity

Each particle has many histories This idea is known as Feynmans theory of sum over histories A theory that unifies quantum mechanics and gravity should have Feynmans theory in it To find the chance that a particle will pass through a point the waves of each particle needs to be added up These waves happen in imaginary time Imaginary numbers when multiplied by themselves make a negative number For example 2i X 2i  4

Alexander Graham Bell was a teacher scientist and inventor He was the founder of the Bell Telephone Company

Bell was born in Edinburgh Scotland His family was known for teaching people how to speak English clearly Both his grandfather Alexander Bell and his father Alexander Melville Bell taught elocution His father wrote often about this and is most known for his invention and writings of Visible Speech In his writings he explained ways of teaching people who were deaf and unable to speak It also showed how these people could learn to speak words by watching their lips and reading what other people were saying

Alexander Graham Bell went to the Royal High School of Edinburgh He graduated at the age of fourteen At the age of sixteen he got a job as a student and teacher of elocution and music in Weston House Academy at Elgin in Morayshire He spent the next year at the University of Edinburgh While still in Scotland he became more interested in the science of sound He hoped to help his deaf mother From 1866 to 1867 he was a teacher at Somersetshire College in Bath Somerset 

In 1870 when he was 23 years old he moved with his family to Canada where they settled at Brantford Ontario Bell began to study communication machines He made a piano that could be heard far away by using electricity In 1871 he went with his father to Montreal Quebec in Canada where he took a job teaching about visible speech His father was asked to teach about it at a large school for deaf mutes in Boston Massachusetts but instead he gave the job to his son The younger Bell began teaching there in 1871 Alexander Graham Bell soon became famous in the United States for this important work He published many writings about it in Washington DC Because of this work thousands of deaf mutes in America are now able to speak even though they cannot hear

In 1876 Bell was the first inventor to patent the telephone and he helped start the Bell Telephone Company with others in July 1877 In 1879 this company joined with the New England Telephone Company to form the National Bell Telephone Company In 1880 they formed the American Bell Telephone Company and in 1885 American Telephone and Telegraph Company still a large company today Along with Thomas Edison Bell formed the Oriental Telephone Company on January 25 1881

Bell married Mabel Hubbard on July 11 1877 He died at his home near Baddeck Nova Scotia in 1922

Bells genius is seen in part by the eighteen patents granted in his name alone and the twelve that he shared with others These included fifteen for the telephone and telegraph four for the photophone one for the phonograph five for aerial vehicles four for hydroairplanes and two for a selenium cell

He was the recipient of many honors

His past experience made him ready to work more with sound and electricity He began his studies in 1874 with a musical telegraph in which he used an electric circuit and a magnet to make an iron reed or tongue vibrate One day it was found that a reed failed to respond to the current Mr Bell desired his assistant who was at the other end of the line to pluck the reed thinking it had stuck to the magnet His assistant Thomas Watson complied and to his surprise Bell heard the corresponding reed at his end of the line vibrate and sound the same  without any electric current to power it A few experiments soon showed that his reed had been set in vibration by the changes in the magnetic field that the moving reed produced in the line This discovery led him to stop using the electric battery current His idea was that since the circuit was never broken all the complex vibrations of speech might be converted into currents which in turn would reproduce the speech at a distance

Bell with his assistant devised a receiver consisting of a stretched film or drum with a bit of magnetised iron attached to its middle and free to vibrate in front of the pole of an electromagnet in circuit with the line This apparatus was completed on June 2 1875 On July 7th he instructed his assistant to make a second receiver which could be used with the first and a few days later they were tried together at each end of the line which ran from a room in the inventors house at Boston to the cellar underneath Bell in the room held one instrument in his hands while Watson in the cellar listened at the other The inventor spoke into his instrument Do you understand what I say and Mr Watson rushed back into the upstairs and answered Yes The first successful two way telephone call was not made until March 10 1876 when Bell spoke into his device Mr Watson come here I want to see you and Watson answered back The first long distance telephone call was made on August 10 1876 by Bell from the family home in Brantford Ontario to his assistant located in Paris Ontario some 16 km away

On March 7 1876 the US Patent Office gave him patent 174465 for the telephone

After that Bell continued his experiments in communication which led to the invention of the photophone which sent sound on a beam of light Bell worked with Charles Sumner Tainter In his paper on the photophone Bell gave credit to A C Browne of London with his discovery in 1878 Bell and Tainter however were the first to perform a successful experiment It was not an easy task as they had to produce selenium cells with the desired properties themselves

In one experiment in Washington DC the sender and the receiver were placed in different buildings some 830 ft apart The sender had a mirror directing sunlight onto the mouthpiece where the light beam was changed by a vibrating mirror It was focused by a lens and sent at the receiver which was a curved mirror with the selenium cells in the focus and a headphone attached With this setup Bell and Tainter succeeded in voice communication by lighbeams

The photophone was patented on December 18 1880 However since the light beam was not shielded in any way against external interference the quality of communication was not always good and it only worked within line of sight It is still considered a forerunner of the much later fiber optic technology which is based on the same ideas but which removed those limits

Bell is also credited with the invention of an improved metal detector in 1881 that made sounds when it was near metal The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of US President James Garfield The metal detector worked but did not find the bullet because of the metal bedframe the President was lying on Bell gave a full description of his experiments in a paper read before the American Association for the Advancement of Science in August 1882

Bell was an active supporter of the eugenics movement in the United States He was the honorary president of the Second International Congress of Eugenics held at the American Museum of Natural History in New York in 1921 He did not want deaf people to be allowed to teach in schools for the deaf He was also against the use of sign language These things mean that he is not appreciated by some deaf people in the present day

Heinrich Rudolf Hertz was a German physicist He was the first man who discovered radio waves in 1888 He also proved that light is a kind of electromagnetic waves The unit for frequency is named after him

Deep house is a type of house music It has influences from disco music and jazz music The BPM of deep house is usually 100  128 

Cytokines are signaling proteins which the body makes They help to control the immune system and fight disease 

Cytokines are small proteins which carry signals locally between cells and have an effect on other cells They are a category of signalling molecules They are proteins peptides or glycoproteins The term cytokine encompasses a large and diverse family of polypeptide regulators that are produced widely throughout the body by many groups of cells

Some well known kinds include histamine prostaglandin and interleukins Cytokines can be detected using the ELISA and ELISPOT techniques

Bristol is a city in the United Kingdom It is home to nearly 500000 people The River Avon runs through it to the Severn estuary

It is between the counties of Gloucestershire and Somerset In 1373 King Edward the Third ordered that it should be a county itself forever However it lost county status in 1974 the year after its 600 year celebrations becoming the largest district within the new Avon county Avon was never popular and was abolished in 1996 when county status returned to Bristol which became a unitary council

The Bristol name means the place where the bridge is in Old English It has been a port for 800 years but now ships are too big to reach it It has a new seaport at Avonmouth

It has many historic churches and other buildings The Clifton Suspension Bridge crosses high above the river

Bristol was a centre for the slave trade Bristol was badly damaged during World War II It now has many new factories and offices The Concorde supersonic airliner was made here It is also the birthplace of the music genre trip hop with 3 trip hop bands originating there Massive Attack Portishead and Tricky

Bright Eyes is an American indie rock music band The people in the band are Conor Oberst a singer songwriter Mike Mogis a musician and producer and other friends and session musicians from Omaha Nebraska USA

Obersts singing style and the words to the songs are called desperate or on the verge of tears Many people think his songs are always about himself but Oberst has said that they are not For example one song Padraic My Prince tells the fictional story of a mother drowning her son in a bathtub In interviews Oberst has said that he sings about such things to make rich emotions

A honeycomb is a container made by bees out of wax that they produce The bees make a honeycomb as a place to keep their honey Bees make honey from nectar that they collect from flowers After bees collect nectar from flowers and make it into honey the bees then put the honey in the small six sided areas of the honeycomb Each hexagonal section tessellates with the rest 

Honeycomb wax can be used for making soap and candles Some people eat honey that is still in the honeycomb 

The Greek language is an Indo European language It is the official language of Greece and Cyprus It was first spoken in Greece and was also once spoken along the coast of Asia Minor and in southern Italy It was also widely used in Western Asia and Northern Africa at one time In Greek the language is called 

Greeks write their language using the Greek alphabet The Latin alphabet came from the Greek alphabet Many other alphabets around the world also came from the Greek one such as the Cyrillic alphabet The Greeks got the idea of using an alphabet from the Phoenicians

Greek has an unbroken history of being a written language for over 3000 years This is longer than any other Indo European language spoken today Over 15 million people in the world speak Greek now These speakers mostly live in Greece and Cyprus but there are also people in other countries around the world who speak the language This is largely because people left Greece and emigrated meaning they moved to other countries Countries like the United States and Argentina have small Greek populations

Pepsin is a kind of enzyme It acts on proteins in the stomach It works best at a pH of about 15 It will not work at a pH above 6 

It was the first animal enzyme to be discovered Theodor Schwann discovered it in 1836

Pepsin is used to make cheese The brand name Pepsi comes from pepsin

pH is a scale of acidity from 0 to 14 It tells how acidic or alkaline a substance is More acidic solutions have lower pH More alkaline solutions have higher pH Substances which are not acidic or alkaline usually have a pH of 7 Acids have a pH less than 7 Alkalis have a pH greater than 7 

There are a lot of ways for finding the pH of something One way is to use litmus paper The pH paper is able to tell how strong the chemical is whether it is a stronger acid or a stronger base

pH is a measure of the concentration of protons in a solution SPL Srensen introduced this concept in 1909 The p stands for the German potenz meaning power or concentration and the H for the hydrogen ion

H indicates the concentration of H ions measured in moles per litre

Most substances have a pH in the range 0 to 14 although extremely acidic or basic substances may have pH 14

Basic substances have instead of Hydrogen ions a concentration of Hydroxide ions

Neutralisation can be summed up by the formula

Tapeworms are the class Cestoda of segmented flatworms They are parasitic which means that they need another larger creature as a host Tapeworms live inside the intestines of vertebrate animals This includes humans When a vertebrate has a tapeworm they may lose weight and become weaker

Tapeworms can be up to 30 or 36 feet long They eat by absorbing material directly through their epidermis The head of a tapeworm has four suckers and two rings of hooks The body of a tapeworm is in segments Each segment can produce eggs Little segments of the tapeworm sometimes break off and pass out through the stool of the host with the eggs Little segments of its body fall off They go out of the host body and are eaten by the next host which is another type of vertebrate

Tapeworms are hermaphrodite with both sexes Cross fertilization occurs between two tapeworms in the same intestine They have a life cycle with a secondary or intermediate host For example human tapeworms have cows or pigs as intermediate hosts The definitive host is the one where fertilization takes place

Omnivores are animals that actively seek out both plants and animals to supply nutrition Omni means all Grizzly bears are classic omnivores eating plants and berries but hunting prey and salmon when available Other examples are

Herbivores are animals that eat plants They are herbivorous animals

Humans are omnivores because they eat meat as well as vegetable matter People who eat mostly plants are usually called vegetarians 

Herbivores have teeth that are adapted to grind vegetable tissue Many animals that eat fruit and leaves sometimes eat other parts of plants for example roots and seeds Usually such animals cannot chew or digest meat But some herbivorous animals will eat eggs and occasionally other animal protein 

Some herbivores can be classified as frugivores because they eat mainly fruit or browsers which eat mostly leaves Animals that eat mostly grass are grazing animals

The diets of some herbivorous animals change with the seasons In the temperate zones of the Earth some seasons are hot and some are cold so different plants are available at different times of the year 

Plant cell walls are mostly made up of cellulose No herbivore can digest cellulose by itself They all make use of gut flora some of which produce an enzyme called cellulase This is an example of symbiosis

According to the theory of predator prey interactions the relationship between herbivores and plants is cyclic When prey are numerous their predators increase in numbers reducing the plant population which in turn causes herbivore number to decline The prey population eventually recovers starting a new cycle This suggests that the population of the herbivore fluctuates around the carrying capacity of the food source in this case the plant 

There will always be pockets of plants not found by herbivores This is important for specialist herbivores which feed on only one species of plant it prevents these specialists from wiping out their food source Eating a second plant type helps herbivores populations stabilize Alternating between two or more plant types provides population stability for the herbivore while the populations of the plants oscillate When an invasive herbivore or plant enters the system the balance is thrown off and the diversity can change or even collapse

In some ways it is easier to be an herbivorous animal than a carnivorous animal Carnivorous animals have to find and catch the animals that they eat and sometimes the animals that they want to eat fight them Herbivorous animals have to find the plants that they want to eat but they do not have to catch them Many plants have defences against herbivores such as spines toxins or a bad taste There are many more herbivorous animals living in the world than carnivorous animals

Hindi is the most commonly spoken language in India It is the fifth most spoken language in the world with about 182 million native speakers in 1998 The script used in writing Hindi is Devangar 

Hindi is widely written spoken and understood in north India and most other places in India In 1997 a survey found that 66 of Indians can speak Hindi The most common form of Hindi is known as Hindustani It has taken words from the Dravidian languages of South India many words from the Persian Arabic Turkish English and Portuguese languages Hindustani language is almost the same as Urdu the most commonly spoken language in Pakistan the difference is that Urdu is written in the Arabic alphabet from right to left 

Some other dialects of Hindi are Avadhi Braj Bhojpuri Bundeli Bagheli Chhattisgarhi Dogri and Marwari Hindi has developed from Sanskrit the ancient language of India Hindi started to develop in the 7th century as Apabhramsha but became pretty stable by the 10th century Some famous Hindi poets are Tulsidas and Kabir Hindi is also spoken with regional accents like Haryanvi Rajasthani and Bengali In the past few years a new Hindi language has emerged from Mumbai It is being spread by Hindi filmsIt is becoming very popular with younger generation 

Year 1945 was a year that started on a Monday It is well known as the end of World War II

Ludwig van Beethoven was a German composer He wrote classical music for the piano orchestras and different groups of instruments His best known works are his third fifth sixth and ninth symphonies the eighth and fourteenth piano sonatas two of his latter piano concertos his opera Fidelio and also the piano piece Fr Elise When he was a young man he was a talented pianist Beethoven was popular with the rich and important people in Vienna Austria where he lived 

In 1801 however he began to lose his hearing His deafness became worse In 1817 he was completely deaf Although he could no longer play in concerts he continued to compose During this time he composed some of his greatest works He is said to be one of the greatest classical composers who has ever lived 

He moved to Vienna in 1792 and lived there for the rest of his life He never married

Very little is known about Beethovens childhood He was baptized on December 17 1770 and was probably born a few days before that Beethovens parents were Johann van Beethoven and Maria Magdalena Keverich Magdalenas father Johann Heinrich Keverich had been Chef at the court of the Archbishopric of Trier at Festung Ehrenbreitstein fortress opposite to Koblenz His father was a fairly unimportant musician who worked at the court of the Elector of Cologne This court was in Bonn and it was here that he lived until he was a young man His father gave him his first lessons in piano and violin Beethoven was a child prodigy like Mozart but while Mozart as a little boy was taken all over Europe by his father Beethoven never traveled until he was 17 By that time his piano teacher was a man called Neefe who had learned the piano from Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach the son of Johann Sebastian Bach Neefe said to the Elector that the young Beethoven should be given the chance to travel so he was allowed to go to Vienna There he seemed to have had one or two lessons from Mozart but then Beethoven got a letter saying that his mother was dying so he hurried back to Bonn Soon his mother died and Beethoven had to help to look after the family because his father had become an alcoholic Beethoven played the viola in the orchestra of the Elector he started to compose and made many friends Some of these friends were musicians and others were very important people many of them were aristocrats who would be able to help him in his career

In 1792 the Elector let Beethoven travel to Vienna again He expected him to return after a while However Beethoven never left Vienna He stayed there for the rest of his life He would have loved to have had some more composition lessons from Mozart but Mozart had just died so he had lessons from Haydn instead Haydn was a good teacher but a year later he went off to England Therefore Beethoven took lessons from a man called Albrechtsberger who was not famous like Haydn He was a good teacher too and he made him write lots of technical exercises He showed him how to write advanced counterpoint and fugues This helped him to be a great composer

Beethoven wanted to become famous as a pianist and composer so he started to get to know important aristocratic people Some of these people had already heard him in Bonn when they had traveled there so his name was becoming known in Vienna It also helped that he could say he was the pupil of the famous Joseph Haydn There were a lot of aristocratic people in Vienna who liked music and many had their own private orchestras Some of them started to give Beethoven places to live when the Elector of Bonn stopped sending him money in 1794 Beethoven started to perform in private houses and he became known for his improvisations In 1795 he performed one of his piano concertos at a concert He also had his first publication This was a group of three Piano Trios Haydn had heard them at a private concert a year before and had advised Beethoven not to publish the third one However he did publish it and that was the one which became the most successful His opus 2 was a group of three piano sonatas which he played at the court of his friend Prince Lichnowsky When he published them he dedicated them to Haydn

Beethoven was starting to become famous travelling to places like Prague and Pressburg He wrote much chamber music He was perhaps a little jealous of the success that Haydn had with his latest symphonies he had written for London In 1800 he gave his first public concert with his own music He conducted his First Symphony as well as the Septet By now several publishers were trying to persuade him to let them publish his new works Beethoven was becoming famous as a composer And during this period Beethoven produced his most famous piano sonata No 14 in C sharp minor nicknamed Moonlight This was written for his girlfriend 16 year old Giulietta Giulietti However he was far from happy because he realized that he was starting to become deaf And when he asked for Giuliettas marriage her parents refused and married her to another 20 year old man instead

Beethoven seems to have tried to forget these bad thoughts by working very hard He composed a lot more music including his Third Symphony called the Eroica Originally he gave it the title Bonaparte in honour of Napoleon whom he admired But when Napoleon crowned himself emperor in 1804 Beethoven began to think that he was just a tyrant who wanted a lot of power He went to the table where the score of the symphony was lying and tore up the title page Beethoven stayed in Vienna that year working hard at an opera and giving piano lessons to Josephine von Brunsvik to whom he wrote passionate letters She was a young widow with four children It is impossible to know quite what her feelings were for Beethoven but socially she belonged in higher society and probably thought that a wild musician was not a suitable husband In the end she married a Baron but this marriage like her first one was not happy either

In 1805 Beethoven wrote his only opera The next spring it had two performances but was then not performed again for another eight years Beethoven had made several changes to the opera which became known as Fidelio The overture that he had written for the 1806 performance is now known as Leonore 3 and is usually performed separately at concerts The opera is a rescue opera a typical French kind of opera describing a man who is imprisoned and rescued by his lover who disguises herself as a man and manages to get into the prison

Beethoven continued to write compositions a Violin Concerto symphonies piano concertos string quartets and chamber music Two of his greatest symphonies were produced in 1806 Symphony No 5 and Symphony No 6 Pastorale The first one was known for its dark and deep tone especially in its first movement The second was famous for its depicting of a garden city He also wrote Piano Concerto No 4 and Piano Concerto No 5 Emperor He earned money by pleasing the aristocrats dedicating works to them in return for fees and by selling his music to publishers Occasionally he earned money from concerts It was not a regular income He would have liked the job of Kapellmeister to the emperor He was not able to get this but in 1809 three rich aristocrats the Archduke Rodolph Prince Lobkowitz and Prince Kinsky gave him an income for the rest of his life on condition that he stayed in Vienna This meant that Beethoven did not have to worry so much about money He was asked to write music for Egmont a play by Goethe The overture is very often performed as a concert piece Beethoven very much wanted to meet Goethe The two great men met in Teplitz Goethe later described Beethoven as a rather wild mannered man who made life difficult for himself by his cross attitude to the world Beethoven admired several women including one to whom he wrote a passionate letter She is known as the Immortal Beloved but no one knows who she was Beethoven seems to have become deeply depressed because he never found true happiness in love

In a letter dated June 29 1801 Beethoven told a friend in Bonn about a terrible secret he had for some time He knew that he was becoming deaf For some time he had spells of fever and stomach pains A young man does not expect to become deaf but now he was starting to admit it to himself He was finding it hard to hear what people were saying Just at the moment when he was starting to become known as one of the greatest of all composers it was a terrible blow to realize that he was losing his hearing In 1802 he stayed for a time in Heiligenstadt which is now a suburb of Vienna but at that time it was outside the city There he wrote a famous letter which is known as the Heiligenstadt Testament It is dated October 6 and told about his rising frustration at his deafness He asks people to forgive him if he cannot hear what they are saying He said that he had often thought of suicide but that he had so much music in his head which had to be written down that he decided to continue his life This very emotional letter was found amongst his papers after his death It was never sent to anyone

By 1814 Beethoven had reached the height of his fame He was thought of as the greatest composer by the Viennese people and he was often invited by royal people to their palaces It was the year in which he played his famous Piano Trio Op 97 The Archduke That was the last time he played the piano in public His deafness was making it impossible to continue

Beethoven had many problems when his brother Caspar Carl died leaving a 9 year old son The boys mother may have been incapable of looking after him but Beethoven had to prove this in a court of law For several years he looked after his nephew but it was a difficult relationship and it involved a lot of legal letters and quarrels with people In 1826 Karl tried to shoot himself He survived but people persuaded Beethoven to stop being his guardian Karl went into the army

The last years were unhappy years for Beethoven During this time he composed very little Then in 1817 he recovered and wrote his last two symphonies a mass called Missa Solemnis his last five piano sonatas and a group of string quartets which were so modern and difficult that very few people at the time understood the music Nowadays people think they are the greatest works ever written for string quartet

His Ninth Symphony is called the Choral Symphony because there is a choir and soloists in the last movement At the time people did not understand this either because a symphony is normally a work for orchestra not a work with singers Beethoven chose the words of a poem by the German poet Friedrich Schiller An die Freude It is all about living together in peace and harmony so that it sends an important message to people This is why it has been chosen in recent years as the National Anthem for the European Union The Ninth Symphony was performed at a concert on May 7 1824 After the scherzo movement the audience applauded enthusiastically but Beethoven could not hear the applause and one of the singers had to turn him round so that he could see that people were clapping

Beethoven died on March 26 1827 About 10000 people came onto the streets for his funeral The famous poet Franz Grillparzer wrote the funeral speech One of the torchbearers was Franz Schubert Schubert died the next year In 1888 Beethovens and Schuberts remains were moved to another cemetery in Vienna and were placed side by side

Beethovens music is usually divided into three periods Early Middle and Late Most composers who live a long time develop as they get older and change their way of composing Of course these changes in style are not sudden but they are quite a good way of understanding the different periods of his composing life

His first period includes the works he wrote in his youth in Bonn and his early days in Vienna up to about 1803 His middle period starts with the Eroica Symphony and includes most of his orchestral works His last period includes the Ninth Symphony and the late string quartets

Beethoven is probably the most famous of all composers and the most written about He had a wild personality and this was something that the Romantics in the 19th century always expected from great artists The Romantics thought that the artist was somehow a person with exaggerated qualities who was not like normal people Beethoven had a very strong personality He lived in the time of the French Revolution and had strong views on independence and ways of living free from tyranny This made him a hero in many peoples eyes

His music was so famous that many composers in the 19th century found it quite hard to compose because they thought they would be compared to him For example Johannes Brahms took a long time to write his First Symphony He thought that everyone was expecting him to be the next Beethoven It was only towards the end of the 19th century that Gustav Mahler wrote several symphonies which include singing although he does this very differently to Beethoven

Roald Engelbregt Gravning Amundsen was a Norwegian man who explored the Arctic and the South Pole Amundsen was born 16 July 1872 He disappeared in June 1928 while taking part in a rescue mission Probably he died 18 June 1928

Amundsen was the first man to reach the South Pole On 19 December 1911 he came to the South Pole together with his men The Royal Navy Captain Robert Falcon Scott came 35 days later

Amundsen was also the first man known to travel the Northwest Passage

Christopher Columbus was a trader and explorer He was born in Genoa Italy in the year 1451 He died on May 20 1506 in Valladolid He wrote that he went to sea at the age of 14 He piloted four voyages to the Bahamas believing he had reached the Indies

Columbus is often considered the first European person to have discovered the Americas when he landed in the Bahamas in 1492 Many people doubt this for several reasons One of these is that though the Caribbean is often considered part of North America it is not on the American mainland Another is that some believe that America was discovered by the Viking Leif Ericson around 1000 AD Still others doubt the idea of discovery of America at all as Native Americans had been living there for thousands of years before Columbus 

While he did not actually discover the Americas he discovered the Bahamas close to the Americas He was once called the first European to find out because people already lived at the Americas though it is known now that the Vikings did this earlier

Columbus sailed the Atlantic Ocean because he was hoping to find a shorter safer way to China and India He wanted to bring back spices and gold for the King and Queen of Spain Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon He knew that the world was round but he did not know how large it was He had heard that Marco Polo had found a sea to the east of China and he believed that it must be the same as sea to the west of Europe He did not really know about the Pacific Ocean and The Americas and that the Atlantic Ocean did not go all the way to China 

When he found some islands at the end of his voyage he thought he had reached the East Indies when in fact he had landed on an island in the Bahamas That is why he named the people living there Indians In all he made four voyages to America Colombia is also named after him

There is disagreement on where Columbus came from Many people think that he was born in Genoa Experts have studied clues to Columbus birthplace but no final answer has been found

He was arrested in Santo Domingo on August 23 1500 and sent to Spain in chains in October 1500 Released December 12 1500 and summoned to court

Meat is animal tissue used as food Most often is used to describe skeletal muscle and fat that is found with it Types of meat include beef and veal from cattle pork ham and bacon from pigs mutton from sheep venison from deer and poultry from chickens ducks and turkeys The word meat is also used for sausages and for non muscle organs which are used for food for example liver brain and kidneys Eggs may also be included

In the meat processing industry the word meat is to mean only the flesh of mammalian species such as pigs cattle etc but does not include fish poultry and eggs 

Meat is an important part of the diet of many people because it contains protein Protein helps the growth and healing of a body and gives energy Meat is a high protein food but costs more than other foods like bread and vegetables People who cannot afford meat or who do not like to eat it need to find other ways to get enough protein in their diet Beans and certain nuts are also high in protein People that choose not to eat meat are called vegetarians and those who do not eat any animal product are known as vegans

Animals such as members of the cat family that mainly eat animals are called carnivores 

Red meat is darker coloured meat different from white meat or lighter coloured meat Some raw meat can make humans sick

Tuvalu is a small island country in the Pacific Ocean It used to be called Ellice Islands it was part of Gilbert and Ellice Islands It is a monarchy

Tuvalu is getting smaller If the sea level keeps rising at the same rate this country will be covered by water in about 50 years

The most important language spoken in Tuvalu is Tuvaluan although Nuian is spoken on the island of Nui

The United States and Tuvalu signed a treaty of friendship in 1979 when the USA gave up its claim to the islands of Funafuti Nukefetau Nukulaelae and Nurakita

Tuvalu is made up of 9 islands 

Tuvalu has four reef islands and five true atolls The atolls have only 26nbspkm land Tuvalu is the fourth smallest country in the world The land is very low lying and the coral atolls are narrow Funafuti is the largest atoll of the islands and atolls It has many islets around a central lagoon This is about 251 kilometres by 184 kilometres centred on 1797E and 830S A

The highest height is convert45m above sea level which gives Tuvalu the second lowest highest elevation of any country Because of this the islands that make up Tuvalu are threatened by any sea level rise If this happens the people will have to go to New Zealand Niue or the Fijian island of Kioa Tuvalu is also affected by what is known as a king tide which can raise the sea level higher than a normal high tide

Java is one of the islands of Indonesia The area is 132000 square km It is the worlds 13th largest island 124 million people live there The capital city of Indonesia Jakarta is in Java

James Watt was a Scottish mathematician and engineer He did not invent the first steam engine but he did modify it to work better There were other patented steam engines in use by the time Watt started his work on them His major contribution is in developing the modern form of the steam engine The Watt steam engine is credited for driving the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuriesJames Watt was a brilliant engineer and he also transformed the Newcomen engine

Today most people honor him by naming a unit of power the watt after him 

James Watt was born on 19 January 1736 in Greenock Renfrewshire a seaport on the Firth of Clyde His father was a shipwright ship owner and contractor and served as the towns chief baillie while his mother Agnes Muirhead came from a distinguished family and was well educated Both were Presbyterians and strong Covenanters Watts grandfather Thomas Watt was a taught mathematics and baillie to the Baron of Cartsburn Watt did not go to school every day At first he was mostly schooled at home by his mother but later he attended Greenock grammar school He exhibited great manual dexterity and an aptitude for mathematics although Latin and Greek failed to interest him and he absorbed the legends and lore of the Scottish people

Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni known as Michelangelo was an Italian Renaissance painter sculptor architect poet and engineer Along with Leonardo da Vinci he is often called a Renaissance man which means that he had great talent in many areas 

Michelangelo lived an extremely busy life creating a great number of artworks Some of Michelangelos works are among the most famous that have ever been made They include two very famous marble statues the Pieta in Saint Peters Basilica and David which once stood in a piazza in Florence but is now in the Accademia Gallery His most famous paintings are huge frescos the Sistine Chapel Ceiling and the Last Judgement His most famous work of architecture is the east end and dome of Saint Peters Basilica

A lot is known about Michelangelos life because he left many letters poems and journals Because he was so famous he became the very first artist to have his biography published while he was still living His biographer Giorgio Vasari said that he was the greatest artist of the Renaissance He was sometimes called Il Divino Other artists said that he had terribilit Many other artists who saw his work tried to have the same emotional quality From this idea of terribilit came a style of art called Mannerism

 Childhood  Michelangelo was born on 6 March 1475 in Caprese near Arezzo Tuscany His father was Lodovico di Leonardo di Buonarroti di Simoni and his mother was Francesca di Neri del Miniato di Siena The Buonarrottis were a banking family from Florence They claimed they were descended from the noble Countess Matilda of Canossa Michelangelos father had lost most of the banks money so he worked for the local government in the town of Chiusi When Michelangelo was a baby the family moved back to Florence Because he was sickly Michelangelo was sent to live on a small farm with a stonecutter and his wife and family The stonecutter worked at a marble quarry owned by Michelangelos father Many years later Michelangelo said that the two things that had helped him to be a good artist were being born in the gentle countryside of Arezzo and being raised in a house where along with his nurses milk he was given the training to use a chisel and hammer His mother died when he was only seven

Michelangelos father then brought him back to Florence and sent him to study with a tutor Francesco da Urbino Michelangelo was not interested in his school lessons He explored the great churches of the city and drew copies of the frescos that he saw there When he was thirteen he was apprenticed to the painter Domenico Ghirlandaio Ghirlandaio had a large busy studio He had wealthy patrons who worked for the Medici He painted frescos in their family chapels Michelangelo was able to learn the art of fresco painting very well from Ghirlandaio In a large workshop such as Ghirlandaios artists would have been working in all sorts of different media including sculpture metalwork and painting altarpieces Michelangelo would have learned about all these things When Michelangelo was only fourteen his father persuaded Ghirlandaio to pay his apprentice as an artist which was highly unusual at the time

The richest most powerful family in Florence were the Medici They had an academy where some of the most famous philosophers poets and artists met to share their ideas The Medici family were important patrons of the arts In 1489 Lorenzo de Medici the head of the family asked Ghirlandaio to send his two best pupils to the academy Michelangelo was one of the students chosen and he attended the academy from 1490 to 1492 He heard the teaching and discussion of Marsilio Ficino Pico della Mirandola and Angelo Poliziano The philosophy that they taught was called Humanism It was based on the philosophy of the ancient Greek Plato Michelangelos ideas and his art were influenced by these teachings 

Michelangelo and another young sculptor called Pietro Torrigiano studied sculpture under Bertoldo di Giovanni Michelangelo had an argument with Torrigiano who punched him on the nose so that it was badly broken and spoilt his appearance for the rest of his life Michelangelo sculpted some reliefs One was the Battle of the Centaurs which was made for Lorenzo de Medici

In 1492 Michelangelos patron Lorenzo de Medici died This brought about a big change in Michelangelos life He went back to live at his fathers house Michelangelo asked the prior at the Church of Santo Spirito to allow him to study the anatomy of the bodies of people who had died at the churchs hospital In 1493 as a thank you gift to the prior Michelangelo carved a large wooden Crucifix which still hangs in the church In January 1494 there were very heavy snowfalls Lorenzo de Medicis son Piero de Medici commissioned Michelangelo to make a snow statue So Michelangelo began to work for the Medici again 

In 1494 a new leader rose up in Florence He was a Dominican friar called Savonarola His strong preaching caused people to burn their books throw away their jewellery and chase the wealthy families out of the city The Medici had to go For Michelangelo it was a good time to travel He stayed for a while in Venice then moved to Bologna In Bologna he soon got work sculpting three figures for the big marble Shrine of Saint Dominic When things calmed down in Florence Michelangelo returned and worked for another member of the Medici family Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de Medici 

Michelangelo made a marble statue of Cupid asleep Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco told Michelangelo that it looked just like a real Ancient Roman statue and said that if he made it dirty and knocked a few chips off someone would pay a lot of money for it Lorenzo sold it to a Cardinal who discovered that it was a fraud He thought that Michelangelos work was so good that he told the pope about it The pope then invited Michelangelo to go to Rome and work for him 

Michelangelo arrived in Rome 25 June 1496 at the age of 21 He lived near the church of Santa Maria di Loreto on the Gianicolo hill 

In 1496 he got an important commission from Cardinal Raffaele Riario The Cardinal wanted Michelangelo to make a marble statue larger than life size of Bacchus the Ancient Roman God of wine Michelangelo worked hard at the statue He carved Bacchus as a young man who was quite drunk and looked as if he was staggering as he raised his cup to make a toast The cardinal did not like the drunken Bacchus and would not pay for it A banker called Jacopo Galli bought it for his garden

Michelangelos next important commission was from the French Ambassador who asked him to make a statue of the Virgin Mary mourning over the dead body of her son Jesus This type of artwork either a painting or a statue is called by the Italian name Pieta Michelangelos Pieta is the most famous Pieta that has ever been made It is now in Saint Peters Basilica and is visited by thousands of people every day Giorgio Vasari wrote It is a miracle that a shapeless block of stone could have been carved away to make something so perfect that even nature could hardly have made it better using real human flesh

In 1499 Michelangelo returned to Florence The priest Savonarola had made so many people angry that he had been put to death in 1498 Life in Florence started to return to normal Many years earlier the Guild of Woolworkers had commissioned some artists to make statues of the heroes of the city A sculptor called Agostino di Duccio had started carving a huge statue of David the hero of the Bible story of David and Goliath For 40 years the Guild of Woolworkers owned the huge block of marble with the statue hardly begun In 1501 they commissioned the young Michelangelo to carve it It took him three years to complete

Once again Michelangelo made a statue that became world famous The statue shows a young man naked in the way that statues of ancient gods were made just pausing for a moment and looking with fierce eyes at the huge soldier Goliath that he is about to kill The statue is 517 meter tall It was placed in the piazza outside the Palazzo Vecchio where the town council met After many years the statue was put into an art gallery the Accademia A copy now stands in the piazza People still struggles to see the statue that he made

In 1505 Michelangelo was invited to Rome by the newly elected Pope Julius II Pope Julius was an old man He wanted Michelangelo to design a grand tomb It was to stand inside a church and have many carved figures which were to include several slaves to hold up part of the tomb and Old Testament prophets to sit in niches Michelangelo started work He made a magnificent statue of Moses which is now in the Church of S Pietro in Vincoli in Rome Many people go to look at this statue The slaves were only partly carved Four of them are now in the Accademia in Florence The rest of the great plan was unfinished 

The main reason that Pope Julius tomb was not finished was that the Pope had an idea for another artwork The Sistine Chapel near St Peters Basilica had its walls painted by some famous artists from Florence The Pope decided that Michelangelo should paint the ceiling Michelangelo did not want to He said that he was not a painter But the Pope bullied Michelangelo until he agreed to do it He told the Pope that he would do it for God and that he would only do it if the Pope let him paint it in his own way 

The chapel was long and wide Its curved ceiling was held up by twelve fan shaped pieces of wall called pendentives Pope Julius told Michelangelo to paint one of the twelve apostles of Jesus on each pendentive Michelangelo started to do this Then he got a different idea and scraped off the work that he had done Instead of apostles he painted twelve prophets Seven of them were men from the Old Testament but the other five were women and did not come from the Bible They were five prophets from the Classical world Like the prophets in the Bible they had all told people about the birth of Jesus 

On the middle of the ceiling instead of painting a starry sky Michelangelo painted scenes from the Bible telling the story of Creation and the downfall of humanity The most famous scene is the picture of God creating Adam The ceiling was so famous that many artists tried to copy the way that Michelangelo had arranged and painted the figures

In 1513 Pope Julius II died The next pope was Pope Leo X a member of the Medici family He gave Michelangelo several jobs in Florence including designing a the Medici Chapel to hold the tombs of his family members Although not all the tombs were built Michelangelo finished seven large statues including a Madonna and Child His pupils later completed completed the chapel 

In 1527 the people of Florence became angry at the Medici for acting like princes That was not the right way for a family to act in a city that was a republic The people threw the Medici out but the Medici came back with an army and took over the city Michelangelo was so upset at the behaviour of the Medici that he left his beloved city and never went back 

Pope Clement VII called Michelangelo back to the Sistine Chapel to paint the wall behind the altar with a huge scene of The Last Judgement He worked on it from 1534 to 1541 At the centre it shows Jesus surrounded by saints sitting in judgement over the people of the Earth To the left people are rising from their graves and many are welcomed into Heaven To the right other people are being sent to Hell where they are dragged down by demons It is a huge painting with many figures in it 

Like Adam and Eve on the ceiling all the figures were shown naked Some of the cardinals in the church said that it was wicked to paint saints including the Virgin Mary with no clothes on They called Michelangelo the painter of rude bits There was a long argument about this because some people said that God had created everyone naked so clothes would not be needed in Heaven After Michelangelos death another artist Daniele da Volterra was called in to paint drapes on the figures For the rest of his life he was known as the painter of pants

In 1546 when Michelangelo was his seventies he was given one of his most important jobs The old St Peters Basilica had been partly demolished and a new one designed by Bramante But many architects had worked on it and it was still just at the beginning stages Michelangelo was made the architect He immediately improved the plan had important parts made much stronger and designed a huge dome taller than any other dome in the world He died before it was completed but he left drawings and models so that the next architect Giacomo della Porta could finish what he had started The dome of St Peters Basilica still stands as one of the greatest monuments of Christianity and as a symbol of the city of Rome 

When Michelangelo died his body was taken back to Florence and buried in the Basilica of Santa Croce On his tomb sit three mourning figures who symbolize Architecture Painting and Sculpture

Leonardo Da Vinci was an Italian Renaissance genius He was good at many things but was most famous as a painter He was also a scientist a mathematician an engineer an inventor an anatomist a sculptor an architect a botanist a musician and writer Leonardo was curious about everything in nature He wanted to know how everything worked He was very good at studying designing and making all sorts of interesting things 

Many people think that Leonardo was one of the greatest painters of all time Many people think that he was the most talented person ever to have lived The art historian Helen Gardner said that no one has ever been quite like him because he was interested in so many things that he seems to have had the mind of a giant and yet what he was like as a person is still a mystery 

Leonardo was born at Vinci which is a small town near Florence in Italy He was trained to be an artist by the sculptor and painter Verrocchio He spent most of his life working for rich Italian noblemen In his last years he lived in a beautiful home given to him by the King of France 

Leonardo could do all sorts of clever things but he was most famous as a painter Two of his pictures are among the best known paintings in the world the Mona Lisa and the Last Supper He did many drawings The best known drawing is the Vitruvian Man It is so well known that even Homer Simpson and Garfield have been drawn in a square and a circle to look like the drawing Leonardo was always thinking of new inventions Most of his inventions were never made However we know his ideas because he kept notebooks and wrote and drew in them very often Some of the ideas that he thought of were a helicopter a tank a calculator a robot and solar power

Leonardo was born on 18 April 1452 in the Tuscan hill town of Vinci in the valley of the Arno River His grandfather Ser Antonio wrote down the details of the birth Leonardos parents were not married His father was a lawyer Messer Piero Fruosino di Antonio da Vinci His mother Caterina was a servant She may have been a slave from the Middle East Leonardos full name was Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci which means Leonardo the son of Messer Piero from Vinci 

Leonardo spent his first five years living in a farm house with his mother Then he lived at Vinci with his father his fathers wife Albiera his grandparents and uncle Francesco When Leonardo grew up he only wrote down two things about his childhood He remembered that when he was lying outside in his cradle a large bird flew from the sky and hovered over him Its tail feathers brushed his face Leonardos other important memory was how he found a cave while exploring in the mountains He was terrified that some great monster might be hiding there But he was also very excited and curious to find out what was inside 

Leonardo started painting while he was still a boy Giorgio Vasari wrote about Leonardos life shortly after his death He tells many interesting stories about how clever Leonardo was He says that Leonardo painted a round wooden shield with a picture of snakes spitting fire Messer Piero took his sons painting to Florence and sold it to an art dealer

In 1466 when Leonardo was fourteen his father took him to Florence to be an apprentice to the artist Verrocchio 

Florence was a very exciting place for a young person who wanted to be an artist Many famous artists had lived in Florence starting with Cimabue and Giotto in the 1200s Everywhere a person looked there were famous and beautiful artworks The huge cathedral had an enormous new dome The church of St John had doors that gleamed with gold and were said to be the most beautiful doors in the world Another church had statues all around it by the most famous sculptors including one by Leonardos teacher Verrocchio 

If an artist was lucky they would find a rich patron who would buy lots of their paintings The richest family in Florence were the Medici They had built themselves the finest palace in Florence and liked buying paintings statues and other beautiful things They were also interested in the study of literature and philosophy Many young artists hope to get work from the Medici and their friends

Verrocchio had a big workshop that was one of the busiest in Florence Leonardo was learning to be an artist so he had to learn drawing painting sculpting and model making While he was at the workshop he was able to learn all sorts of other useful skills chemistry metallurgy metal working plaster casting leather working mechanics and carpentry 

Leonardo was not the only young painter at Verrocchios workshop Many other painters were trained there or often visited Some of them later became famous Ghirlandaio Perugino and Botticelli These artists were all just a few years older than Leonardo 

Vasari tells an interesting story from this time of Leonardos life Verrocchio was painting a large picture of the Baptism of Christ He gave Leonardo the job of painting one of the angels holding Jesus robe on the left side of the picture Vasari said that Leonardo painted the angel so beautifully that Verrocchio put down his brush and never painted again When the painting is examined closely it is possible to see that many other parts of the picture such as the rocks the brown stream and the background may have been painted by Leonardo as well Verrocchio made a bronze statue of David at this time It is believed that he used Leonardo as his model 

In about 1472 when he was twenty Leonardo joined the Guild of St Luke an organisation of artists and doctors of medicine Even after his father set him up in his own workshop Leonardo still enjoyed working at Verrocchios workshop Leonardos earliest known work is a drawing in pen and ink of the Arno River valley It has the date 5 August 1473 It is now in the Uffizi Gallery  

When Vasari writes about Leonardo he uses words like noble generous graceful and beautiful Vasari tells us that as an adult Leonardo was a tall handsome man He was so strong that he could bend horseshoes with his bare hands His voice was so beautiful that it charmed everyone that heard it Almost everyone wanted to be his friend He loved animals was a vegetarian and would buy birds at the market and set them free 

Very little is known about Leonardos life and work between 1472 and 1481 He was probably busy in Florence In 1478 he had an important commission to paint an altarpiece for the Monks of San Donato a Scopeto The painting was to be the Adoration of the Magi The painting was never finished because Leonardo was sent away to Milan

Leonardo was a very talented musician In 1482 he made a silver lyre in the shape of a horses head At that time there was a new ruler in the city of Milan in the north of Italy Duke Ludovico il Moro was making other rulers nervous Lorenzo Medici sent Leonardo to Milan as an ambassador Lorenzo de Medici wanted Leonardo to give Ludovico the lyre as a present from him Leonardo wrote a letter to the Duke of Milan telling him about all the clever and useful things that he could do like making war machines He wrote in the letter that he could also paint Leonardo did not know at the time that it was for painting that he would be mostly remembered Leonardo stayed in Milan and worked for the Duke between 1482 and 1499 Part of his work was to design festivals and carnival processions In Leonardos note books are drawings of theatre costumes amazing helmets and scenes that might be for the theatre 

Leonardo like most other well known artists of his time had servants young students and older assistants in his workshop One of his young students was a boy whose name was Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno He was a handsome boy with beautiful long golden curls He looked perfect as a artists model for an angel But he was such a difficult and dishonest boy that Leonardo called him Salai or Salaino which means the little devil Leonardo wrote in his notebook that Salai was very greedy that he was a liar and that he had stolen things from the house at least five times Salai stayed in Leonardos household for thirty years as a pupil and a servant 

Leonardos most important work for Duke Ludovico was to make a huge statue of the previous ruler Francesco Sforza on horseback He started with the horse After studying horses and drawing designs he made a huge horse of clay It was called the Gran Cavallo It was going to be cast in bronze It was going to be the biggest bronze horse that had been made for more than a thousand years Unfortunately the bronze horse was never made In 1494 Ludovico gave the bronze to be made into cannons because the French army was invading Milan The huge clay horse was still standing when the French army invaded again in 1499 This time it was used for target practice and was completely destroyed

While Leonardo was working for Duke Ludovico he had two important painting commissions One was to do an oil painting to go in a big altarpiece for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception Leonardo did the painting twice He left one with the monks in Milan and took the other painting to France where it is now in the Louvre Museum The paintings are both called the Virgin of the Rocks They show a scene of the Virgin Mary and the child Jesus in a rocky mysterious landscape Mary and Jesus are meeting with John the Baptist There is a story about how the baby John and the baby Jesus met on the road to Egypt In this scene John is praying and the baby Jesus raises his hand to bless John The paintings have a strange eerie light with soft deep shadows In the background is a lake and mountains in the mist No painting like this had ever been done before

Leonardos other important painting in Milan is even more famous It is the Last Supper The painting shows the last meal shared by Jesus with his disciples before his capture and death Leonardo chose to paint the moment when Jesus has said one of you will betray me Leonardo tells the story of the surprise and upset that this caused to the twelve followers of Jesus He tells the story through the actions and faces of the people in the painting Some of them are talking some of them have stood up some are raising their hands in horror 

The novelist Matteo Bandello saw Leonardo at work Bandello wrote that on some days he would paint from morning till night without stopping to eat Then for three or four days he would not paint at all He would often just stand and look at the painting Vasari said that the prior of the convent was very annoyed He asked Ludovico to tell Leonardo to work faster Vasari said that Leonardo was worried because he did not think that he could paint the face of Jesus well enough Leonardo told the Duke that he might use the face of the prior as his model for Judas the traitor

When it was finished everyone that saw it said that the painting was a masterpiece But Leonardo had not used proper fresco for the painting He had used tempera over gesso which is not usually used for wall painting Soon the painting started to grow mold and flake off the wall In a hundred years it was completely ruined Even though in some places the paint has fallen right off the wall the painting is so popular that it is printed and copied more that any other religious painting in the world

In 1499 Ludovico il Moro was overthrown Leonardo left Milan with his servant Salai and a friend Luca Pacioli who was a mathematician They went to Venice Leonardo worked as a military architect and engineer Because Venice is a city on many islands Leonardo tried to think of ways to defend the city from a naval attack 

In 1500 Leonardo went back to Florence taking his household of servants and apprentices with him The monks from the monastery of The Holy Annunciation gave Leonardo a home and a large workshop In 2005 some buildings which were used by the Department of Military Geography were being restored The restorers discovered that part of the building was Leonardos studio

Leonardo started work on a new painting He drew a large cartoon The cartoon showed the Virgin Mary sitting on the knee of her mother St Anne Mary holds the baby Jesus in her arms Jesus stretches out his hands to his young cousin John the Baptist Vasari says that everyone was so amazed by the beautiful drawing that men and women young and old came in large groups to see it as if they were attending a great festival The drawing is now in the National Gallery London Even though it is old and faded and is kept in a dark room people go to the gallery to sit in front of it every day Like many of Leonardos projects the painting was never done

In 1502 and 1503 Leonardo worked for a powerful noble called Cesare Borgia who was the son of Pope Alexander VI He travelled around Italy with Borgia as a military architect and engineer Late in 1503 Leonardo returned to Florence He rejoined the Guild of St Luke He was given a very important commission The Signoria of the City of Florence wanted two large frescos painted on the walls of the most important room of the Signoria Palace They chose the two most famous painters Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo Michelangelo was to paint the Battle of Cascina

Leonardo began the project by studying and drawing the faces of angry men and fighting horses These drawings can still be seen in his notebooks But unfortunately this was to be another failure for Leonardo When he painted the picture on the wall instead of using fresco he mixed the paints with oil The paint would not dry Leonardo lit some fires to dry it and the painting melted We have some idea what the painting was like because Peter Paul Rubens drew a copy of the middle part After a time the town council covered it up and got somebody else to paint the wall Michelangelo did not finish his painting either because the Pope called him to Rome

While Leonardo was working at his studio in Florence he painted the most famous portrait that has ever been painted the Mona Lisa The Mona Lisa took from 1503 to 1519 It is a small picture painted in oil paint on a wooden panel It shows the face upper body and hands of a woman She is very plainly dressed For a portrait a woman would usually put on her best clothes and jewellery Mona Lisa has a dark dress and a fine black veil over her head Leonardo often left symbols in his paintings that give clues about the person The unusual thing about this picture is the smile The smile is the clue to her name Mona Lisa Giacondo Giacondo means the joking one

The reason why the painting is so famous is that it seems to be full of mystery Mona Lisas eyes look out at the viewer But no one can guess what she is thinking Her eyes and her mouth seem to be smiling This is very unusual in a portrait painting Most people in portraits look very serious It is hard to tell what Mona Lisas exact expression is When a person wants to read another persons feelings they look at the corners of their mouth and eyes But Leonardo has painted soft shadows in the corners of Mona Lisas mouth and eyes to disguise her expression The soft shadows are also found on the sides of her face her neck and hands The way that Leonardo uses shadow is called sfumato Vasari said that the picture was so beautifully painted that every other artist who looked at it thought that they could never paint so well

In 1506 Leonardo went back to Milan with his pupils and lived in his own house in Porta Orientale Some of the pupils became painters Bernardino Luini Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio and Marco DOggione DOggione made several copies of the Last Supper Luini made a copy of the Virgin of the Rocks Boltraffio painted many Madonna and Child pictures which can still be seen in art galleries and churches One of pupils was a young nobleman called Count Francesco Melzi Melzi never became a very good painter but he loved Leonardo and stayed with him until the day he died 

In September 1513 Leonardo went to Rome and lived there until 1516 He lived in the Vatican The three greatest painters of the High Renaissance Leonardo Michelangelo and Raphael were all working in Rome at the same time Even though their names are often said together as if they were friends they were not Leonardo at this time was in his sixties Michelangelo was middle aged He was not friendly to either Leonardo or Raphael Raphael was a very clever young painter who learnt a lot by looking at the pictures painted by Leonardo and Michelangelo But neither of them was ever his teacher 

In October 1515 King Francis I of France captured Milan On December 19 there was a meeting of Francis I and Pope Leo X in Bologna Leonardo went to the meeting with Pope Leo Leonardo made an amazing toy to entertain King Francis It was a life sized mechanical lion that could walk It had doors in its chest which opened and a bunch of lilies came out Lilies were the royal symbol of the French Kings

In 1516 Francis I invited Leonardo to go to France with him He gave Leonardo a beautiful house called Clos Luc It is near the kings palace Chateau Amboise Leonardo spent the last three years of his life at Clos Luc with his faithful friend and apprentice Count Melzi The king gave Leonardo a pension of 10000 scudi One of the last paintings that Leonardo did was a picture of John the Baptist His model was Salai with his beautiful long curling hair 

When Leonardo was dying he asked for a priest to come so that he could make his confession and receive Holy Communion Leonardo died at Clos Luc on May 2 1519 King Francis had become a close friend Vasari says that the King held Leonardos head in his arms as he died In his will he asked that sixty beggars should follow his casket in procession He was buried in the Chapel of the Chateau Amboise 

Leonardo had never married and had no children of his own In his will he left his money his books and most of his paintings to Count Melzi Leonardo also remembered his other pupil Salai and his servant Battista di Vilussis who each received half of Leonardos vineyards near Milan Leonardos left to his serving woman a black cloak with a fur edge Salai was the owner of Leonardos most famous oil painting the Mona Lisa He still owned it a few years later when he died after fighting in a duel

King Francis said There had never been another man born in the world who knew as much as Leonardo not so much about painting sculpture and architecture as that he was a very great philosopher

Leonardo did not paint very many pictures But he drew hundreds of quick sketches plans maps and detailed drawings This is the way that he recorded all the interesting things that he saw studied and thought about 

Some of Leonardos drawings are studies for paintings In these drawings Leonardo planned the things he was going to paint Some studies are plans for whole paintings One of these paintings is the large beautiful drawing of the Madonna and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist that is now in the National Gallery London

Many of the studies show details that Leonardo wanted to get just right One study shows a very detailed perspective drawing of the ruined buildings in the background of the painting of the Magi Other studies show hands faces drapery plants horses and babies The earliest drawing by Leonardo that has a date on it is a Landscape of the Arno Valley 1473 which shows the river the mountains Montelupo Castle and the farmlands beyond it in great detail

Leonardo studied things all his life He did not go to university to study He studied by looking at things in the world around him He looked at things to see how they were made and how they worked He drew the things that he saw and the discoveries that he made into his notebooks and made notes about them Many of his notebooks are now in museums There are 13000 pages of notes and drawings Many of these are scientific studies 

Leonardos notebooks are hard to read because he wrote backwards in mirror writing Some people think that perhaps he was trying to keep his work secret This is not true Leonardo wrote with his left hand In those days pens were made from a quill that was cut with a pen knife on the end It is hard for a left handed person to write with a quill in the ordinary way but quite easy to write backwards 

It is likely that Leonardo planned to publish the studies in his notebooks He organized many pages carefully with one study taking up the front and back of each page There is a page with drawings and writing about the human heart and a page about the womb and the fetus One page shows drawings of the muscles of a shoulder and another page shows how an arm works 

The notebooks were not published in Leonardos lifetime After he died they were divided between different people who had known him They are nearly all in museums or libraries such as Windsor Castle the Louvre and the British Library The Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan has the twelve volume Codex Atlanticus

Some of the things that Leonardo studied are 

Many of the drawings and notes in Leonardos notebooks are designs plans and inventions

Platinum is a soft heavy white metal It is a precious metal and not a common metal It usually costs more than gold

In chemistry platinum is element number 78 It has an atomic weight of 195 amu The symbol for platinum is Pt from Spanish platina meaning little silver

Platinum is very malleable and ductile which means it can be hammered into thin sheets and it can be pulled into wire Platinum is very stable Acids do not affect platinum In the nineties lots and lots of urban people began wearing platinum as opposed to gold White gold never became popular amongst Americas urban population thus Platinum originated the whole bling bling revolution

The most common use of Platinum is in a vehicle catalytic converter

Sorted by name initial letter means Igneous Sedimentary or Metamorphic rocks

This is a list of minerals 

Minerals are substances that are formed naturally in the Earth 

Minerals are usually solid inorganic have a crystal structure and happen naturally by geological processes 

The study of minerals is called mineralogy

A mineral can be made of single chemical element or more usually a compound There are over 4000 types of known minerals Two common minerals are quartz and feldspar

A mineral is a substance that usually

One recent definition is

Alternatively a mineral is one listed as such by the International Mineralogical Association

Minerals are different from rocks A mineral is a chemical compound with a given composition and a defined crystal structure A rock is a mixture of one or several minerals in varying proportions

A rock has only two of the characteristics minerals haveit is a solid and it forms naturally A rock usually contains two or more types of minerals Two samples of the same type of rock may have different kinds of minerals in them Minerals are always made up of the same materials in nearly the same proportions A ruby is a mineral Therefore a ruby found in India has similar makeup as a ruby found in Australia

Minerals are formed by natural processes A few substances with the same chemical composition as minerals can be produced by living creatures as part of their shells or bones The shells of molluscs are composed of either calcite or aragonite or both

Traditionally chemicals produced by living things are not considered minerals However it is difficult to see why an organic substance should not be called a mineral if its chemical nature and its crystalline structure is identical with its inorganic twin This issue is now under debate see Railsback part II

Minerals form in many ways The mineral halite which is used as table salt forms when water evaporates in a hot shallow part of the ocean leaving behind the salt it contained Many types of minerals are made when molten rock or magma cools and turns into a solid Talc a mineral that can be used to make baby powder forms deep in Earth as high pressure and temperature causes changes in solid rock

A mineral is a solidthat is it has a definite volume and a rough shape Volume refers to the amount of space an object takes up For example a golf ball has a smaller volume than a baseball and a baseball has a smaller volume than a basketball

A substance that is a liquid or a gas is not a mineral However in some cases its solid form is a mineral For instance liquid water is not a mineral but ice is

These properties are used most often

The particles of ice that make up frost have smooth flat surfaces These flat surfaces form because of the arrangement of atoms in the ice which is a mineral Such an internal arrangement is a characteristic of minerals It is the structure of a crystal a solid in which the atoms are arranged in an orderly repeating three dimensional pattern 

Each mineral has its own type of crystal structure In some cases two minerals have the same chemical composition but different crystal structures For example both diamond and graphite consist of just one elementcarbon But the arrangements of the carbon atoms in these two minerals are not the same so they have different crystal structures and very different properties Diamonds are extremely hard and have a brilliant sparkle Graphite is soft gray and dull 

In nature a perfect crystal is rare Most crystals have imperfect shapes because their growth was limited by other crystals forming next to them

Each mineral has a definite chemical makeup it consists of a specific combination of atoms of certain elements An element is a substance that contains only one type of atom

Scientists can classify minerals into groups on the basis of their chemical makeup Though there are thousands of different minerals only about 30 are common in Earths crust These 30 minerals make up most rocks in the crust For that reason they are called rock forming minerals 

The most common group is the silicates All the minerals in this group contain oxygen and siliconthe two most common elements in Earths crustjoined together They may include other elements such as aluminium magnesium iron and calcium Quartz feldspar and mica are common silicates

The second most common group of rock forming minerals is the carbonates All the minerals in this group contain carbon and oxygen joined together Calcite which is common in seashells is a carbonate mineral There are many other mineral groups The mineral group known as oxides contains the minerals from which most metals such as tin and copper are refined An oxide consists of an element usually a metal joined to oxygen This group includes haematite a source of iron

These contain the sulphate group SO4 Sulphates commonly form in evaporites where highly salty waters slowly evaporate allowing sulfates and halides to precipitate where the water evaporates Sulphates also occur where hot waters are forced through the rock as with geysers

People use minerals for many everyday purposes Every time people turn on a microwave oven or a TV minerals are being used The copper in the wires that carry electricity to the object is a mineral Table salt or halite is another mineral that people use in their everyday life 

Craft is about making things with ones own hands and skills The different types of crafts can be put in groups according to the material being used In the Middle Ages the most common materials were metal wood or clay

A craftsman is a person who has the knowledge and skills of a craft When they have a lot of experience they may be called a master craftsman If they are young people learning a craft they are called an apprentice

Kim Jong il birth name Yuri Irsenovich Kim was the Supreme Leader of Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea from the time of his fathers death in 1994 until his own death in 2011 He was the son of Kim Il Sng Official North Korean propaganda says he was born on Mount Paektu however most historians think that he was born near Chabarowsk in the Soviet Union Inside North Korea it was the law that no one could try to replace him as leader of the country He was sometimes referred to as the Dear Leader but this was not an official title His official title was Chairman of the National Defense Commission of North Korea Supreme Commander of the Korean Peoples Army and General Secretary of the Workers Party of Korea Many people in North Korea were imprisoned or killed for speaking out against the Kim regime Almost everyone in North Korea wore a small pin with a picture of Kim Jng Il or Kim Il Sng on it

The North Korean government told people of his death through the state media on December 19 2011 It was said that he had died two days earlier of physical and mental over work

Kim was a Stalinist He believed in the North Korean Communist philosophy of Juche He was afraid to travel on aeroplanes and traveled only on trains He was well known for his love of movies and luxury goods especially caviar and Hennessey brand cognac even though North Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world Former United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright once gave Kim a present of a basketball signed by Michael Jordan when he visited North Korea because Kim is a fan of the National Basketball Association and of Michael Jordan

Silver is a chemical element In chemistry silver is element 47 a transition metal It has an atomic weight of 10786 amu Its symbol is Ag from the Latin word for silver argentum

Silver is a soft metal It is also a precious metal When it is used in money or in jewellery it is often mixed with gold or some other metal to make it harder It is bluish white It reflects light very well It is a very good conductor of electricity It is considered a precious metal Silver is very malleable and ductile which means it can be pulled into wire or hammered into thin sheets Silver is one of the only words in the English language that does not rhyme with any other word Silver coins and bars can be bought and sold at coin shops around the world

It is not reactive It does not dissolve in most acids Nitric acid dissolves it though to make silver nitrate It does react with strong oxidizing agents like potassium dichromate or potassium permanganate It does not corrode easily It only corrodes when there is hydrogen sulfide in the air Then it forms a black coating known as tarnish 

Silver exists in the 1 oxidation state as an ion in compounds such as silver oxide A few compounds exist in the 2 oxidation state but they are very strong oxidizing agents Silver compounds can be gray black brown or white Silver compounds are disinfectants

Silver can be found as a metal Silver can be found with copper lead or gold in rocks The rocks are found mostly in Canada Mexico Peru and the United States Peru produces the most silver Silver is also in chemical compounds Acanthite is a silver ore that is a silver compound

Silver is extracted from the earth in several ways It is normally gotten from electrolysis

Silver has been used for many thousands of years by people all over the world for jewellery as money and many other things It is called a white metal even though it looks grey The word silver is also used to talk about this colour or shade of grey Silver is also used for utensils It may be used to fill teeth in dentistry as an amalgam Silver is used as a catalyst 

Silver compounds are disinfectants It can kill bacteria and has other useful properties It is used in the silver oxide battery They are also used in photographic film They can also be used to reduce odors in clothes Some silver compounds are used in creams that help burns heal 

Silver has been around for thousands of years It was normally considered second to gold in value Romans used silver as money The symbol Ag is from the Latin name for silver argentum Silver was also used to prevent infections and decay

Silver is not a large danger to humans Silver compounds are toxic They make the skin turn blue Some can be carcinogens Colloidal silver a common homeopathic remedy is not toxic in normal amounts but it does not do much

Silver because is depleting is actually more valuable than gold The silver saved up in the world is running out very quickly because more of it has been used each year than the amount mined in each year since 1990 Companies that use silver have benefitted from speculators who sell promises to deliver silver that does not exist keeping prices artificially low This is called naked short selling The amount owed is more than all the silver in the world The price of silver could go very high when the stored silver runs out and investors start asking for their metal back instead of taking more IOUs

Silver is 18 US dollars per troy ounce as of June 2010

Silver increased to 28 US dollars per troy ounce as of December 2010

This article is about Popes in general For the current Pope see Pope Benedict XVI

The Pope is the head of Catholic Church The current Pope is Benedict XVI he was born in Germany The previous Pope John Paul II died on April 2 2005 at 9152115 vatican time

Popes are elected by under 80 Cardinals of the Catholic Church Once they are elected they hold the position until they die or resign Usually they do not resign though the last pope who resigned was Pope Gregory XII in 1415 because of political pressure After a Pope is elected the pope chooses a different name Everyone is told the new name when the Habemus Papam is read out The current pope was called Joseph Ratzinger before he became a pope

In the Middle Ages the Pope had a lot of political power This is no longer the case

The name Pope comes from the Greek word pappas meaning father Catholics believe that when making statements ex cathedra that is official statements teaching about faith and morals the Pope is infallible  which means God will not allow his followers to be misled by allowing their leader to make a wrong statement Only two of any Popes statements have been ex cathedra 

The Pope is also the head of state of the Vatican City a tiny country in the city of Rome Italy whose only purpose is to run the Roman Catholic Church Popes today travel to many countries around the world preaching The Pope is the only person in the world who is the leader of a political state and a religion at the same time

The Pope wears a big hat called a mitre and holds a staff called a crosier

Some recent Popes and the time they were Pope

During parts of the Middle Ages the French kings had a lot of influence in Europe For this reason seven popes lived in Avignon rather than Rome This was from 1309 to 1377 During that time the popes were known for their greed and corruption These popes were allies of France the enemies of France were also their enemies

The Bishops of Rome who lived in Avignon were

Two antipopes were based in Avignon as well

Antipopes were people that were elected by small groups because they did not like the official choice Catherine of Siena could convince pope Gregory XI to move back to Rome Unfortunately he died shortly after moving The cardinals then elected Urban VI to be the next pope The French cardinals did not recognise this election as legitimate They declared the papal see as vacant which led to the Western Schism The Shism lasted until the Council of Constance in 1417 During this time there was a pope in Rome an Antipope in Avignon and for some time a second antipope Each of the three was recognised as legitimate pope by different European powers This led to a big split in the church as a whole The council elected Pope Martin V as a new pope recognised by all parties

The San Andreas Fault is a dextral strike slip fault It marks the boundary between the North American Plate on the east and the Pacific Plate on the west The fault was the cause of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake It first appeared about 20 million years ago 

The San Andreas Fault is composed of a zone several miles wide which incorporates multiple strands The main active strand currently runs on and off shore between Cape Mendocino and the Sea of Cortez From Cape Mendocino it runs offshore to Tomales Bay Then it goes southward through Bolinas Lagoon just west of the San Francisco Peninsula to come onshore again at Daly City through the hills of the Peninsula Crystal Springs reservoir is formed by the fault itself 

In the Santa Cruz mountains it bends slightly eastward This is the site of the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake The fault continues south through the historic mission at San Juan Bautista and through the town of Hollister The Transverse Ranges north of Santa Barbara are formed by compression Strands of the fault snake under the Los Angeles Basin From there it connects into the active spreading under the Sea of Cortez

The San Andreas fault was discovered by Andrew Lawson in 1895 who famously climbed into the faulted serpentinite well where the south tower of the Golden Gate Bridge was being poured In spite of the extreme deformation of the serpentinite Lawson declared the bridge perfectly safe The events of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake would seem to support his conclusion the ruptured strand was not the one he observed in the footprint of the bridge

In astronomy voids are the empty spaces between filaments Both filaments and Voids are one of the largest scale structures in the Universe There are no or few galaxies in voids Most voids have a diameter of 11 to 150 Mpc Especially large voids are the empty spaces without many superclusters These voids are sometimes called supervoids

A 1994 official counting lists a total of 27 supervoids with a distance of up to 740 Mpc Some of supervoids chosen from the list are given below

A computer mouse is used to tell a computer what to do including moving the cursor and choosing things on the screen 

It got its name because the wire coming out of the end of the first computer mice reminded people of the tail of a real mouse Many mice today are wireless and use batteries

When Silicon Valley was being reclaimed in California Douglas Engelbart a researcher of Stanford institute wanted to find a way to make using computers easier In those days using a computer was very hard because they were large machines Everything had to be typed in by hand and there was no way to alter things if you made a mistake 

After studying and designing for a long time Engelbart succeeded in inventing an input device which he named XY index 

At first it needed two hands to use but it was changed so that only one hand was needed to use it This is the mouse that we use today 

The mouse was used with Macintosh of Apple Inc when it came out in 1984 Microsoft Windows also used the mouse when it came out so over time computer mice became used with many computers

On most computers the user can move the mouse to move the cursor in the same direction If there is something on the screen that the user wants to choose he can move the cursor over it and click the mouse button The right mouse button is used to open menus that are different depending on where the cursor is The other mouse buttons can do different things depending on the software A mouse can have 1 to 6 buttons to click but most mice have two or three Most mice also have a scroll wheel  a small wheel found between the two main mouse buttons The user can move the wheel up or down to scroll through things like a website or folder which means to move it up or down on the screen or he or she can click the wheel down like another button

Metallurgy is the study of metals Alloys are also studied People who study metals are called metallurgists

The rocks are made of a metal with oxygen called an oxide Separating the oxygen off the metal is called smelting This is done with chemistry or electricity It happens often in very high temperature This is the first step in metallurgy A rock containing enough metal to be profitable is called ore

Iron is smelted from iron ore in large reactors called blast furnaces A blast furnace is a tall vertical structure which is fed with coke iron ore and limestone When hot air is blown in the blast furnace the coke will burn and reduce the oxygen off the ore producing bare iron and carbon dioxide The limestone will bind off any remaining bedrock The iron melts in the hot temperature and is tapped off in liquid phase at the bottom It is then worked into steel The limestone and bedrock form a compound called slag It can be used for making bricks concrete or road topping

Aluminum is smelted in electric ovens called electric arc furnaces The aluminum ore is poured on the bottom of the furnace and electric current is led through the ore The temperature rises so high that the oxygen separates leaving metallic aluminum

Copper is poured on naked flame which burns off sulfur and other impurities leaving raw copper The copper is then electrolyzed in big pools which contain water solution called electrolyte An electric current is led in the pool and all copper will gather on the electrode called cathode

Another part of metallurgy is making parts from metals These parts must be made so they will not break when they are used Metallurgists work to make the metal good when they are used Sometimes the metal must be strong Other times it must be tough The metallurgist must follow directions when making the part to know what metal to use Steel has a low cost but rusts Choosing a good metal is sometimes hard

A metal starts as a block called an ingot Metallurgists must know how to make a metal part from an ingot Parts are made from ingots different ways When a big hammer is used it is called forging To make thin metals a metal is put between two rolls and moved called rolling

When a metal part is made hot the metal moves farther than when it is cold Most metal parts are made hot to make moving metal easier This is hot work

Two metal parts can be put together with much heat This is called welding Iron is easy to weld

Metallurgists use many tools to know what to do to the metal The most useful is the microscope The microscope gives much information about the way the metal moves Metals are sometimes pulled until they break This is the tension test Some useful information can be gotten from this test

A fixed wing aircraft more often called an aeroplane or airplane is a kind of aircraft An aircraft is a machine that can fly but is heavier than air Fixed wing aircraft are sometimes called just planes All fixed wing aircraft have wings Gliders are fixed wing aircraft that do not have engines 

A steam powered unmanned fixed wing aircraft that weighed 9 lbs was built by John Stringfellow in Chard Somerset England in 1848 It could fly by itself without needing to be dropped from high up There were gliders before this but they had to fly by being pushed off a building or hill

The first man who flew a motor powered fixed wing aircraft was Orville Wright in 1903 in Kitty Hawk North Carolina USA

Today fixed wing aircraft fly between many cities all over the world bringing people and cargo Big cities usually have an international airport which is the place where fixed wing aircraft can land and take off safely Some large cities like New York City and London have more than one airport Two large makers of fixed wing aircraft are Airbus and Boeing

Advances in technology have made fixed wing aircraft more efficient in recent years Things like winglets and more efficient turbofans have helped to do this

The first aircraft for war bombing was used in Libya in 1911 by Italy against the Ottoman Empire Some fixed wing aircraft are used by air forces to defend countries These fixed wing aircraft may use guns or missiles for combat with other aircraft or they may drop bombs on ground targets

Fixed wing aircraft allow people to travel longer distances and faster than ships or trains Aircraft can fly from New York to London in about 7 hours It would take one week or more on a ship

Airplanes are also used by the military to see many things on the ground easily This is called surveillance or reconnaissance Often fixed wing aircraft will take photographs as well which can be used for military planning later

Fixed wing aircraft have long been used for moving people from place to place for things like holidays

Sometimes people are scared to fly They may think that the plane could crash or hijacked by terrorists However statistics show that riding in a plane is safer than driving in a car The September 11 2001 attacks helped spread this fear of flying

An aircraft is a flying machine There are many different kinds of aircraft

Some aircraft keep in the sky by moving air over their wings Examples are aeroplanes helicopters and gliders Some aircraft keep in the sky by floating Examples are balloons and airships

Most aircraft use engine power Examples are aeroplanes helicopters and airships A few aircraft use no power Examples are gliders and balloons A few aircraft use muscle power

Big aeroplanes for transporting people are called airliners Airliners fly at more than 850 kmh Less than 100 years ago the quickest ships needed more than seven days to travel across the Atlantic Ocean because it is 4800 km wide Now airliners need less than seven hours to travel across the Atlantic Ocean Airliners are the quickest way to travel Airliners can fly over mountains and bad weather Airliners have complex technology to make them fly quickly safely and for less money 

Fighting aircraft fly at 3200 kmh 

The person who drives an aircraft is called the pilot

Victoria is the capital city of the province of British Columbia Canada It is named after Queen Victoria

Over 350000 people live in the Victoria area Many people work for the government or in tourism It is warmer than other Canadian cities in the winter so many Canadians move there when they retire

The Suez Canal is a canal in Egypt It lies west of the Sinai Peninsula The canal is 163 km long and at its narrowest point 300 m wide It runs between Port Said on the Mediterranean Sea and Suez on the Red Sea It was built by a French company The canal was started in 1859 and finished in 1869

The canal allows boatsships to travel from Europe to Asia without having to go the way around Africa It was built to go from Egypt to the Indian Ocean

The canal consists of two parts north and south of the Great Bitter Lake

The Suez Canal was first built over 2000 years ago

In 1859 the Suez Canal was built again by the Universal Suez Ship Canal Company and took 10 years to build The first ship to pass through the canal did so on 17 February 1867 Giuseppe Verdi wrote the famous opera Aida for this ceremony 

The canal made it possible to easily transport goods across the world The canal also allowed Europeans to travel to East Africa and this area was soon controlled by European powers

The success of the Suez Canal encouraged the French to try to build the Panama Canal But they did not finish it The Panama Canal was finished later

After the Six Day War in 1967 the canal remained closed until June 5 1975 A UN peacekeeping force has been stationed in the Sinai Peninsula since 1974 to avoid more wars

About 15000 ships pass through the canal each year which is about 14 of world shipping Each ship takes up to 16 hours to cross the canal

A canal is a waterway made by humans In the 1800s and 1900s canals were built as a way of transporting heavy goods in barges Canals usually connect lakes rivers or oceans Some canals allow boats to pass Others are used for irrigation The Panama Canal is a famous canal that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean They are inforced with clay or concrete on the sides

Clothing is an item which is made to cover part of the human body The torso can be covered by a arms by sleeves legs by the hands by feet by and the head by Clothing is made from many materials such as cotton wool or polyester fabrics and leather In cold climates people also wear heavy thick coats such as trenchcoats

Almost all humans wear clothing Clothing protects the human body from the hot sun and high temperatures in warm tropical countries Clothing such as thick wool coats and boots keeps the human body warm in very cold temperatures As well clothing protects people from insects that might hurt a person if his or her body is not covered up Clothing is also worn for decoration as a fashion People from different cultures wear different clothing and have different beliefs and customs about what type of clothing should be worn For many people clothing is a status symbol It also helps people project an image Often clothing is a form of self expression Adults in different social or work situations present different views of themselves by the clothes they wear Young people have an entirely different form of dress to express their personalities Often people will simply follow popular fashion styles so that they will fit in Clothing is far more than just a means to protect our bodies

People also decorate their bodies with makeup or perfume and they also cut or change the hair on their heads and faces They might also go in for body modification tattoos scarifications and body piercings But makeup and tattoos are not kinds of clothing

Things that are carried and not worn like purses canes and umbrellas are called accessories but they are not kinds of clothing either Jewelry and eyeglasses are also accessories that are put on the body Nail Polish is also put on the finger tips and can be translated as makeup

Clothing is often made of

A shoe is a type of footwear Shoes come in pairs with one shoe for each foot A shoe is also an item of clothing

There are many different types of shoes One type of shoe is trainers Their main purpose is to make running walking or jogging easier by making the weight of the shoe lighter and the sole of the shoe softer Slippers are a kind of indoor shoe They are often worn when it is cold

Footwear is an item of clothing made by humans that covers and protects the foot including the soles of the feet Footware allows people to walk on rough surfaces such as gravel roads without hurting their feet Some types of footwear such as boots help to keep peoples feet dry or help to keep peoples feet warm in cold weather

People in many countries make their own footwear by hand using simple tools A simple pair of sandals can be made by hand cutting a foot shaped sole out of a thick flexible material such as rubber Next straps of fabric rope or leather can be added with a needle and thread A simple pair of boots can be made by hand by using animal hide with fur and sewing it with strong thread

A cafe is a type of restaurant which usually serves coffee and snacks The term cafe comes from French and means coffee

You can read newspapers and magazines there or chat with other customers about current topics It is known as a place where information can be exchanged 

A cafe is sometimes called a coffeehouse or a coffee shop in English a caf in French Spanish and Portuguese and a caff in Italian It shares some of the characteristics of a bar and some of the characteristics of a restaurant but it is different from a cafeteria which is a type of restaurant where customers can choose from many dishes on a serving line In some countries cafes more closely resemble restaurants offering a range of hot meals and possibly being licensed to serve alcohol British cafes however do not sell alcohol In the Netherlands cannabis selling cafes face an uncertain future under a planned new law banning smoking in public places The cafes which attract millions of tourists each year allow customers to buy marijuana over the counter and openly smoke it In the United States donut shops are also popular places to drink coffee and hang out

A new type of cafe known as the Internet cafe was introduced in the 1990s The spread of modern style cafes to many places urban and rural went hand in hand with computers Computers and Internet access in a contemporary atmosphere created a youthful modern public space compared to the traditional bars or old fashioned diners that they replaced Nowadays many cafes offer wireless Internet or have computers customers can use just as they offer telephones and newspapers

Jazz is a type of music which was invented in the United States Jazz music combines African American music with European music A great example of jazz can be heard at httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvVbzvElL5opY 

Some common jazz instruments include the saxophone trumpet piano double bass and drums

It is difficult to give an exact definition for jazz One important part of jazz is improvisation which means the person playing is making music up as they go along If a jazz band is playing a song the song may have several solos where one player will improvise while the rest of the band except for the rhythm section does not play Another Great Example of Jazz in 54 is httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvREkZgaESH3Y

Jazz started in the United States in the early 20th century Jazz music has musical influences from the African slaves who were taken from Africa to work in the plantations of the southern United States such as call and response songs and blue notes These influences were indirect through earlier musical forms such as ragtime Also jazz has musical styles from European music as well as the brass and stringed instruments and the use of musical notation

There have been different types of jazz over the year In the 1920s there was New Orleans style jazz and Dixieland jazz was also popular In the 1930s there was swing jazz which was also called big band jazz In the 1940s bebop became a major type of jazz with fast songs and complex harmony Large jazz bands which are called big bands were also popular in the 1940s Big bands usually have 5 saxophone players 4 or 5 trumpet players 4 trombone players a piano player or guitar player an acoustic bass player a drummer and sometimes a singer In the 1950s there was hard bop jazz In the 1960s there was modern jazz and free jazz In the 1970s jazz fusion began to blended jazz music with rock music

Coffee is a plant and the name of the drink that is made from this plant The coffee plant is a bush or tree that can grow up to ten meters high but is usually cut shorter Coffee plants originally grew in Africa and now also grow in South America Central America and Southeast Asia They are an important crop for the economies of many countries 

The drink is made from the seeds of the coffee plant called coffee beans Coffee is usually served hot and is a popular drink in many countries Coffee contains a chemical called caffeine a mild drug that keeps people awake 

To make a drink from coffee beans the beans must first be specially prepared by roasting The beans are usually roasted a short time after they are picked This dries them out makes them last longer and makes them ready to be packed Before the beans are made into a drink they are ground When the ground coffee is placed into boiling water the flavour and dark brown colour of the beans goes into the water Making coffee is called brewing coffee There are several different ways that coffee can be brewed

There are two main types of coffee plant The Coffea Arabica the most common Most of the worlds coffee is made from Arabica beans and the Coffea Robusta which is easier to grow in places where Arabica will not grow 

Robusta is cheaper and has more caffeine than Arabica and it is used in many commercial coffee products But Robusta tastes bitter and acidic so people only drink it with other things Better quality Robustas are in some espresso blends 

In the past people gave names to new Arabica coffees from the port they came from The two oldest Arabica coffees are Mocha and Java Today names are more specific They tell us the country region and sometimes even the property where they come from

Some sorts of coffee taste better if the beans are aged This means that after they are picked the beans are kept from three to eight years This aging gives the coffee a less acidic taste Coffee that has been aged is often mixed or blended with other coffee that is not aged

Roasting is one of the important stages in making coffee beans into coffee When a coffee bean is roasted it grows nearly two times bigger and changes from green to yellow to brown 

The length of time that the coffee beans are roasted makes the coffee taste different Some types of coffee such as Mocha and Java are roasted for a short time It is easy to tell from the flavour where the coffee is from When coffee is roasted for a long time it is harder to tell the different types apart Green coffee beans can be bought and roasted at home in the oven

Before the coffee is made into a drink it is ground in a small grinding machine called a coffee mill The coffee mill breaks the beans into very small pieces Coffee is turned into a drink in several different ways For some ways of making coffee such as espresso it is best to have the coffee ground into fine powder but for other types of coffee making such as filtered coffee the coffee is in larger pieces to stop it going through the filter Finely ground coffee makes a stronger taste 

Coffee is made into a drink by putting the coffee into boiling water This is called brewing coffee There are many ways to brew coffee Four of the most popular are

Instant coffee is a very quick way to make a cup of coffee to drink It is made in a factory and sold in jars or packets First strong coffee is made using ground coffee and boiling water Then the coffee grounds are filtered out The coffee liquid is dried out until nothing is left except granules or fine powder This is then put into jars or packets As soon as a spoonful of instant coffee is added to boiling water it dissolves in the water to make coffee to drink The taste can be very different from fresh coffee Part of the reason for the different taste is that Robusta coffee beans are usually used for making instant coffee Robusta coffee beans do not cost as much as Arabica

The United States buys the most coffee Germany is next People in Sweden drink the most coffee for each person In Canada the United States and Europe some restaurants sell mainly coffee they are referred to as cafs or coffeehouses Cafs often sell food but the type of food is different from one country to another

In some countries for example those in northern Europe people like having coffee parties At these parties people have coffee and cake

In many countries people drink coffee at work in the United States and England for example people drink it in the morning In other countries such as Mexico people drink it in the evening to help them stay awake

Coffee contains the drug caffeine Caffeine is a mild broken wikt linkstimulantstimulant which helps to keep people awake Caffeine like many drugs can be addictive and can cause health problems 

Some studies have looked at the health risks of coffee In February 2003 there was a study in Denmark of 18478 women to find out if coffee had an effect on pregnancy and birth It was found that if a woman drank between four and seven cups of coffee a day it did not seem to make a big change to the number of babies that were born dead But the women in the study who drank eight or more cups of coffee a day had three times as much chance of having a stillborn baby

For this and other reasons some people drink coffee substitutes instead

Beef is a type of meat Beef comes from cows There are different kinds of beef Beef is quite popular in Argentina and the United States Beef derives from the German word beife meaning grazing beast In the faith of Hinduism it is forbidden to eat beef Although Sikhs can eat beef Sikhs in India do not eat beef out of respect for Hindus

Beef can also mean a rivalry or feud between people in slang

Hyaenas are mammals They are the family Hyaenidae in the order Carnivora They live in Africa and in west and south Asia In the past they had a much wider distribution Now there are two subfamilies with four species

Although Hyaenas look much like canids they are actually in the suborder Feliformia the same as cats and mongoose Hyaena walk much like bears because their front legs are longer than their back The Brown and Striped Hyaena have striped fur with a mane covering their neck The Spotted Hyaenas fur is shorter and spotted instead of striped The Spotted Hyaenas mane is reversed forward instead of back like the other species Hyaenas are known to have one of the worlds strongest bites Its function is to crush bone

Hyenas particularly Spotted Hyenas are intelligent creatures They work together very well and are very cooperative They have very strategic hunting methods and work to steal and protect it from other predators Hyenas main targets are Zebras and Wildebeests Their main rival is the Lion If a lioness is eating a kill a group of three Hyenas can take her down but they can not take down a male lion

Table salt often called cooking salt or just salt is widely used in cooking to add flavor to food 

It is a compound of two chemical elements sodium and chlorine This is why it has the chemical name sodium chloride

In history salt was very expensive Salt was used to keep food from going bad It was even used as money in some places

Crystals of sodium chloride are almost perfect cubes 

Silk is a natural fiber made by the silk worm larvae Silk is often used to make cloth The cloth can be made into clothes rugs bedding or can be used to write or paint on Silk fibers are very strong In the past silk was used to make parachutes

In history silk came from China and was very expensive

Most spiders make a natural fiber that is also called silk 

Silk that is emitted by the silk worm consists of two main proteins sericin and fibroin Fibroin is the structural center of the silk Serecin is the sticky material surrounding it Fibroin is made up of the amino acids Gly Ser Gly Ala Gly Ala and forms beta pleated sheets Hydrogen bonds form between chains and side chains form above and below the plane of the hydrogen bond network

The high proportion of glycine allows tight packing Tight packing makes the fibers strong and resistant to breaking The tensile strength is due to the many interseeded hydrogen bonds When silk is stretched the force is applied to these many bonds and they do not break

Silk is resistant to most mineral acids except for sulfuric acid which dissolves it Perspiration makes silk yellow

The members of the band were John Lennon Paul McCartney George Harrison and Ringo Starr

Brian Epstein was their manager George Martin produced all of their albums and singles except for the album Let it Be which was produced by the famous 1960s producer Phil Spector Almost all of their music was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London

Starting in 1957 John Lennon and several of his friends played in a British band called the Quarrymen Over the next few years the members of the band changed and by 1960 the band was called The Beatles They did not have their first hit until 1962 In November 1962 their song Please Please Me reached the number 1 position on the British charts This was the first of a record 15 British number 1 singles They first came to the United States in 1964 They were met at the airport by thousands of screaming American teenagers The Beatles were so popular that they were attacked by screaming fans everywhere they went around the world The effect they had on their fans was known as Beatlemania The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show on 9 February 1964 About 74 million viewers about half of the American population watched the group perform on the show Beatles songs soon filled the top 5 places on the American top 40 chart  a record that has never been matched

After the Beatles became so popular in the United States other British bands such as the Rolling Stones the Animals the Kinks and Gerry and the Pacemakers had songs become hits there as well So many British bands became popular after the Beatles success that this time became known in America as the British Invasion

Towards the mid 1960s The Beatles became bolder with their style of music This largely started in 1965 with the release of the album Rubber Soul and hit a peak in 1967 with the release of Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band which was named as the greatest album of all time by Rolling Stone Magazine They were also named the most influential artists of all time by Rolling Stone magazine because their music clothing style and attitudes shaped much of what was popular among young people in the 1960s 

The Beatles became so popular that no regular concert venue was big enough for their concerts This led to them playing the first ever stadium rock concert at Shea Stadium in America to around 50000 people The Beatles stopped touring and playing live music in 1966 because they were sick of audiences screaming so loudly that their music could not be heard They were also tired of the pressures of touring Among other things they were so popular that thousands of people would gather outside the hotels they stayed in day and night meaning that they could never leave their rooms unless they were playing a concert

The Beatles broke up in 1970 because of the pressures of fame and each member becoming more independent both in their personal lives and musically In 1973 the two disc sets 1962 1966 and 1967 1970 were released These were both re released on CD in 1993

The band was still very popular all over the world after they broke up According to the Guinness Book of World Records they are the highest selling recording artists ever They have sold more than one billion records including albums and singles Their music is still important and still influences many musicians Musicians today perform cover versions of Beatles songs and people everywhere still listen to their music Their song Yesterday is one of the most popular songs for other artists to sing It is also the song that has been played the most on radio ever

The Beatles made thirteen albums and twenty six singles together They also started their own record label Apple Records They made two movies A Hard Days Night and Help where they appeared as actors Later they made Magical Mystery Tour a television special Yellow Submarine was a cartoon movie based on their music Let It Be showed them working on a new album

After the Beatles broke up in 1969 all four members started their own solo careers

John Lennon became a famous peace activist in the late 1960s and early 1970s He wrote successful songs including Give Peace a Chance Imagine and Happy Christmas John Lennon was murdered on December 8 1980 outside his home in New York Part of Central Park in New York and an airport in Liverpool are named in his honor

The other three Beatles got together in the 1990s to make two new records They used demo recordings of two John Lennon songs and added their own new parts Producer Jeff Lynne helped them so all four members could appear on the songs The songs were Free As A Bird and Real Love Both were top 5 hits in the UK in 1995 and 1996 

Paul McCartney started the band Wings with his wife Linda In 1977 his song Mull of Kintyre became the biggest selling single in British history It sold even more copies than the Beatles singles Paul McCartney was knighted in 1997

George Harrison and Ringo Starr had early success as solo artists but were less successful later on George formed the group The Travelling Wilburys in the 80s with other rock legends Bob Dylan Roy Orbison Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne George Harrison died of cancer on November 29 2001 Ringo still tours the world with his All Starr Band

They also sold many singles

Reincarnation is the name of the idea that people are born in another body after they die Many Hindus Jainists Celtic pagans Buddhists and people who follow some African religions believe in reincarnation Carnate means of flesh and reincarnate means to reenter the flesh

The belief is held by people of almost all major religions except Islam and Christianity although between 20 and 30 percent of Christians in western countries also believe in reincarnation 

Ethnologists have documented the belief among nearly all the traditional religions of ethnic groups in Africa North and South America and AustraliaOceania The tribes of north west North America continue to believe in reincarnation despite negative attitudes towards it on the part of Christian missionaries and churches

The soul evolves from immaturity to spiritual illumination Therefore each reincarnating soul chooses a home and a family which can best fulfill its next step of learning and maturation Each life on Earth is similar to a class in school Maturation of the soul on Earth means fulfilling its worldly desires which can only be experienced through a body 

At death the soul leaves the physical body But the soul does not die It lives on in a subtle body called the astral body The astral body exists in a nonphysical dimension called the astral plane Here the soul continues to have experiences until it is born again in another physical body as a baby

After many lifetimes of following dharma the soul is fully matured in love wisdom and knowledge of God There is no longer a need for physical birth for all lessons have been learned all karmas fulfilled When all desire has vanished the person will not be born again anymore

Ian Stevenson found that the best research evidence supporting the belief in reincarnation comes from the cases of young children who typically between the ages of 2 and 5 make statements about a previous life they claim to have had before being born Some 35 per cent of the children also have birthmarks or birth defects which often correspond to injuries or illness experienced by the deceased person who the subject remembers Medical documents have confirmed this correspondence in more than forty cases

A philosopher is a person who works studies or is an expert in philosophy The word philosopher comes from the Greek language and literally means friend of wisdom

eBay is a website It is a place for online auctions Anybody can sell almost anything they want there People can buy many things there as well

Canberra is the capital city of Australia There are 340 800 people who live there It doesnt belong to a state but it is in the Australian Capital Territory

Canberra was started in 1913 and in the middle of the city is Lake Burley Griffin  This lake was created especially for the city There was a competition to design the new capital city of Australia The competition was won by an architect from Chicago in the United States of America His name was Walter Burley Griffin Griffin designed his triangular town as a garden town so its size expanded over a big area But as Canberra grew larger and larger the lake was no longer in the middle of the town but the people who are in charge of planning the city make sure Canberra is as close to Griffins original plan as possible Canberra has a size in area nearly as big as Berlin but the number of people who live there is much smaller

Before Canberra was founded Australias two most important cities Sydney and Melbourne were arguing which city should be the capital of the continent First Melbourne was elected the capital but in 1908 there was a vote The result an area of 2400 square kilometers was given to the country by New South Wales to build Canberra in This was the place 300 kilometers away from Sydney and with a distance of 650 kilometers to Melbourne where a few years later Canberra was built

The name Canberra is pronounced in various ways and most commonly now as CAN brugh making it sound almost an English name  Canborough  Some say CAN buh ruh a small number of people may pronounce it can BEAR ruh at an earlier time can BERR a was very common and that form is still heard although often looked down upon as ignorant and incorrect But while now an uncommon pronunciation it may be closest to the original name and pronunciation In the 19th century a farming property on the Limestone Plains was named Canberry and some think this name is derived in turn from the name of the local tribe  the Ngambri or Kamberra or Camberri people

The greenhouse effect occurs when certain gases in the atmosphere trap infrared radiation This effect makes the planet warmer like a greenhouse keeps its inside temperature warmer

The greenhouse effect is caused by greenhouse gases the most important greenhouse gases in Earths atmosphere are water vapor carbon dioxide and methane When there is more greenhouse gas in the air the air holds more heat This is why more greenhouse gases cause global warming 

The greenhouse effect is normal It is important for life on Earth Without the greenhouse effect the Earths average temperature would be around 18 or 19 degrees Celsius Because of the greenhouse effect the Earths actual average temperature is 14 degrees Celsius 

The problem is that recently the greenhouse effect has become stronger Scientists believe this is because humans have been using large amounts of fossil fuels which release carbon dioxide when they are burned Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas it has caused the planet to warm over the past 150 years

About ten thousand years ago before people started burning large amounts of fossil fuels there was 260 to 280 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere In September 2011 the figure was 389 ppm Most scientists say that have 350 ppm or less is safe for the environment for species on the planet can adapt to this level At a higher level there are severe problems for animal and marine life that are already being seen today such as ocean acidification

The greenhouse effect was first proposed by Joseph Fourier in 1824 Mars Venus and other planets with atmospheres also have greenhouse effects The effect on Venus is especially strong This is why Venus is hotter than Mercury even though Mercury is closer to the sun 

A World War is a war in which most of the countries in the world fight or help 

There have been two World Wars so far World War I and World War II 

After World War II many people were afraid that a World War III might start probably between the United States and the countries of Europe on one side and the Soviet Union and maybe China on the other side After World War II countries had many powerful weapons including jet bomber airplanes that could carry many powerful bombs fast and far nuclear weapons which could destroy many buildings and kill many people instantly and missiles which could carry nuclear weapons to other countries very fast 

This time when many people were afraid that World War III might start was called the Cold War After the fall of the Soviet Union people were not as afraid that World War III might begin However many countries still have powerful weapons and still could use them 

Albert Einstein said I dont know what weapons countries might use to fight World War III but wars after that will be fought with sticks and stones  because World war III would be so big that it would probably destroy civilization

Ionizing radiation is a process in physics where something sends out particles or waves that can ionize an atom or molecule through atomic interactions 

The strength of ionizing radiation depends on the energy of the individual particles or waves and not a function of the number of particles or waves present 

There are several types of ionizing radiation including

Some radiation can go through the human body and other objects Usually when people use the term radiation they are talking specifically about potentially harmful types of ionizing radiation If something produces this sort of radiation we can say it is radioactive 

There is a little radiation all around us all the time which peoples bodies are used to but larger amounts of radiation can make people sick or kill them Natural radiation is produced by some chemical elements such as uranium and by stars and other things in outer space Some things that are radioactive only stay radioactive for much less than a second Other things can stay radioactive for thousands of years 

People can also make radiation because of small traces of Carbon 14 in them Some of the machines that make radiation are called cyclotrons linear accelerators and particle accelerators Scientists use these machines to make radiation so they can study it X ray machines make radiation so doctors can see the inside of the human body and help people Nuclear weapons make a huge amount of radiation very fast in order to destroy buildings and kill people

Nuclear reactors are used to make electricity They make a lot of radiation but the reactors are built carefully to keep the radiation inside the reactor But many people are afraid that if there were a problem with the reactor the radiation could escape into the environment harming or killing many animals and people Also the parts of the reactor stay radioactive and can kill people for hundreds or thousands of years so people are not sure where they can keep parts of old reactors safely away from people

Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria which make 10 of people get sick who catch it People who suffer from tuberculosis generally cough a lot and have trouble breathing They feel pain in their chest They also feel very tired Unless they get medicine half of the sick have died

Throughout history many millions of people have died of tuberculosis In the early 1900s it was still called consumption because it seemed people were consumed from inside The oldest signs of tuberculosis that have been found are in the spines of Egyptian mummies which date to 2400 BC Nowadays the diseases can be treated with anti biotic drugs for several months However many people still die from this disease every year particularly in countries where there is a shortage of food

Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis Its symptoms include a long lasting bad cough pain in the chest coughing up blood or sputum weakness and tiredness weight loss being not hungry chills fever and sweating at night 

TB is contagious which means it can be spread from person to person The disease is carried on the tiny droplets of water that come out of a persons lungs when they breathe If the person who has TB coughs sneezes or spits without covering their mouth they spread the bacteria more widely People become infected by breathing in the droplets spread by an infected person If a person lives with someone who has TB there is a 22 chance that they will also be infected with the disease 

Many people have TB in their system but they do not know it because it is not making them sick This is called latent tuberculosis If a person becomes infected with TB there is a 90 chance that it will be a latent TB infection meaning that they will not become sick or infect other people However there is a 10 chance that the latent TB infection will turn into Active Tuberculosis Disease at some time in the persons life People who have a latent TB infection can not spread the disease to other people The disease only becomes infectious when the person becomes sick 

The most common type of tuberculosis is an infection of the lungs This is called Pulmonary Tuberculosis This type affects 75 of TB patients There is another form called Miliary Tuberculosis that causes lesions on the lungs which are shaped like little seeds of millet This type of infection spreads to the heart and then to other organs such as the liver and brain This most commonly affects people with conditions such as HIV as well as small children Tuberculosis can also affect the bones and the skin and other organs

During the late 20th century in developed countries doctors had very good success is controlling this disease But the disease continues to spread in countries where there are many poor people without enough food In 2004 the World Health Organization said there were 146 million people sick with the disease there were 89 million new cases and 16 million deaths 

In developed countries there is now a larger number of people sick with tuberculosis because of HIVAIDS substance and taking immunosuppressive drugs to treat some other illness

Another big problem is that there are now new strains of tuberculosis which are resistant to the usual drugs that doctors use to treat it About 20 of new cases are resistant to drugs In 1993 the World Health Organization declared that tuberculosis was a global health emergency

The word American is used to mean a person or a thing from any country in any of the Americas  North America Central America or South America In English the most common use of this word is to mean a person or a thing from the United States 

Even though the islands in the Caribbean Sea are close to the Americas people who speak English do not usually use the word American for people or things from these islands 

A Native American is someone who is mostly descended from the people who lived in the Americas before the Europeans arrived Native Americans are also called First Nations and Indians

There is no language American Some important languages used in the Americas are English French Portuguese and Spanish Some people still use the Native American languages

Grain is the seeds of some special kinds of grass These grains are also called cereals People grow different kinds of grain as food The different kinds of grain are perhaps one of the most important foods in the world 

Some kinds of grain are

87 of all grain grown by farmers around the world is maize Grains contain carbohydrates that people can eat In poorer countries grains are a large part of the food supply In richer countries they are still important as food but not as important as in poorer countries Growing grain uses a lot of water About 1000 tons of water is needed to grow one ton of grain

Many different foods are made from different types of grain Grain is often ground into a powder called flour Flour can be made into breads cakes or noodles

Different kinds of beer are made from barley malt wheat and other grains

Tortillas are made from a special flour of maize called masa

A clause is a part of a sentence Each clause has only one main verb I love you is a sentence which has only one clause I love you and I will always love you is a sentence which has two clauses The two clauses are I love you and I will always love you These clauses are joined together by the word and

Two clauses can be joined with a pronoun For example I live in London which is in England Here I live in London is the first clause and which is in England is the second clause The word which is a pronoun which takes the place of London It joins the two clauses

A sentence can contain many clauses But sentences with fewer clauses are easier to understand

A subordinating clause is one which is dependent on the main clause The main clause makes sense on its own However the subordinating clause does not Eg I love you makes perfect sense left on its own However and always will does not

Marxism is the name for a set of political and economic ideas The base of these ideas comes from the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels They have had a lot of influence in many countries Very often both authors are named as it is difficult to say which of the two wrote what piece of the theory

From Marxist thought other political views came to be such as Social Democracy and Reformist Socialism

Many Marxists say that modern Communism is not Communism at all That nations such as Russia The Peoples Republic of China Venezuela Cuba and Vietnam are different forms of Capitalism often with heavily nationalized industries One of the biggest proponents of these ideas in Marxist thought was Tony Cliff who wrote that states like the USSR and Communist China were State Capitalist Not all Communists Socialists or Marxists agree on this question but many hardened Marxists generally agree that Socialism is workers democratic control over economic decisions and social justice while production is based on what people need and that Socialism will wither away into Communism when Capitalism is defeated With that idea in mind Marxists have a tendency to discredit most of the listed regimes 

Modern Communism claims to be based on Marxist ideas but many Marxists disagree about whether Communist countries have understood Marxism correctly 

Marxism says that people in the world are organized into different groups or classes based on their relationship to how things are made Most people are called workers because they work in factories or offices or farms for money They belong to the working class Another group who are not as big as the working class are capitalists because they own the factories land and buildings that the workers have to work in and also own all of the tools the workers have to use Marx calls Capitalists the Ruling Class because they live off of the work of all the workers He also says that the Capitalists own the government army and courts In Marxist views Capital is the means of production and money which the Capitalist can invest in different places of business so that they can profit or gain more Capital

Most workers work for companies owned by Capitalists or Petit bourgeois The capitalist pays a wage to the worker in exchange for the workers time The capitalist has bought a period of time from the worker which the worker must then use to labor for the Capitalist which according to marxist economic thinking is the only thing that can create value in a commodity and then exploits the time of the worker as much as they can The capitalist amasses capital by paying the worker less wealth than they make for the Capitalist Marx says that commodities have a twofold nature On the one hand they are use value Use value means they are useful that is they have the capacity of satisfying a human need On the other hand they are exchange value because someone could trade a quantity of them for a determined quantity of another commodity For example if a nail is traded for 2 boot laces the exchange value of a single nail is 2 boot laces Finally Labor Value or Value is determined by the amount of labor needed to create a product Value is created by adding work to something A products value is determined by the average work needed to create the product for the market Value can be described as the amount of labor time used to create a commodity

As an example Peter and Bob and Carl are all shoe makers It takes Peter half a day to make 20 shoes and it takes Bob half a day to make 20 shoes and it takes Carl half a day to make 20 shoes The average labor time to make the shoes is half a day and that means each shoe contains half a days labor value

Peter Bob and Carl now work for James James owns a shoe factory that can make 60 shoes in half a day Between Peter Bob and Carl 60 shoes are made Peter Bob and Carl are paid only as much as they need to live at socially accepted standards Peter Bob and Carl each get 20 dollars a day in wages however James sells the shoes for 2 dollars each 120 is made and James pays the workers their wages The remaining wealth is called Profit or Surplus Value In other words Peter Bob and Carl earn enough to provide for themselves within half of their working day The rest of the day they are creating profit for their boss James which is called Surplus Value

It is this Surplus Value or Profit which Marxism thinks as an exploitation of labor This exploitation allows the smaller class to live without laboring while the bigger class have to work for the Capitalists to survive

Marxism says that Factories tools and work places cannot create new value on their own Similar to how a blue berry bush has no value on its own That value can only be created with the use of labor For example someone spends a day picking blue berries Those blue berries are now able to be traded or eaten because of the invested labor time to pick them

Marxist thinking claims that Capitalists and Workers are in a constant state of struggle which they call Materialist Dialectic Marxism says that in order for Capitalists to generate profit quickly and to maximise their rate of profit they have to exploit the workers as much as possible and lower their wages as much as possible Workers on the other hand have to struggle to keep their wages up to keep the rate of exploitation low so that they can live more peaceful lives This is what Marxism calls Class Struggle where Workers and their Bosses fight against each other to gain for themselves

Marxists think that all of written human history has been divided by economic classes They think that the progression of history has been pushed forward by class struggle Marxism says that it is from this struggle that Capitalism was born and that it is from this struggle that Communism will be born For example Feudal Society rested its Ruling Class on the labor of peasants But as peasants demanded more and more for themselves small shopkeepers and tradespeople began to appear Many of these people appeared in Guilds as well and eventually began to employ workers to independently accumulate wealth It was this historical progression that created CapitalistsCapitalism

In the same way Marxism says that Capitalism will give way to Communism as the struggle of the workers becomes more and more revolutionary

The core of Marxist thinking is called Materialism Materialism is a philosophical view that says that communities develop from the ground up that the higher qualities of culture are actually founded on the lower or simpler qualities of life 

Changes in the higher qualities of culture are often linked to changes in the lower qualities of life One example is that in the Medieval period honor or duty to ones superiors was seen as very important today in Western countries ambition or being someone who works hard for their own goals is seen as more importantthis is because in the Medieval period people worked their entire lives under lords who depended on them not only for work but for war today people work on a more individual basis and our society operates by letting some people move up from being poor to rich In this case what is seen as good depends on how the rulers get value out of their workers

Marxism recognizes that in earlier time periods we lived first under rulers who owned everything then we lived under lords who owned land with workers who lived on them and that we currently live under governments that allow many people to own property Eventually Marxists believe that we will move to a society where everyone owns everything in commonthis will be known as Socialism

In other words human progression has been based on genetic evolution and social evolution that human society has always been based on the economic forces that human beings can control For Marxism this means that the mode of production dictates the form each society will take It is this idea that brings Marxists to believe that the current capacity to produce means human beings can move beyond the conflicts of Class society

Dialectic A dialectic is an argument or conflict between different groups The different groups or classes have their own objectivematerial interests and needs

Dialectical materialism is the idea that the history of humans is the history of conflict between classes Different classes with different interests argue or fight each other Social change is the result 

Many Marxists believe that there will always be revolts and with the right conditions revolutions In these revolutions the workers will fight the capitalists and will win During this process they will set up a Socialist workers state that will serve as a temporary state until all capitalist countries have been defeated and all classes have been abolished Marxists believe that if the working class makes itself the ruling class and destroys the objective basis for class society there will be a classless society  a society where no social groups are in conflict and there is no government anymore and the state will be dismantled organically and it will be a borderless world with world wide communes and worker organisation of production based on needs instead of profits

People use the word sacred for something that a religion says is special or important 

Most religions have sacred books that tell about their religion For Christians this book is called the Bible Muslim peoples have another book they call the Quran Jews call their book the Torah

Most religions have sacred places that are important to their religion

The City of Jerusalem is considered sacred by worlds major religions of Judaism Christianity and Islam for example Another example might be the city of Mecca which is sacred in Islam

Translation means to copy writing or speech from one language into a different language

The people who do translation are called translators A translator who is copying a book into another language may use a language dictionary to find out how a word is written in another language A translator who works with the spoken word is also called an interpreter

In computer technology translation from a programming language to a machine language is called compiling There are free translators on the internet

An astronaut or cosmonaut is a person who goes into outer space Countries friendly to the Soviet Union always said cosmonaut countries friendly to the United States said astronaut

Astronauts are also called taikonauts in China or spationaute in France 

The first person to go into space was a Russian from the Soviet Union his name was Yuri Gagarin This happened on April 12 1961

The first and second persons to walk on the Moon were the Americans Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin This happened on July 20 1969 

No astronauts have gone to the moon since 1972 No people have visited any other planets yet

Astronauts used to go into space on the Space Shuttle and the Soyuz spacecraft but now they only go on the Soyuz Several countries have worked together to build an International Space Station so people can stay and work in space for long periods of time

A hacker is someone who likes to do new things with computers

One wrong meaning of the word hacker is someone who tries to get into another persons computer using computer software such as Trojan horse programs computer viruses and worms that can hurt other peoples computers The correct name for a person doing these illegal things is cracker but many news stories use hacker even though it is wrong

The older meaning of the word hacker is someone who knows a lot about computers and likes to do new and different or hard to do things with them This meaning of the word hacker is usually a compliment Another meaning of hacker is someone who can change or program something like how people can change or program a Furby to say something insulting or humorous

In communications such as radio and television broadcasting means sending information such as television shows or music electronically to a large audience The information is sent through the air in radio wavesthrough a wire or by a satellite and then the television viewers or radio listeners pick up the signal using their television sets and radio receivers Gugliemo Marconi invented wireless telegraphy in December 1901 he transmitted first radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean however it was Nikola Tesla who developed first radio concept

Many countries have public broadcasters which get funding from the government to broadcast television shows and radio programs Examples of public broadcasters include the BBC in Britain NHK in Japan and the CBC in Canada 

In the US the public broadcaster is called PBS It is different than the other public broadcasters such as BBC NHK and CBC because the PBS gets a lot of its funding from donations by viewers and listeners Public broadcasters make programs that the private companies are not interested in making such as educational childrens shows documentaries and public affairs shows about current issues

As well there are private broadcasting companies These are companies that broadcast television and radio programs To make money private broadcasting companies sell advertisements called commercials 

A third type of broadcaster is community broadcasters There are community television stations and community radio stations

Community television stations are often provided on cable networks Community television stations usually have shows about local issues and community events Some community television stations film and broadcast community cultural activities such as musical performances or town hall meetings 

Community radio stations play music and have public affairs shows about community issues Community radio stations are usually small organizations that are run by volunteers Community radio stations often get their funding from local governments local universities and from donations by listeners Some community radio stations also have poetry readings by local poets or performances by local musicians or singers 

Broadcasting can also mean sending a message to many users on a computer network at the exact same time or sending a message from one computer to many other computers giving information about itself such as its name and location

Sending information to a small selected group is called narrowcasting

Socialism is an economic and political system where the use of property and capital is used for the common good According to socialists the wealth of a society should be shared and everyone in it should have everything they need Individual rights and needs cannot be more important than the needs of everyone Although socialist ideas go back in history to Plato the word socialism was first used in Britain in the 1820s Louis Blanc described socialism as being from each according to his ability to each according to his needs

Socialism is an economic or governmental system in which the public or the state owns or runs important industries Its goal is to have the industries make money which can be used for the benefit of everyone It wants to give workers some control over their work places When economic planning is applied extensively it is referred to as communism although communism as used by Karl Marx had a different meaning originally

Social Democracy is a form of socialism that tries to mix parts of socialism with capitalism Much of the time the people when social democracy is practiced as a form of government collectively contribute money or other goods for the benefit of the entire community An example of this would be Americas fire departments which rely on taxes paid by the people to maintain equipment and staff for the benefit of the community should something catch on fire Some social democratic countries have a higher income tax for people with high incomes called a progressive tax This tax and other measures helps to reduce the gap between rich and poor within a nation

In many countries that practice social democracy industries are subsidized andor partially controlled by the government For example education health care or public transportation are some industries that might be ownedmaintained by the government or people in a socialist system For the most part people working in these industries are paid by the government with money paid by the people as taxes

Another kind of Socialism is Collectivization In this system money and goods are shared more equally among the people with the government in control In theory this system results in the divide between classes shrinking with the poorest of a nations people getting better looked after while the richest make sacrifices in terms of higher taxes and regulation of business Of course socialism as it is commonly practiced differs in many ways from communism

Today many democratic socialists especially in Western Europe want industries to be guided jointly by representatives of shareholders as well as the workers working together in what is known as an industrial democracy because both groups have interests in the success of the enterprise This would be a more direct democratic way of organizing rather than control by central government Trade unions andor workers councils would represent the interests of the employees

Many countries view Socialism in different ways Social Democracy for example a Democratic form of Socialism is the most common kind of government in the world Socialist International is an organization dedicated to the cause of promoting socialist ideals and has ties with many Socialist parties especially Social Democratic ones

A Welshman Robert Owen was the first socialist His followers began calling themselves socialists in 1841 He is still regarded as a pioneer of the Cooperative Movement in Britain He said that workers should own the companies they worked for The workers would then share the profits among themselves He set up a new model factory in New Lanark Scotland 

Many socialist political parties were formed during the 19th century and early part of the 20th century Left Wing political parties are generally newer than Right Wing ones

At first the words socialism and communism meant almost the same thing Today they usually mean different things Most non communist people say communism when they mean the Marxist and Leninist ideas of Russias Bolshevik party Marx said that socialism can be used as a period of working towards Communism However many non Communists do not recognize the difference and use the term Communist country to refer to a socialist state though socialists would never use the term Others call this State Socialism to distinguish it from the communist goal that does not need a state or any form of government To non communists the word socialism is now mostly used for attempts to come close to this goal in a democratic state

After World War I the collapse of the Second International and the Russian Revolution socialism was split into two ways Some socialists followed Lenin and were called Communists Others believed in Parliamentary socialism and were called social democrats Social democrats disagreed very strongly with communists They had supported their Bourgeois Governments at the outbreak of the War and became establishment Parties of the ruling class

Today there are still many different forms of Socialism and some do not agree with others

Vladimir Lenin was a Russian Marxist He had a set of political ideas based on Marxism Lenins development of Marxism has become known as Leninism

These ideas include

A Bolshevik was a Russian Communist

The Russian Social Democratic Workers Party was a Marxist political party In 1903 at the Party Congress members disagreed with each other The Party ended up dividing into two groups the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks They were called Bolsheviks because it means those who are more Vladimir Ilyich Lenin was the leader of the Bolshevik group The more moderate group the Mensheviks were led by Julius Martov Although the Bolsheviks were called those who are more before 1917 there were more Mensheviks Many of Lenins opponents were afraid that he liked to control things too much

In 1905 the Bolshevik group became a separate political party the RSDLP the b in brackets standing for Bolshevik 

After the February Revolution some of the Mensheviks took positions in the Provisional Government Lenin said socialists must oppose the Provisional Government The government began to falter and Lenin started to have more authority Because of this many Mensheviks joined the Bolsheviks

The Bolsheviks led the October Revolution in Russia in 1917 They said they created the worlds first Workers State Soon however the government started to control what people could say and killed many people who opposed them The Mensheviks opposed the government led by the Bolsheviks Many ended up in prison or were killed After that they opposed the Bolsheviks from outside Russia in exile 

After the Revolution the Bolshevik Party was called the Russian Communist Party

Saddam Hussein Abd al Majid al Tikriti was the President of Iraq from July 16 1979 to April 9 2003 when he was removed from his position during the War in Iraq led by the United States

Saddam Hussein was born in the village of Al Awja in the Tikrit in Iraq He never knew his father Hussein Abd al Majid who disappeared five months before Saddam was born Shortly before Saddam was born Saddams twelve year old brother died of cancer leaving his mother very depressed in the final months of the pregnancy She tried to kill herself near the end of the pregnancy and did not want to care for Saddam when he was bornfactdateApril 2009 Saddam was sent to the family of an uncle Khairallah Tulfah until he was three

At ten Saddam ran away from the family to return to live with his uncle who was a devout Sunni Muslim in Baghdad According to Saddam in 1957 at the age of 20 Saddam became part of the Baath Party The Baath party is an Arab group that supports socialism

A year after Saddam had joined the Baath party army officers led by General Abdul Karim Qassim got rid of Faisal II of Iraq The Baathists opposed the new regime and in 1959 Saddam was involved in the attempted murder of Prime Minister Qassim Saddam was shot in the leg but managed to get away to Syria later he moved to Egypt He was sentenced to death In exile he attended the University of Cairo law school

Army officers including some with the Baath party came to power in Iraq in a military coup in 1963 However the new regime was kicked out quickly Saddam returned to Iraq but was imprisoned in 1964 when an anti Baath group led by Abdul Rahman Arif took power He escaped from jail in 1967 and became one of the leading members of the party

In 1976 Saddam was appointed as a general in the Iraqi army He quickly became the most important person of the regime He slowly began to gain more power over Iraqs government and the Baath party As Iraqs weak and old President Ahmed Hassan al Bakr became more unable to do the duties of his office Saddam began to become an larger important role as the head of the Iraqi government He soon became the creator of Iraqs foreign policy and represented the nation in all diplomatic situations 

In 1979 Irans Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was overthrown by the Islamic Revolutiongiving way to an Islamic republic led by the Ayatollah Khomeini The influence of revolutionary Shiite Islam grew in the region particularly in countries with large Shiite populations especially Iraq Saddam was afraid that radical Islamic ideas that would go against his leadership were quickly spreading inside his country among most of the Shiite people

There had also been a rivalry between Saddam and Khomeini since the 1970s Khomeini having been exiled from Iran in 1964 began living in Iraq at the Shiite holy city of An Najaf There he became involved himself with Iraqi Shiites and got a strong religious and political following throughout the world Under pressure from the Shah who had agreed to a rapprochement between Iraq and Iran in 1975 Saddam agreed to kick Khomeini out in 1978 After the Islamic Revolution Khomeini thought defeating Saddams government may have been the second most imporatnt thing to do only behind keeping his power in Iran

After Khomeini gained power small battles between Iraq and revolutionary Iran happened for ten months They were fought over who controlled the disputed Shatt al Arab waterway which divides the two countries Iraq and Iran entered into warfare on September 22 1980 The pretext for war with Iran was this territorial dispute but the war was more likely an attempt by Saddam helped by both the United States and the Soviet Union to have Iraq stop radical revolutions like in Iran from spreading any further

In the first days of the war there was heavy ground fighting around major ports as Iraq launched an attack on Irans oil rich Arab populated province of Khuzestan After making some gains Iraqs troops began to suffer losses from human wave attacks by Iran By 1982 Iraq was looking to end the war

During the war Iraq used chemical weapons against Iranian forces and Kurdish separatists On March 16 1988 Iraqi troops on orders from Saddam to stop a Kurdish uprising attacked the Kurdish town of Halabjah with a mix of poison gas and nerve agents killing 5000 people mostly women and children 

Saddam reached out to other Arab governments for cash and political help The Iranians hoping to bring down Saddams non religious government and start a Shiite rebellion in Iraq refused a cease fire until 1988

The eight year war ended in a tie There were hundreds of thousands of casualties Perhaps 17 million died on both sides Both economies previously healthy and expanding were left in ruins

Saddam was also stuck with a debt of roughly 75 billion Borrowing money from the US was making Iraq into its client state embarrassing a strongman who had sought to define and dominate Arab nationalism Saddam also borrowed a large amount of money from other Arab states during the 1980s to fight Iran Faced with rebuilding Iraqs infrastructure Saddam desperately sought out cash once again this time for postwar reconstruction

Saddam was pressuring Kuwait to forgive its share of his debt some 30 billion He argued that since the struggle with Iran had been fought for the benefit of the other Persian Gulf Arab states as much as for Iraq that a share of Iraqi debt should be forgiven 

Saddam had pushed oil exporting countries to raise oil prices and cut back production but on top of Kuwaiti refusals to do so Kuwait helped spearhead OPECs opposition to the production cuts that Saddam had requested Kuwait was pumping large amounts of oil and keeping prices low when Iraq needed to sell high priced oil from its wells to pay off a huge debt

The fact that Kuwait had so much oil made the region even more tense Even though Kuwait had fewer people it had about as much oil in reserve as Iraq Together Iraq and Kuwait had 20 percent of the worlds known oil reserves

The Kuwaiti monarchy made Saddam even angrier by drilling oil out of Iraqi wells At the time Saddams regime was not thought to be disliked by most of the world Saddam complained about the drilling to the US State Department Although this had gone on for years Saddam now needed oil money to get rid of a looming economic crisis Saddam still had an experienced and well equipped army which he used to influence regional affairs He later ordered troops to the Iraq Kuwait border

As Iraq Kuwait relations rapidly grew worse Saddam was getting conflicting information about how the US would respond to an invasion Washington had been taking measures to start a good relationship with Iraq for roughly a decade The Reagan administration gave Saddam roughly 40 billion worth of arms in the 1980s to fight Iran nearly all of it on credit The US also sent billions of dollars of food and arms to Saddam to keep him from forming a strong alliance with the Soviets

The US ambassador to Iraq April Glaspie met with Saddam in a meeting on July 25 where the Iraqi leader said he wanted to keep talks going US officials attempted to maintain a conciliatory line with Iraq indicating that while Bush and Baker did not want force to be used they would not take any position on the Iraqi Kuwait dispute and did not want to become involved Later Iraq and Kuwait then met for a final negotiation session which failed Saddam then sent his troops into Kuwait

In August 2 1990 Saddam invaded and Kuwait thus making an international crisis The invasion of Kuwait gave Iraq with its own substantial oil fields control of 20 percent of the Persian Gulf oil The US helped Saddam Hussein in the war with Iran but with Iraqs take over of the oil rich emirate of Kuwait in August of 1990 the United States led a United Nations attempt that drove Saddam from Kuwait in February 1991

Cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union made it possible for resolutions to pass in the United Nations Security Council and gave Iraq a deadline to leave Kuwait

Saddam ignored the Security Council deadline Helped by the Security Council a US led coalition launched missile attacks on Iraq January 16 1991 The United States and a group of allies it had hastily rounded up including Egypt Syria and Saudi Arabia made Saddams army move from Kuwait in January 1991

Israel though subjected to attack by Iraqi missiles refrained from retaliating in order not to anger Arab states into leaving the coalition But Saddam had focused attention on the Palestinian problem by promising to make his forces leave from Kuwait if Israel would leave the occupied territories in the West Bank the Golan Heights and the Gaza Strip Saddams proposal further split the Arab world pitting US and Western supported Arab states against the Palestinians

175000 Iraqis were taken prisoner and the dead were estimated to be 85000 As part of the cease fire agreement Iraq agreed to get rid of all poison gas and germ weapons and allow UN observers to inspect the sites

All of the different religions and the violence of the war that this had created caused after war rebellions After the war fighting between Shiite Muslims Kurds and dissident military units was bad This was a problem to Saddams rule Saddam acted by stopping all rebellions in their tracks especially in the North

The United States did not help the rebellions although they had wanted Iraqis to rise up against Saddam Turkey  a friend of the US  was against Kurdish independence which would have stopped the fighting This was because the Saudis and old fashioned Arab states were afraid of a change like what happened in Iran with the Shiites Saddam survived these problems that happened right after the war He was then left completely in control of Iraq The country never recovered from the Gulf War economically or with the army Hussein often showed his proof that Iraq had won the Gulf War and the USA had lost This made Saddam popular in many parts of the Arab world

Saddam liked to show himself as a strict Muslim This was to calm down the religious parts of the society Some parts of the Sharia law were brought back This included the 2001 law imposing the death penalty for homosexuality The phrase Allahu Akbar in Saddams handwriting was added to the Iraq national flag

Relations between the United States and Iraq remained tense after the Gulf War The US launched a missile attacked aimed at Iraqs intelligence headquarters in Baghdad June 26 1993 believing evidence that Iraq had sponsored a plot to kill former President George Bush

The UN placed a trade embargo on Iraq blocking Iraqi oil exports This caused hardship in Iraq and almost destroyed the Iraqi economy and state infrastructure Only smuggling across the Syrian border and humanitarian aid kept Iraq from crisis Later limited amounts of income from the United Nations oil for food program started flowing into Iraq On December 9 1996 the United Nations allowed Baghdad to begin selling limited amounts of oil for food and medicine

US officials continued to accuse Saddam of violating the terms of the Gulf Wars cease fire by developing weapons of mass destruction and other banned weaponry and violating the UN imposed sanctions and no fly zones Isolated military strikes by US and British forces continued on Iraq the largest being Operation Desert Fox in 1998 After two years of intermittent activity US and British warplanes struck harder at sites near Baghdad in February 2001

Saddams base of Tikriti tribesmen family members and other supporters was divided after the war and in the following years adding to the regimes increasingly repressive and arbitrary nature Domestic repression inside Iraq grew worse and Saddams sons Uday Hussein and Qusay Hussein became increasingly powerful and carried out a private reign of terror They likely had a leading hand when in August 1995 two of Saddam Husseins sons in law who held high positions in the Iraqi military defected to Jordan Both were killed after returning to Iraq the following February

The main reason for the invasion was the claim by the Bush administration that Saddam has WMD He was seen as a major threat to Western allies such as oil rich Saudi Arabia and Israel to Western oil supplies from the Persian Gulf states and to Middle East stability generally Bushs successor US President Bill Clinton maintained sanctions and made occasional air strikes in the Iraqi no fly zones or other restrictions in the hope that Saddam would be overthrown by his many political enemies

The domestic political equation changed in the US after the September 11 2001 attacks which added to the influence of the neoconservative faction in the presidential administration and throughout Washington In his January 2002 state of the union message to Congress George W Bush spoke of an axis of evil comprising Iran North Korea and Iraq

As the war was looming on February 24 2003 Saddam Hussein talked with CBS News anchor Dan Rather for more than three hourshis first interview with a US reporter in over a decade CBS aired the taped interview later that week

The Iraqi government and military collapsed in three weeks of the beginning of the US led 2003 invasion of Iraq on March 20 The United States made at least two attempts to kill Saddam with targeted air strikes but both failed to hit their target By the beginning of April Coalition forces had much of Iraq The resistance of the much weakened Iraqi Army either crumbled or shifted to guerrilla tactics and it appeared that Saddam had lost control of Iraq He was last seen in a video which showed him in the Baghdad suburbs surrounded by supporters When Baghdad fell to the Coalition on April 9 Saddam was nowhere to be found

Saddam was also accused by the Bush administration of being part of Al Qaeda That has never been proven and there is no evidence Saddam ever had any ties People in the Bush administration including the Vice President Dick Cheney will forever claim otherwise Mostly to justify the largely perceived illegal invasion

Even when Baghdad was taken over and most of the fighting had stopped people still did not know where Saddam was For a few weeks some people said they saw Saddam and some videotapes of Saddam talking came out but still nobody knows if they were true or not

Although Saddam was placed at the top of the most wanted list he could not be found even when the other leaders of the Iraqi regime were arrested His sons and political heirs Uday and Qusay were killed in July 2003 in a clash with US forces after a tip from an Iraqi

On December 14 2003 the Islamic Republic News Agency of Iran first reported that Saddam Hussein had been arrested These reports were soon confirmed by other members of the Governing Council by US military sources and by British Prime Minister Tony Blair In a press conference in Baghdad shortly afterwards the US Civil Administrator in Iraq Paul Bremer officially announced the capture of Saddam by saying Ladies and gentlemen we got him He was found at around 830 PM Iraqi time on December 13 in an underground spider hole at a farmhouse in ad Dawr near his home town Tikrit in what was called Operation Red Dawn

The first photos taken of Saddam after the soldiers found him did not look like the photos taken when he was president of Iraq He had grown long hair and a long beard Later on he cut off his hair and beard The DNA tests came back and showed that he really was Saddam Hussein People who talked with him after the soldiers found him said he was healthy and wanted to talk to people and do what they told him to do Paul Bremer said that Saddam would have a trial but that he did not know yet what kind of trial 

The Iraqi Special Tribunal was in charge of Saddam Husseins trial and the trials of some people that helped him to be president of Iraq

In November 2006 Saddam Hussein was found guilty of 148 murders and on December 30 2006 he was put to death The hanging recorded by officials of the government and secretly recorded by a member of the witnesses with a cell phone camera  with sound  showed Saddam being calm as he was prepared for his final moments Both witnesses and exectutioners could be heard teasing him as the rope was placed on his head and he was put on the trap door He was in the middle of a prayer when the trap door beneath him opened and his life ended Later pictures and live video of Saddams taunting and execution of his dead corpse were shown on many Internet sites

Saddam had been married three times His first marriage was to his first cousin Sajida Talfah This union with the eldest daughter of Khairallah Talfah Saddams uncle produced two sons and three daughters Rana Raghad and Hala Sajida was put under house arrest in early 1997 along with daughters Raghad and Rana because of suspicions of their involvement in an attempted assassination on Uday in December 12 1996 General Adnan Khairallah Tuffah who was Sajidas brother and Saddam Husseins boyhood friend was allegedly executed because of his growing popularity

Saddam Hussein also married two other women Samira Shahbandar whom he married in 1986 after forcing her husband to divorce her and Nidal al Hamdani the general manager of the Solar Energy Research Center in the Council of Scientific Research whose husband apparently was also persuaded to divorce his wife 

In August 1995 Rana and her husband Hussein Kamel al Majid and Raghad and her husband Saddam Kamel Majid defected to Jordan taking their children with them They returned to Iraq when they received assurances that Saddam Hussein would pardon them Within three days of their return in February 1996 both of the Majid brothers were executed

Saddams daughter Hala is married to Jamal Mustafa the deputy head of Iraqs Tribal Affairs Office Neither has been known to be involved in politics Another cousin was Ali Hassan al Majid also known in the United States as Chemical Ali who was accused of ordering the use of poison gas in 1988 



Saddam was scheduled to die on Thursday night December 28 2006 Because of last minute legal appeals in the American federal court Saddams execution came about 40 hours later Saddam Hussein was hanged on December 30 2006 at 605 AM Iraqi time Saddam refused to wear a hood The execution was performed by the Shiites He was pronounced dead at 610 AM Baghdad time Baghdad had curfews on those days policy regulation required people to be off the streets by evening His motionless body was allowed to dangle on the rope for about 10 minutes Many Shiites danced around his corpse

Anarchism is a political belief that is against authority believing that people can organize themselves without needing state or a government in power Anarchists also believe that participation should never be forced by other people

Anarchism is a cluster of doctrines and attitudes centered on the belief that government is both harmful and unnecessary The term anarchism derives from the Greek broken wikt link 

In the common language the word anarchy is often used to describe chaos or anomie However anarchists usually do not promote this Rather they define anarchy as a way of relations between people They believe that once put into place these relations work on their own

Individual freedom voluntary association and opposition to the state are important beliefs of anarchism There are also big differences between anarchist philosophies on things like whether violence can be used to bring anarchy the best type of economy the relationship between technology and hierarchy the idea of equality and the usefulness of some organization 

There are many anarchists who reject capitalism and support socialism they are called anarcho socialists Also there are some people called anarcho capitalists who oppose governments but support capitalism and reject socialism Other anarchists say that they are not really anarchists Finally there are anarchists without adjectives who hold that because people will be free in an anarchy to pursue voluntarily any economic structures they want

CLinux musilnks is an operating system for small computers inside integrated circuits The system is based on the Linux operating system in many ways Apart from the rather big size of Linux CLinux is much smaller and not as packed with features as Linux It finds uses in many places mostly dealing with sensor and data gathering of different sorts

Thanks to its compact nature it can easily be transferred over slow connections Yet it is a stable and robust system distributed as an open source program

UNIX is a computer operating system It was developed during the late 1960s at Bell Labs It was made by Ken Thompson Dennis Ritchie Douglas McIlroy and others The system is a multiuser and multiprocessing system This means that it can do many things at the same time Also many people can use it at the same time It also is network oriented which means that it is meant to operate in a network of computers Security is also very important in UNIX because of the multiuser idea but also the networked environment it is found in

Many ideas that were in UNIX were new Other operating systems copied them Today there are many operating systems that have some of the ideas of UNIX in them For this reason some people talk about a UNIX philosophy of doing things One of these systems with many of the UNIX ideas in it is called Linux Linux does not use code from UNIX it only shares some of the ideas Therefore Linux is not a UNIX operating system Instead it is called UNIX like

There can be many different users in a UNIX like operating system Most of them have a personal area where they can put things This is called a user account

The main method of interacting with a UNIX system is the command line interface Users run commands and programs by typing them at the command line This is an extremely powerful and flexible way of working because it allows things to be done automatically and is still used by most UNIX users and administrators

A graphical user interface usually used by UNIX systems is the X Window System The X Window System is only a shell of a graphical interface It is made of many protocols The X Window System itself does not provide decorations for windows or controls to the user to move and resize windows This is handled by a window manager or desktop manager

Some of the popular desktop environments and window managers are

Like most other graphical user interfaces they use windows dialog boxes support the use of a computer mouse and are designed to be easy to use

There are many thousands of programs available for the X Window System Programs like word processors and spreadsheets are available including free and open source software

Today there are two kinds of operating systems that look like Unix The first group contains all those that have common kernel code with the original developed at Bell Labs later ATT This includes the commercial Unix variants like Solaris AIX or Mac OS X The free ones do usually have BSD in their name like FreeBSD OpenBSD and NetBSD The other group is based on the Linux Kernel It does not have common code with the original UNIX To avoid this controversy many people therefore speak about Unix and Unix like systems

As to the applications most can be made to run on either Unix or Linux KDE and GNOME were developed for Linux and later ported to the commercial Unix variants

A signature is a special way that people write their name to imply that they agree to something which is written 

A signature is usually used by people to sign letters they have written cheques to show that they agree to the payment of some money petitions to show their support for views and contracts The way people sign things are different in different countries In the UK most people have a signature which is just made from writing their name in their own handwriting but in Cte dIvoire for example young adults spend many months practicing fancy signatures which are hard to copy and not readable

People who cannot write often mark a signature of a cross 

Hundreds of years ago rich people used sealing wax to make an impression of their signet rings next to or instead of a signature This was called their seal which is where the term seal of approval comes from Some formal documents still carry an official wax seal For example if a coat of arms is registered with the College of Heralds the registration document carries a wax seal

Sometimes one finds a form where the person is asked to both 

Cocoa is the seed of the cacao tree 

The seed contains a lot of fat and is used to produce cocoa butter Cocoa butter is then used to produce chocolate

Most people will know Cocoa as a ground powder they use to produce chocolate

Chocolate and cocoa are made from the beans of the cacao tree The tree might have first come from the foothills of the Andes Mountains near the Amazon River and the Orinoco River in South America The tree was brought to Central America by the ancient Mayas and was grown in Mexico by the Toltecs and later by the Aztecs

Cocoa was an important product in Pre Columbian Mesoamerica People who told the story of the conquest of Mexico by Hernn Corts said that when Moctezuma II emperor of the Aztecs ate dinner he took no other drink than chocolate served in a golden goblet and eaten with a golden spoon Flavored with vanilla and spices his chocolate was whipped into a froth that dissolved in the mouth No less than 50 pitchers of the drink were prepared for the emperor each day and 2000 more for nobles of his court

Chocolate was brought to Europe by the Spaniards and became a popular drink by 1700 They also brought the cacao tree to the West Indies and the Philippines It was used in alchemical processes where it was known as Black Bean

The cacao plant was first given its name by Swedish natural scientist Carl von Linn who called it theobroma cacao or food of the gods

A pod has a rough leathery rind about 3 cm thick It is filled with slimy pinkish pulp sweet but inedible enclosing from 30 to 50 large almond like seeds or beans that are fairly soft and pinkish or purplish in color As soon as they ripen the pods are removed with a curved knife on a long pole opened with a machete and left to dry until taken to fermentation

Then the beans are removed and piled in heaps bins or on grates where during several days of sweating the thick pulp ferments until it thins and trickles off The quality of the beans which originally have a strong bitter taste depends upon this sweating If it is overdone they may be ruined if underdone they have a flavor like raw potatoes and are susceptible to mildew

Then the beans are spread out constantly raked over and dried On large plantations this is done on huge trays either outdoors by sunshine or in sheds by artificial heat However thousands of tons from smaller producers are dried on small trays or on cowhides Finally the beans are trodden and shuffled about and sometimes during this process red clay mixed with water is sprinkled over the beans to obtain a finer color polish and protection against molds during shipment to factories in the United States the Netherlands United Kingdom and other countries About 3000000 tonnes of cocoa are grown each year The Netherlands is the leading cocoa processing country followed by the US

Uses of cocoa are numerous It may be used in cakes creams drinks toppings

Besides its use as a food science has discovered that cocoa is beneficial for health Cocoa has nearly twice the anti cancer antioxidants of red wine and up to three times those found in green tea

The Republic of Cte dIvoire commonly known in English as Ivory Coast is a country in West Africa People who live there speak French It used to be called the Ivory Coast Some people in the USA still call it this but it is not the official name 

Coffee cocoa bananas and rubber are all sold from here

From the 1960s to the mid 1980s Cote dIvoire was managed well by the government There was one president for this time The economic growth and development of the country were among the best in the world

After the mid 1980s the country became hard to live in The cost of coffee and cocoa went down so people could not make as much money The first president died and a civil war took place Today it relies on smaller crops

The capital of Cte dIvoire is Yamoussoukro its biggest city is Abidjan

The God paradox is a problem in philosophy The problem is explained here

This problem is a paradox because

The God paradox is a good example of a philosophical problem This section has some responses to the paradox

This response says that God can do only logical things God can do everything that makes sense If you talk about a mountain that is too heavy to lift then it would not make sense if anything could lift it This is because saying a mountain is too heavy to lift means that the mountain cannot be lifted by anything This does not mean that God is too weak to lift very heavy mountains God cannot lift an unliftable mountain because that would not make sense He also cannot create an unliftable mountain because that also would not make sense if God can lift everything God could still lift any mountain that is not defined as cannot be lifted For example God can make a mountain as heavy as he wants but he cannot make a round square

Some people disagree They think that God can do things that are illogical This is another way of saying that one cannot apply logicalillogical to God at all People who believe this either do not believe we can know God at all or that we can only use what God has told us to know about Him

God is beyond limitation His strength is infinite If He chooses to create a mountain that is too heavy for Him to lift he would simultaneously become strong enough to lift it To ask if the creation of such a mountain is possible is to attempt putting a limitation on the limitless

In analytical philosophy problems can be solved by breaking it into smaller pieces One solves each of the small problems

Let us see how one can use this for the God Paradox The paradox is

If one changes this question to a sentence it becomes

We can make this even more simple First we must see that because God can do anything 

Now we can write the sentence as these facts

Facts 1 2 and 3 must always be true Now we must see if fact 4 is true or false

If 4 is true or false fact 1 is disproved Illustrating the God paradox does make sense or that omnipotence is impossible

This rather simple language of logic does indeed rely on 1 2 and 3 all being true therefore 4 must be true if it is false then either 1 2 or 3 must also be false

These references were taken from the English article They may not be simple to understand

This page is about free market individualism Some people use the word libertarianism to refer to libertarian socialism

Libertarianism is an idea in ethics and politics The word comes from the word liberty and people who believe in libertarianism believe in individual people having as much liberty as possible It also leads libertarians to want to limit government power as much as possible People who believe in libertarianism are called libertarians

Libertarianism grew out of liberalism as a movement in the 1800s Many of the beliefs of libertarianism are similar to the beliefs in classical liberalism It also has roots in anarchism and the Austrian School of economics

Libertarians often oppose slavery rape theft murder and all other examples of initiated violence 

Libertarians believe that no person can justly own or control the body of another person what they call self ownership or individual sovereignty In simple words every person has a right to control her or his own body

In the 1800s libertarians like William Lloyd Garrison Frederick Douglass and Lysander Spooner were all abolitionists Abolitionists were people who wanted to end slavery right away

Garrison based his opposition to slavery on the idea of self ownership Since you have a natural right to control your own body no one else has any right to steal that control from you Garrison and Douglass both called slave masters man stealers

If you have a right to control your own body then no one has a right to start violence against you

Some libertarians believe that all violence is unjust These libertarians are often called anarcho pacifists Robert LeFevre was a libertarian who rejected all violence However most libertarians believe that there are some ways violence can be justified

One thing that justifies violence is self defence If someone is violent towards you you have a right to defend yourself with equal force

The libertarian Murray N Rothbard said that it would be wrong to kill someone for stealing a pack of gum If you steal gum this is an act of violence against the property owner The owner has a right to use defensive violence to get the gum back but killing the thief goes too far That is too much force because it is not equal to the force used by the thief Punishment must be equal to the crime

Some libertarians believe that it is your moral duty to defend yourself and your property if you can This belief is usually held by Objectivists These people believe that pacifism is immoral Most libertarians reject this view

All libertarians believe that it is wrong to start violence against any person or against what he or she owns They call this the non aggression principle

Ownership is the right to control something Property is the thing that you control

Libertarians believe that property rights come from self ownership This means that because you have a right to control your own body you also have a right to control what you make with it

The English philosopher John Locke said that a person comes to own something by using it So if you turn an area that no one else owns into a farm and use it that area becomes your property This is called the homestead principle

Libertarians also say that you can become a legitimate owner by receiving something as a gift or by trading it with someone for something they own You do not become a legitimate owner by stealing You also do not become a legitimate owner by simply saying you own something If you have not homesteaded the thing or received it through trade or gift you do not own it

Libertarians are opposed to states creating any laws that tell people what they can and cannot do with their own bodies The only legitimate laws are laws that say a person may not start violence against other people or their legitimate property All laws stopping people from doing nonviolent things should be repealed according to libertarians

In most countries the state takes tax money from the people All libertarians support cutting taxes back and some libertarians believe the state should not take tax money at all Libertarians think people can take care of the poor without the government They believe that people should pay for the things that they want to use but not have to pay for other things that they do not want Tax evasion is a victimless crime Libertarians would prefer to see taxation replaced with lotteries user fees and endowments

Libertarians think everyone should be allowed to decide what is good or bad for herhis own body Libertarians think if people want to drive cars without wearing seat belts it is their own choice They should not be forcibly stopped from doing that not even by the state If a person wants to donate all of herhis money to a charity or waste it all gambling that is also something shehe should decide for herselfhimself No one should be forcibly stopped from doing that not even by the state Libertarians even say that if adults want to use harmful drugs they should be allowed to do that even if it spoils their lives It is the drug users own choice because it is the drug users own body As long as the drug user does not start using violence against other people or their legitimate property no one should use violence against the drug user or the drug users legitimate property not even the government

Many libertarians also believe that families and friends should look after people so that they will not use drugs drive without seat belts or do other things that are dangerous for them But no one can force others to do things that they do not want to do or to stop them from doing nonviolent things that they want to do

There are two basic types of libertarians All libertarians fall into one of these two broad types

Minarchists are libertarians who believe that society should have a state with very limited power They typically believe that the only things the state should have are police and judges to make sure that people obey the laws Some also believe in having a military to make sure that no one attacks the country Some minarchists believe in having a small amount of taxation

Two famous minarchist libertarians are Robert Nozick and Ayn Rand Nozick believed that the only legitimate thing a state can do is have a police force He called his legitimate state a night watchman state Rand believed that the state should have police and judges but that it should fund itself through lotteries and not through taxation

Libertarian anarchists usually call themselves anarcho capitalists free market anarchists individualist anarchists or just anarchists

Libertarian anarchists do not believe the state is needed They believe that people can organise their own lives and businesses They want to replace the state with voluntary organisations including charities private companies voluntary unions and mutual aid societies They also want to end all forced taxation

They say that state police can be replaced with DROs or private protection agencies They also say that state judges can be replaced with private arbitration

The most famous libertarian anarchist was Murray N Rothbard Others include Lysander Spooner Benjamin R Tucker and Linda Morris Tannehill

Most libertarians fall under one of the two types of libertarians listed above But there are other types too

An auction is a place where people can buy or sell things People say how much they will pay for something and the person who is willing to pay the most gets the thing

The amount people will pay is called a bid The person in charge of the auction is the auctioneer He usually has a hammer which he will knock when he accepts a bid

Some auctions only let you place one bid Some let you change your bid if someone else bids higher There is also another kind called a Dutch auction In a Dutch auction the auctioneer starts off with a price that is much too high and gradually makes it lower until somebody makes a bid That person will then buy the thing 

Recently people have also started to do auctions online The most popular online auction place is EBay

A common prank is to fake bid where a person bids an amount and they do not actually pay it This usually occurs when people bid simply to force others to bid higher forcing them to lose more money in the process Occasionally the fake bidder is actually the highest bidder at which point they will promptly leave Although generally frowned upon fake biding is not considered illegall in many countries however legal action may be pursued against the perpetrators 

Advantages of online auctions

DisadvantagesCriticisms of online auctions

Auction sites like garage sales flea markets classified ads and other independent sales venues sometimes draw criminals wishing to sell stolen products

Roman Catholicism is the Christian denomination which claims to date back to the Apostles of two thousand years ago centered in Rome Italy and led by the Bishops and the Pope as their chief

Like other Christians Catholics believe a divine person Jesus Christ is the Son of God Catholics believe that because of his love for all people Jesus Christ died so that all of us will live forever in heaven The Catholic Church teaches that Catholics should follow the example of love Jesus Christ teaches to love each other so much that one is even willing to die for another Catholicism also recognizes the Triune God This consists of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit

The leader of the Roman Catholic church is called the Pope which literally means father Catholics say Jesus Christ established the Catholic Church and appointed the first Pope a person named Saint Peter to lead all Christians Over the next 2000 years different Popes have lead the church The current Pope is called Benedict and he lives in a country called Vatican City a very small country inside the city of Rome Italy In addition to the Roman Catholic Church the Pope also leads the Eastern Catholic churches Together with the Roman Catholic Church they are known as the Catholic Church

Catholics believe that some of the official statements that the Pope makes about their religion are true and cannot be proved incorrect an idea called infallibility Infallibility only occurs when the Pope is speaking Ex Cathedra which is Latin for From the chair The Pope is only infallible in matters of faith and morals

Some of the traditional worship practices of Roman Catholics include making the sign of the cross kneeling bowing and receiving the Eucharist during their worship ceremonies Their main form of worship is called the Mass and is celebrated every day and Catholics are required to attend on Sunday They are also required to attend on Holy Days of obligation In the United States the Holy Days of Obligation are Mary Mother of God The Assumption of Mary The Immaculate Conception The Ascension of Jesus Christmas and All Saints Day These can be remembered by the following phrase 3 for Mary 2 for Jesus and 1 for all the saints While these are all practices of Roman Catholics other Christian churches also use many or all of these same practices Catholics put more emphasis on the Virgin Mary than other Christian sects calling her the Mother of God The Queen of Heaven and praying to her regularly as Mediatrix of graces at a level higher than the mediation of other saints

The Catholic Church celebrates seven sacraments A sacrament is an outward sign instituted by Christ to give grace The seven sacraments are Baptism Confirmation Reconciliation Holy Matrimony Holy Orders Anointing of the Sick and the Most Holy Eucharist The Eucharist is the most important of the sacraments because Catholics believe that Jesus Christ becomes truly present in the form of bread and wine This happens through transubstantiation which takes place in the Mass

Catholics believe in the necessity of love hope and faith in order to gain salvation but that these all come from grace This is different from the 16th century interpretation created by Luther Catholics interpret the Bible by St Augustines rule and by Tradition Tradition is the records of the teachings of the early church especially those before what was in the bible was finalized in the fourth century A basic rule for Catholics is that Truth cannot contradict truth They translated the Bible with this in mind No interpretation of interpretable material can be accepted if it contradicts another revealed truth The Bible is considered revealed

Catholics like Orthodox Christians accept the Nicene Creed a combination of the Council of Nicaea and the later Council of Constantinople as true

We believe in one God the Father the Almighty maker of heaven and earth of all that is seen and unseen We believe in one Lord Jesus Christ the only Son of God eternally begotten of the Father God from God Light from Light true God from true God begotten not made one in being with the Father Through Him all things were made For us men and our salvation He came down from heaven by the power of the Holy Spirit He was born of the Virgin Mary and became man For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate He suffered died and was buried On the third day He rose again in fulfilment of the scriptures He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end We believe in the Holy Spirit the Lord the giver of life who proceeds from the Father and the Son With the Father and the Son He is worshipped and glorified He has spoken through the Prophets We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins We look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come Amen Nicene Creed Catholic Prayers

Eastern Orthodox and Protestant people believe many of the same things They disagree on the role of saints and the role of Mary on what a priest can do and on how exactly God should be worshipped among other things

The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is one of two Special Administrative Regions of the PRC It is one of the richest and most highly developed places in the world Hong Kong grew quicky in the decades after World War II and now has become a famous world class financial center

Hong Kong is divided into 3 main parts

Hong Kong was a British colony since 1842 In 1997 after the Handover Hong Kong became a part of China

Hong Kong is in a sub tropical area and has monsoon winds It is cool and wet in winter hot and rainy from spring through summer and warm sunny and dry in the autumn The rainy season is from May until September In summer and early autumn there is a frequent threat of typhoons

Hong Kong has just reached the 7 million people population in 2009 Most of them are Chinese They mainly speak Cantonese Many people learn English as an additional language

17 days of the year are public holidays in Hong Kong

Hong Kong has two media companies Television Broadcasts Limited and Asia Television Limited They are business rivals

Blitzkrieg is a German word which means lightning war

In a blitzkrieg the attacking armies move very quickly and are helped by tanks and by aircraft Enemy slower moving units are overrun or surrounded They are often captured with little fighting Often the slower units might not be ready to fight when they are captured

It was used by the German army in World War II during the invasions of Poland France and the Soviet Union

The Blitz refers to the German bombing of Britain especially London during World War II which destroyed over a million homes and killed over 40000 people The bombing was supposed to quickly destroy industry and morale and make it easier for the German Army to invade

Towards the end of the war the Allies learned to defeat German blitzkrieg attacks by attacking the sides of the attackers with reserve forces

A Tank is an armoured combat vehicle typically armed with a large cannon and a few machine guns

The first tanks were used by the British during World War I as a way of attacking enemy trenches They were called tanks to trick the Germans into thinking they were water carriers for areas where water was hard to move or find in large amounts

A tank is covered in thick armour to protect it from enemy weapons Tanks have tracks that wrap around its wheels to spread out its weight and let it cross rough ground Most tanks have a powerful gun and one or more machine guns 

A tanks crew is normaly 3 5 men a driver commander and gunner always present usualy a loader who handles the ammunition for the main gun and in WWII some had a man responsible for the radio

Tanks became a main weapon during World War II where battles between great numbers of tanks were fought especially between the Germans and the Soviet Union Well known World War II tanks were the German Panzer IV Panther and Tigers Soviet T 34 British Matilda Churchill and Cromwell and American M4 Sherman and Stuart tanks There where also many plans for very big and powerful tanks called super heavy tanks but these where decided to be of little use as their huge weight would have made moving them very hard and they would have been easy targets for very large weapons that could easily destroy them

Old tanks are often modified for other uses like carrying soldiers or bridges Combat engineers use special tank based vehicles for example minesweeper tanks or bridge layer tanks

The tank is a major part of all large armies today

Modern tanks are all of the Main Battle Tank type Comopared to older types MBTs are very heavy with a 120mm or 125mm calibre cannon and 2 3 machine guns

Edinburgh is the capital city and second largest city in Scotland Edinburgh lies on the east coast where the River Forth flows into the sea 

The central part is Edinburgh Castle at the top of a steep hill The castle has a military display every year called a tattoo where soldiers show their skills at marching and competitions and there are brass bands and bands of bagpipes

Edinburgh has a very large festival every year where thousands of performers come to put on shows The Edinburgh International Festival takes place in August and September At the same time there is the Edinburgh Fringe The shows are of all kinds and range from large ones with famous people to very small ones by new or unknown actors

The city is served by Edinburgh Airport and Haymarket and Waverley railway stations

The citys main football teams are Heart of Midlothian FC and Hibernian FC Murrayfield stadium in the city is the home of the Scottish national rugby team

The serial novel 44 Scotland Street by Alexander McCall Smith took place in New Town Edinburgh

Edinburgh is twinned with

Edinburgh has lots of important buildings The Balmoral Hotel was opened on 15 October 1902 and designed by W Hamilton Beattie Saint Giles Cathedral was built in Mediaeval times There was a big fire there in 1385 The Royal Museum was designed by architect Francis Fowke and built between 1861 and 1888 Its sister museum the Museum of Scotland was designed by Benson and Forsyth in 1998 Holyrood Palace was once the home of the Scottish kings and is open to the public

The head of state of a country is its highest leader However the head of state may not have very much real power

In a modern republic the head of state is a president usually elected by the people or by a parliament In a monarchy the head of state is the king or queen Some countries have different systems  for example the head of state of the Vatican City is the Pope

In a modern monarchy the head of state usually has little real power Instead the most powerful person is the head of government This is usually the leader of the political party that wins the most seats in an election In these cases the king is considered to be the leader of the country but must always take the decisions that the head of government advises them to make The king or queen carries out national ceremonies The United Kingdom works like this with the Prime Minister heading the government

A president may be the most powerful person in the country This is true in the United States However sometimes there is a head of government as well as a president The president then acts very much like a king or queen leaving the real decisions to the head of government The Republic of Ireland works like this 

In older times and some modern countries the head of state has absolute power

Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov better known as Lenin was a Russian lawyer revolutionary and the leader of the Bolshevik party and of the October Revolution He was the first leader of the USSR and the Communist government that took over Russia in 1917 Lenins ideas became known as Leninism

Lenin was born on April 22 1870 in the town of Simbirsk in the Russian Empire His mother was a schoolteacher and his father was an education official

Lenin was good in school and learned the Latin and Greek languages In 1887 he was thrown out of Kazan State University because he protested against the Tsar who was the king of the Russian Empire He continued to read books and study ideas by himself and in 1891 he got a license to become a lawyer

In the same year that Lenin was expelled from University his brother Alexander was hanged for his part in a bomb plot to kill Tsar Alexander III and their sister Anna was sent to Tatarstan This made Lenin furious and he promised to get revenge for his brothers death

While he learned about law in St Petersburg he learned about the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels who were both philosophers from Germany Karl Marxs thoughts were called Marxism To talk or write about Marxism like it was a good thing was illegal in Russia and Lenin was arrested for that and sent to prison in Siberia This punishment was harsh because Siberia is known for being very cold and isolated and almost impossible to escape

In July 1898 when he was still in Siberia Lenin married Nadezhda Krupskaya In 1899 he wrote a book he called The Development of Capitalism in Russia In 1900 Lenin was set free from prison and allowed to go back home He then traveled around Europe He began to publish a Marxist newspaper called Iskra the Russian word for spark or lightning He also became an important member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party or RSDLP

In 1903 Lenin had a major argument with another leader of the party Julius Martov which divided the party in two Lenin wanted a strict system where power would only be given to the government Martov disagreed and wanted the government to give power to ordinary people People who agreed with Martov were called Mensheviks The people who agreed with Lenin were called Bolsheviks

In 1907 he traveled around Europe again and visited many socialist meetings and events During World War I he lived in big European cities like London Paris and Geneva At the beginning of the war a big left wing meeting called the Second International included the Bolsheviks The meeting shut down when a lot of the groups argued whether or not to support the war Lenin and the Bolsheviks were one of only a few groups who were against the war because of their Marxist ideas

In 1917 people started rumors that Lenin had got money from the Germans That made him look bad because a lot of Russians had died fighting Germany in the war The rumors were so bad he was afraid he could get arrested or even killed He left Russia and went to Finland a country right next to Russia where he could hide and carry on with his work on Communism

After Tsar Nicholas II gave up his throne during the February Revolution Lenin went back to Russia where he was still a very important Bolshevik leader He wrote that he wanted a revolution by ordinary workers to overthrow the government that had replaced Nicholas

In October 1917 the Bolsheviks led by Lenin and Trotsky headed the Petrograd Soviet and other Soviets all over Russia in a revolution against Kerenskys government which was known as the October Revolution They won and announced that Russia was a Communist country In November Lenin was chosen as its leader

Because Lenin wanted an end to World War I in Russia he signed the Treaty of Brest Litovsk with Germany in February 1918 While the treaty ended the attack by Germany Russia lost a lot of land that it used for farming

The treaty also made Germanys other enemies angry and together with Russian people who supported the Tsar or Kerenskys government they attacked Russia Lenin made rules that as much food as possible was to be given to Communist soldiers in Russias new Red Army This meant that they won the war but ordinary people were starving and many died of hunger or disease

After the war Lenin brought in the New Economic Policy to try and make things better for the country Some private enterprise was allowed but not much Businessmen known as nepmen could only own small industries not factories

After a woman named Fanny Kaplan shot Lenin in 1918 he started having strokesIn May and December 1922 in March 1923 and in January 1924 which killed him Just before he died Lenin had wanted to get rid of Stalin because he thought he was dangerous to the country and the government

The city of St Petersburg had been renamed Petrograd by the Tsar in 1914 but was renamed Leningrad in memory of Lenin in 1924 When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 Leningrad was again named St Petersburg which it remains to this today

Before Lenin died he said he wished to be buried beside his mother When he died Stalin and his communists let the people in Russia look at his body Because people kept coming they decided not to bury him and preserved his body instead A building was built in Red Square Moscow over the body so that people could see it It is called the Lenin Mausoleum Many Russians and tourists still go there to see his body today

A disease or medical condition is an abnormality of the body or mind that causes pain and discomfort dysfunction distress or death to the person afflicted or those in contact with the person The term is sometimes used broadly to include injuries disabilities disorders syndromes infections symptoms deviant behaviors and atypical variations of structure and function while in other contexts these may be considered separate categories Literally a disease refers to the invasion of the body by pathogens 

One of the most common cause of disease is poor sanitation and lack of clean water Many deadly diseases in tropical areas are spread by the mosquito The mosquito is called a vector There are many kinds of vector other than mosquito examples are snails ticksetc A disease can be caused by many things A person can be infected by infectious agents like bacteria or viruses or fungus Disease can also be caused by eating spoiled foods There are small germs in spoiled foods that can cause diseases Sometimes the germs produce chemicals or toxins which causes the disease Some people are born with genetic diseases These are diseases because of an error or mutation in a persons DNA An example of a mutation is cancer Living or working in an unhealthy environment can also be a cause for diseases Diseases are more common in older people

Some diseases can be helped with medicine Some disease is helped by surgery Not every disease can be helped with medicine or surgery though Some diseases must be treated during the whole life they are chronic diseases An example is diabetes Diabetes can be treated but it can not yet be cured People who usually treat diseases are called doctors or physicians

Some diseases that are common or very bad are tested for even in people who are healthy If these diseases are found early they can be treated before they cause problems An example would be checking a woman for cervical cancer with a test called a pap smear If cervical cancer is found early it can be fixed If it is found later it usually causes death Another example is immunizaion The basic principle is to make the body ready for a disease The body has its own defence against disease called the immune system One special characteristic of the immune system is its ability to remember If a person had been sick before and had recovered the mmune system prduce a substance called antibodies which fight the disease if it comes back to the person The antibody is specific to a particular disease or antigen An example of this is measles which is a virus A person usually a child who had never been sick with measles is given a milder form of the virus this cause the immune sytem to produce antibodies against the measle virus If this person is exposed to the measle virus in the future the persons immune system will remember and will fight the measle virus

For general prevention to be useful it needs to look at diseases that have special characteristics

Carbon is a very important chemical element with a chemical symbol of C All life on Earth is made from it Carbon has atomic mass 12 and atomic number 6 It is non metallic meaning that it is not a metal

Carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen and some other elements like sulfur and phosphorus together form most life on earth Carbon forms a very large number of organic compounds because it can form strong bonds with itself and with other elements Because of the amounts of carbon living things have all organic things are considered carbon based Also each carbon atom can form 4 single covalent bonds Many carbon atoms linked together with hydrogen atoms form plastic Also Carbon is the only element that can form long chain shaped molecules When iron is heated up with carbon hard steel is formed

The name of carbon comes from Latin carbo meaning charcoal In many foreign languages the words for carbon coal and charcoal are synonyms

Carbon in nature is found in three forms called allotropes diamond graphite and fullerenes Graphite with clay is in pencils It is very soft The carbon atoms in it make rings which are on top of each other and slide very easily Diamonds are the hardest natural mineral Fullerenes are a soccer ball shape of carbon They are mostly of interest to science A special man made tube shaped allotrope of carbon is the carbon nanotube Carbon nanotubes are very hard so they might be used in armor Nanotubes might be useful in nanotechnology There are 10 million known carbon compounds

A whole type of Chemistry organic chemistry is about carbon and its compounds Carbon makes many types of compounds Hydrocarbons are molecules with carbon and hydrogen Methane Propane and many other fuels are hydrocarbons Many of the substances that people use daily are organic compounds

Carbon is in many places in the universe It was first made in old stars Carbon is the fourth most common element in the sun Almost all of the atmosphere of Mars is Carbon dioxide

It is important to the human body and it is the second most common element in the human body at 23 of all body weight It is also a key part of many biological molecules

Graphite is in many areas including Sri Lanka Madagascar and Russia Diamonds are rare and are found largely in Africa Carbon is also in some meteorites

Zazaki is a language spoken in eastern Anatolia above the rivers Euphrates and Tigris It belongs to the northwest Iranian group of the Iranian language branch of the Indo European language family The Zaza language is related to Sangsar Mzandarn Tt Semnn Tlesh Kurdish Persian and Balchi An exact indication of the number of Zaza speakers is unknown 

   Zaza is also a name that appears in the Bible meaning belonging to all or plenty 

A chemical reaction happens when one or more chemicals are changed into one or more other chemicals Examples

Some reactions are very fast and others are very slow Some happen at different speeds depending on temperature or other things For example wood does not react with air when it is cold but if it is made hot enough it will start to burn

Some reactions give out energy These are called exothermic In other reactions energy is taken in These are called endothermic

A rectangle is a shape with four sides and four corners The corners are all right angles It follows that the lengths of the pairs of sides opposite each other must be equal

Tables boxes books and paper look like rectangles

A rectangle with all four sides equal in length is called a square

Trafalgar Square is a famous place in the city of London England It is a large pedestrian square bounded on three sides by roads It serves as a refuge and a major traffic intersection It is visited by many tourists Trafalgar Square is the heart of London Very important roads go from the square Whitehall goes to Parliament the Mall goes to Buckingham Palace and the Strand goes to the City of London The square is also close to Covent Garden and Charing Cross station

The square celebrates the Battle of Trafalgar fought in 1805 It contains Nelsons Column a statue of Lord Horatio Nelson mounted on a tall column with four statues of lions around it the column is 56 meters tall while the statue is 5 meters tall The National Art Gallery is there

Since it was first built people have been holding demonstrations in Trafalgar Square Demonstrating in the square has often been banned

Demonstrations were banned in March after Nelsons column was built First Chartist meetings in the square were banned Then all demonstrations were banned The ban lasted until the 1880s when the new Labour movement start to hold demonstrations One group that did this was the Social Democratic Federation

On Black Monday 6 February 1886 there was a major demonstration about unemployment which led to a riot in Pall Mall There were demonstrations in the 1980s against South African apartheid In 1990 there were riots against the Poll tax In the 2000s there have been demonstrations against the Iraq war

In recent years the square has become a gathering place for celebrations When England won the Rugby World Cup in 2003 thousands of fans gathered in the square This public festivities again happened when London won its bid to hold the 2012 Summer Olympic Games

The Square was also scene to a large vigil held soon after the terrorist bombings in London on Thursday 7 July 2005

An official language is a language that has special status in a country Usually the government does its business in the official language They are sometimes named in a countrys constitution Some countries like Canada have more than one Other countries may not have an official language Also the languages do not have to been a written language to be an official language They can be a pidgin language They can also be a sign language

A cake is a type of bread or a bread like food Many cakes are for dessert Sometimes made to celebrate special occasions like a birthday There are many kinds of cakes It can be baked in an oven like bread Some savory cakes are made in a griddle or a frying pan 

Cakes are made by carefully combining wet ingredients together with dry ingredients to make a batter which is then baked in an oven This general process is known as the muffin method because muffins are made this way but they are usually simpler to make 

Just like bread cakes rise in the oven because of many thousands of air bubbles As cakes and breads rise in the oven the air bubbles expand This is why the cake batter expands in the pan There are two ways of forming the air bubbles which create different types of cakes Almost every kind of cake belongs to one of these families

These cakes are made with butter or another fat like vegetable shortening The fat should not be a liquid or a solid at room temperature it should feel like playdough By mixing the sugar with the fat one creates lots of tiny holes which are filled with very small air bubbles Most birthday cakes are made this way Cupcakes are also made this way

Egg foam cakes are made by whipping egg whites for a very long time with sugar to create a very delicate and light batter These cakes are typically much taller lighter and often spongier than creamed fat cakes A common example of an egg foam cake is angelfood cake which can be found at most grocery stores with bakeries Chiffon cake is another good example

After a cake has been baked and cooled for a while some bakers add a frosting on top to make it look better Sometimes people cut it in slices and fill those slices with more frosting or a fruit filling Birthday cakes are sometimes decorated with candles Often cakes are topped with small pieces of fruit such as raspberries

A large rich cake is often called by the French word for cake gteaufactdateOctober 2011 It may have a lot of cream

A house is a building that is made for people to live in It is a permanent building that is meant to stay standing It is not a place to live that can be easily packed up and carried away like a tent or moved like a caravan If people live in the same house for more than a short stay then they call it their home

Houses come in many different shapes and sizes They may be as small as just one room or they may have hundreds of rooms They also come in many different shapes and may have just one level or several different levels A house is sometimes joined to other houses at the sides to make row houses but it is not part of a big building with lots of levels That type of home is called an apartment or a flat or a unit One of the differences between a house and an apartment is that a house has a front door to the outside world whereas the main door of an apartment usually opens onto a passage or landing that can be used by other people in the building

Houses have a roof to keep off the rain and sun and walls to keep out the wind and cold They have window openings to let in light and a floor Houses of different countries look different to each other because of different materials and different styles 

A house is a building for people to live in It is usually built for a family to live in Most modern houses have special areas or rooms for a person or a family group to do the things that they need to live comfortably A modern house has a place to cook food a place to eat places to sleep and a place to wash These things are usually done in separate rooms which are called the kitchen the sitting room the bedrooms the bathroom and the toilet Many houses have a separate dining room for eating meals and a separate laundry where the clothes are washed In some houses the toilet is in the bathroom and in other houses it is separate Many houses may also have a study or computer room and a family room where the children can play games and watch television 

In some countries such as the United States Canada Australia and New Zealand many families live in a detached house which is separate from other buildings and surrounded by its own yard but is close enough to town to have shops good transport and entertainment nearby In many other countries including most of Europe owning a house like this is something that only the richer families can afford and is just a dream for most people 

In many very poor countries a lot of people live crowded in houses with only one room They often have to share a toilet with many other families and have to do the cooking outside The house might be made of materials that can be found nearby like mud bricks and grass or from second hand materials like corrugated iron and cardboard boxes In many cities there are thousands of small houses crowded together with narrow alleys between them 

A small house is often called a cottage In England where this word comes from it is used to mean a house that has one main storey with a second lower storey of bedrooms which fit under the roof upstairs Cottages are usually found in villages or in the countryside They are nearly always built from material that can be found nearby In many places the word cottage is used to mean a small old fashioned house In the United States the word cottage is often used to mean a small holiday home

A semi detached house is a building that has two houses side by side and covered over by just one big roof Each house has a pathway to one side leading from the front to the backyard Semi detached houses are very common in some cities and can be single storey or several storeys high

A rowhouse which is sometimes called a terrace house is a house that is part of a row of houses which are joined at the side walls Many cities and towns have thousands of row houses because they are a good way to build lots of houses close together Many row houses have two rooms downstairs and two rooms upstairs with a kitchen or wash area out the back Houses like this were built for poor factory workers and coal miners in many cities and towns 

Rowhouses are not always small Some cities have large beautiful rowhouses like the Royal Crescent which was built 200 years ago at Bath in England and is a famous example of Georgian architecture

In some places the word bungalow is used for any house that is all on one level The word came from India and for a long time was used for a house that is built all on one level and has a verandah where people can sit or work outdoors but under a shady roof A bungalow often has a hall down the middle of the house to let the breeze blow through Bungalows are often seen in countries with hot summers in India South East Asia South Africa parts of the United States South America Australia and New Zealand In regions with flooding a bungalow is often built up on wooden stilts or a high basement In the 1800s bungalows were nearly always built of wood but from the 1920s it became fashionable to build them of brick as well 

A farmhouse may look like a cottage a bungalow or a mansion but in many countries a farmhouse can look quite different to a house in a town because as well as having a place for people to live it also has a place for animals Three typical types of farmhouses are found Many farm houses are long and have two doors One door leads to the rooms used by the family The other door opens into a stable for the cows sheep and chickens The stable part often has a loft where hay can be kept to feed the animals in the winter Another type of farmhouse has two storeys with a big stable and storeroom underneath with the rooms for the family on the upper floor Another type of farmhouse has buildings such as the family house the barn and the stable all joined together around a central courtyard Old farmhouses of these three types can be found in many parts of Europe and Great Britain

A mansion is a big grand house usually with two storeys and sometimes more A mansion often has beautiful architecture and shows that the person for whom it was designed and built was rich Mansions often have beautiful gardens Sometimes a mansion does not belong to a private family but to a town council to a big business company to a church or college and is a place for a person with an important job to live and to entertain guests A mansion often has rooms which are not found in ordinary houses such as a drawing room a ballroom a library and a music room Mansions often need servants to help keep them in order and there are often special rooms where the servants do particular jobs such as cleaning the silver tableware Well known mansions are the White House in Washington DC where the President of the United States lives and Mansion House in London where the Lord Mayor of London lives 

A palace is a house that is very grand Palaces are some of the most famous and beautiful houses in the world 

They have often been built by people who were extremely rich and who wanted to leave behind them a sign that their family was important Some palaces have taken a long time to build They have been changed and added to by different family members or changed by people from different families that have owned them over many hundreds of years 

One of the best known palaces in the world is Buckingham Palace where the monarch of England who is currently Queen Elizabeth II lives The largest palace in the world is the Louvre which was built in Paris for the Kings of France It now holds a famous art gallery

Houses are usually built from types of material that can easily be made or bought near the place where the house is built Because of this old houses in different towns and different villages look quite different to each other even in the same country In modern times building materials can be transported easily and this means that a builder has much more choice about the types of material to use for a house 

In many parts of the world mud or clay are the main building materials Clay is a type of soil that sticks together more strongly than most other types of soil There are three main ways of building walls with mud and clay 

Houses made of timber are found wherever there are or there has once been big forests Timber houses are also often found in seaside towns where the sea air makes brick and stone houses feel cold and damp 

A well known type of old fashioned house is the half timbered house These are seen in the British Isles France and across northern Europe and the Alps These houses date mainly from about 1200 to about 1800 

In places where there is lots of stone many houses are built of it In many parts of the world little cottages are built of stone Many mansions and palaces are also built of stone 

Modern houses are often made of pre fabricated parts that are partly built in a factory and are easy to put together at the site of the building Many different types of materials for making houses have been developed in the 20th century 

A gigabyte is a unit of measurement in computers and similar electronic devices At first it meant exactly 1 billion bytes usually referring to the number of bytes in a computer hard drive Its meaning gradually changed over time so that today it is often used to mean 1073741824 bytes especially when referring to the random access memory of a modern computer Now some people say a gigabyte should only be used to mean exactly 1 billion bytes and that gibibyte is a better name for 1073741824 bytes In everyday use people use gigabyte to mean 1073741824 bytes when talking about computer memory and 1000000000 bytes when talking about computer disk space

This measurement is often used when measuring the capacity of computer memory hard drives or other storage devices

A sailor is a person who works under a captain to sail a ship Sailor is also the lowest rank in a navy

A farmer is a person who grows crops and raises animals to be used as food This has been a common job for people since the beginning of civilization

The word farmer usually refers to a person who has a field orchard vineyard or garden where food is grown This food is eaten or sold after it is harvested Farmers may also grow raw materials for industrial purposes Some examples of raw materials that are used in this way are

Some farmers also raise animals to be used for meat milk eggs or other things

A constellation is a group of stars usually in a recognizable shape or pattern Together the stars look like a picture The word constellation comes from Latin con meaning together and stella meaning stars Some examples of constellations are Ursa Major Orion and Andromeda

People used constellations to tell the difference in the colors Different places in the world may have different constellations but today astronomy has a fixed set of 88 constellations This set is based on the Greek set and later some southern constellations were added for example Antlia  the air pump Most constellations have names that come from Greek mythology like Orion or Andromeda

There are 12 constellations in the Zodiac The Sun travels through the Zodiac once each year There is also a thirteenth constellation Ophiuchus  the carrier of a serpent which the Sun goes through However most people do not think that it is in the Zodiac

No one is exactly sure who saw the first constellations

Sometimes a river receives a lot of extra water either from lots of rain or other natural disasters When this happens the water overflows from its normal path in the river bed and possibly onto dry land This is called flooding

During a flood people should move themselves and their most precious valuables to higher ground quickly The process of leaving your home behind in search of a safe place is called evacuation

During a flood there is plenty of water but it is mostly polluted and not safe to drink If people drink the contaminated water they may suffer from illnesses or diseases such as typhoid and cholera People can prepare for flooding by filling many containers with fresh clean drinking water or using sandbags A flood is an overflow or accumulation of an expanse of water that submerges land In the sense of flowing water the word may also mean the inflow of the tide Flooding usually results from the volume of water within a body of water such as a river or lake which overflows The result is that some of the water escapes its usual boundaries Floods can also occur in rivers when the strength of the river is so high it flows out of the river channel particularly at bends or meanders and causes damage to homes and businesses along such rivers While flood damage can be eliminated by moving away from rivers and other lakes people have lived and worked by the water to seek sustenance and capitalize on the gains of cheap and easy travel and commerce easily by being near water 

Queensland floods are hurting Australias Gross Domestic Product by wiping as much as 9 billion off export revenues

Operations at at least 40 coal mines in central Queenslands Bowen Basin have been disrupted because of the floods Crops have been damaged and grazing lands are under water

In many religions Hell is a place where souls of dead people go after their lives end It is often thought of as the opposite of Heaven and a place where no love and no God is In many religions Hell is the place where the souls of dead people go if they have done evil things in life It is used in the Old Testament to translate the Hebrew Sheol and in the New Testament the Greek Hades and Hebrew Gehenna

Many believe that Jews do not believe in Hell but Jews really do believe But it does not consist of eternal torture Rather there are lower levels of Heaven that a person can descend to considering the number of mitzvot that they have obeyed Gemorah writings tell the Jews of devil beliefs but these are stories and are taken lightly Jews also believe that Satan did exist but he was an angel that quarreled with God such as the story of Job

In Hebrew the word for the grave is used for the place where people go when they die

In Christianity Hell is usually the place where the souls of people go who did not accept Jesus or broke important rules set forth by God In Hell souls suffer and wait for the Last Judgement a time when the souls of the dead will be judged by God The concept of Hell in Christianity comes from the Bible and the casting out of Lucifer In being cast out he was removed from the presence of God Therefore if taken in its most literal sense Hell is separation from God Stated another way to the Christian mind being separated from God is to be in Hell Some Christians believe that Hell has real fire and flames but others do not

Many Christian groups believe that once a soul goes to Hell it stays there forever and cannot leave However some Christian groups do not believe this Mormons for example think Hell is only a temporary place and that souls may leave Hell at some point Other Christians believe that those who do not go to Heaven simply stop existing and do not go to Hell These Christians are called annihilationists

The telephone number 1 1 2 is also the standard European Union emergency telephone number it works in every country of the EU for land lines and mobile phones It is also used in some other countries as the emergency telephone number for both mobile and fixed line telephones

112 is also the international emergency telephone number for all GSM mobile phone networks It does not necessarily work on other mobile phone technologies outside the EU

A government in exile is a group of people who claim they are the real government of a country but who live in another country These were common during World War II The Germans took over several countries and the leaders of those countries went to England for refuge

Today there are some governments in exile They include

Few countries recognize these groups

Stonehenge is a prehistoric site two miles north of Salisbury in Wiltshire in England It is made of a henge with standing stones in circles 

There were three main building phases each between about 3100 BC and 1950 BC The first circle 3000 BC was made of timber The post holes for the timber have been found Around 2600 BC the builders gave up timber in favour of stone Most of the construction took place between 2640 and 2480 BC 

The first stone circle was a set of bluestones The holes held up to 80 standing stones only 43 of which can be traced today The bluestones were thought for much of the 20th century to have been brought from the Preseli Hills 160 miles away in modern day Pembrokeshire Wales Another theory is that they were brought much nearer to the site as glacial erratics by the Irish Sea Glacier

Later 2400 BC 30 huge grey sarsen stones were brought to the site They were erected in a circle 33 metres in diameter with lintels on top of the standing stones The remaining blue circles were placed as an inner circle The site was in use until the Bronze Age The modern Stonehenge consists entirely of original stones some of which have been replaced in upright position

There are also several passage tombs and many tumuli nearby

No one knows who built Stonehenge or why they built it During the summer solstice the sunrise lines up with some of the stones in a particular way This suggests that the arrangement of stones may work as a calendar In Egypt and South America similar ancient buildings can be found They also show the time of the solstice 

Stonehenge itself is owned by the Crown and managed by English Heritage while the surrounding land is owned by the National Trust 

The UNESCO World Heritage Site includes Avebury and Stonhenge together though they are quite distinct sites Stonehenge however does have a number of satellite structures which are part of the ritual landscape

Granite is a kind of igneous rock It is formed from hot molten magma 

The magma is forced between other layers of rock by the pressure under the Earths surface The magma cools and turns slowly into solid stone Granite has many different types of minerals in it These include quartz feldspar hornblende and sometimes mica As the magma cools these minerals form crystals The crystals can be seen easily if the granite is cut and polished 

Granite is a common stone on Earth and makes up a big part of the crust Although it forms under the surface of the Earth there are many places where it has been forced upwards by tectonic movement This is the cracking and folding of the Earths crust When this happens granite mountains can be formed

Kitchen benches are often made of polished granite Granite is found in many countries of the world Some countries have beautifully patterned granite which is quarried and sold for building material

Immanuel Kant was a German philosopher He was born in Knigsberg Prussia and also died there Kant studied philosophy in the university there and later became a professor of philosophy

Today the town Knigsberg is part of Russia and is renamed Kaliningrad When Kant was alive it was the second largest city in the kingdom of Prussia 

Immanuel Kant was born on April 22 1724 His father was Johann Georg Kant In 1732 he was sent to Fredericks college a school directed by the Kant familys pastor Franz Albert Schultz In 1740 he entered the Albertus University in Knigsberg and studied the philosophy of Gottfried Leibniz and his follower Christian Wolff He studied there until 1746 when his father died then left Knigsberg to take up a job as tutor After a time he became the tutor of Count Kayserling and his family In 1755 Kant became a lecturer and stayed in this position until 1770 He was made the second librarian of the Royal Library in 1766 Kant was eventually given the Chair of Logic and Metaphysics at the University of Knigsberg In his entire life Kant never travelled more than seventy miles from the city of Knigsberg Kant died on February 12 1804 with the final word EnoughfactdateDecember 2010

After finishing his study in the university Kant hoped to be a teacher of philosophy but it was very difficult He could have lived a life of private lecturer for a long time He was offered a job as professor of poetry in Knigsberg university but he turned it down Later in 1770 he became a full professor of philosophy in Knigsberg university

The young Kant was interested in physics both of heavenly bodies and the earth He wrote some papers about this but he became more interested in metaphysics He was eager to learn the nature of human experience how humans could know something and what their knowledge was based on

Under the strong influence of the philosophical system of Leibniz and Wolff Kant began to doubt the basic answers of past philosophers Then Kant read a Scottish philosopher David Hume Hume had tried to make clear what our experience had been and had reached a very strong opinion called skepticism that there was nothing to make our experience sure Kant was very shocked by Hume and saw the theory he had learned in a new point of view He began to try finding a third way other than the two that Kant called skepticism and dogmaticism

Kant read another thinker named Jean Jacques Rousseau His thought on human beings especially on moral and human freedom impressed Kant

Some scholars like to include Kant as one of the German idealists but Kant himself did not belong to that group The most known work of Kant is the book Critique of the pure reason that Kant published in 1781 Kant called his way of thought critique not philosophy Kant said that critique was a preparation for establishment of real philosophy According to Kant for that establishment people should know what human reason can do and which limits it has In Critique of Pure Reason Kant wrote several limits of human reason to both feeling and thinking something For sensation there are two limits inside of human reason space and time There are no physical objects but the limitations of our mind that work whenever we feel something through our senses For thinking he said there are twelve categories or pure rational concepts divided into four fields quantity quality relation and modality Kant thought human reason applied those ideas to everything

Is what we think only our fantasy Kant said No although without those sensual and rational limitations we can think nothing then Kant was convinced there would be something we could not know directly behind our limitations and even with limitations we could know something It can not be a personal fantasy either since those limitations were common to all human reason before our particular experience Kant called what we could not know directly Ding an sich  thing itself We can think thing itself but cannot have any experience about it nor know it God the eternity of soul life after death such things belong to thing itself so they were not right objects of philosophy according to Kant although people had liked to discuss them from ancient times

Kant wrote two other books named Critique too Critique of the practical reason and Critique of the Judgement In Critique of the practical reason Kant wrote about the problem of freedom and God It was his main work of ethics In Critique of the Judgement Kant wrote about beauty and teleology or the problem if there was a purpose in general if the world a living creature had a reason to exist and so on In both books Kant said we could not answer those problems because they were concerned with thing itself

Kant had a great influence on other thinkers In the 19th century German philosophers like Fichte Schelling Hegel and writers like Herder Schiller and Goethe were influenced by Kant  

In the early 20th century Kants ideas were very influential on one group of German philosophers They became known as the new Kantians One of them Windelband said every philosophy before Kant poured into Kant and every philosophy after Kant pours from Kant 

Kant has influenced many modern thinkers including Hannah Arendt and John Rawls

An aunt is a name used in an extended family An aunt is either a sister of one of someones parents or the wife of their uncle That person is the aunts nephew or niece An aunts child is a cousin 

Homer is the name of the Greek poet who wrote the epic poems the Iliad and the Odyssey These are the earliest works of Greek literature which have survived to the present day and are among the greatest treasures of the ancient world They are a product of Mycenaean culture The Iliad tells the story of the Trojan war which took place around 1190 BC The manuscripts of Homer were written much later probably later than 800 BC 

What makes the history of this period so difficult is that the Mycenaean civilization was followed by several hundred years of decline from which little or no writing has survived This period the Greek Dark Age ended around 800 BC when once again we find Greek writing though this time in their newly developed alphabetic script Therefore there is a distinct possibility that the Homeric epics had a life perhaps a long life as oral literature spoken by story tellers

We know little about Homer and the later Greeks also knew little about him Some have doubted he was a real person others think he was a woman A legend has it that he was a blind poet who lived in Ionia There is no definite evidence for any of these ideas

There is archaeological evidence that Troy existed The site of Troy has been discovered and excavated Therefore it is a fair guess that the epic began as a long oral poem based on the siege of Troy but with details added and changed as time went on Virtually every feature of Homers poetry is due to the economy forced on it by oral methods of composition

The date of Homers existence is not known Herodotus said that Homer lived 400 years before his own time which would place him at around 850 BC but other ancient sources gave dates much closer to the time of the Trojan War The date of the Trojan War was given as 11941184 BC by Eratosthenes

Today the date of Homer means the date of the writing down the oral poems rather than the life of Homer This is called the transcription date The language suggests that the earliest possible date for the transcription is 800 BC and the latest possible date is 600 AD

Donatien Alphonse Franois Comte de Sade better known as the Marquis de Sade was a French nobleman dramatist and philosopher The House Sade were French nobility who originated in the Provence Different members of the house held positions in the Church and the French state at different times 

Once Donatien had grown up he had troubles with the authorities several times He spent quite a few years in prison

The main points he was accused of were

On one of his escapades he accidentally raped a close relative of his who was a nun This caused his family to drop him and to hand him over to the authorities 

For this he was sentenced to death He later escaped the death penalty by moving to Italy The death penalty against him was later changed to a prison sentence

In prison he started to read about philosophy He also started to write down his ideas He tried to hide his writing and also wrote in a very small print so that the consumption of paper would not be noticed 

In later years he was moved to an asylum and gave his wife the possibility of a divorce

After the French Revolution he got out of the asylum but in 1803 was declared mentally ill He died in the asylum in 1814 at the age of 74

The term sadism was created after Donatien Alphonse de Sade because of his practice of brutality through his long life

Ordinal numbers are numbers that show somethings order for example 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th

Suppose a person has four different T shirts and then lays them in front of the person from left to right

If the person then starts counting the shirts from the left he would first see the red shirt So the red shirt is the first T shirt The blue shirt is the second T shirt The yellow shirt is the third one and the white T shirt is the fourth one

The first second third and fourth in this case are ordinal numbers They result from the fact that the person has many objects and they give them an order The person then simply counts those objects and gives the ordinal numbers to them

The word Gnome can mean different things

A republic is a type of government that has no king queen or other monarch and where the people are sovereign This means that people can choose leaders to represent them and make the laws The word republic comes from the Latin language words res publica which means public thing

Countries with a king or other monarch and free elections are called Constitutional Monarchies What makes a republic different is that the people do not need the permission of a king or other higher power to choose leaders and the type of government they want Laws are made and enforced in the name of the people

The Head of State in a republic is generally a person who has been chosen by the citizens either by direct election or by a group of elected representatives to act as the top representative of the people In most republics the Head of State is called the president In some countries the president is elected and has a lot of political power In others the president does not hold a lot of direct power but is important in the legal system for other reasons

Licchavi in India was the first republic in the 6th and 5th century BCE The other earliest republics were Greek settlements in the Mediterranean sea The biggest difference from other city states that were around then was that people could choose their leaders by voting for them The votes were then counted and the person with the most votes won

Martin Luther was a German monk and theologian of Christianity He is credited with starting the Protestant Reformation As this happened what are now called Protestant churches split from the Roman Catholic church He started the Lutheran Church the first church of Protestantism

Luther studied philosophy at the University of Erfurt In 1505 he entered into the Augustinian Order as a monk Luther studied theology and ancient languages in Erfurt In 1512 he became a doctor of theology in Wittenberg and began his lectures on the Psalms and Letters of Paul

In October 1517 Luther wrote his 95 Theses Many people think that he put them on the door of a church in Wittenberg but this is not sure Instead he published a copy Luther called them The Disputation of Doctor Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences It questioned the teaching of the western Church and its ideas about penance the authority of the Pope and the usefulness of indulgences At that time the Catholic Church was saying that they were allowed to decide who could go to Heaven after death and they were selling indulgences for money to tell them they could go to Heaven If that was true it would mean that poor people would not be able to go to Heaven but that the priests in the church would be rich from selling these things Luther thought that this was all wrong and was against the Bible

After studying the Letters of Paul especially the Letter to Romans Luther came up with an idea called sola fide This means that faith is the only way that people can get salvation from God According to sola fide this would mean that many church customs were useless and should be cast away

First Luther believed that he could reform the Roman Church from the inside with his Theses but the Papacy took his attitude as heresy and excommunicated him on June 15 1520 with a paper saying he did not have their permission to go to Heaven In October Luther burned the paper in public and showed he would not obey the Church unless they accepted his words

Emperor Charles V Opened the imperial Diet of Worms on 22 January 1521 to hear the case For Luther it was the last chance to say he had been wrong But he did not change his mind The Diet declared Luther an outlaw

With the help of a friend Luther hid in Wartburg Castle near Erfurt In the castle he translated the Bible First he wrote the New Testament in German instead of the original Greek Later he translated the Old Testament into German too Until then the Holy Mass and the Bible were in Latin Very few people understood it Most people went to Mass and did not understand what the priest said because they did not speak Latin Luther translated the Bible so that more people could read and understand it That way they were no longer depending on the priest to tell them what was in the Bible but could read it themselves

Luther started his own church called the Lutheran Church with his friend Philip Melanchton Luther died in 1546

From the Bible Luther formed firm ideas about families Luther knew that what a child learned at home would greatly influence his life He said in Table Talks Sermons very little edify children who learn little thereby it is more needful they be taught and well instructed in schools and at home and that they be learned and examined what they have learned this way profits much tis very wearisome but very necessary Luther also preached against the Catholic Churchs demands that ministers remain single After hearing his preaching many nuns wrote to him to ask for help in escaping their convents Luther helped nine nuns escape one convent On April 4 1524 Luther had a friend help the nuns sneak over the wall and then hid them in barrels on a wagon until they were out of the city One of these nuns was Katherine von Bora

After finding husbands for the nuns whose families would not accept them Luther had to find a husband for Katherine von Bora Katherine however not only rejected a match Luther arranged for her but said she would accept only Luther or another pastor named Amsdorf as her husband

At first Luther did not really like Katherine and supposed she was proud and haughty His feelings changed though and they married on June 13 1525 Luther later said And thank God it hath turned out well for I have a pious and faithful wife to whom one may safely commit his heart 

They had six children On June 6 1526 Luther wrote I am a happy husbandfor from the most precious woman my best of wives I have received by the blessing of God a little son John Luther and by Gods wonderful grace I have become a father 

The firstborn was John Luther The next was a daughter Elizabeth but Elizabeth died when she was just eight months old and Luther wrote in a letter My little daughter Elizabeth is taken from me and hath left me with a bleeding and almost womanly heart so sad am I on her account I never thought the heart of a father was so tender towards his children Pray the Lord for me A third child Magdalene also died young After Magdalene came Martin then Paul and finally Margaret It was for his children that Luther wrote the Small Catechism  a book showing the basics of Lutheran beliefs

Since the time of the silent films there existing films to the biography of Martin Luther The newest film is called Luther It was released in 2003

Liberalism is a way of thinking about politics and government Liberalism sees the personal freedom and equality as one of the highest goods

Some liberals believe that freedom is impossible without equality and that governments should promote equality by providing education and health care supported by taxes Other liberals believe that taxes are bad and that people should provide their own education and health care these people are usually called libertarians today Most liberal governments today do provide at least some education and health care though not necessarily equally for all citizens

Other concepts important to some liberals include

In the old days kings or queens told people what to do and there was very little freedom A few hundred years ago philosophers such as Simn Bolvar John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham began to write about freedom Earlier writers such as Marcus Aurelius had written about freedom but this time the idea caught on The United States of America was the first country to have a constitution which was based on the ideas of Mill and Bentham and which guaranteed certain rights to all citizens including freedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of religion the right to assemble the right to bear arms and the right to ask their government to take action or to remove from office rulers they did not like

Another idea that became popular around this time was the idea of free trade A leading philosopher who promoted free trade was Adam Smith

Most of the wealthy countries in the world today are liberal democracies with more or less free trade An exception to this rule are the oil rich countries not all of which are liberal or democratic Most of the poor countries in the world are dictatorships with heavy restrictions on trade China is a poor country which is rapidly becoming rich and is trying the experiment of combining dictatorship with free trade Whether it is possible to have the advantages of free trade without other freedoms remains to be seen

While all liberal governments support free elections other ideas of liberal government vary a great deal from country to country For information about liberalism in a particular country look for an article called Liberalism in and then the name of the country

The government of the United States was created based on a belief in Democracy and personal freedom However the word liberalism has taken on a different meaning in modern times Liberals in the United States still believe in supporting democracy and freedom however many liberals also support other ideas While not all liberals agree on everything most liberals in the United States agree

Liberals in the United States are also sometimes called Progressives The biggest liberal political party in the United States is the Democratic Party To the contrary the Green Party are thought to be more left or liberal than Democrats

Liberals in Australia have many different ideas about government than liberals in the United States Most liberals in Australia believe that government should not increase taxes and would like a government that has lower taxes and less power over the economy The main liberal political party in Australia is the Liberal Party of Australia The Liberal Party also believes that government should support traditional values and morals something which many conservatives believe as well

Zenos Paradoxes are a famous set of thought provoking stories or puzzles created by Zeno of Elea in the mid 5th century BC Philosophers physicists and mathematicians have argued over how to answer the questions raised by Zenos Paradoxes for two and a half millennia Although the specifics of each paradox differ from one another they all deal with the tension between the apparent continuous nature of the universe and the discrete or incremental nature of mathematics and physics

The most famous of Zenos Paradoxes is called Achilles and the Tortoise The story goes that if Achilles were to race a tortoise but the tortoise were given a head start Achilles could never catch the tortoise no matter how fast or how long Achilles ran This is of course at odds with common sense and observation which conclude that Achilles will eventually catch up with and pass the tortoise However the paradox lies upon a purely mathematical inspection of this scenario

In order for Achilles to catch the tortoise he must of course cover some distance A between where he began the race and where the reptilian racer began ahead of him However in the time Achilles traversed A the shelled shlepper traveled a second distance B Of course Achilles is undaunted because B is less than A and brings himself to the point where he has gone the distance A B To the champions chagrine the tortoise has not yet given up and in the time Achilles took to cover B has continued to travel to C This progression can be carried out ad infinitum and it can be shown that mathematically speaking there is an infinite number of time intervals andor distances which Achilles must endure to catch his intrepid opponent

This then is where Zenos paradox lies both pictures of reality cannot be true at the same time Hence either

1 There is something wrong with the way we perceive the continuous nature of time 2 In reality there is no such thing as a discrete or incremental amounts of time distance or perhaps anything else for that matter or 3 There is a third picture of reality that unifies the two pictures the mathematical one and the common sense or philosophical one that we do not yet have the tools to fully understand

Suppose someone wishes to get from point A to point B Well first they must move halfway Then they must go half of the remaining way And so forth never actually reaching the ending So motion from any point A to any different point B is impossible A common response to such a problem is to point at calculus we can add up infinite series like 1121418116 to get 2 However the basic question Zeno is asking is how one can deal with an infinite progression with doing each element individually Using calculus does not actually involve adding up infinite numbers one number at a time Instead it adds up a large group of numbers all at once The quantum physicists respond to this paradox by saying that Zenos premise was incorrect That is it is not always necessary that for a point A and a point B that one can go halfway between them before getting to point B

Mandrake is the common name of a number of plants in the Nightshade family genus Mandragora The roots often look like man or woman or can be easily made to resemble them The plant has been used in witchcraft for a long time 

According to this literature the plant shrieks in pain when it is pulled from the ground This shriek is able to make a person deaf He might also loose his mind or even be killed if he is unprotected 

Mandrake has been used as an anaestethic for a long time For this it was usually prepared in an alcoholic solution

Debian is a free operating system which is the Linux kernel and application software run on its kernel Much of the application and utility software was done by the GNU project so Debian Linux is more correctly called Debian GNULinux It is one of the most complete and popular Linux distributions on which many others like Ubuntu are based upon

The Debian Project officially started on August 16th 1993 led by Ian Murdock He is a computer programmer Today in this project Debian is developed by more than 1000 computer specialists all over the world 

The name Debian was taken after Ian Murdock and his wife Debra Some people say or pronounce deb ee n but others also say de bi an or de bai an and in Japan de bi a n and so on

Software packages in development are either uploaded to the project distribution named unstable or to the experimental repository Software packages uploaded to unstable are normally versions stable enough to be released by the original upstream developer but with the added Debian specific packaging and other modifications introduced by Debian developers These additions may be new and untested Software not ready yet for the unstable distribution is typically placed in the experimental repository

After a version of a software package has remained in unstable for a certain length of time that package is automatically moved to the testing distribution The packages move to testing happens only if no serious bugs in the package are reported and if other software needed for package functionality qualifies for inclusion in testing

Since updates to Debian software packages between official releases do not contain new features some choose to use the testing and unstable distributions for their newer packages However these distributions are less tested than stable and unstable does not receive timely security updates In particular incautious upgrades to working unstable packages can sometimes seriously break software functionality Since September 9 2005 the testing distributions security updates have been provided by the testing security team

After the packages in testing have matured and the goals for the next release are met the testing distribution becomes the next stable release The latest stable release of Debian is 60 released on February 6 2011 The next release is codenamed Wheezy

Debian has made ten major stable releases 

Due to an incident involving a CD vendor who made an unofficial and broken release labeled 10 an official 10 release was never made

GNU is the name of a computer operating system The name is short for GNUs Not Unix Richard Stallman leads the project working on GNU known as the GNU Project It was created to replace the UNIX operating system with all free and open source software People often mistakingly call it Linux

People have been working on GNU since it was started in 1983 but it is still being worked on The central part of the operating system called the Kernel is not finished and lots of people use Linux as the kernel with GNU Software that runs on the GNU system often has been made for other computer software systems like Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X and is often compatible with other systems inspired by UNIX

Cancer is a class of diseases or disorders It is when the body has no control over cells that begin to split In cancer body cells copy their contents They then make new cells with these copies These cells are able to go into other tissues They go into other tissues by growing into them They can also go into other tissues by putting themselves into far away places by metastasis Metastasis is the process in which cancer cells move through the bloodstream or lymphatic system Cancer can affect anybody at any age People are more likely to get it as they get older This is because DNA damage becomes more apparent in older DNA An exception is testicular cancer It is more common in young men Cancer is one of the biggest and most researched causes of death in developed countries

Cancer is a leading cause of death It causes about 125 of all deaths worldwide This is according to the World Health Organization There are some things that can be causes or triggers of different types of cancer They include tobacco lots of sunlight radiation chemicals used in building and manufacturing high fat or low fiber diets air and water pollution people who eat very little fruits and vegetables obesity not enough physical activity drinking too much alcohol and household use of some chemicals Some cancers can also be caused by viruses

There are lots of different kinds of cancers Some of the most common include breast cancer brain cancer leukemia testicular cancer mesothelioma and lung cancer Breast cancer begins in the breast It can be found in anybody at anytime It can also be found in men Brain cancer starts in the brain Testicular cancer starts in the testicles It is most common in young men Mesothelioma and lung cancer start in the lungs Mesothelioma is usually caused by exposure to asbestos

There is no cure for cancer Cancer can sometimes be treated using radiotherapy chemotherapy or immunotherapy In some cases it is possible to use surgery to remove a part of the tumor But this is not the end of treatment After surgery patient has radio or chemotherapy to prevent the tumor growing once again

One hard problem in treating cancer is that most things that kill cancer also kill normal cells Cancerous cells are often quite weak Since the cancer is actually a part of the body the body will not attack it even though the cancer often could easily kill the body Another hard problem in treating cancer is that there are many different types of cancer Each have their own symptoms and causes Some people can handle cancer better than others However it is harmful to everybody It can be fatal 

There is always progress in finding treatment Many cancers are treated successfully For example a study showed that if someone with lymphedema lifts weights they be able to fight cancer better than somebody who does not

The Greek term carcinoma is a medical term It is used for a malignant tumour from epithelial cells Celsus translated the Greek word carcinos into the Latin cancer Cancer also means crab Galen used oncos to describe all tumours This is the origin for the current word oncology

Hippocrates named many kinds of cancer He called benign tumours oncos In Greek oncos means swelling He called malignant tumours carcinos This means crab or crayfish in Greek The veins of the cut surface of solid malignant tumor looks like a crab the veins stretched on all sides as the animal the crab has its feet whence it derives its name He later added oma after the word It is Greek for swelling This has given the name carcinoma Hippocrates only described and made drawings of tumors he saw from outside This is because the Greeks did not open up the body He drew tumors that were on the skin nose and breasts People were treated based on the humor theory The humor theory describes four bodily fluids The patients treatment was made up of diet blood letting andor laxatives The treatment was according to the patients humor Through the centuries it was discovered that cancer could occur anywhere in the body The humor theory treatment was popular until the 19th century with the discovery of cells

The oldest known description and surgical treatment of cancer was discovered in Egypt It dates back to approximately 1600 BC The Papyrus describes eight cases of ulcers of the breast They were treated by cauterization They used a tool called the fire drill The writing says about the disease There is no treatment

Another very early surgical treatment for cancer was described in the 1020s It was described by Avicenna in The Canon of Medicine He stated that the removal should be radical and that all diseased tissue should be removed This included the use of amputation or the removal of veins running in the direction of the tumor He also recommended the use of cauterization for the area treated if necessary

In the 16th and 17th centuries it became more acceptable for doctors to dissect bodies to discover the cause of death The German professor Wilhelm Fabry believed that breast cancer was caused by a milk clot in a mammary duct The Dutch professor Francois de la Boe Sylvius believed that all disease was the outcome of chemical processes He believed that acidic lymph fluid was the cause of cancer He was a follower of Descartes Nicolaes Tulp believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads He said that it was contagious He lived at the same time as Sylvius

British surgeon Percivall Pott was the first to find a cause for cancer In 1775 he discovered that cancer of the scrotum was a common disease among chimney sweeps The work of other physicians led to different views Physicians then started working together They reached better conclusions

The microscope began to be widely used in the 18th century With the microscope it was discovered that the cancer poison spread from the one tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites This view of the disease was first made clear by the English surgeon Campbell De Morgan He made it known between 1871 and 1874 The use of surgery to treat cancer had poor results This was because of problems with hygiene The well known Scottish surgeon Alexander Monro saw only 2 breast tumor patients out of 60 surviving surgery for two years In the 19th century asepsis made surgical hygiene better As the survival statistics went up surgical removal of the tumor became the primary treatment for cancer Cancer treatment became dependent on the individual art of the surgeon at removing a tumor except for William Coley In the late 1800s Coley felt that the rate of cure after surgery had been higher before asepsis He had injected bacteria into tumors with mixed results During the same period the idea was that the body was made up of many kinds of tissues They in turn were made up of millions of cells This laid rest the humor theories about chemical imbalances in the body The age of cellular pathology was born

At the end of the 19th century Marie Curie and Pierre Curie discovered radiation They had found the first non surgical cancer treatment With radiation also came the first signs of multi disciplinary approaches to cancer treatment The surgeon was no longer operating in isolation The surgeon worked together with hospital radiologists to help patients This made things difficult in communication It also made it necessary for the patients treatment to be done in a hospital rather than at home This made a process of putting all of the patient data into hospital files This led to the first statistical patient studies

Janet Lane Claypon wrote a paper on cancer epidemiology It was a founding paper She published a comparative study in 1926 It was about 500 breast cancer cases and 500 control patients They both had the same background and lifestyle It was published for the British Ministry of Health Her work on cancer epidemiology was carried on by Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill They published Lung Cancer and Other Causes of Death In Relation to Smoking A Second Report on the Mortality of British Doctors followed in 1956 Richard Doll left the London Medical Research Center He left to start the Oxford unit for Cancer epidemiology in 1968 With the use of computers the unit was the first to bring together large amounts of cancer data Modern epidemiological methods are closely related to current ideas of disease and public health policy Over the past 50 years great efforts have been made on collecting data across medical practice hospital provincial state and even country boundaries This data is used to study the sharing dependence of environmental and cultural causes on cancer incidence

Cancer patient treatment and studies were only allowed to individual physicians practices This changed during World War II This is when medical research centers found that there were large international differences in disease incidence This idea made national public health bodies to make it possible to bring together health data across practices and hospitals Many countries use this process today The Japanese medical community found that the bone marrow of victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was completely destroyed They said that diseased bone marrow could also be destroyed with radiation This led to the discovery of bone marrow transplants for leukemia Since World War II improvements in cancer treatment are getting much better There are some things that still need to get better They need to be better on a micro level with existing treatment methods They need to be standardized They need to be globalized to find cures through epidemiology and international partnerships

Photography is a way of making a picture using a camera A person who makes pictures using a camera is called a photographer A picture made using a camera is called a photograph or photo

A camera is in its simplest form like a box with a hole in the front There is a special piece of glass in front of the hole called a lens To take a photograph of something the lens makes a small picture of the object inside the camera The lens does this by focusing light A lens in a camera works like a lens in glasses or a magnifying glass One type of camera called the Pin Hole camera has no lens but uses a very small hole to focus light

To make a photograph with a camera the shutter release button is pressed Pressing the button opens the shutter The shutter is like a door It covers the hole in the camera box The shutter is behind the lens When the shutter is closed no light can enter the camera box When the shutter is open light can enter the camera When the button is pressed the shutter opens and then closes This happens very fast The amount of time the shutter stays open for is called the shutter speed The shutter speed can change between 11000th of a second to a few seconds Normally the time taken for the shutter to open and close is far less than 1 second 

A camera also has an aperture ring The aperture ring is behind the lens but in front of the shutter The purpose of the aperture ring is to control how much light enters the camera box The aperture ring is a flat circle with a small hole in the centre The small hole is called the aperture The size of the aperture can be changed When the aperture is very small only a small amount of light can enter the camera When the aperture is big a lot of light can get in

The photograph in camera may be made on film or if it is a digital camera using a special electronic sensor

The picture the lens makes is recorded on photographic film Film is placed inside the camera box Light coming through the lens aperture and open shutter shines on the film Photographic film is coated with chemicals that react when light shines on it Letting light shine on the film is called exposing the film 

There are many different types of photographic film There are films for taking colour photographs and films for taking black and white photographs There are different sizes of film The most common size is 35 mm It is called 35 mm because the width of the film is 35 millimetres Most cameras use 35 mm film

Another difference between films is how sensitive they are to light Films have a code number called an ISO number The ISO number tells how fast a film reacts when light shines on it Examples of ISO numbers are ISO 50 ISO 100 IS0 200 ISO 400 ISO 800 and ISO 1600 The ISO number is sometimes called the ASA number or the film speed When the ISO number is low for example ISO 50 the film takes a long time to record the picture This is called a slow film This means the shutter has to stay open for a long time When the ISO number is high for example ISO 800 the picture is made in a very short time This is a fast film This means the shutter has to open and close quickly

Once the film has been exposed it is processed Processing has to be done in total darkness or the film will be exposed too much and the picture will be lost Processing stops the film reacting to light any more After the film has been processed the picture can be seen on the film 

A photographic print is a photograph made on paper A light sensitive paper is used The picture on the film is placed in an enlarger An enlarger is a machine that shines light through the film and makes a bigger picture on the light sensitive paper A chemical reaction happens in the paper which turns the areas hit with light black when the paper is developed Developing makes the picture appear on the paper now it is a photograph Then the paper is put into other chemicals that make it not sensitive to light any more This is called fixing Last the paper is washed so that there are no more chemicals on it and then dried Then it is finished

Digital photography is photography done using a digital camera Sometimes it is called digital imaging A digital camera has a lens aperture and shutter The picture the lens makes is recorded by a light sensitive electronic sensor A digital camera does not use photographic film to record a picture Digital photographs are stored in a computer but paper prints can also be made from digital pictures Digital cameras are also not expensive to use as there is no film to buy

The most important thing when taking a photograph is focusing the lens If the lens does not focus the picture well the photograph will be blurry Autofocus cameras focus automatically when the shutter release is pressed There are also manual focus cameras

Three other things are important when taking a photograph These control how bright or dark the photograph will be 

A slow shutter speed a bigger aperture and a fast film will make a brighter picture A fast shutter speed a small aperture and a slow film will give a darker picture A good picture is not too bright and not too dark An automatic camera changes these things by itself when the shutter release is pressed

An acronym is a word whose letters are the first letters of other words People often create a short word that means the same thing as a much longer phrase to make it faster and shorter to say the long phrase Examples of acronyms are

Radio waves make up part of the electromagnetic spectrum These waves are packets of energy with differing wavelengths similar to visible light waves X rays or Gamma rays except longer

A Radio wave like other electromagnetic waves is similar to an ocean wave or any other type of wave Both types of wave have a hill and valley shape repeating over and over A wavelength is measured as the distance from the top of one crest to the top of its neighboring crest While the wavelength of visible light is very very small less than one micrometer and much less than the thickness of a human hair radio waves can have a wavelength from a couple centimeters to several meters Antennas designed to detect radio waves are usually similar in size to the wavelength they wish to detect This is why many radio antennas must be very long If the antennas are not close to the size of the wavelength they do not usually do a good job of detecting the waves

Manmade radio waves have been used for a long time to send information receive information and to see objects Radar uses radio waves to see distant objects by bouncing waves off an object and seeing how long it takes for the waves to return Radar can even be used to find oil or see what chemicals are in soil Radios also use these waves to send and receive information Natural radio waves were first discovered in the 1930s by a man named Jansky working for Bell Laboratories Before his discovery everyone thought only people could generate radio waves Bell was detecting static on his radio channels and had Jansky try to figure out where this static or interference was coming from Surprisingly the interference was coming from space This discovery eventually led astronomers to look at radio waves along with optical waves to find things in the sky These radio astronomers use giant Radio telescopes shaped like satellite dishes to gather and analyze the waves

Radio waves are used for many things today They broadcast TV communicate with satellites let cell phones communicate with each other make radar systems and allow computers to share information without wires

A bridge is a structure to cross an open space or gap Bridges are mostly useful for crossing rivers valleys or roads by vehicles but people have also used bridges for a long time for walking Bridges called highway overpasses are used to avoid traffic control

Bridges also have uses in the military Military bridges have to be portable so that they may be easily moved to the front lines and so they are much more complex than regular civilian bridges

There are five major structural types of bridges 

Mysticism is the belief that people can directly experience God or true reality rather than through books ritual or other people People who practice this are called mystics

Mystics exist within most religions though not all people who practice religions are mystics Mystics may experience visions or dreams or hear God as a voice

Some examples of Hindu mystics

Some examples of Christian mystics

Islamic Mysticism is also known as Sufism Some examples of Muslim mystics

Some examples of Jewish mystics

Some examples of Buddhist mystics

Ontario is a province of Canada It is in the Eastern half of Canada between Manitoba and Quebec Ontario has the most people of any province with 13 150 000 in 2009 It has the second largest area for a province with 1 076 395 km Quebec has a larger area 

There is 4 large lakes in Ontario called the Great Lakes These lakes are Lake Ontario Lake Erie Lake Huron and Lake Superior Ontario shares a border with the United States and there are several border crossings including the one at Niagara Falls

Toronto is the capital of Ontario Ottawa which is the capital of Canada is also in Ontario The government of Ontario sits at Queens Park in Toronto The leader of the government is called the Premier There is also a Lieutenant Governor of Ontario who represents the Queen

Ontario is very big so sometimes people break it into two The two parts are called Northern Ontario and Southern Ontario Most of the people in Ontario live in the south and that is where the big cities are The big cities in Southern Ontario are Toronto Ottawa Hamilton London Windsor and Sarnia The cities in the north are smaller In the far north of Ontario hardly any people live at all and there are no roads or railways

Much of Ontario gets lots of snow in the winter In the summer it can get very hot in the south parts In some big cities there is smog in the summer

Ontario became part of Canada when it was created in 1867 Before 1840 it was known as Upper Canada which was a part of the British Empire Between 1840 and 1867 it was known as Canada West

The Ontario flag is red with the British Union Jack in the top left corner The Ontario shield is on the right hand side of the flag

The Ontario bird is the Loon

The Ontario flower is the trillium It has three flower petals and it is usually white 

Manitoba is a province of Canada It lies roughly in the centre of Canada

Manitoba is the 6th largest province with 647797 km area It has the fifth largest number of people with 1 150 000 in 2001 People from Manitoba are called Manitobans

The capital of Manitoba is the City of Winnipeg Other larger cities in Manitoba include Steinbach and Brandon

The people of Manitoba elected a legislature The leader of the government who is called the Premier is the leader of the largest party in the legislature There is also a Lieutenant Governor who represents the Queen Right now the premier of Manitoba is Gary Doer and the Lieutenant Governor is John Harvard

The main political parties in Manitoba are the New Democratic Party the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba and the Liberal Party

People have been living in Manitoba for thousands of years Both the Hudsons Bay Company from England and many people from France moved to Manitoba during the 17th 18th and 19th centuries It became part of the Northwest Territory in 1869 The Red River Rebellion which was started by Louis Riel began in Manitoba

Manitoba became part of Canada on 12 May 1870 It included only the southern part which is nearest to the United States But parts of the Northwest Territory were added to Manitoba later on Manitoba was due to lots of animals

The head of government of a country is the person who runs it This is not always the same person as the head of state Official titles for heads of government include Premier or Prime Minister

For example in the United States the president is both the head of state and the head of government In the Republic of Ireland the president is the head of state but the Taoiseach is the head of government In most modern monarchies the king is the head of state but not the head of government

The head of state of some countries has no power over law and justice for example the Bundespresident of Germany

Saskatchewan is a province of Canada About 1 million people live in Saskatchewan Most of its population lives in the southern part of the province The primary industry in Saskatchewan is agriculture

Saskatchewan is known for its wide horizons The land is very flat in the south so you can sometimes see far away Not all the land is flat prairie There are beautiful scenic woodlands and forests in the central and northern regions and parklands with lakes for fishing The province is marked by the North and South Saskatchewan rivers that run through it The province is nicknamed The Land of Living Skies 

The largest city in Saskatchewan is Saskatoon followed by the provinces capital Regina Saskatchewan is a quadrilateral bounded on the west by Alberta on the north by the Northwest Territories on the east by Manitoba and on the south by the American states of Montana and North Dakota 

Saskatchewan was founded on September 1 1905 the same date that Alberta was founded The provinces colors are gold red green white brown yellow and black Gold for the wheat red for the Prairie Lily which is the provincial flower green for the forests white for the snow brown for the fresh cut fields yellow for the canola and sunflowers and black for the coal and oil

Classical music is a very general term which normally refers to the standard music of countries in the Western world It is music that has been composed by musicians who are trained in the art of writing music and written down in music notation so that other musicians can play it Classical music can also be described as art music because great art is needed to compose it and to perform it well Classical music differs from pop music because it is not made just in order to be popular for a short time or just to be a commercial success It is different from folk music which is generally made up by ordinary members of society and learned by future generations by listening and copying

The word classic tends to mean an art which is so good that it will always be enjoyed by future generations It is something that has become a model for future artists The period of Ancient Greece and Rome is known as the Classical Period because many centuries later people looked back to those ancient civilizations and thought they were perfect In recent European history the 18th century was known as the Classical Period because musicians artists writers and philosophers were inspired by the art forms of the Classical Period of Ancient Greece and Rome Something that is a classic is therefore something that will always be remembered as something great Famous books such as the novels of Charles Dickens are called classics Classical music therefore tends to mean music that will not be forgotten soon after it is written but is likely to be enjoyed by many future generations

Although people sometimes think of classical music as the opposite of pop music it can still be very popular Like all kinds of music classical music can be in many different moods happy sad scary peaceful thoughtful simple etc Mozart wrote his serenades and divertimentos to entertain people at parties Classical pieces of music can be quite short but they can also be very long like a big musical story A symphony by Mahler or Shostakovich can last for nearly an hour and an opera is a whole evenings entertainment

Classical music is also different from jazz because true jazz is improvised However the differences are not always obvious Classical music has often been inspired by jazz and jazz by classical music George Gershwin wrote music which is both jazz and classical Classical music too can be improvised The great composers Bach Mozart and Beethoven often improvised long pieces of music on the organ harpsichord or piano Sometimes they wrote these improvisations down They were in effect compositions which were composed in one go

In Western countries a vast amount of music was written for Christian worship in churches and cathedrals This is called sacred music All other music is secular music The word secular means things that are not sacred Sacred and secular music have influenced one another in many ways during the course of music history Secular music was largely influenced by dance and this in turn changed the style of sacred music For example the church music of the 16th century composer Giovanni da Palestrina has nothing to do with dance music but both the sacred and secular music of Johann Sebastian Bach two centuries later is full of dance rhythms At some times in music history there have been different styles of composing for sacred and for secular music Claudio Monteverdi uses two different styles for his church and for his non church music When composers were experimenting with new ways of writing music they usually did this with secular music and sacred music caught up later

The term classical music was not used until the early 19th century People then started talking about classical music in order to praise the great composers such as Bach Mozart and Beethoven In the 20th century many different ways of composing were used including music played by electronic instruments or very modern music using strange sounds for example the music of John Cage Some people feel that this kind of music cannot really be described as classical music

Classical music can be for instruments or for the voice The symphony orchestra is the most common group of instruments for the playing of classical music It has four families of instruments the string instruments which include the violins violas cellos and double basses the woodwind which includes flutes oboes clarinets and bassoons together with related instruments of different sizes the brass instruments trumpet trombone tuba and French horn and percussion instruments which nearly always includes timpani as well as many other possible instruments which are hit or shaken This is very different from a typical rock band which has a drummer a guitarist one or two singers and an electric bass and keyboard Instruments that play classical music are not normally amplified electronically 

The same applies to the voice Singers may be sopranos altos tenors or basses depending on their vocal range Their voices are not amplified Opera singers in particular have to develop very powerful voices which will be heard over the orchestra and project right to the back of an opera house 

The instruments used in classical music developed at different times Some of the earliest were known in Medieval music The trombone and the triangle have hardly changed for hundreds of years but the violin family developed from folk instruments such as fiddles and gradually replaced the viols to form the basis of the modern orchestra This was happening by the beginning of the 17th century which was the time when opera was invented

In general musical instruments have become louder as concert halls have become bigger Violins are louder than viols Modern violins are louder than the early 17th century violins largely because of they have metal strings instead of gut strings The piano developed from the clavichord which was very quiet indeed Woodwind instruments developed from Renaissance instruments while the clarinet was invented in the middle of the 18th century and the saxophone and tuba came even later Modern trumpets sound much brighter than the straight trumpets of the 18th century

Most popular music is based on song form but classical music has many different forms some of which can be used over a long time span to make big compositions Classical music can have many forms including the symphony concerto oratorio opera sonata fugue or any combination of dance movements such as suites In many of the longer compositions short tunes are developed and changed during the course of the piece Beethovens Fifth Symphony is a good example of a piece which develops from just four notes into a large piece lasting about half an hour

People who want to be good at performing classical music have to practice hard for many years They normally have formal training at a music college or conservatoire and have lessons from well known music teachers

Classical musicians often spend a lot of time thinking carefully about pieces of music especially about pieces of music that they perform They study such things as harmony and counterpoint to help them understand the way that the composers were thinking when they put the piece together When they look at pieces of music in this way this is called musical analysis People who specialize in thinking and writing about music may become professors or lecturers of music at universities

Classical music is often heard in popular culture It is used as background music for movies television programs advertisements and even for mobile phone ringing tones Most people in the Western world recognize many classical tunes possibly without even realizing it Some classical pieces of music have become enormously popular eg the song Nessun dorma from Giacomo Puccinis opera Turandot which was sung by the three tenors Luciano Pavarotti Placido Domingo and Jos Carreras and used as the theme tune for the 1990 Soccer World Cup This made many people who had never been interested in opera start to become curious about it

The history of classical music really started in the late Middle Ages Music written for the church was almost always vocal because instruments were thought to be wicked This is because the devil played them and because they were used for dancing There was a lot of dance music but most of it is lost because it was never written down

Medieval composers who are remembered today include Lonin Protin and Guillaume de Machaut

The Renaissance was from the 15th century until the 17th century This period saw a massive increase in the composition of music both sacred and secular Many great cathedrals had been built in Europe and composers wrote music for them mostly vocal music Secular music also became extremely popular especially songs and madrigals which would sometimes be accompanied by instruments

The greatest composers of this period include Giovanni da Palestrina Orlando di Lasso Thomas Tallis and William Byrd

The Baroque period was from about the 17th century until the mid 18th century This was the time when the modern orchestra was formed more or less as we know it It was also the time when opera was invented Most musicians worked either for the church or for rich people who had their own orchestras Many of them also started to work for opera houses

The greatest composers of this time include Claudio Monteverdi Heinrich Schtz Henry Purcell Antonio Vivaldi George Frideric Handel Johann Sebastian Bach Domenico Scarlatti and Georg Philipp Telemann 

The mid 18th century until around 1820 was known as the Classical period Composers thought a lot about the forms of their pieces and were influenced by the classical art of the Ancient Greeks and Romans The symphony was invented and various forms of chamber music including the string quartet

The greatest composers include Joseph Haydn Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven

From 1820 to 1910 was known as the Romantic period Composers continued to use the forms that had been invented in the 18th century but they also thought that personal feeling and emotion were very important Music for orchestra sometimes told a story Musicians who played their instruments brilliantly were worshipped like heroes Beethoven and Schubert belong in many ways to this period as well as to the Classical period It was a time when there were a lot of changes in society After the wars that Napoleon had waged there were not so many ruling aristocratic families There was a lot of feeling of nationalism as countries united 19th century music is often nationalistic composers wrote music that was typical of their own country

Some of the greatest composers include Ludwig van Beethoven Franz Schubert Hector Berlioz Frdric Chopin Robert Schumann Felix Mendelssohn Anton Bruckner Johannes Brahms Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky Edward Elgar Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss

What is known as 20th century classical music is music from about 1910 onwards At this time many composers felt that everything had already been done by the composers of the past so they wanted to find new ways of composing Claude Debussy Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky in particular found new ways of writing music which was not necessarily tonal Classical music was influenced by jazz especially with American composers Later in the century people such as Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen experimented in many other ways including with electronic music Todays composers have combined some of these ideas to develop their own styles 

Some of the most important composers are Claude Debussy Jean Sibelius Maurice Ravel Arnold Schoenberg Igor Stravinsky Bla Bartk Aaron Copland Benjamin Britten Dmitri Shostakovich Leonard Bernstein Philip Glass Dmitri Kabalevsky James MacMillan Judith Weir Peter Maxwell Davies

It has never been possible to say exactly what is meant by classical music Many different kinds of music influence one another Since 1970 it has been even harder to make clear dividing lines between rock pop classical folk jazz and world music This shows that classical music like other kinds of music continues to develop and reflect the society from which it comes

SNAFU or snafu is an acronym that the United States Military first used Civilians now use it as well It stands for Situation Normal All Up

First it meant things are in a mess as usual SNAFU

In modern times it means a situation that was occurring normally but then suddenly began to go wrong For example

The generals visit this week end went well until we hit a snafu Everything went wrong after that

Snafu is used mostly as a noun It can also be used as a verb but usually in the passive sense For instance someone would say

The generals visit this week end went well until it snafued Everything went wrong after that

But they would probably not say

The generals visit this week end went well until we snafued it

Caenorhabditis elegans is a species of roundworm or nematode It is important because much research has been done on its genetics and development

C elegans is about 1 mm long The worms are not parasites they are free living They live in soil and feed on bacteria C elegans is a model organism used to study animal development and behavior It is the first multicellular organism for which scientists have been able to sequence its whole genome

C elegans has two types of sex hermaphrodite and male A hermaphrodite makes sperms when its in a larval stage and makes ova in an adult stage A male can only make sperm Males are a little smaller than hermaphrodites

Study using C elegans was begun in 1965 by Sydney Brenner In laboratories they are easy to keep alive At 25C they spend 14 hours as an embryo Animals like C elegans that do not take long to grow and are easy to feed are usually good organisms for research

In 2002 the Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to Sydney Brenner Robert Horvitz and John Sulston for their work on how C eleganss genes cause it to grow and cause some of its cells to die

New Zealand is a country in the south western Pacific Ocean It is made up of two large islands and several much smaller islands It is currently ranked as the 8th happiest country in the world New Zealand is not part of Australia The official languages are English Mori and New Zealand sign language

The name New Zealand comes from Zeeland in Dutch Zeeland is a province of the Netherlands New Zealand is called Aotearoa in the Maori language It means Land of the Long White Cloud Ao means cloud tea means white and roa means long

New Zealand is a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II The Prime Minister is Mr John Key

New Zealand has made itself a Nuclear Free Zone They do not use nuclear power and do not allow nuclear weapons or nuclear powered vessels in their territory

As of the 2006 census 4143279 people lived in New Zealand Most of them had European ancestors The indigenous people of New Zealand the Mori had a population of 565329 or 146 

The people of New Zealand call themselves Kiwis representing their national native although flightless bird The North Island is smaller than the South Island but most people live there

The main religion in New Zealand is Christianity Just over 2 million New Zealanders are Christian

Farming represents a large community in both the North and South Islands Most New Zealanders however choose to live in more urban areas Wellington being the capital of New Zealand Auckland the largest city with around 1 million people Other cities in the North Island include Hamilton Tauranga NapierHastings New Plymouth Wanganui Palmerston North South Island Cities Christchurch Dunedin Nelson and Invercargill

New Zealand sits at the boundary between two continental plates They are the Australian and Pacific plates When these two plates moved together one moved under the other north of the South Island As a result there was a great deal of volcanic activity South of the South Island the Australian plate moves under the Pacific plate instead The plates slide past each other in the South Island where they have pushed up the Southern Alps Because of these two colliding plates New Zealand often has earthquakes One of the best known is the 2010 2011 group of earthquakes that hit the Christchurch area

The diagram shows that the North Island is on the Australian plate but most of the South Island is on the Pacific plate New Zealand is still geologically active and will remain so as long as the islands are sitting above the plate boundary

The oldest rocks in New Zealand date from the Cambrian period 510 million years ago New Zealand became part of the global super continent Pangaea and when that split NZ became part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana Finally Gondwana broke up leaving the continents rather as they are today NZ is a remnant of these great events

New Zealand was isolated from the rest of the world for a long time It split from Australia 83 million years ago Because of this there are many plants and animals that only live in New Zealand Before humans came to New Zealand there were no mammals except three species of bat and marine mammals such as seals dolphins and whales Instead New Zealand has many different kinds of bird New Zealand has several species of flightless bird for example the kiwi Especially important is the Tuatara the only living member of a whole order of reptiles

New Zealand used to have more rare species but some mostly birds were hunted to extinction early in its history The giant Moa Dinornis is a famous example The group of birds to which the Moa belongs had been in existence since the Cretaceous period Mankind arrived in New Zealand about a thousand years ago when a large number of moas lived especially on South Island Archaeological sites with evidence of Moa hunting are all over New Zealand The moas became extinct about five hundred years ago Extinctions closer to today have been caused by habitat change and introduced species like rats and dogs which can kill the native species

About 5000 years ago the two ethnic tribes of the Lac Viet and Au Viet lived together in many areas with other inhabitants Due to increasing needs to control floods fights against invaders and culture and trade exchanges these tribes living near each other tended to gather together and integrate into a larger mixed group

Among these Lac Viet tribes was the Van Lang which was the most powerful tribe The leader of this tribe later joined all the tribes together to found Van Lang Nation in 2897 BC addressing himself as the King Hung The next generations followed in their fathers footsteps and kept this appellation Based on historical documents researchers correlatively delineated the location of Van Lang Nation to the present day regions of North and north of Central Vietnam as well as the south of present day Kwangsi

The Van Lang Nation lasted to the 3rd century BC The Dong Son civilization that covered much of Southeast Asia was also the beginning of Vietnams history In 221 BC the Qins invaded the land of the Viet tribes Thuc Phan leader of the alliance of Au Viet tribes managed to expel the enemies and declared himself King An Duong Vuong and his territory Au Lac Nation In 208 BC a Qin Dynasty general named Triu invaded Au Lac An Duong Vuong failed this time As a result the northern feudalist took turns dominating the country over the next eleven centuries establishing their harsh regime in the country and dividing the country into administrative regions and districts with unfamiliar names However the countrys name of Au Lac could not be erased from the peoples minds in their everyday life

In 207 BC Triu established a state called Nam Vit which encompassed southern China and the Red River Delta The historical significance of the original Nam Vit remains controversial because some historians consider it a Chinese occupation while others believe it was an independent era For most of the period from 111 BCE to the early 10th century CE Vietnam was under the rule of successive Chinese dynasties Sporadic independence movements were attempted but were quickly suppressed by Chinese forces

When it was ruled by the Chinese Empire for many hundred years it was called Annam

In September 1858 France occupied Nng Cochinchina was a French colony from 1862 to 1948 

In 1930 Nguyn i Quc established the Vietnamese Independence League which is also known as the Vit Minh 

The Japanese took over Vietnam in World War II The Vit Minh fought against both the Japanese and the Vichy French 

When the Japanese were defeated the Vietnamese people led by the Vit Minh started the August Revolution 

On September 2 1945 Nguyn i Quc read the Declaration of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in Ba nh Square in Hni It was based on the American Declaration of Independence 

H Ch Minh led the Vit Minh in a war for independence from France 

The Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina was proclaimed June 1 1946 to frustrate the Vit Minhs desire to rule all of Vietnam 

The War between France and the Vit Minh lasted from 1946 to 1954 The French were defeated in 1954 after the Battle of Dien Bien Phu

The nation was then divided into North Vietnam and South Vietnam After independence was achieved the French gave the land of the Mekong delta that was part of Cambodia to South Vietnam The anti communist United States had a lot of influence in the South and the communist and nationalist Vit Minh controlled the North H Ch Minh was extremely popular in the whole nation as he was the only remaining leader after years of fighting so he became President of the Democratic Republic of Vitnam It was agreed that the nation would be reunited by elections in 1956 But the Americans and the Southern government stopped the elections from happening because they expected H Ch Minh to win because communist North Vietnam refused to hold free elections Dwight Eisenhower said he thought H would win with around 80 of the vote if elections were held because of the majority of the population being in the north added with Hos few supporters in the South

Soon the USA was at war with Vietnam This war was known as the American War the Vietnam War or the Second Indochinese War Soon South Vietnam became a military dictatorship with some basic freedoms The Southern army removed the contriversial Ngo Dinh Diem from power and killed him

On September 2 1969 Independence Day President H Ch Minh died of heart failure People all across the nation cried for him Even the Sign newspaper said Vit Nam loses a unique politician since this man had fought for freedom from their Japanese and French rulers 

On April 30 1975 the National Liberation Front with the help of the NVA overtook Sign and quickly renamed it H Ch Minh City The nation was fully reunified as Socialist Republic of Vietnam on July 2 1976

Recently the challenge has become more popular People who live near the mountains often do not like having cars around in the middle of the night Conservation groups blame people doing the challenge for dropping litter and damaging the landscape Some people park their cars in inconsiderate places Thousands of people attempt the challenge each year Supporters of the challenge say that only a few people cause these problems and most behave well

Most attempts are made in the summer because the days are long and the weather is good In the winter it is dark for most of the day and can be very cold The weather up the mountains can change very quickly and some people die in blizzards in the winter Most people who attempt the challenge use the same route because it is the easiest way of doing the challenge in 24 hours

They start with Ben Nevis at about five oclock It takes about three hours to climb this mountain so they reach the summit at about eight oclock and return to the bottom at about ten oclock In the summer it is still light in Britain at this time If people start climbing Ben Nevis too early they will arrive at Scafell Pike too early the next morning and it will still be dark It is important to be quick at the bottom of the mountains There is not much time so food is usually prepared by others waiting at the bottom When the climbers arrive they usually leave straight away and eat while they are on the road

The next mountain is Scafell Pike in the Lake District of northern England The journey between Ben Nevis and Scafell Pike is longer than the journey between Scafell Pike and Snowdon This is why it is done at night when it is too dark to climb The journey takes six or seven hours and the walkers usually go to sleep The next morning they arrive at Scafell Pike at about half past four In the summer it is light by this time Scafell Pike is not as high as the other mountains but is harder

If it is climbed quickly enough and the walkers do not get lost they can return to the bottom by about nine oclock It takes several hours to get to Snowdon in Wales The walkers are usually very tired and worried that there is not enough time If they arrive at the bottom of Snowdon at half past one in the afternoon they can climb it in two hours This leaves them an hour and a half to get back to the bottom If they were too slow on the other mountains or the journeys in between they might have to run

You need to be quite fit to do the challenge in 24 hours but people who are young and active and people who are used to hillwalking can do it Compared to some mountains in the world all the mountains in Britain are small If the weather is bad or the drivers are slow it is very hard

Pennsylvania is one of the 50 states in the United States of America It is located in the northeastern section of the country It has a border with Ohio on the west West Virginia on the south and west Maryland and Delaware on the south New Jersey on the east and New York and Lake Erie on the north

The state capital of Pennsylvania is Harrisburg The largest city in Pennsylvania is Philadelphia The state nickname of Pennsylvania is The Keystone State The current governor of Pennsylvania is Tom Corbett

Pennsylvania is well known for its role in the American Revolution its large communities of Amish and its heavy industry

Pennsylvania was home to many Native American groups before Europeans settled there These include the Delaware Susquehanna and Iroquois

The first European settlers in Pennsylvania were from Sweden They arrived in 1643 The area was later ruled by the Netherlands and Great Britain In 1681 Charles II of England gave the land to William Penn Penn used the land to create a home for Quakers The land became known as Penns Woods as Pennsylvania has many forests In Latin this is Pennsylvania This became adopted as the name of the colony

Meanwhile in the western part of the state armies from France and Great Britain fought for control of the source of the Ohio River This conflict was part of the French and Indian War Great Britain eventually won the conflict for this location and built a fort called Fort Pitt The fort grew into a city which is now called Pittsburgh 

The state of Delaware was once part of Pennsylvania In 1704 Delaware formed when three Pennsylvania counties left the colony and created their own government

Pennsylvania was one of the 13 colonies that fought Great Britain in the American Revolution The United States Declaration of Independence was signed in Philadelphia Benjamin Franklin an important figure in the Revolution was also from Philadelphia Pennsylvania was the second state to join the United States Philadelphia was capital of the United States before Washington DC

Later Pennsylvania became an important center of industry Kerosene was discovered in Titusville in the 19th century This was the start of the oil industry in the United States Large deposits of coal were found in and around Pittsburgh This caused Pittsburgh to become a major industrial city

Industry began leaving Pennsylvania in the late 20th century because most heavy industry was being transferred to other nations This caused the population to drop profoundly It also caused many of its cities and towns to decay

Most of Pennsylvania is part of the Appalachian Mountains including the south central and northeastern areas of the state Much of the rest of the state is very hilly partly due to the closeness to mountains and partly due to the steep river valleys in the state The Monongahela Allegheny and Ohio rivers are in the western part of the state and the Susquehanna is in the central part of the state The northwestern and southeastern parts of the state are mostly flat and low lying

Pennsylvania is the 33rd largest state in the United States with a land area of 44817 square miles The highest point in the state is Mount Davis at 3213 feet above sea level The lowest point is the Delaware River which is at sea level

Pennsylvania is the 6th most populated state In 2000 the population was 12281054 

More than half of the population lives in the areas of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia Few people live in the north central area of the state Towns and cities tend to be small in size and densely populated more so than in other states This is because many of the towns and cities in Pennsylvania were built around a specific factory or factories

Pennsylvania has many colleges and universities Officially the states public university is Pennsylvania State University Best known are a few private university systems which are partially funded by the state like University of Pittsburgh The states most well known private university is the University of Pennsylvania an Ivy League institution Pennsylvania also has a number of state run colleges located in Bloomsburg California Cheyney Clarion East Stroudsburg Edinboro Indiana Kutztown Lock Haven Mansfield Millersville Shippensburg Slippery Rock and West Chester Those fourteen schools make up one of the largest state run higher education systems in the country Other significant private universities are Carnegie Mellon University known for its computer science research and Bucknell University

A box is a container used to put things in It is mainly a cuboid shape but it can be other shapes too Boxes are usually made out of cardboard wood plastic or metal Many boxes are made of cardboard and a lot of them are made which are primarily used for packaging commercial goods or storing goods and materials They can be made from bent or wrinkled cardboard In their most obvious life stage they are popularly used as a cheap material for the construction of a range of projects among them being science experiments childrens toys costumes and other things

A box also means a rectangle eg userbox But rectangles are mainly referred to as rectangles the term box is the outline or perimeter of the rectangle

The Philippines is archipelago country with 7000 islands It is in the Pacific Ocean and about 100 kilometers southeast from Asia Spain and the United States colonized the country The Philippines South Korea and East Timor are the only nations in East Asia where most people practice Christianity Philippines achieved independence after United States left in 1946

The Philippine Islands are surrounded on the East by the Philippine Sea on the west by the South China Sea and on the south by the Celebes Sea Borneo island is a few hundred kilometers to the southwest Vietnam is to the west and Taiwan is directly north On the eastern side of the Philippine Sea is Palau

Human fossils were found proving that many people settled in the Philippines for thousands of years The Negritos crossed prehistoric land or ice to settle in the islands land Many groups of Austronesian or Malayan people began to come to the Philippines in the first millennium pushing the aboriginal population into the interior or perhaps absorbing them through intermarriage

Chinese merchants arrived in the 8th century The rise of powerful Buddhist kingdoms enabled trade with the Indonesian archipelago India Japan and Southeast Asia Factional fighting among the kingdoms of Southeast Asia weakened their strength In the meantime the spread of Islam through commerce and proselytism much like Christianity brought traders and missionaries into the region Arabs set foot in Mindanao in the 14th century When the first Europeans arrived led by Ferdinand Magellan in 1521 there were rajahs as far north as Manila who historically were tributaries of the kingdoms of Southeast Asia However the islands were essentially self sufficient and self ruling

The Spanish led by Conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legazpi claimed and colonized the islands in the 16th century and named it Filipinas after King Felipe II Roman Catholicism was immediately introduced The Philippines was ruled from New Spain and a trade began in the 18th century began using galleons across the Pacific Ocean Some rebellions and violence started in the towns near the ocean and during the next three centuries because of some unfairness of the government

In 1781 Governor Jos Basco y Vargas founded the Economic Society of Friends of the Country to make the Philippines independent of New Spain

The country opened up during the 19th century The rise of an ambitious more nationalistic Filipino middle class and the Chinese mestizo community signaled the end of Spanish colonialism in the islands Enlightened by the Propaganda Movement to the injustices of the Spanish colonial government they asked for independence Jose Rizal the most famous propagandist was arrested and put to death in 1896 for acts of subversion Soon after the Philippine Revolution broke out led by the Katipunan a secret revolutionary society founded by Andres Bonifacio and later led by Emilio Aguinaldo The revolution nearly succeeded in ousting the Spanish by 1898

That same year Spain and the United States fought the Spanish American War after which Spain gave up the Philippines to the United States for US20 million The Filipinos had declared independence by that time and the assertion of American control led to the Philippine American War that officially ended in 1901 but fighting continued well into 1913 Between 1899 and 1913 the American Philippines war waged about one million Philippines and well over 5500 American soldiers lost their lives tens of thousands more were wounded Most of the Philippines casualties came from starvation injuries diseases lack of clean living Hostilities continued until 1914 when Philippines was promised future independence

President McKinley was killed by an anarchist Leon Czolgosz because Czolgosz believed president McKinley was against good working people he considered William McKinley responsible for falsifying reasons for war approving and waging illegal devastating Philippines war

The American regime imposed the English language as the lingua franca in the islands through free public education The status of the country was turned into that of a US commonwealth in 1935 which provided for more self governance

Independence was finally given in 1946 after the World War II The years right after that had many post war problems People were also not happy during the unpopular dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos who was made to leave the presidency in 1986 Later the continuing problem of communist insurgency and Moro separatism

The government of the Philippines is similar to the Government of the United States of America The President of the Philippines works as the head of state the head of government and the commander in chief of the Military of the Philippines and the armed forces The president is elected by voting just as in America He stays as the president for 6 years He is the leader of the cabinet

The bicameral Philippine legislature the Congress of the Philippines consists of the Senate of the Philippines and the House of Representatives of the Philippines members of both are elected by popular vote There are 24 senators serving 6 years in the Senate while the House of Representatives consists of no more than 250 congressmen each serving 3 year terms

The judiciary branch of the government is headed by the Supreme Court of the Philippines which has a Chief Justice as its head and 14 Associate Justices all appointed by the president

The Philippines is a founding and prominent member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations It is also an active participant of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation a member of the Group of 24 and one of the 51 founding members of the United Nations on October 24 1945

Local Government The parts of Philippines are local government units The province is the top unit There are 79 provinces in the country In the provinces there are cities and municipalities In these municipalities there are smaller barangays The barangay is the smallest local government unit

All provinces are in 17 regions for administration Most government offices have regional offices for the provinces The regions do not have a separate local government except the Muslim Mindanao and Cordillera regions which have their own power

 Names are capitalized because they are acronyms containing the names of the constituent provinces or cities

The Philippines has 7107 islands Together there are about 300000 square kilometers of land The islands are in three groups Luzon Visayas and Mindanao Luzon is the largest island and Mindanao is the second largest The Visayas are the group of islands in the central part of the Philippines The busy port of Manila on Luzon is the countrys capital and it is the second largest city after Quezon City In the Visayas Cebu City is the largest city In Mindanao Davao City is the largest city

The climate is hot humid and tropical The average temperature all year is around 265 Celsius Filipinos usually say there are three seasons Tag init or Tag araw Tag ulan and Tag lamig

The Philippines is in the Pacific Ring of Fire Most of the mountainous islands had a lot of tropical rainforests a long time ago They started as volcanoes The highest place is Mount Apo on Mindanao at 2954 m Many volcanoes in the country for example Mount Mayon are active The country also has about 19 typhoons per year

Taal Volcano is an island within Taal Lake which sits in a ancient caldera Located in Batangas Province its about 2 hours by bus going south from Manila The jump off point in Talisay Its suitable for day trips and overnighters

There are many environmental problems in the Philippines One of them is overfishing in many areas which lead to pitiful catches Another problem is that only ten percent of sewage is treated and cleaned while the other 90 is dumped back to nature and the ocean which leads to pollution Deforestation is a serious problem and after decades of taking down forests illegal logging and forest fires there is only 3 left of original forest cover Forest losses have also affected the Philippines with serious soil erosion which is threatening the Philippines biodiversity 

The Philippines is a developing country In 1998 the Philippine economy a mixture of agriculture light industry and support services deteriorated because of the spillover from the Asian financial crisis and poor weather conditions Growth fell to 06 in 1998 from 5 in 1997 but recovered to about 3 in 1999 and 4 in 2000 The government has promised to continue its economic reforms to help the Philippines match the pace of development in the newly industrialized countries of East Asia

The strategies are improving infrastructure fixing the tax system to help the government income supporting deregulation and privatization of the economy and increasing trade within the region Future prospects depend heavily on the economic performance of the three major trading partners China the United States and Japan

Around 94 million people live in the Philippines as of 2010 Most people in the Philippines are of Austronesian stock The ethnic Chinese who have helped run businesses since the 9th century also live in the country The Negritos live in the mountains of Luzon and Visayas The rest of the groups are the Spanish North Americans other Asians and other ethnicities from other countries and live throughout the countrys major cities

The people of the Philippines are known as Filipinos Filipinos are divided into many groups the three largest are the Tagalogs Cebuanos and the Ilocanos When the Philippines was a colony the term Filipino used to mean the Spanish and Spanish mixed minority But now everyone living in the Philippines is called Filipino Even then it is still has the most diverse ethnic groups in Asia People also call Filipinos Pinoy for short

Filipino and English are the official languages Filipino is based largely on Tagalog the language spoken in Metro Manila and neighboring provinces Other local languages are Cebuano and Ilocano and many others English is used in government schools and business Other languages are Chinese and Arabic

Filipino culture is strongly influenced by both Western and Eastern traditions It is a mix of native Spanish Mexican American and Chinese cultures

Before the Spanish arrived the Filipinos did not think of themselves as one people The Spaniards came in 1565 and brought with them Spanish culture They soon spread to the islands making forts and schools preaching Christianity and converting the native peoples to the Catholic religion When the United States colonized the islands in 1898 the Americans brought with them their culture which has the strongest influence up to now This makes the Philippines the most Westernized country in eastern Asia

Each year major festivities called barrio fiestas are held They commemorate the Patron saints of the towns villages and regional districts The festivities includes church services street parades fireworks displays feasts dancemusic contests and cockfights

Most of the people in the Philippines are Christians About 92 of the people are Christians Most people in the Philippines belong to the Roman Catholic faith A small percentage of the people are Protestants Members Church of GOD International Iglesia ni Cristo Muslims Buddhists There are also some Hindus and some other minor religions with fewer adherents

Fort Ouiatenon was the first fortified European settlement in what is now the US state of Indiana It is approximately three miles southwest of modern day West Lafayette

Fort Ouiatenon was originally constructed by the French government in 1717 as a military outpost to protect against Great Britains western expansion Its location among the unsettled woodlands of the Wabash River valley also made it a key center of trade for fur trappers French merchants and trappers from Quebec would arrive at Fort Ouiatenon in search of beaver pelts and to take advantage of trade relations with the native Wea Native American tribes

At its peak level of activity during the mid 18th century Fort Ouiatenon was home to over 2000 residents In 1761 during the French and Indian War a contingent of British soldiers led by Lieutenant Edward Jenkins captured and occupied the fort In 1763 an uprising led by Chief Pontiac of the Ottawa Native American tribe surprised Lieutenant Jenkins and his men and captured Fort Ouiatenon without firing a shot Seven similar posts were also captured in what became known as Pontiacs Uprising

The British made little use of Fort Ouiatenon after the French and Indian War it was never garrisoned During the 1780s local Indian tribes used it as a base of operations to stage raids against American settlers pushing westward Consequently President George Washington ordered the fort to be destroyed in 1791

In 1930 a replica of Fort Ouiatenon was built near its original site by a local physician named Richard Wetherill In 1970 the site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the US Department of the Interior Today Fort Ouiatenon is open to tourists and is the location of the annual Feast of the Hunters Moon

Sir Edmund Hillarys fame came as a result of being the first New Zealander in the world to conquer Mt Everest in Nepal He is on the New Zealand five dollar note He also climbed ten other mountains after Mount Everest all of which are also located in the Himalayas 

Hillary was born to Percival Augustus Hillary and Gertrude Hillary ne Clark in Auckland New Zealand on 20 July 1919 His family moved to Tuakau in 1920 after his father had gotten land there His grandparents were early settlers in northern Wairoa in the mid 19th century after moving from Yorkshire England

Hillary learned at Tuakau Primary School and then Auckland Grammar School He finished primary school two years early but he did not do very well at high school At first he was smaller than other students there and very shy so he felt safe with his books and often thought of a life filled with adventure Every day he rode a train to and from high school and he often used this time to read Learning how to box helped him become more confident At age 16 his interest in climbing started during a school trip to Mount Ruapehu Although very tall at 6 ft 5 in he found that he was stronger than many of his fellow hikers He learned about mathematics and science at The University of Auckland and in 1939 he completed his first important climb which was reaching the top of a mountain called Mount Ollivier With his brother Rex Hillary became a beekeeper during summertime which allowed him to do climbing in the winter

The Wright brothers Orville Wright and Wilbur Wright are credited for making the first controlled powered heavier than air flight on December 17 1903 They had been experimenting for many years with gliders and other vehicles before their first powered flight They are also known for making the first way to steer an airplane Their first test flight took place in Kitty Hawk Heights North Carolina though they designed the aircraft in Dayton Ohio 

The Wrights both grew up in Dayton Ohio and were the son of a minister They went to high school but did not go to college and started a newspaper instead After that they started a shop to build and repair bicycles

By the 1890s the Wrights were interested in flight particularly the gliders of Otto Lilienthal They saw controlling a plane as one of the big problems of flight as Lilienthal and others had been killed when they could not control their aircraft and fixed it by building wings that could be moved up and down slightly From 1900 to 1902 they built gliders in Dayton and tested them in Kitty Hawk During this period they also built a wind tunnel to test how well something will fly In 1903 they built a powered airplane with a propeller and a light engine The Wright Flyer airplane first flew successfully on December 17 1903 which many think is the first time man ever flew The two continued to make changes to their design and had a very practical plane by 1905

The Wright Brothers kept their discovery largely secret for a couple of years until they showed it to the world in 1908  After that they started a company to build airplanes and had a patent war with Glenn Curtiss over who could make money over the invention of the airplane During the patent war Wilbur died Orville continued work to maintain his reputation as the first man to fly but eventually sold the airplane company and became an elder statesman of aviation He died in 1948  

Charles Robert Darwin was an English naturalist He is famous for his work on the theory of evolution His book On the Origin of Species did two things First it provided a great deal of evidence that evolution has taken place Second it proposed a theory to explain how evolution works That theory is natural selection Evolution by natural selection is the key to understanding biology and the diversity of life on Earth

FileVoyage of the Beagle ensvgthumb450pxcenterThe voyage of the Beagle

Darwin spent five years on board a Royal Navy exploring ship the HMS Beagle He was the guest naturalist which meant that he was responsible for making collections and notes about the animals plants and the geology of the countries they visited The ships crew made charts of all the coastal areas which could be used by the navy wherever it went in the world At the time Britain had by far the largest navy in the world and an empire which was global

Darwin collected everywhere the ship weighed anchor He found huge fossils of recently extinct mammals experienced an earthquake in Chile and noticed the land had been raised He knew of raised beaches elsewhere high in the Andes with fossil seashells and trees which had once grown on a sandy beach Obviously the earth was constantly changing with land rising in some places and sinking in others He collected birds and insects and sent shipments back to Cambridge for experts to identify 

Darwin was the first dedicated naturalist to visit the Galapagos Islands off the west coast of Ecuador He noticed that some of the birds were like mockingbirds on the mainland but different enough to be placed in separate species He began to wonder how so many new species came to be on these islands

When Charles got back to England he edited a series of scientific reviews of the Voyage and he wrote a personal journal which we know as the Voyage of the Beagle It is one of the great natural history travel diaries

While on HMS Beagle and later back home in London Darwin had come across the ideas of the Rev TR Malthus Malthus had realised that although humans could double their population every 25 years it did not happen in practice He thought the reason was that a struggle for existence limited their numbers If numbers increased then famine wars and diseases caused more deaths Darwin who knew that all living things could in principle increase their numbers began to think about why some survived while others did notp264 268 His answer took years to develop

The theory of evolution says that all living things on Earth including plants animals and microbes come from a common ancestor by slowly changing throughout the generations Darwin suggested that the way living things changed over time is through natural selection This is the better survival and reproduction of those that best fit their environment Fitting into the place where you live is called adapting Those who fit best into the place where they live the best adapted have the best chance to survive and breed Those who are less well adapted tend not to survive If they do not survive well enough to raise young this means they do not pass on their genes In this way the species gradually changes

The first chapter of the Origin deals with domesticated animals such as cattle and dogs Darwin reminded readers of the huge changes mankind had made in its domestic animals which were once wild species The changes were brought about by selective breeding choosing animals with desirable characters to breed from This had been done generation after generation until our modern breeds were produced Perhaps what man had done deliberately might happen in nature where some would leave more offspring than others 

Darwin noticed that although young plants or animals are very similar to their parents no two are exactly the same and there is always a range of shape size colour and so on Some of these differences the plant or animal may have got from their own ancestors but some are new and caused by mutations When such differences made an organism more able to live in the wild it would have a better chance to survive and would pass on its genes to its offspring and they to their offspring Any difference that would cause the plant or animal to have less of a chance to live would be less likely to be passed on and would eventually die out altogether In this way groups of similar plants or animals slowly change in shape and form so that they can live more successfully and have more offspring who will survive them So natural selection had similarities to selective breeding except that it would happen by itself over a much longer time

He first started thinking about this in 1838 but it took a full twenty years before his ideas became public By 1844 he was able to write a draft of the main ideas in his notebook Historians think that he did not talk about his theory because he was afraid of public criticism He knew his theory which did not discuss religion raised questions about the literal truth of the Book of Genesis Whatever the reason he did not publish his theory in a book until 1859 In 1858 he heard that another biologist Alfred Russel Wallace had the same ideas about natural selection Darwin and Wallaces ideas were first published in the Journal of the Linnaean Society in London 1858 Then Darwin published his book the next year The name of the book was On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life This is usually called The Origin of Species 

Darwin wrote a number of other books most of which are also very important

Adam Smith was a Scottish economist who is called the Father of Modern Economics His book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations published in 1776 was very important People call the book just The Wealth of Nations It stated some of the ideas on which modern economics is based especially market economics In the Wealth of Nations Adam Smith asks what can a person do that is best for his country He decides that if every person does what is best for himself and his little circle of family and friends then the country will do better This is because every person knows a lot about his own situation much more than the government knows This sort of thinking is called liberal theory a main part of liberalism

He was also a philosopher who wanted to know why people thought that some things are good and others bad He wrote an earlier book in 1759 called The Theory of Moral Sentiments He thought that sympathy was very important in ethics Sympathy is when you see how someone else is feeling imagine what it feels like and then end up feeling the same way for Smith sympathy is like putting yourself in someone elses shoes For example sympathy makes us feel happy to see someone else who is happy or feel sorry for someone who is sad Sympathy may even make us feel pain when we see someone in pain Both Smith and his friend David Hume who was another Scottish philosopher wrote about the importance of sympathy in ethics

Sir Isaac Newton was an English physicist and mathematician He is famous for his work on the laws of motion optics gravity and calculus In 1687 Newton published a book called the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica in which he presents his theory of universal gravitation and three laws of motion

Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope in 1668 he also developed a theory of light based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the colours of the rainbow Newton also shares credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the development of calculus

Newtons ideas on light motion and gravity dominated physics for the next three centuries until modified by Albert Einsteins theory of relativity

Isaac Newton was born on 4 January 1643 in a manor house in Lincolnshire England His father died three months before his birth When Isaac was three his mother remarried and Isaac remained with his grandmother He was not interested in the family farm so he was sent to the University of Cambridge to study It is sometimes told that Isaac Newton was reading a book under a tree when he saw an apple fall to the ground This led to his calculations of gravity

Newton explained the workings of the universe through mathematics He described laws of motion and gravitation These laws are math formulas that explain how objects move when a force acts on them Isaac published his most famous book Principia in 1687 while he was a mathematics professor at Trinity College Cambridge In the Principia Isaac explained three basic laws that govern the way objects move He then described his idea or theory about gravity Gravity is the force that causes things to fall down If a pencil fell off a desk it will land on the floor not the ceiling In his book Isaac also used his laws to show that the planets revolve around the suns in orbits that are oval not round 

Following are the three laws of motion

Newtons first law of motion states that an object that is not being pushed or pulled by some force will stay still or will keep moving in a straight line at a steady speed It is easy to understand that a rocket will not move unless something pushes or pulls it It is harder to understand that an object will continue to move without help Think of the rocket again If someone is flying a rocket and jumps off before the rocket is stopped what happens The rocket continues on until it goes into space The tendency of an object to remain still or keep moving in a straight line at a steady speed is called inertia

The second law explains how a force acts on an object An object accelerates in the direction the force is moving it If someone gets on a bike and pushes the pedals forward the bike will begin to move If someone gives the bike a push from behind the bike will speed up If the rider pushes back on the pedals the bike will slow down If the rider turns the handlebars the bike will change direction

The third law states that if an object is pushed or pulled the object will be push or pull equally in the opposite direction If someone lifts a heavy box they use force to push it up The box is heavy because it is producing an equal force downward on the lifters arms The weight is transferred through the lifters legs to the floor The floor presses upward with an equal force If the floor pushed back with less force the person lifting the box would fall through the floor If it pushed back with more force the lifter would fly into the air like young birds taking their first flight and falling back down again

When most people think of Isaac Newton they think of him sitting under an apple tree watching an apple fall Some people even believe the apple fell onto his head Newton understood that what makes things like apples fall to the ground is a specific kind of force the force we call gravity Newton thought that gravity was the force of attraction between two objects such as an apple and the earth He also thought that an object with more matter exerted the same force on smaller objects as they exerted on it That meant that the large mass of the earth pulled objects toward it That is why the apple fell down instead of up and why people do not float in the air

Isaac Newton went on thinking about gravity Before Newton people thought that only objects near to the earth would fall down But Newton thought that gravity should not just be limited to the earth and the objects on it What if gravity extended to the moon and beyond

Newton invented a formula for calculating the force of attraction between two bodies He used it to calculate the force needed to keep the moon moving around the earth Then he compared it with the force that made the apple fall downward After allowing for the fact that the moon is much farther from the earth and has a much greater mass he discovered that the forces were the same The moon is held in an orbit around earth by the pull of earths gravity

The formula invented by Newton is called the Law of Gravitation

Isaac Newtons calculations changed the way people understood the universe No one had been able to explain why the planets stayed in their orbits What held them up Less than 50 years before Isaac Newton was born it was thought that the planets were held in place by an invisible shield Isaac proved that they were held in place by the suns gravity He also showed that the force of gravity was affected by distance and by mass He was not the first to understand that the orbit of a planet was not circular but more elongated like an oval What he did was to explain how it worked

The great physicist Albert Einstein thought that Newtons idea of gravity was not completely accurate He corrected many of the things that Newton did

Isaac Newton died on 31 March 1727 in London England He is buried in Westminster Abbey He set the stage for many great physicists to come such as Albert Einstein James Chadwick and Stephen Hawking 

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was a German writer poet novelist and playwright He also worked as an actor administrator scientist geologist botanist and philosopher He influenced many 19th century writers and thinkers His contributions to science include his work in botany and his Theory of Colours Famous lines from his books are often quoted and some of his phrases have become part of the German language His poems were set to music by composers like Schubert Schumann Brahms Wolf and Strauss Critics and scholars say his poems are only good in German because that is the language he wrote them in His plays are not often performed outside Germany and most of his scientific work now seems old fashioned 

Goethe was born in Frankfurt am Main Germany His father was well educated and very strict His mother was only eighteen when he was born When Goethe was a young boy he began to write stories and plays for his friends In his youth he learned Greek Latin and French He studied law in Leipzig from 1765 to 1768 He also wrote some letters that are seen as beautiful and that showed his promise as a writer He continued his studies in Strasbourg from 1770 to 1771 He joined other young men who wanted to change the way that Germans were writing He thought that people like Johann Christoph Gottsched were too strict about writing poetry Instead of the ideas of the Enlightenment he wanted poets to be creative and make their own rules

One man who had many new ideas was a poet named Johann Gottfried von Herder Herder liked the plays of Shakespeare as well as folk poetry These ideas were exciting for Goethe and he helped Herder to collect folk poetry Both men believed that poetry should always come from the heart and that it should be based on the poets experiences instead an old fashioned idea of what a good poem should be Some of Goethes best known poems were written during this time like Heidenrslein Der Knig in Thule and Erlknig

Goethe fell in love with several women during his lifetime During the early period of his life he was in love with a girl named Friederike Brion the daughter of a pastor Several of his poems are inspired by her He felt extremely sad when they split up The feeling of desertion by a lover is a lot of Goethes works They are all based on his own experience His disappointment in love inspired him when writing about Werther in Die Leiden des jungen Werthers and Gretchen in his great play Faust His poems also show his ideas about science and philosophy

Die Leiden des jungen Werthers is a book written in the form of letters Werther is a young man who falls passionately in love with a girl called Lotte who is married to someone else Werther kills himself in the end The book was very successful all over Europe People talked about Werther fever Many young men who were disappointed in love copied Werther and killed themselves

Goethes most famous work is a very long play called Faust He spent most of his life working at it He was writing the first version of Faust at this time Based on a legendary character it tells of a man called Faust who is tired of studying and wants to have the greatest possible happiness The devil tells Faust he can help him to do this but that in the end Faust must give him his soul and go with him to hell Faust uses magic in the hope that it will tell him everything about life

Along with writing Goethe was developing a career in law In 1772 he spent four months in Wetzlar at the Imperial Law Courts Here he made new friends including a young girl who was already engaged to someone else

Goethe had been well educated and was good at organizing and getting on with important people For eleven years he worked at the court of Weimar for a young Duke called Karl August He became a member and later the president of the Dukes cabinet He had to organize road building projects and look after parks and buildings He studied geology mineralogy botany and anatomy He fell in love with a woman called Charlotte von Stein who was married and had several children He wrote love letters to her and she inspired him to write many poems At this time he felt that a mans task in life was to be useful The heroes of his books at this time were often ordinary people instead of geniuses 

After a time he realized that all his work on governmental duties were not giving him time for his writing so he went to Italy for 18 months He loved the landscape and made lots of sketches and he read the ancient poets and books on the history of art He wrote a play in rhyme called Iphigenie auf Tauris which combines the beauty of Classicism with great poetry

When he returned from Italy he settled once more in Weimar He visited Italy a second time He became great friends with the famous poet and playwright Friedrich Schiller The two men talked about many of their ideas and helped one another by offering criticism of their works He wrote short works such as Hermann und Dorothea which is about life in a small German town at the time of the French Revolution 

Two works of the greatest importance works occupied him at this time One is the novel Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre This is an example of what is called in German a Bildungsroman which means something like Education novel It means a novel which shows a person growing up and developing his character and learning about the world This book was a very important influence on the 19th century Romantic novel and on all German autobiographical novels ever since Goethe spent many years working on this book

The second work of enormous importance was his play Faust He made changes to the original version putting all the small bits together into one great play Schiller gave him advice while he was writing it Faust enters into a pact with the devil Mephistopheles who promises him all his soul can wish for fine living gold women and honour He signs the pact with his blood

Napoleon was fighting wars all over Europe at this time Germany which was still made up of lots of small countries was an enemy of France Goethe always thought of Napoleon as a hero His ideas about politics were still based on 18th century ideas He hated war and so he did not take part in politics but concentrated on science and literature He wrote a book called Die Wahlverwandtschaften which is about a divorce problem Some of his scientific ideas are used in the story as he talks about the way that two chemical compounds can break up and form new unions He compares this to the people in his story His poems in Weststlicher Divan are some of his greatest He uses ideas from Persia and other Eastern countries together with ideas from the West It has a lot of parables about human life

Many interesting things that Goethe said were written down in a book by his friend Eckermann who published them in a book called Conversations with Goethe Goethe also wrote about his own life in his autobiography which he called Dichtung und Wahrheit The book tells us about his youth up to the time of his arrival in Weimar It is in four parts The fourth part was published after his death He chose the title to show that he was telling us the truth about his life but that he had changed the order of some events to make it into a poetic book

Goethe wrote a sequel to Wilhelm Meister called Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre It consists of several sections which are like separate stories They tell us about Wilhelm Meisters relationship with society and how he has to change his ways to fit in with other people

Goethes Faust had made him the greatest person in European literature At the end of his life he finished a second part of Faust It is quite hard to read and is more of a long poem than a dramatic play It talks of his ideas about allegory science and philosophy

Goethe died in Weimar on March 22 1832 He had started as a great Classical writer of the 18th century and finished as a young Romantic of the 19th century No one else had such a big influence on art and literature of that time

Pythagoras of Samos was a famous Greek mathematician and philosopher born between 580 and 572 BC and died between 500 and 490 BC He is known best for the Pythagorean theorem which is an important theorem about right triangles He started a group of mathematicians called the Pythagoreans who worshiped numbers and lived like monks He was an influence for Plato

He had a great impact on mathematics theory of music and astronomy His theories are still used in mathematics today He was one of the greatest thinkers of his time

Pythagoras was born in Samos a little island off the western coast of Asia Minor There is not much information about his life He was said to have had a good childhood Growing up with two or three brothers he was well educated He did not agree with the government and their schooling so he set up his own cult of followers under his rule His followers did not have any personal possessions and they were all vegetarians Pythagoras taught them all and they had to obey strict rules

Some say he was the first person to use the term philosophy Since he worked very closely with his group the Pythagoreans it is sometimes hard to tell his works from those of his followers

Religion was important to the Pythagoreans They swore their oaths by 1234 They also believed that the soul is immortal and goes through a cycle of rebirths until it can become pure They believed that these souls were in both animal and plant life Pythagoras himself claimed to remember having lived four different lives He also told of hearing the voice of a dead friend in the howl of a dog being beaten and was then attacked by an angry mobfact

Socrates was one of the greatest Greek philosophers His work was not to propose any specific knowledge or policy it was to show how argument debate and discussion could help men to understand difficult issues Most of the issues he dealt with were only political on the surface Underneath they were moral questions about how life should be lived Such is the influence of Socrates that philosophers before him are called the Presocratic philosophers

Socrates made enemies three of whom brought charges against him Socrates was tried for his life in 399 BC found guilty and put to death by drinking hemlock The story of his trial and death is the subject of a tract by Plato which is called the Apologia 

Most of what we know about Socrates comes from the works of Plato who was his pupil Socrates lived in the Greek city of Athens His method of teaching was to have a dialogue with individual students They would propose some point of view and Socrates would question them asking what they meant He would pretend I dont know anything Im just trying to understand what it is you are saying or words to that effect This is now called the Socratic method of teaching

Socrates is sometimes called the father of Western philosophy This is because in the discussions he uncovered some of the most basic questions in philosophy questions which are still discussed today Also some of the people he taught were important and successful like Plato and Alcibiades

Socrates never wrote anything All of what we know about Socrates is from what other people wrote about him Our main source of what we know about Socrates is from the writings of his student Plato Some of Platos dialogues such as the Crito and the Phaedo are loosely based on fact They are not written records but artistic re creation of Socrates in action

Another of Socrates students Xenophon also wrote about Socrates Plato wrote down many of the conversations that Socrates had with other people Aristophanes a person who wrote brilliant satirical comedies wrote about him in play called The Clouds Socrates was an easy target for satire He walked barefoot and with a swagger Sometimes he stood in a trance for hoursp8 In The Clouds Socrates is a crazy person who tries to scam people out of their money Plato wrote that Socrates taught for free 

We do not know if Platos description of Socrates is accurate or not That is called the Socratic problem While a lot of what Plato wrote about Socrates is accepted by historians some believe that Plato portrayed Socrates as a greater man than he actually was Some think that Plato was using the character of Socrates as a tool to express his own opinions rather than to accurately write about Socrates This is what makes Socrates such a mysterious historical figure Platos dialogues are works of art finely written The general view is that they are based on reality but no doubt adjusted for the purpose of writing

Socrates father was a sculptor and his mother was a midwife who helped women give birth to children He may have been a stonemason like his father and Plato wrote that he served in the Athenian army as a hoplite We know he was influenced by an older philosopher Archelaus and that he talked with anyone who had interesting ideas in Athens but beyond that nothing is known

Socrates was about 50 when he married a much younger woman Xanthippe They had three children together Socrates made complaints about his wife but no one knew if he was telling the truth

It is said that one of Socrates friends went to ask the oracle at Delphi if there was anyone wiser than Socrates in Athens The oracle said that there was no wiser person The oracle was well known for saying things that were ambiguous or unclear It did not say that Socrates was the wisest just that there was no person wiser 

After being puzzled by this Socrates finally decided that his wisdom lay in knowing that he was ignorant His attempts to show the citizens that some of their ideas were nonsense might help explain his unpopularity In Platos works Socrates says he knows nothing but can draw out other peoples ideas just as his mother helped other women to give birth

In 399 BC when Socrates was an old man three citizensMeletus Anytus and Lyconbrought charges against Socrates A trial was held In ancient Athens the procedure was quite different from the present day There was a jury of 500 men drawn from the citizens Both the accusers and the defendant had to make speeches in person to the jury Guilt or innocence was by majority vote There was no preset penalty if the verdict was guilty Both the accuser and the defendant would make speeches proposing what the penalty should be Again a vote was takenp17

There were two charges against him The general theme was that Socrates was a menace to society The first charge was of heresy disbelief in the Gods It was probably meant to cause prejudice amongst the jurymen Actually Socrates observed all the correct procedures of the religion of his times The charge had been used successfully against another philosopher Anaxagorasp17

The second charge was that he corrupted the youth with his teachings What was meant by this Apparently this was not about his personal relationship with his pupils It was about the way he was thought to influence their political views His circle had included a number of right wing aristocrats whose ideas were now rejected by most citizens The brilliant Alcibiades once a great leader of Athens was now seen as a traitorp17

Crito a friend of Socrates illegally paid the prison guards to allow Socrates to escape Socrates however decided not to escape When Socrates was put on trial he gave a long speech to defend himself against the claims made by the Athens government

We have Platos version of how Socrates defended himself in the Apologia It starts

When Socrates was asked to propose his punishment Socrates said that the government should give him free dinners for the rest of his life for all the good that he did for society The court held a vote between giving Socrates a fine to pay or putting him to death The verdict was that Socrates was to be put to death 

Socrates did not fear death He did not try to avoid death by apologizing for his actions because he thought it was morally right to stand by his principles Socrates was ordered to drink a cup of hemlock He drank it and died soon after

Socrates helped people to see what was wrong with their ideas Sometimes they liked this sometimes they were not happy or grateful He said that he Socrates was not wise but he said something like I know what I dont know In other words he knew the limit of his knowledge He said that people who do bad things do so because they do not know any better

People think that Socrates was a good man because he did no harm except he asked questions about everything However during his life many people thought he was a bad person because he asked those questions and because he made young people unhappy about their lives

Someone once wrote that Socrates said that A life that was not examined was not worth living This means that someone must think about their own life and its purpose Some people believe that most humans are happier if they do not think too much about their life

Socrates also taught that many people can look at something and not truly see it He asked questions about the meaning of life and goodness These are still very important questions Much of philosophy is about these things

Socrates is seen by some people as a martyr Socrates is seen a person who willingly died to support his principle that knowledge and wisdom are very important to our lives

Socrates is known as one of the most important philosophers in history He is thought by some to be the father of Western philosophy While he did not start Western philosophy he had a big influence on it Before Socrates philosophy was mainly about mathematics and answering questions about our natural world Socrates expanded upon that and added topics such as ethics politics and epistemology to philosophy

Dante Alighieri or simply Dante was an Italian poet from Florence His central work the Commedia is considered the greatest literary work composed in the Italian language and a masterpiece of world literature In Italian he is known as the Supreme Poet Dante and the Divine Comedy have been a source of inspiration for artists for almost seven centuries Dante with Petrarch and Boccaccio are also known as the three fountains Dante is also called the the Father of the Italian language The first biography written on him was by his contemporary Giovanni Villani The most famous section in La Divina Commedia is the first third of it the first 34 cantos of the poem called Inferno which is Dantes vision of hell

Dante Alighieri was born in 1265 between May 14 and June 13 under the name Durante Alighieri ca 1450 His family was important in Florence and supported the Papacy The poets mother was Bella degli Abati She died when Dante was 7 years old and Alighiero soon married again to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi Lapa had two children Dantes brother Francesco and sister Tana

Dante fought in the front of the Guelph troops in the battle of Campaldino After the victory Dante gained an important part in public life

When Dante was 12 in 1277 he married Gemma di Manetto Donati Dante had already fallen in love with another girl Beatrice Portinari that is mentioned same in Divine Comedy Years after Dantes marriage to Gemma he met Beatrice again He had become interested in writing poems

Dante had six children with Gemma Jacopo Pietro Giovanni Gabrielle Alighieri and Antonia

Not much is known about Dantes education and it is presumed he studied at home It is known that he studied Tuscan poetry His interests brought him to discover the Occitan poetry of the troubadours and the Latin poetry of classical antiquity At 18 Dante met Guido Cavalcanti Lapo Gianni Cino da Pistoia and soon after Brunetto Latini together they became the leaders of Dolce Stil Novo Brunetto later received a special mention in the Divine Comedy for what he had taught Dante

When he was nine years old he met Beatrice Portinari daughter of Folco Portinari with whom he fell in love at first sight and apparently without even having spoken to her He saw her frequently after age 18 often exchanging greetings in the street but he never knew her wellhe effectively set the example for the so called courtly love Dante gave his imprint to the Stil Novo Love for Beatrice would apparently be the reason for poetry and for living together with political passions In many of his poems she appears such as semi divine watching over him constantly

When Beatrice died in 1290 Dante tried to find an help in Latin literature

He then dedicated himself to philosophical studies at religious schools like the Dominican one in Santa Maria Novella This excessive passion for philosophy would later be criticized by the character Beatrice in Purgatorio the second book of the Divine Comedy

Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome At the same time Charles de Valois entered Florence with Black Guelphs who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies A new Black Guelph government was installed and Messer Cante dei Gabrielli di Gubbio was appointed Podest of Florence Dante was put in exile for two years and ordered to pay a large hill of money 

Dante did not pay the money in part because he believed he was not guilty and in part because all his needs in Florence had been stolen by the Black Guelphs He was condemned to exile for life and if he returned to Florence without paying the money he could be burned at the stake

In exile he began searching the foundation for the Divine Comedy a work in 100 cantos divided into three books of thirty three cantos each with a single introductory canto

He went to Verona as a guest of Bartolomeo I della Scala then moved to Sarzana in Liguria Later he is supposed to have lived in Lucca with Madame Gentucca Some not sure sources say that he was also in Paris between 1308 and 1310 

In 1310 the Holy Roman Emperor Henry VII of Luxembourg marched 5000 troops into Italy Dante saw in him a new Charlemagne who would restore the office of the Holy Roman Emperor for re take Florence from the Black Guelphs He wrote to Henry and several Italian princes demanding that they destroy the Black Guelphs Mixing religion and private concerns he invoked the worst anger of God against his city suggesting several particular targets that coincided with his personal enemies It was during this time that he wrote the first two books of the Divine Comedy

When Dante died at Ravenna the custodians of the body at Ravenna put the bones in a false wall of the monastery Nevertheless in 1829 a tomb was built for him in Florence in the basilica of Santa Croce That tomb has been empty ever since with Dantes body remaining in Ravenna far from the land he loved so dearly The front of his tomb in Florence reads Onorate laltissimo poeta  which roughly translates as Honour the most exalted poet 

Virginia Woolf was an English writer essayist and feminist

She was born into a famous family Her father Leslie Stephen was a Victorian scholar Her sister Vanessa Bell was a painter She had two brothers one of them Thoby died in 1906

Her mother died when she was thirteen and four years later her half sister Stella died In these times Virginia started to have her psychological problems She had manic depression in the time when no one knew this disease and for most of the people she was just strange

After the death of her mother Leslie Stephen was not able to keep good relations in the family Virginia and her sister Vanessa were sexually abused by their half brothers George and Gerald It affected Virginia for the rest of her life

In the childhood all the Stephens children were writing their diaries but only Virginia kept write it for the whole life It was important for her in the time of sexual abusing because there was no one with who she could talk about it In the diary she could write everything 

After her fathers death Virginia and her brothers and sister moved to the London part called Bloomsbury and there they became members of the famous group of the artists called Bloomsbury Group Here Virginia met her husband a writer Leonard Woolf Together they moved to Richmond where they opened a publishing office called Hogarth House Press which later published all Virginias novels and essays

Although she had a husband she was bisexual When she was a teenager she fell in love with Violet Dickinson and she wrote her lots of love letters Violet probably never loved her Later Virginia had a sexual relationship with Vita Sackville West a writer and a poet Their letters which have been published are showing us how deeply they were in love

Her most famous novels are Mrs Dalloway and To the Lighthouse Mrs Dalloway she finished in 1925 It is about one day of an English woman called Clarissa Dalloway Clarissa is making a party and all the day she is preparing it The story can seem stupid but it is not so important in the book More important are the feelings the colours or the mood of it Its very charming

To the Lighthouse was published in 1927 for the first time It is about a family of Ramsays and its friends These people are altogether spending a summer in Ramsays house on an island The youngest of Ramsays children James wants to go to the lighthouse but they cant go there because of bad weather In the next part of the book James is ten years older and his father is taking him to the lighthouse although he doesnt want to go there anymore

Virginia Woolf is also an author of these novels Jacobs Room Orlando and The Waves She was a feminist and she wrote a few essays about womens position in the society for example The Room of Ones Own and Three Guineas

She died on 28 March 1941 She committed suicide by drowning in the river Ouse

In 1998 American writer Michael Cunningham wrote about her a novel called The Hours which is best known because of the same named movie in which the role of Virginia played an actress Nicole Kidman She won the Oscar 

March 28 is the 87th day of the year in the Gregorian calendar 

Jane Austen was an English novelist She wrote many books of romantic fiction about the gentry Her works made her one of the most famous and beloved writers in English literature She was one of the great masters of the English novel

Austens works criticized sentimental novels in the late eighteenth century and are part of the change to nineteenth century realism She wrote about typical people in everyday life This gave the English novel its first distinctly modern character Austens stories are often comic but they also show how women depended on marriage for social standing and economic security Her works are also about moral problems

Jane Austen was born on 16 December 1775 at Steventon near Basingstoke Educated mostly by her father and older brothers and also by her own reading she lived with her family at Steventon They moved to Bath when her father retired in 1801 After he died in 1805 she moved around with her mother In 1809 they settled in Chawton near Alton Hampshire In May 1817 she moved to Winchester to be near her doctor She died there on 18 July 1817

Jane Austen was very modest about her own genius She once famously described her work as the little bit of Ivory on which I work with so fine a brush as produces little effect after much labor When she was a girl she wrote stories Her works were printed only after much revision Only four of her novels were printed while she was alive They were Sense and Sensibility Pride and Prejudice Mansfield Park and Emma Two other novels Northanger Abbey and Persuasion were printed in 1817 with a biographical notice by her brother Henry Austen Persuasion was written shortly before her death She also wrote two earlier works Lady Susan and an unfinished novel The Watsons She had been working on a new novel Sanditon but she died before she could finish it

Biographical facts about Jane Austen are famously scarce Only a few letters remain Her sister Cassandra burned the greater part of the ones she kept The letters she did not destroy she censored Other letters were destroyed by the heirs of Admiral Francis Austen Janes brother Most of the biographies written about her for 50 years after she died was by her relatives who often described her as good quiet Aunt Jane Scholars have not been able to find much information after that

Austens parents George Austen and his wife Cassandra were both part of the gentry Cassandra was a part of the important Leigh family George and Cassandra married on 26 April 1764 at Walcot Church in Bath

Austen had a large family She had six brothersJames George Edward Henry Thomas Francis William Charles Johnand one sister Cassandra Elizabeth who died without marrying Jane deeply loved Cassandra and they were both best friends Of her brothers Austen was most close to Henry who helped spread and influence her writing Oh what a Henry she once wrote George was almost ten years older than Jane Sadly he suffered from fits and was not able to develop normally His father wrote of him We have this comfort he cannot be a bad or a wicked child He may also have been deaf and mute Jane knew sign language and could have communicated with him Charles and Frank served in the navy Edward was adopted by his fourth cousin Thomas Knight He became Edward Knight instead of Edward Austen in 1812

Austen was born on 16 December 1775 at Steventon rectory She was christened in public on 5 April 1776 A few months after she was born her mother hired a woman named Elizabeth Littlewood to nurse her Littlewood took care of Austen for about a year According to family tradition Jane and Cassandra were sent to Oxford to be educated by Mrs Ann Crawley in 1783 They moved with her to Southampton later in the year Both girls caught typhus and Jane almost died After that Austen was educated at home until she went to boarding school with Cassandra early in 1785 She learned some French spelling needlework dancingmusic and probably drama In the winter of 1786 Jane and Cassandra went back home because their family was not rich enough to send both of their daughters to school Austen then studied English at Bristol University She stayed in Manor Hall in Clifton at that time

Austen also learned much by reading books Her father and brothers helped choose the books she read George Austen seemed to have let his daughters read the books in his large library freely He also allowed Austens experiments in writing and gave her costly paper and other writing materials

Jane Austen and her family also enjoyed acting out plays privately Most of the plays were comedies This might have been a way for Austens comedic and satirical talents developed

Perhaps from as early as 1787 Austen began writing poems short stories and plays for fun Austen later put together fair copies of 29 of these early works into three notebooks They are now called the Juvenilia It has pieces which were first written down between 1787 and 1793 There is some proof that Austen continued to work on these pieces later in life Her nephew and niece James Edward and Anna Austen may have made further additions to her work in around 1814 In these works were included Love and Freindship sic In Love and Freindship she laughed at popular sentimental novels She also wrote The History of England which had 13 watercolour pictures by her sister Cassandra inside it

The Mutiny on the Bounty has become a famous story leading to many books movies and songs The HMS Bounty was a small three masted fully rigged sailing ship The Bounty became famous when the crew mutinied the ship on 28 April 1789 

The ship was built in Hull England in 1784 and was first called Bethia In 1787 the ship was rebuilt to carry breadfruit trees Heat and water were added to the cabins so the trees would survive in cold weather The British government was hoping the breadfruit trees growing wild in Tahiti could be grown in Jamaica This would provide cheap food for the slaves working on the sugar farms The ship was very small  90 feet 10 inches long and 24 feet 4 inches wide The tallest mast was 53 feet high

The Bounty was captained by Lieutenant William Bligh and he took command on 16 August 1787 On 23 December 1787 Bounty set off on the long trip to Tahiti On the journey William Bligh tried to go around Cape Horn He tried for over a month but bad weather and winds stopped the ship The Bounty was turned around and went the longer way around the Cape of Good Hope

The Bounty reached Tahiti on 25 October 1788 She had been at sea for ten months The crew stayed for five months and lived on the island They collected 1015 breadfruit plants The crew were very happy living in Tahiti and Fletcher Christian fell in love with a Tahitian girl named Maimiti They did not want to have another long journey and go back to England

The Bounty left Tahiti on 4 April 1789 on the way to Jamaica On 28 April near the Friendly Islands Fletcher Christian led the mutiny Bligh and 18 sailors were left at sea in a small boat while Christian and the Bounty went back to Tahiti Christian and a small group of sailors 11 Tahitian women and 6 Tahitian men then went to the remote Pitcairn Island After they arrived they took everything they could from the ship A sailor called Matthew Quintal burned and destroyed the Bounty on 23 January 1790

Pitcairn Island is a remote island in the Pacific Ocean The Polynesians knew about the island and people had once lived there There was nobody living on Pitcairn when it was discovered by an English sailor Philip Carteret on 2 July 1767 He made a mistake and marked it on the map 200 miles from its real location The people from the Bounty had the remote island to themselves There was a lot of fighting between the new settlers Fletcher Christian 4 other mutineers and all 6 of the Tahitian men were killed One of the 4 surviving mutineers fell off a cliff while drunk Matthew Quintal was killed by the remaining 2 mutineers after he attacked them When the American seal hunting ship Topaz visited the island in 1808 they found only 1 mutineer John Adams still alive along with 9 Tahitian women In 1856 the British government moved all the island people to Norfolk Island Most stayed on Norfolk but about 22 people found their way back and their descendants still live on Pitcairn Norfolk has about 1000 Bounty descendants which is about half its population

Lieutenant William Bligh was able to sail the small boat 6500 km back to Batavia He returned to England and reported the mutiny to the Admiralty on 15 March 1790 On 7 November 1790 HMS Pandora was sent to Tahiti look for the Bounty and to bring back the mutineers for punishment The Pandora was able to capture the mutineers left on Tahiti but could find no sign of the group that was hiding on Pitcairn The Pandora was wrecked on the way back to England

The following list tells what happened to the crew of the Bounty

Two died before the mutiny

From the 19 left in the small boat only 12 got back safely to England

One sailor was killed on the trip to Timor

One sailor died from disease when they reached Timor

Three sailors died from disease not long after getting to Batavia

Two sailors died on their way home from Batavia to England

Seven sailors were forced to stay on the Bounty after the mutiny There was not room in the small boat They were all taken prisoner in Tahiti by the Pandora to be taken back to England to be charged

Two of the mutineers who stayed on Tahiti died before the Pandora arrived

Three mutineers who were captured by the Pandora drowned in the wreck

Four mutineers survived the wreck and were taken to England for trial

Only two of the mutineers who went to Pitcairn died peacefully

Some other virtues have also been suggested humour empathy

Lady Jane Grey also known as The Nine Days Queen was born in London or at her family home of Bradgate Park Leicestershire England

Jane was an English noblewoman who occupied the English throne from 10 July until 19 July 1553 and was executed a commen punishment for royal blood for high treason 

A great granddaughter of Henry VII by his younger daughter Mary Jane was a first cousin once removed of Edward VI 

In May 1553 Jane was married to Lord Guildford Dudley a younger son of Edwards chief minister John Dudley Duke of Northumberland When the 15 year old King lay dying in June 1553 he nominated Jane as successor to the Crown in his will thus subverting the claims of his half sisters Mary and Elizabeth 

During her short reign Jane lived in the Tower of London She became a prisoner there when the Privy Council decided to change sides and proclaim Mary as queen on 19 July 1553 Wyatts rebellion in January and February 1554 against Queen Marys plans of a Spanish match was the direct cause of Janes and her husbands execution 

She was the daughter of Henry Grey Duke of Suffolk and Lady Frances Brandon the daughter of Henry VIIIs sister Mary She was born on 12 October 1537 and she was probably named after Jane Seymour Jane had two younger sisters Catherine and Mary

Janes parents were very strict even by the standards of the day If she made mistakes in her studies or had any other normal troubles her mother would slap her or beat her She found she loved her nurse but otherwise lived a sad childhood

She told a visiting scholar Roger Ascham  For when I am in the presence of either Father or Mother whether I speak keep silence sit stand or go eat drink be merry or sad be sewing playing dancing or doing anything else I must do it as it were in such weight measure and number even so perfectly as God made the world or else I am so sharply taunted so cruelly threatened yes presently sometimes with pinches nips and bobs and other ways that I think myself in hell 

When Jane was nine she was sent to the royal court to learn etiquette and manners with Henry VIIIs sixth wife and eventual widow Catherine Parr Jane liked Catherine a great deal and found love with her which she had not got from her parents It was clear that Catherine was very fond of Jane in return 

Jane also found friendship with her cousin and future king Edward VI They often studied together

Jane was well educated as a child and learned to read in Latin Greek French and Italian as well as English Later in her life she also learned Hebrew

Janes parents especially her mother wanted to gain more political influence For that reason they wanted to marry her to someone important Jane had two sisters Catherine born in 1540 and Mary born in 1545 After her sisters were born her parents tried to marry Jane to her cousin Edward VI They went to Catherine Parrs new husband Thomas Seymour to try to prepare this royal marriage It is likely that King Edward loved Jane However he decided to arrange a marriage with a foreign princess instead

In 1548 Jane was sent to Chelsea to be with Catherine Parr and Thomas Seymour Catherine Parr became pregnant that same year and the family moved to Sudeley Castle in June taking Jane with them Tragedy struck when Catherine Parr died while having the baby in August of that year and Jane served as chief mourner in her funeral

Jane was dealt another blow in 1549 when Thomas Seymour was arrested on charges of treason She was sent back to her angered parents They knew that their hopes of her marriage to the king were ruined they punished her cruelly for this even though it was not her fault

In 1551 Janes mothers two half brothers died of the Sweating Sickness Since Francess father was dead she became Duchess of Suffolk Janes father also became Duke of Suffolk In the same year John Dudley was made the Duke of Northumberland and the chief councillor to Edward VI 

In April 1552 Edward became sick with the measles and caught tuberculosis as well By next year Edward was so ill that he was weak and spitting up blood or something that was greenish yellow It was clear that he was going to die soon 

Dudley knew that if either of Edwards half sisters Mary or Elizabeth became queen he would not be powerful anymore Dudley plotted with Janes equally ambitious parents and planned that Jane became his ward and also that she marry his son Guildford Dudley Janes mother decided to give up her claim to be queen for Jane This did not mean that Frances was any less greedy however This meant that Jane would become Frances and Dudleys puppet and do what they wanted Now Jane would be the next in line to the throne if the rights of the princesses Mary and Elizabeth were ignored

When Janes mother and father told her that Jane was going to get married Jane refused She said that Guildford was ugly stupid and rude She also hated John Dudley When Jane refused Frances and Henry swore at Jane and slapped her This did not work so Frances gave Jane a brutal whipping Finally Jane agreed The wedding between Jane and Guildford happened on 25 May 1553 This became a triple marriage because Janes sister Katherine was married at this time to Lord Herbert and Guildfords sister Katherine was also married to Lord Hastings 

At first they were all forbidden to consummate their marriages This probably made Katherine Grey and William Herbert unhappy It is not known if they liked each other but it was obvious that they wanted to consummate the marriage 

On the other hand Jane and Guildford hated each other They ignored each other for most of the time But they consummated the marriage later

On 6 July 1553 King Edward VI died Dudleys plan to make Jane queen was starting to take place Edwards death was kept secret for a few days until Jane could be proclaimed queen

Jane was told by her parents and John Dudley that she was queen She became sick with fright and fainted She refused to take the crown The crown is not my right It pleaseth me not The Lady Mary is the rightful heir Jane said Her parents swore at her and John Dudley told her that she doth wrong to herself and her house Under pressure Jane finally relented But she never forgave herself for doing this

Meanwhile news was spreading the Jane had been proclaimed the new queen Although the people liked Jane they loved Mary and Elizabeth more They also hated John Dudley In East Anglia Mary was gaining support and planning to march into London Dudley tried to enforce a counter attack but to no avail On 19 July Mary became queen Jane was queen for nine days

Jane returned all the crown jewels and clothes She was then brought into the Tower of London There she was kept in a cell for the next few months She was allowed to walk in the garden however She wrote many letters and read many books while at the Tower of London She wrote a letter to Queen Mary saying that she never wanted the crown Queen Mary believed Jane and refused to execute her cousin Many people pressured Mary but she was stubborn She still ordered that a trial be held for traditional purposes Jane was found guilty but the Queen pardoned her

But the next year 1554 a group of rebels under Thomas Wyatt including Janes father Henry Grey led a rebellion against Queen Mary because she was planning to marry prince Phillip II of Spain It was quickly put down Although Jane had nothing to do with it and Mary did not want to kill her cousin her advisors told her that Phillip would only come if Jane was killed So with a heavy heart Queen Mary signed the death warrant Jane was going to be beheaded

When Jane was told that her head was going to be cut off she was very scared Nonetheless she was happy that her sad and woeful days of life were finally coming to an end 

Meanwhile Mary still did not want to kill her cousin So she sent a Catholic priest Dr Feckenham to try to convert Jane to Catholicism That way Jane would not be a threat But Jane was a firm Protestant and refused to become a Catholic Janes execution was postponed from 9 February to 12 February to try and make her a Catholic The night before the execution Jane wrote many letters to her family and prepared her neck for the block The next morning her hair was tied back and she watched Guildford go very unwillingly to the block Then it was her turn

On 12 February 1554 at the Tower of London Jane was sent to the scaffold She calmly climbed the scaffold and said a speech She said the Psalm 51 in the most devout manner She then knelt by the block and tied a piece of cloth around her eyes 

When the executioner told her to put her head on the block she reached out but could not find the block since she was very scared She cried for help until someone grabbed her hands and helped her find the block Jane then put her neck above the block and slowly lowered it onto the block pressed her neck against the wood and fit her chin in the hold Then she brought her arms around her Before she was executed she cried out Lord into thy hands I commend my spirit

The crowd watched as the executioner raised the axe high in the air Jane was shivering badly but her neck stayed perfectly still Then the executioner quickly swung the axe down perfectly at the middle of Janes neck which was severed in a single stroke Janes severed head fell to the straw in front of the block while huge amounts of blood splattered across the scaffold The executioner then grabbed Janes head by her red hair and lifted it up to show the crowd He shouted So perish all the Queens enemies Behold the head of a traitor

After the crowd left the blood was removed and Janes body was brought to the church St Peter ad Vincula Since the church had just become Catholic and Jane was a Protestant they had to get permission from Queen Mary to bury her It was four hours until her maids were allowed to prepare her body for burial Janes body was buried between former Queens Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard It is unknown what happened to her severed head

 The Tower of London is an ancient Norman stone fortress in London England It stands on the bank of the River Thames in the oldest part of the city It was built by William the Conqueror King William I starting in 1078 The moat was built by Richard I using water diverted from the River Thames 

The Tower had many uses Its main function was to protect Norman rule in the years after the conquest It was a prison and a place of execution Today the Crown Jewels are kept there This is the collection of jewels owned by the British state and sometimes worn by the monarch There is also a museum of armour

Only the most important people were executed inside the Tower of London Among the most famous were

The Tower of London has a collection of ravens large black birds of the Crow family They are taken care of by the staff who work there The ravens wing feathers are kept short so they cannot fly away This is because a legend says that if the ravens leave the Tower the Tower and the Kingdom will fall

The closest Underground station to the Tower of London is Tower Hill

Peoples opinions of Annes beauty was different The Venetian diarist Marino Sanuto described Anne as not one of the handsomest women in the world she is of middling broken wikt linkstaturestature broken wikt linkswarthinessswarthy complexion long neck wide mouth bosom not much raised eyes which are black and beautiful Simon Gryne wrote to Martin Bucer in September 1531 that Anne was young good looking of a rather dark complexion Lancelot de Carles called her beautiful with a good figure A Venetian in Paris in 1528 also said that she was beautiful The most well known description of Anne was written by the Catholic Nicholas Sanders in 1586 He wrote it several years after Anne died Even though this is the most famous it is also probably the wrongest description Anne Boleyn he said was rather tall with black hair and an oval face of a sallow complexion as if troubled with jaundice She had a projecting tooth under the upper lip and on her right hand six fingers which historians now say is not true There was a large wen under her chin and therefore to hide its ugliness she wore a high dress covering her throat She was handsome to look at with a pretty mouth Sanders said that it was because of Anne that Henry went away from the Catholic church Sanders words about Anne made what Eric Ives called the monster legend of Anne Boleyn Anne was also a good dancer William Forrest who wrote a modern poem about Catherine of Aragon praised Annes dancing He said she had passing excellent skill as a dancer Here he wrote was a fresh young damsel that could trip and go

Little is known for certain about Annes early life beginning with her date and place of birth She was born in either 1501 or 1507 at either Blickling Hall in Norfolk or Hever Castle in Kent She was the daughter of Sir Thomas Boleyn a courtier and later a diplomat and his wife Lady Elizabeth Howard daughter of the Duke of Norfolk She had two siblings a sister Mary and a brother George 

Annes early education was the same for girls of her class Her academic education was limited to arithmetic her family genealogy grammar history reading and writing She had been given a strong upbringing in religion and the Scriptures as the Boleyns were a family of firm religious beliefs Anne developed domestic skills such as dancing embroidery good manners and morals household management music needlework and singing and excelled in playing several musical instruments including the block flute the harp the lute and the virginals She learned to play games such as cards chess and dice and outdoor pursuits such as archery falconry horseback riding and hunting Anne was also taught to have obedience to the men in her life was which first to her father and then to her husband once she was married

In 1513 she was sent to Margaret of Austrias royal court in the Netherlands to complete her education Anne learned to speak French and studied art culture dance literature music and poetry while she was there The following year she was transferred to the French court on the occasion of the marriage of Princess Mary Tudor younger sister of King Henry VIII to the French King Louis XII Anne remained in France after the death of Louis XII and served as a lady in waiting to Queen Claude upon the accession of Francis I In Queen Claudes household Anne completed her study of French and developed a thorough knowledge of French culture and etiquette As well as English French and some Italian Anne demonstrated a working knowledge of Latin She also developed an interest in fashion and religious philosophy that called for reform of the Church Anne stayed in France until late winter 1521

Anne was called back to England to marry a distant cousin James Butler in the hope to settle an inheritance dispute However when the plan failed Thomas Boleyn found a place for his daughter at the English court as lady in waiting to Queen Katherine There Anne fell in love with Sir Henry Percy who was the eldest son of the Earl of Northumberland and they became secretly engaged to be married much to the displeasure of their respective families Cardinal Wolsey ordered them to be separated Anne was sent home to Hever Castle and Henry Percy was forced to marry Lady Mary Talbot the daughter of Edward Talbot Earl of Shrewsbury Anne blamed Cardinal Wolsey for her lost love and was determined to have her revenge on him because he had called her a foolish girl

Anne came back to the royal court and soon King Henry fell passionately in love with her He wanted her to become his mistress however she categorically refused which made Henrys desire for her even greater 

King Henrys marriage to Catherine of Aragon had produced only one daughter Princess Mary not thought suitable to rule the country after his death Henry needed a son to succeed him and to secure the Tudor dynasty but Catherine was now to old to have children Henry then came to see Anne as the answer to the problem of the succession and decided to divorce Catherine so that he could marry Anne instead and have male heirs 

He said that the marriage was not valid because Catherine had been married to his older brother Arthur Prince of Wales before she had married Henry Arthur had died a few months after the marriage at the age of fifteen and a special dispensation from the Pope on the ground the marriage had never been consummated was issued so Catherine could marry Henry and the alliance between Spain and England would be kept King Henry now thought that their marriage should not have been allowed in the first place and that they had been punished by not having any sons He quoted a verse from the Bible that said a man may not marry his brothers wife He said he was doing what he thought was right even though he still loved Catherine but his conscience would not allow him to continue living in sin with her The plans for the divorce caused a lot of gossip at court and abroad and became known as the Kings Great Matter 

A special court was held with Wolsey leading it to decide if the divorce should be allowed An official from the Pope in Rome was brought over and a trial was held The official stated that he could not decide what to do He wanted the Pope to decide instead The Pope was fearful to offend Charles V Holy Roman Emperor nephew of Catherine and what would happen if he allowed the divorce He did not make a decision In the meantime Anne and King Henry were becoming more and more impatient

After becoming Marquess of Pembroke in her own right Anne felt secure enough and finally gave in to Henry in late 1532 and soon became pregnant In order to have a legitimate heir to the throne this meant that Anne and Henry needed to legalize their union quickly and therefore were secretly married on January 25 1533 even though the divorce had not come through 

No longer hoping for the Pope to grant him a divorce Henrys marriage to Catherine of Aragon was declared illegal in the following May by the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer former chaplain of the Boleyns Catherine was sent away from court with the title of Dowager Princess of Wales as if she had never been married to Henry 

Now recognized as Henrys legal wife Anne was formally crowned Queen of England on June 1 1533 All that was needed now was the birth of a son and her triumph would be complete 

Anne gave birth to a daughter the future Elizabeth I of England on September 7 1533 King Henry was very disappointed after all his troubles the problem of the succession was still not resolved However Anne soon became pregnant again but that ended in a miscarriage in the summer of 1534 Henry started to worry that Anne could not give him a healthy male child Anne feeling more and more insecure became more and more difficult and Henry began tiring of her When on January 29 1536 Anne gave birth to a stillborn male child Henry was furious and turned against her accusing her of having bewitched him   

Henrys new secretary Thomas Cromwell looked for a way to get rid of Anne so that Henry could marry again He found people who said that Anne had been the lover of other men while she was married to King Henry She was put on trial and found guilty of treason adultery and incest although she was probably innocent The men who were accused of being her lovers were Sir Francis Weston her musician Mark Smeaton Sir Henry Norris William Brereton and her brother Viscount Rochford George Boleyn All of them were condemned and executed

Anne was executed on 19 May 1536 in the Tower of London London England She was buried in the Chapel Royal of Saint Peter ad Vincula within the Tower of London

Mona Lisa is a 16th century portrait painted in oil by Leonardo da Vinci during the Renaissance in Florence Italy As of 2011 the work is owned by the Government of France and is shown at the Muse du Louvre in Paris under the title Portrait of Lisa Gherardini wife of Francesco del Giocondo Many people think Mona Lisas smile is mysterious It is so often studied recognized and copied that many people say it is the most famous painting in the world The Louvre says that about 80 percent of its visitors come to see the painting of Mona Lisa

Vasari who was Leonardos first biographer thought the painting was of a person named Lisa Gherardini Speculation over the paintings model was solved in 2008 by Dr Armin Schlechter a manuscript expert Notes discovered in Heidelberg University Library which were written by Agostino Vespucci a Florentine city official reinforced Vasarils earlier indentification of the model Lisa was the wife of Francesco del Giocondo a wealthy silk merchant who lived in Florence

Scholars have been of many minds identifying several people as the paintings subject There are scholars who think that the Mona Lisa is Leonardos mother Caterina in a distant memory

Leonardo began painting the Mona Lisa in 1503 or 1504 in Florence Italy According to Da Vincis contemporary Giorgio Vasari after he had lingered over it four years left it unfinished The painting was brought to France by Leonardo in 1516 and it was bought by Francis I of France 

The Mona Lisa used to hang in the Chateau Fontainebleau and was then moved to the Palace of Versailles After the French Revolution Napoleon I of France had it hanging in his bedroom in the Tuileries Palace but it was later moved to the Louvre where it is still hanging today

On August 21 1911 the Mona Lisa was stolen The Louvre museum thought it was being photographed but when they checked it was not there The Louvre closed for one week to help look for it

People thought Guillaume Apollinaire a French poet stole it He was put into jail and tried to make people think his friend Pablo Picasso did it and he was questioned It was not either of them though

It was lost for two years and everybody thought it would be lost forever A worker at the Louvre named Vincenzo Peruggia had actually stolen it He had hidden it in his coat and walked out with it after the museum had closed He wanted the painting to go back to Italy and be shown in an Italian museum After hiding it in his apartment for two years he grew impatient and tried to sell it to a gallery in Florence but was caught It was shown all over Italy before going back to the Louvre People thought Vincenzo was a hero who loved Italy so he only spent a few months in jail The Mona Lisa is very mysterious

1981 was a common year starting on Thursday of the Gregorian calendar

The Matrix is a science fiction action movie that was made in 1999 It was written and directed by the Wachowski Brothers The main actors in the movie are Keanu Reeves Laurence Fishburne Carrie Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving The Matrix was followed by two sequels The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions

The main character is Neo a hacker A man named Morpheus shows Neo what the Matrix is The Matrix is a computer program that is an unreal world The computer program makes people think that they live in the real world The machines built the Matrix 

The Matrix is a computer program that tricks people It uses their bodies to get energy Before the movie Neo lives in the computer program of the Matrix Then Neo realizes that he is living a false life inside of the Matrix Neo must fight the Matrix to free the humans He is trying to let all the humans know the truth  that they are living inside the Matrix

There is a lot of symbolism in The Matrix Common sources are Christianity BuddhismHinduism the ancient philosopher Plato and Platos Cave modern philosophers such as Ren Descartes and modern authors such as William Gibson 

Descartes says that maybe humans are brains in jars A monster is maybe tricking humans The monster makes humans believe that they are in the real world but actually humans are simply brains Humans cannot know what is real 

There are also references to Simulacra and Simulation a very modern philosophy book by Jean Baudrillard Baudrillard says that in the modern world copies of copies are made The Real is gone because people do not know what the first things were For example a modern person who eats a chicken did not kill the chicken That person does not know what a real chicken is The chicken meat is false because the person did not kill the chicken The persons reality is the chicken meat

The September 11 2001 attacks shortened as nine eleven 911 or 9 11 were four attacks by terrorists that happened on the same day Four groups of people each with a trained pilot captured airplanes and flew them into US landmarks These landmarks were the World Trade Centers twin towers in New York and the Pentagon The fourth plane crashed before reaching its target in Washington DC After the event the US government said the people who had done the attacks were close to the terrorist group al Qaeda During the events nearly 3000 people died Most of them were from the United States but over 300 were from other places such as the United Kingdom India and Canada

All of the 246 people on the four planes died in the crashes 19 terrorists were also killed in the attacks Both towers of the World Trade Center caught on fire after the crashes The south tower burned for 56 minutes before it fell and was destroyed The north tower burned for 102 minutes before it also fell As the towers fell parts of the towers hit other buildings around them It is believed that because of this damage a third building 7 World Trade Center fell at 520 pm but this is a debated subject Many other buildings in the area were damaged badly and had to be destroyed 2602 people died at the World Trade Center

The plane that hit the Pentagon hit the ground just as it hit the western side of the building It then crashed through three of the five rings that make up the Pentagon The crash killed 125 people in the Pentagon

2973 people died in the attacks including people such as firemen and policemen trying to save the lives of other people 

This was the first big attack by non Americans on the United States since 1941 when Japanese war planes attacked the US naval base at Pearl Harbor Hawaii There had been some big terrorist acts against American targets before but most of them have been outside the US

Many conspiracy theories have appeared which say that certain people in the United States government knew about the attacks beforehand or even made them happen and many people in the United States believe that this is the truth

After the attack the United States blamed al Qaeda which the US believed was a terrorist group President George Bush said he would start a War on Terror He meant that the United States would take major steps to protect Americans and their property from terrorists For example the American government would be reorganized Security in public places was made stronger especially at airports Americans were told every day whether there was a serious threat of terrorism

The War on Terror also led to real military wars The leader of al Qaeda Osama bin Laden lived in the country of Afghanistan The United States told the government of Afghanistan called the Taliban to turn bin Laden over to them The Taliban would not do this The leader of the Taliban Mullah Muhammad Omar demanded to see proof first from the United States government President George Bush said that he did not need to provide proof The United States then went to war against Afghanistan The Taliban was removed from power and a new government was elected by the people of Afghanistan

While this was happening the United States government changed in a few ways The US Department of Transportation created the Transportation Security Administration Before 911 security at American airports was provided by the airlines The TSA made it the governments job to provide airport security New officers were hired by TSA to work at airports and to fly on planes as air marshals The TSA also provides security on American trains and subways A new Department of Homeland Security was also created It became their job to protect Americans and their property inside the United States When this department was created the TSA moved from the DOT to Homeland Security

After defeating the Taliban President Bush thought the US should invade Iraq He believed that Iraq helped terrorist groups including al Qaeda He said he had evidence that Iraq was also making weapons of mass destruction He sent Secretary of State Colin Powell to the United Nations to show them some of the evidence In March 2003 the United States began its invasion of Iraq The government of Iraq was overthrown and the people of Iraq elected a new government No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq

Denise Lewis is a British retired athlete from West Bromwich

Michael Duane Johnson Dallas Texas He is considered one of the best runners in the world He still holds a world record 

His 200 meter world record was beaten by Usain Bolt at the Beijing 2008 Olympics He was the first athlete to win both the 200m and 400m sprints in the same Olympic Games He retired in 2001 and currently is a sports commentator on TV 

The Bronze Age is the time period when people made tools from a metal called bronze Bronze is a mixture of two other metals nine parts copper to one part tin Materials like wood and stone were also used for tools but bronze was better for cutting and chopping and was easy to shape The Bronze Age was not at the same time everywhere because different groups of people began to use bronze at different times In Western Europe the Bronze Age lasted from about 2000 BC until 800 BC In the Middle East it started about a thousand years earlier For example bronze was first used in Mesopotamia around 3000 BC

Archaeologists think that people became more organised in the Bronze Age because the making of metal tools was difficult and needed certain skills The people who had these new skills would have been important The new metal tools were bought sold or traded across larger distances

Later when iron tools spread the Bronze Age ended and the Iron Age started A reason for iron replacing bronze is that tin ore a rock in which tin may found is much more rare than iron ore Copper tools were not useful because they were too soft

By the Bronze Age wild food was no longer a main part of the diet The title inventors of agriculture might go to the Sumerians starting c 5500 BC 

Farming allows more people in an area than can be supported by hunting and gathering Crops can be stored for off season use or to sell or barter Farmers could feed people to do other things than agriculture This was a crucial factor in the rise of full time armies 

Sumerian agriculture allowed them to win battles and land This made them early empire builders Not long after the Egyptians farming in the fertile Nile valley increased their population There were now enough warriors for a territorial expansion more than tripling the Sumerian empire in area

In Sumer barley was the primary crop wheat flax dates apples plums and grapes were grown as well Mesopotamian agriculture was both supported and limited by flooding of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers Floods came in late spring or early summer from snow melting from the Anatolian mountains 

Sheep and goats were domesticated kept mainly for meat milk butter and cheese Ur a large town that covered about 50 acres kept 10000 animals 3000 were slaughtered every year The citys population of 6000 included a labour force of 2500 cultivated 3000 acres of land The labour force included storehouse recorders work foremen overseers and harvest supervisors as well as labourers 

The land was plowed by teams of oxen pulling light unwheeled plows and grain was harvested with sickle Wagons had solid wheels covered by leather tires kept in position by copper nails and were drawn by oxen As many as four animals could pull a wagon at one time The horse was domesticated in Ukraine around 4000 BC and was in use by the Sumerians around 2000 BC

Louis XIV also popularly known as the Sun King was the King of France and King of Navarre from 14 May 1643 until his death He was a king for 72 years This was the longest recorded rule of any European monarch He is often seen as the typical example of absolutism

Louis parents were Louis XIII and Anne of Austria He was the unexpected child of King Louis XIII and Anne of Austria who had not had children in their 22 year marriage He was christened Louis Dieudonn In 1643 before his fifth birthday his father died and Louis inherited the throne of France Because Louis XIV was too young to rule his mother ruled France with Cardinal Mazarin the Italian financier who had been the principal minister of Louis XIII Mazarin had guided the nation through the later stages of the Thirty Years War In this war France struggled against the Habsburg dynasty that ruled Spain for military supremacy in Europe 

After Mazarin died in 1661 Louis declared that he would rule France without a chief minister something no French king had done in living memory He intended to rule as an absolute monarch believing that his power as king was derived from God and that he was responsible to God alone He was obliged to rule for the benefit of his people While Louis assumed responsibility for decision making he understood that he must rule within the constraints of the laws and customs of his kingdom Louis consulted widely with his nobles and ministers and he met weekly with members of his high council He created an informal cabinet which was eventually led by Jean Baptiste Colbert chief minister of finance 

Nevertheless the system of absolute monarchy emphasized the role of the king and no monarch was more successful in creating the image of monarchy than Louis XIV He took the sun as his emblem and connected himself to its radiant image

Starting in 1661 King Louis XIV transformed a humble hunting lodge into a glittering palace Over 30000 men worked on constructing the Palace of Versailles a project that drained the royal treasury for decades Expenses included not only building but also diverting rivers piping in fresh water and planting thousands of orange trees to mask the smell of sewage that could not be properly drained away In May 1682 Louis moved the capital of France to Versailles 12 miles away of Paris It was Louis XIVs motive to remove himself and his nobles from the political intrigues of Paris It became a symbol of his Absolute Monarchy

Although Louis dreamed of a Spanish inheritance for his heirs his military policy was not to expand French territory He fought his early wars for defensive purposesto secure Frances northern border and to dislodge the Spanish from strategic towns

Louis fought the War of the Devolution to assert his claims to a portion of Spains possessions after his wifes father Philip IV died Louis claimed the Spanish Netherlands in place of the wedding gift that Philip IV had never paid 

The French aggression in the Spanish Netherlands caused relations between France and Holland to deteriorate The Dutch had already fought the Spanish for generations to protect against an invasion of their country They had no intention of allowing the French to pose the same threat by occupying the territories on their border The result was war in the Netherlands from 1672 to 1678 during which Louis again demonstrated the effectiveness of French might In a sweeping campaign Louis almost succeeded in conquering Holland To protect themselves the Dutch opened their dikes flooded the countryside and turned Amsterdam into a virtual island Louiss armies could not advance farther and they began negotiating a truce War resumed however when Spain and Austria allied themselves with Holland and Louis signed a treaty with England in 1670 to keep the English navy neutral Neither side could win a decisive victory and both suffered from financial exhaustion which ultimately led to a treaty to end the war 

Louis revoked or ended the Treaty of Nantes This Treaty said that there would be freedom of religion in France This means that everybody in France could worship the way they wanted to When Louis revoked the Treaty of Nantes he said that all people in France must be Catholic Because of this 50 thousand Protestant workers left France and went to America England and Germany 

While Louis ruled France became the most powerful country in all of Europe and many other countries copied the French peoples way of dressing and thinking He also encouraged people to explore Canada and tried very hard to make France larger Louis spent a lot of money on wars and France went into deep debt because of him

By the middle of the 1680s the Sun King was losing much of his shine Mazarin had taught him to work rigorously and Louis maintained a punishing schedule throughout his life shrugging off a series of minor illnesses and not listening to the advice of his physicians Eventually a broken arm put an end to his vigorous horseback riding and gout ended his long walks around Versailles He was wheeled to the throne room or carried to his carriage In 1683 his first wife died and Louis secretly married his longtime mistress Franoise dAubign Marquise de Maintenon In 1711 he went through the tragedy of the death of his oldest son and the following year that of his oldest grandson

French kings after Louis XIV taxed a lot of money from the poor people to try and pay off the debt This is part of what led to the French Revolution

In a world that regarded territory power and wealth as paramount Louis XIV was recognized as a great king He transformed France into the dominant nation in Europe expanded its boundaries and left his heirs secure in their possessions Louis reached the height of his power in the 1670s and he protected what he had achieved for the next four decades in the face of a Europe united against him Moreover he eventually realized his dream of seeing a Bourbon on the Spanish throne During Louiss reign France also consolidated the administration of its colonial possessions and commerce becoming a world power On the domestic front Louis strengthened the central governments control over the diverse regions of France incorporating his territorial gains into a united state On the other hand he provoked controversy when he restored Catholic religious unity by revoking the Edict of Nantes and repressing Protestantism Unfortunately many of Louiss policies both domestic and foreign caused great hardship to ordinary people many of whom suffered starvation fled their homeland or lived in terror of persecution Ultimately Louis XIV wished to bring glory to France and to his dynasty and he died believing that he had

The Olympic Games are an important international event featuring summer and winter sports The Games are held every four years with Summer and Winter Olympic Games taking turns Each seasonal games happens every four years Originally the ancient Olympic Games were held in Olympia Greece from the 8th century BC to the 5th century AD The first modern Olympics happened in 1896 in Athens Greece People choose to play in the Olympics to represent the place they are from

Over time the Olympics have become bigger The Winter Games were created for ice and snow sports The Paralympic Games were created for athletes with physical disabilities As well the Olympics became bigger with the addition of the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes World War I and World War II led to the cancellation of the 1916 1940 and 1944 Games As the decision making body the IOC is responsible for choosing the host city for each Olympic Games The IOC is also responsible for choosing what sports are in the games

The celebration of the Games includes many rituals and symbols such as Olympic flag and torch as well as the opening and closing ceremonies The first second and third place finishers in each event receive gold silver and bronze medals

The Ancient Olympic Games was a series of competitions held between representatives of several city states and kingdoms from Ancient Greece which featured mainly athletic but also combat and chariot racing events During the Olympic games all struggles against the participating city states were postponed until the games were finished The origin of these Olympics is shrouded in mystery and legend According to legend it was Heracles who first called the Games Olympic and established the custom of holding them every four years The most widely accepted date for the beginning of the Ancient Olympics is 776 BC this is based on inscriptions found at Olympia of the winners of a footrace held every four years starting in 776 BC The Ancient Games featured running events a pentathlon boxing wrestling and equestrian events

There is no consensus on when the Games officially ended but many historians think it is 393 AD when the emperor Theodosius I declared that all religious practices should end Another date cited is 426 AD when his successor Theodosius II ordered the destruction of all Greek temples After the demise of the Olympics they were not held again until the late 19th century

An attempt to copy the ancient Olympic Games was the LOlympiade de la Rpublique a national Olympic festival held annually from 1796 to 1798 in Revolutionary France The competition had several sports from the ancient Greek Olympics

Greek interest in bringing back the Olympic Games began with the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1821 It was first proposed by poet and newspaper editor Panagiotis Soutsos in his poem Dialogue of the Dead published in 1833rp1 Evangelis Zappas a wealthy Greek Romanian philanthropist first wrote to King Otto of Greece in 1856 offering to fund a permanent revival of the Olympic Gamesrp14 Zappas sponsored the first Olympic Games in 1859 which was held in Athens Athletes from Greece and the Ottoman Empire participated Zappas funded the restoration of the ancient Panathenaic stadium so that it could host all future Olympic Gamesrp14

Between 1862 and 1867 Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival It was created by John Hulley and Charles Melly with support from Dr Brookes These games were unfair in nature since only Men could compete In 1865 Hulley Dr Brookes and EG Ravenstein founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool a forerunner of the British Olympic Association Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the International Olympic Charter

Dr Brookes copied the sports which were in the Olympics held in Athens in 1859 in future Wenlock Olympian Games In 1866 a national Olympic Games in Great Britain was organized by Dr Brookes at Londons Crystal Palace

The Panathinaiko Stadium hosted Olympics in 1870 and 1875rp2 1323 81 Thirty thousand spectators attended that Games in 1870 although no official attendance records are available for the 1875 Gamesrp44 In 1890 after attending the Olympian Games of the Wenlock Olympian Society Baron Pierre de Coubertin created the International Olympic Committee Coubertin built on the ideas and work of Brookes and Zappas with the aim of creating an Olympic Games that would occur every four years in a different country He presented these ideas during the first meeting of the newly created International Olympic Committee This meeting was held from June 16 to June 23 1894 at the Sorbonne University in Paris On the last day of the meeting it was decided that the first Olympic Games to be controlled by the IOC would take place two years later in Athens The IOC elected the Greek writer Demetrius Vikelas as its first presidentrp100105

The first Games held under the IOC was hosted in the Panathenaic stadium in Athens in 1896 These Games brought 14 nations and 241 athletes who competed in 43 events Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas had left the Greek government money to fund future Olympic Games This money was used to pay for the 1896 Gamesrp117 George Averoff paid for the refurbishment of the stadium in preparation for the Gamesrp128 The Greek government also provided money which was paid back through the sale of tickets Money was also paid back through the sale of the first Olympic commemorative stamp setrp128

The Greek officials and public were excited about hosting these Games This feeling was shared by many of the athletes who even demanded that Athens be the host of the Olympic Games on a permanent basis The IOC did not approve this request The IOC stated that each games would be held in a different country

Following the success of the 1896 Games the Olympics entered a period of stagnation that threatened their survival The Olympic Games held at the Paris Exposition in 1900 and the Worlds Fair at St Louis in 1904 were side shows The Games at Paris did not have a stadium however this was the first time women took part in the games The St Louis Games hosted 650 athletes but 580 were from the United States The homogeneous nature of these celebrations was a low point for the Olympic Movement The Games rebounded when the Intercalated Games were held in Athens These Games are not officially recognized by the IOC and no Intercalated Games have been held since These Games were hosted at the Panathenaic stadium in Athens The games attracted an international field of participants and generated great public interest

The Winter Olympics were created to feature snow and ice sports that were not part of the Summer Games Figure skating and ice hockey were featured as Olympic events at the Summer Olympics The IOC wanted to expand this list of sports to encompass other winter activities At the 1921 Olympic Congress in Lausanne it was decided to hold a winter version of the Olympic Games A winter sports week was held in 1924 in Chamonix France this event was the first Winter Olympic Games The IOC ruled that the Winter Games to be celebrated every four years on the same year as the summer games This pattern continued until the 1992 Games in Albertville France After this beginning with the 1994 Games the Winter Olympics were held on the third year of each Olympiad

Starting in 2010 Youth Games will help to develop young athletes for the Olympic Games Athletes between the ages of 14 and 18 will compete The Youth Olympic Games were created by IOC president Jacques Rogge in 2001 and approved during the 119th meeting of the IOC The first Summer Youth Games were held in Singapore from 1426 August 2010 The first Winter Games will be hosted in Innsbruck Austria in 2012 These Games are shorter than the Olympic Games The summer version will last twelve days and the winter version will last nine days The IOC will allow 3500 athletes and 875 officials to take part at the Summer Youth Games 970 athletes and 580 officials will take part at the Winter Youth Games The sports to be played will be the same as at the Olympic Games

The Olympic Movement includes a large number of national and international sporting organizations and federations As the group in charge of the Olympic Movement the International Olympic Committee is responsible for selecting the host city Overseeing the planning of the Olympic Games Changing the sports involved Agreeing sponsorship and broadcasting rights 

The Olympic Movement is made of three major elements

French and English are the official languages of the Olympic Movement The other language used at each Olympic Games is the language of the host country

In 1998 it was uncovered that several IOC members had taken bribes from members of the Salt Lake City bid committee for the hosting of the 2002 Winter Olympics This was done to make sure that Salt Lake City won The IOC pursued an investigation which led to the resignation of four members and six people were sacked

A BBC documentary entitled Panorama Buying the Games aired in August 2004 investigated the taking of bribes in the bidding process for the 2012 Summer Olympics The documentary claimed it was possible to bribe IOC members into voting for a particular candidate city After being narrowly defeated in their bid for the 2012 Summer Games Parisian Mayor Bertrand Delano accused the British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the London Bid Committee of breaking the bid rules

The Turin bid for the 2006 Winter Olympics was also shrouded in controversy A prominent IOC member Marc Hodler strongly connected with the rival bid of Sion Switzerland alleged bribery of IOC officials by members of the Turin Organizing Committee These accusations led to a wide ranging investigation The allegations also served to sour many IOC members against Sions bid and potentially helped Turin to capture the host city nomination

The Olympic logo also known as the Olympic rings consists of five intertwined rings and represents the unity of the five inhabited continents The colored version of the ringsblue yellow black green and redover a white field forms the Olympic flag The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp Belgium The flag has since been flown during every Games The Olympic motto is Citius Altius Fortius a Latin expression meaning Faster Higher Stronger

Before each Games the Olympic flame is lit in Olympia in a ceremony that reflects ancient Greek rituals A female performer acting as a priestess lights a torch with the use of the sun The woman then lights the torch of the first relay bearer Starting the Olympic torch relay that will carry the flame to the host citys Olympic stadium The flame has been an Olympic symbol since 1928 and the torch relay was introduced at the 1936 Summer Games

The Olympic mascot was introduced in 1968 The mascot is either an animal or human figure representing the cultural heritage of the host country

As mandated by the Olympic Charter various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host countrys flag and a performance of its national anthem The host nation then presents artistic displays of music singing dance and theater representative of its culture 

After the artistic portion of the ceremony the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by nation Greece is traditionally the first nation to enter in order to honor the origins of the Olympics Nations then enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host countrys chosen language The host countrys athletes are always the last to enter During the 2004 Summer Olympics which was hosted in Athens Greece The Greek flag entered the stadium first and last When it came in to the stadium for the second time it was followed by the athletes Speeches are then given formally opening the Games Finally the athletes oath said Following this the Olympic torch is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier who lights the cauldren

The closing ceremony of the Olympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded Flag bearers from each participating country enter the stadium They are followed by the athletes who enter together without any national distinction Three national flags are hoisted while the corresponding national anthems are played The flag of Greece to honor the birthplace of the Olympic Games The flag of the current host country The flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Olympic Games is also flown The president of the organizing committee and the IOC president make their closing speeches The Games are officially closed and the Olympic flame is put out  In what is known as the Antwerp Ceremony the mayor of the city that organized the Games transfers a special Olympic flag to the president of the IOC The president then passes it on to the mayor of the city hosting the next Olympic Games After these compulsory elements the next host nation briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture

A medal ceremony is held after each Olympic event is concluded The winner second and third place competitors or teams stand on top of a three tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals After the medals are given out by an IOC member the national flags of the three medalists are raised while the national anthem of the gold medalists country plays

The Olympic Games program consists of 26 sports 30 disciplines and nearly 300 events For example wrestling is a Summer Olympic sport comprising two disciplines Greco Roman and Freestyle It is broken down into fourteen events for men and four events for women Each event represents a different weight class The Summer Olympics program includes 26 sports while the Winter Olympics program features 15 sports 

Olympic sports are governed by international sports federations recognized by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports There are 35 federations represented at the IOC Changes can happen to the list of sports in the Olympics Sports can be added or removed from the list on the basis of a two thirds majority vote of the members of the IOC 

The 114th IOC meeting in 2002 limited the Summer Games program to a maximum of 28 sports 301 events and 10500 athletes Three years later at the 117th IOC Session the first major change to the list was performed This resulted in the removal of baseball and softball from the list of sports for the 2012 London Games Since there was no agreement in the promotion of two other sports the 2012 program will feature just 26 sports The 2016 and 2020 Games will return to the maximum of 28 sports given the addition of rugby and golf

The exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi professional baseball before the Olympics His medals were restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds As class structure evolved through the 20th century the definition of the amateur athlete as an aristocratic gentleman became outdated The advent of the state sponsored full time amateur athlete of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur as it put the self financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage Nevertheless the IOC held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism 

Beginning in the 1970s amateurism requirements were gradually phased out of the Olympic Charter After the 1988 Games the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics subject to the approval of the IFs As of 2004 the only sport in which no professionals compete is boxing although even this requires a definition of amateurism based on fight rules rather than on payment as some boxers receive cash prizes from their National Olympic Committees In mens football only three professional players over the age of 23 are eligible to participate per team in the Olympic tournament

There have been many countries deliberately missing the Olympics in order to make political statements The most famous examples of countries missing the Olympics happened in 1980 and 1984 The Cold War opponents missed each others Games 65 nations refused to compete at the Moscow Olympics in 1980 because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan The Soviet Union and 14 of its Eastern Bloc partners countered by missing the Los Angeles Olympics of 1984 The countries stated that they could not guarantee the safety of their athletes Soviet officials defended their decision to withdraw from the Games by saying that chauvinistic sentiments and an anti Soviet hysteria are being whipped up in the United States

The Olympic Games have been used as a platform to promote political ideologies almost from its inception Nazi Germany wished to portray the Nationalist Socialist Party as benevolent and peace loving when they hosted the 1936 Games The Games were also intended to show the superiority of the Aryan white race This goal was not met due in part to the achievements of athletes such as Jesse Owens who won four gold medals at this Olympics

Individual athletes have also used the Olympic stage to promote their own political agenda At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City two American track and field athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos who finished first and third in the 200 meter sprint race performed the Black Power salute on the podium The runner up Peter Norman wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge in support of Smith and Carlos IOC President Avery Brundage then told the United States to either send the two athletes home or withdraw the track and field team The United States chose to send the pair home

In the early 20th century many Olympic athletes began using drugs to improve their athletic abilities For example the winner of the marathon at the 1904 Games Thomas J Hicks was given strychnine and brandy by his coach The only Olympic death linked to doping happened at the Rome Games of 1960 During the cycling road race Danish cyclist Knud Enemark Jensen fell from his bicycle and later died A coroners inquiry found that he was under the influence of amphetamines By the mid 1960s sports federations were starting to ban the use of performance enhancing drugs The IOC did like wise in 1967 The IOC created the World Anti Doping Agency in 1999 The IOC established drug testing regimen has set the worldwide benchmark that other sporting federations around the world attempt to emulate The first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance enhancing drugs was Hans Gunnar Liljenwall a Swedish pentathlete at the 1968 Summer Olympics who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use

The Olympics have not brought lasting peace to the world even during the Games Three Olympic Games were not held due to war The 1916 Games were cancelled because of World War I and the summer and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were cancelled because of World War II Terrorism has also threatened the Olympic Games In 1972 when the Summer Games were held in Munich West Germany eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by the terrorist group Black September This event is now known as the Munich massacre The terrorists killed two of the athletes soon after they had taken them hostage and killed the other nine during a failed rescue attempt A German police officer and 5 terrorists also died During the Summer Olympics in 1996 in Atlanta a bomb was detonated at the Centennial Olympic Park which killed 2 and injured 111 others Eric Robert Rudolph is currently serving a life sentence for the bombing

The host city for an Olympic Games is chosen seven years ahead of the event The process of selection is carried out in two phases that span a two year period The process starts when a city wanting to host the games applies to its countrys Olympic group If more than one city from the same country gives a proposal to its NOC the national group choses which city will run for host The first step once the deadline passes is to ask the cities to complete a questionnaire which covers many key points in the organization of the Olympic Games The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a group provides the IOC with an idea of each cities project and their potential to host the Games On the basis of this evaluation the IOC choses the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage 

Once the candidate cities are chosen they must give to the IOC a bigger presentation of their project as part of a candidature file Each city is analyzed by an evaluation group This group will also visit the cities The group give a report on its findings one month prior to the IOCs final decision During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that it can fund the Games The IOC members gathered in the meeting have the final vote on the host city 

By 2016 the Olympic Games will have been hosted by 44 cities in 23 countries The United States has hosted four Summer and four Winter Olympics more than any other nation Among Summer Olympics host nations the United Kingdom has been the host of two Games and will host its third Olympics in 2012 in London Germany Australia France and Greece are the other nations to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice Among host cities only Los Angeles Paris Athens and London have played host to the Olympic Games more than once with each holding that honor twice With the 2012 Games scheduled to take place in London the British capital will hold the distinction of hosting the modern Olympics Games three times more than any other city

In the Winter Olympics France has hosted three Games hile Switzerland Austria Norway Japan and Italy have hosted twice The most recent Games were held in Vancouver Canadas second Winter Olympics and third overall The next Winter Games will be in Sochi Russia in 2014 which will be the first time this nation has hosted

The Iron Age was a time in history after people began to use iron tools Before this they had used bronze or stone tools Most of Europe Africa and Asia reached the Iron Age by 500 BC In Europe it is a period of prehistory because Iron Age people did not write their history down

Coca Cola is a carbonated sweetened soft drink and is the worlds best selling drink The Coca Cola Company claims that the beverage is sold in more than 200 countries The companys headquarters are in Atlanta Georgia Coca Colas main rival is Pepsi 

Coca Cola was first made in the 1800s by John Pemberton The first sales were at Jacobs Pharmacy in Atlanta Georgia on May 8 1886 They sold it there for five cents a glass but it was very strong tasting because they did not mix it with water Coca Cola was first made the way it is now in Columbus Georgia It was called Pembertons French Wine Coca at first and was sold as a medicine to help cure colds and give people more energy The drink used to be sold at soda fountains in the United States

Coca Cola was first sold in bottles in Atlanta on March 12 1894 with actual cocaine content It was first sold in cans in 1955 During the first year sales were about only nine drinks per day Dr Pemberton did not think he could make a lot of money with the drink he invented so he sold parts of his business to different people Just before he died in 1888 he sold the rest of his Coca Cola business to Asa G Candler Mr Candler together with some other businessmen started the Coca Cola Company

The drink is called Coca Cola because of the coca leaves and kola fruits that were used to add flavor Dr Pembertons partner and bookkeeper Frank Robinson suggested the name Coca Cola because he thought using the letter C twice would look better than if they used a K in the word Cola He then wrote down the name to use as a logo that is now very famous

Coca Cola was the first ever sponsor of the Olympic Games This was for the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam

The company sells many other products including other sorts of Coca Cola such as Diet Coke Cherry Coke Diet Cherry Coke Diet Coke with Lemon Diet Vanilla Coke Diet Coke with Li Coke Zero Coca Cola with Orange Diet Coke Citrus Zest

Sulfur is a chemical element The symbol for sulfur is S and its atomic number is 16 

Sulfur is a yellow solid that is a nonmetal It is brittle and crystalline It burns easily releasing toxic fumes of sulfur dioxide It has a very faint odor If it is melted and cooled very quickly it makes a rubbery form of sulfur that is called plastic sulfur It gradually turns back into the yellow brittle form It does not dissolve in water The smell normally known as sulfur comes from hydrogen sulfide and similar chemicals These sulfides are produced when things decay without air

Sulfur can be found in the earth near volcanoes Many minerals contain sulfur ions Coal contains sulfur ions which are released when it burns Hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide are some sulfur compounds that are released when coal burns They are reacted to make sulfur Sulfur in the ground in melted then forced up through pipes by compressed air

Sulfur is commonly used in gunpowder medicine and matches Matches release sulfur dioxide when they burn giving them their smell Sulfur is an essential component to living cells Many proteins contain sulfur It is also used as a pesticide on organic farms 

Powder sulfur is said to be left after an occurrence of a supernatural being

Sulfur is not toxic but the chemical compounds formed when sulfur burns can be very toxic Sulfuric acid for example can make paper turn black

The ancient name for sulfur is brimstone Sulfur was used in fumigation and medicine in ancient Greece In 1777 Antoine Lavosier convinced the scientific community that sulfur was an element

Aluminium is a chemical element The symbol for aluminium is Al and its atomic number is 13 Aluminium is the most abundant metal

Aluminium is a very good conductor of electricity and heat It is light and strong It can be hammered into sheets or pulled out into wires It is a highly reactive metal although it is corrosion resistant

Aluminium prevents corrosion by forming a small thin layer of aluminium oxide on its surface This layer protects the metal by preventing oxygen from reaching it Corrosion can not occur without oxygen Because of this thin layer the reactivity of aluminium is not seen

Pure aluminium is made from bauxite a kind of rock that has aluminium oxide and many impurities The bauxite is crushed and reacted with sodium hydroxide The aluminium oxide dissolves Then the aluminum oxide is dissolved in liquid cryolite a rare mineral Cryolite is normally produced artificially though The aluminium oxide is electrolyzed to make aluminium and oxygen

Aluminium was once considered a precious metal that was even more valuable than gold This is no longer true because as technology improved it became cheaper and easier to make pure aluminium

Aluminium forms chemical compounds in the 3 oxidation state They are generally unreactive Aluminium chloride is an example Very rarely are compounds in the 1 or 2 oxidation state

Aluminium has many uses Much of it is used in overhead power cables It is also widely used in window frames and aircraft bodies It is found at home as saucepans soft drink cans and cooking foil Aluminium is also used to coat car headlamps and compact discs

Pure aluminium is very soft so a harder metal is almost always added The harder metal is usually copper Copperaluminium alloys are to make ships because the aluminium prevents corrosion and the copper prevents barnacles

Aluminium compounds are used in deodorants water processing plants food additives and antacids

Since aluminium needs to be made by electrolysis it requires a very large amount of electrical power Recycling aluminium would be much cheaper Thats why recycling plants were opened The cost of recycling aluminium is much less than the cost of making it from bauxite

Aluminium is not used in the human body although it is very common People debate whether its use in deodorants and water treatment is healthy Aluminium ions slow down plant growth in acidic soils Aluminium may be a factor in Alzheimers disease But the Alzheimers Society says overwhelming medical and scientific opinion is that studies have not convincingly demonstrated a causal relationship between aluminium and Alzheimers disease

Drawing is a way of making a picture Drawings are created by making lines on a surface Long lines make up the shapes and small lines make the textures Drawings can be images of real life or abstract images showing ideas cannot be seen in the real world

A drawing is the art created this way Examples of things used to mark with are pencils chalk charcoal crayons pastels pen and ink

Artists have been drawing for many centuries They draw on paper or on other surfaces which the marks show up on

Texas is the second largest state in the United States It is larger than France In 1845 it became the 28th state in the United States Texas has been controlled by Spain France and Mexico before declaring its independence from Mexico in 1836 It was its own country The Republic of Texas for 9 years 

The largest cities in Texas are Houston Dallas Fort Worth San Antonio El Paso and Austin Austin is the capital city of Texas

There are many famous attractions in Texas Fort Worth is known for its stockyards and Amarillo is known for the cattle business and stockyards In Dallas Industrial Technology companies such as Texas Instruments and EDS have their offices

San Antonio has The Alamo and Houston has the Johnson Space Center Austin has The University of Texas at Austin Texas AM in College Station and Texas Tech in Lubbock are other important universities in the state

The states name derives from tyshay a word in the Caddoan language of the Hasinai which means allies or friends

Texas was first explored in 1528 by Spanish explorers on accident It did not become a colony until 1685 when France claimed it In response Spain set up a rival colony in 1691 by setting up a religious outpost in the eastern part of Texas Spain did not come back to Texas until 1716 to protect its colonies in the west from French forces Two years later San Antonio was started

The pressure between the Spaniards and Native Americans in East Texas stopped many settlers from coming to Texas To stop the violence and the increasing Native American raids Spain called a truce between many tribes in 1745 and 1789

Tensions rose in Texas after the United States bought a large amount of nearby land from France in 1803 This land was called the Louisiana Purchase People began wondering whether Spain or the United States could claim Texas

When Mexico got independence from Spain in 1821 Texas became part of Mexico Americans and other settlers came into Texas when Mexico allowed non Spanish settlers to settle here After many settlers came to Texas Mexico started taxing non citizens This made many settlers outraged Those from the South got even more outraged because Mexico banned all slavery in 1829 On March 2 1836 Texas declared independence from Mexico and soon they were at war Texas won but Mexico refused to recognize Texas as an independent Texas soon asked to become a state of the United States Years later in 1845 the US added Texas as a state and Mexico broke off diplomatic relations Mexico resisted offers by the US to buy land extending from Texas to the Pacific Ocean In 1846 a dispute over the border between Texas and Mexico resulted in armed conflict and the Mexican American War began The United States won the war and by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo won lands that later formed the states of California Arizona Nevada Utah New Mexico southwestern Colorado and southwestern Wyoming Mexico received 15 million dollars and gave up its claims to Texas

After Abraham Lincoln was elected President of the United States Texas joined the newly formed Confederate States of America in 1861 and fought in the American Civil War in an attempt to become independent from the United States The Confederates lost to the Union in 1865 Texas was restored to full representation in Congress on March 30 1870 

On January 10 1901 oil was found in Texas leading the founding of a richer economy During a time when the economy was bad many people left Texas Texas did not regain its population it lost until the 1950s and 60s In recent years Texas has been exploring technology and computers

Texas is the second biggest state in the Union and is bigger than every European country except Russia It has mountains deserts plains and coasts

The word Prussia has a lot of different meanings in the past and now

In 1934 the Nazis stopped using Prussia as a land unit and in 1947 the Allies abolished the state of Prussia and divided its territory among the new Lnder Today the name is only for historical geographical or cultural use

The name Prussia is from the BorussiPrussi people who lived in the Baltic region Their ancestors came from Lithuania Ducal Prussia was a fief of the Kingdom of Poland until 1660 and Royal Prussia was part of Poland until 1772 In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries most German speaking Prussians started thinking they were part of the German nation They thought the typical Prussian way of life was very important 

From the late 18th century this bigger Prussia had the power in North Germany it was strongest in politics economics and number of people In 1871 Bismarck created the German Empire and Prussia was its heart

Prussia was a small part of todays northern Poland After a small number of Prussi people lived there Germans made their homes In 1934 Germanys borders were with France Belgium the Netherlands and Lithuania Some parts of Prussia can be found in eastern Poland Before 1918 a lot of western Poland was also in Prussia Between 1795 and 1807 Prussia also controlled Warsaw and most of central Poland

Before 1934 these regions were also in Prussia

But some regions were never part of Prussia eg Oldenburg Mecklenburg and the Hanse city states

North east Germany was Protestant so Prussian people were mostly Protestant But there were a lot of Catholic people in the Rhineland East Prussia Posen Silesia West Prussia and Ermland The states of south Germany were Catholic so they did not want Prussia to have the power Prussia was mostly German but in the late 18th century the new Polish areas had a large Polish minority  In 1918 these Polish areas returned to Poland

In 1226 Polish Prince Conrad of Mazovia asked the Teutonic Knights from Transylvania to come to Mazovia He wanted them to fight the Prussian tribes on his borders They fought for more than 100 years then they created a new state After some time this state controlled most of todays Estonia Latvia and Lithuania and parts of northern Poland From 1466 the Knights were under the King of Poland and Lithuania In 1525 the leader of the Knights became a Protestant He made part of the Knights land into the Duchy of Prussia in the Kingdom of Poland 

At that time the Duchy of Prussia was only the area east of the mouth of the Vistula In 1618 the new Duke of Prussia was the Elector John Sigismund of Brandenburg He was also Margrave of Brandenburg Brandenburg was under the Hohenzollern family The Duchy of Prussia was important to the Hohenzollern family because it was not in the Holy Roman Empire The name for the new state was Brandenburg Prussia In the middle of the state was Polish land but Brandenburg Prussia was moving away from Poland Under Frederick William the Great Elector Prussia took new land eg Magdeburg and areas west of the Rhine

In 1701 the Holy Roman Emperor and Polish King allowed Brandenburg Prussia to have the name Kingdom of Prussia under Frederick I Under Frederick II Prussia took Silesia from Austria and kept it in the Silesian Wars The wars ended in 1763 Prussia was now the most powerful state in eastern Germany Other parts of Germany went to Prussia because of marriage or death eg Pomerania

In this time the Prussian military machine grew as did the administration system Until 1945 these were at the heart of the German state Between 1772 and 1795 Prussia Russia and Austria divided Poland into parts Now Prussia controlled land in the far east eg Warsaw 

Frederick William II took Prussia into war with France in 1792 He lost at Valmy and gave his western land to France Frederick William III started a new war but lost at Jena He gave more land to France at the Treaty of Tilsit

In 1813 Prussia again started war with Napolonic France In 1815 Prussia won her lost land again and also all the Rhineland and Westphalia and some other land This land in the west was very important especially the Ruhr valley It was the new centre of Germanys industrialisation and the home of the weapons industry After the Napolonic Wars Prussia was the biggest power in Germany and more powerful than Austria 

In the early 19th century the liberals in Germany wanted one federal democratic Germany The conservatives wanted Germany as a group of independent weak states In 1848 revolution came to Europe the liberals had a chance Frederick William IV was worried He allowed a National Assembly and a constitution The new Frankfurt Parliament wanted to give Frederick William the crown of all Germany but he did not want it He said that revolutionaries could not name kings Now Prussia had a semi democratic constitution but really the people with land had the power especially in the east

In 1862 Prussian King William I named Otto von Bismarck as the new Minister President Bismarck wanted the liberals and the conservatives to lose He wanted to create a strong united Germany but under the Junker not under the western German liberals So he started three wars with Denmark in 1864 this gave Prussia Schleswig Holstein with Austria in 186 this allowed Prussia to take Hanover and most other north German territories who were with Austria with France in 1870  so Bismarck could control Mecklenburg Bavaria Baden Wrttemberg and Saxony After this these states became part of a united German Empire and William I took the title of Emperor 

This was Prussias high moment The economic and political future looked good if the leaders were clever But after 99 days in 1888 the state had a new leader William II He had little experience and little imagination and he made bad plans Bismarck lost his job in 1890 and William II started a new foreign policy He started a military program and took risks this took Germany into World War I The Prussian Junker controlled the war so when they lost it was the end for them The Prussian king and all the other German kings lost their power Germany became a republic In 1919 the Treaty of Versailles re created the Polish state and Prussia had to return a lot of land The Polish Corridor was between East Prussia and Germany

At the end of World War I some people wanted to break Prussia into smaller states But tradition won and Prussia became the Prussian Free State the largest state of the Weimar Republic with 60 of its land The industrial Ruhr area was in Prussia and also Berlin so Prussia was the home of the left The Social Democrats and the Catholic Centre had power for most of the 1920s 

In 1932 Germanys conservative Chancellor Franz von Papen took control of Prussia ending the states democratic constitution It was the end of German democracy too In 1933 Hermann Gring became Interior Minister of Prussia he was now very strong In 1934 the Nazis took the German states power  

In 1945 the Soviet Unions army took all of eastern and central Germany Poland took everything east of the Oder Neisse line eg Silesia Pomerania eastern Brandenburg and East Prussia The Soviet Union took the northern third of East Prussia including Knigsberg now Kaliningrad About ten million Germans had to fly from these areas Polish and Russian people moved there to fill the area Because of this and because the Communists took control of land in the GDR the Junker and Prussia were finished 

In 1947 the United States Britain France and the Soviet Union formally agreed the end of Prussia In the Soviet Zone the Prussian lands were now the states of Brandenburg and Saxony Anhalt The Prussian parts of Pomerania went to Mecklenburg Western Pomerania In 1952 the GDR government stopped using states and used districts In 1990 the end of the GDR the states returned In the West the Prussian lands went to North Rhine Westphalia Lower Saxony Hesse Rhineland Palatinate and Schleswig Holstein Baden Wrttemberg took the Hohenzollern land

The idea of Prussia is not completely dead in Germany Today some people want to put together the states of Brandenburg Mecklenburg Vorpommern and Berlin and call them Prussia But German politicians are not interested in the idea The constitution of Berlin allows for Berlin and Brandenburg becoming one state but the people of Berlin said no in a vote 

The Apocrypha are religious texts that are in some versions of the Bible Other versions omit them The word comes from Ancient Greek Apocrypha means those that were hidden Generally the term is applied to writings that were not part of the canon There are several reasons why these texts were not included in the canon The texts might only have been known to few people or they might have been left out because their content does not fit well into that of the other books of the Bible Some of the apocrypha were written at a later date and where therefore not included 

The Authorized King James Version called these books Apocrypha It separated them because the Bible said so in 2 Esdras 1446 But keep the seventy last that thou mayest deliver them only to such as be wise among the people For in them is the spring of understanding the fountain of wisdom and the stream of knowledge

Roman Catholic Bibles have these books in the Old Testament They do not call them Apocrypha They call them deuterocanonical which means that they belong to the second canon Canon just means an official list of literary works accepted as representing a field The first list is of books first written in Hebrew This second list is of books first written in Greek

These books were kept in Catholic Bibles because it is believed that the Bible Jesus read was a Bible that included the books of the Apocrypha the deuterocanonical books It is known that the most popular Bible at the time of Jesus was the Greek Septuagint version  which includes these extra books That is why early Church fathers quoted from Bibles including these books

Christians disagree about the Apocrypha Others point out that the Apocrypha was in every Christian Bible until 1828 In 1828 these books were taken out of some Bibles The translators of the King James Bible said that these books were written to prepare the people for Jesus in the same way as John the Baptist did They said that the apostles used these books 

There is no question that these books have always been part of the Bible in Oriental Orthodox Churches so they were definitely not added in the 1500s Around the year 80 AD the Jewish Council decided to cut the books from the Hebrew Bible but they stayed in the Christian Bible Then soon after Christianity became the only religion of Roman Empire in the 4th century the Romans decided to cut out all of the same books that the Sanhedrin had cut out and they moved some of them to the apocrypha

Books of the Apocrypha

Note Other candidates for Apocryphal scriptures include supposedly lost portions of Esther and Sirach

There are also Apocrypha candidates for the New Testament

Sodium is the chemical element number 11 in the periodic table of elements It follows that its nucleus includes 11 protons and 11 electrons orbit around it Even if a relatively large number of isotopes can be artificially produced all decay in a short time As a consequence all sodium found in nature has the composition 11Na23 meaning that the nucleus includes 12 neutrons The atomic mass of sodium is 229898 if it is rounded it would be 23

Sodium is a light white metal Sodium is so soft that it can be easily cut with a knife Sodium is a little lighter than water when it reacts with water it floats This reaction is very fast Hydrogen and sodium hydroxide are produced The hydrogen may ignite Since sodium melts at a low temperature it melts when it reacts with water It has one valence electron which is removed easily making it highly reactive 

Compared with other alkali metals sodium is usually less reactive than potassium and more reactive than lithium

Not to be confused with cocain

Sodium was discovered by Sir Humphrey Davis an English scientist back in 1807 He made it by the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide It is named after soda a name for sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate

It is used in the preperation of organic compounds It is also used in the street lights that are orange and ultra violet lights that can be used to grow weed

Main articleSodium compounds

Sodium compounds are used in soaps toothpaste baking antacids dildos and other sex toys

Sodium does not exist as an element in nature its easily removed valence electron is too reactive It exists as an ion in chemical compounds Sodium ions are found in the ocean It is also found as sodium chloride in the earths crust where it is mined

Sodium is normally made by electrolysis of very hot sodium chloride that was melted

Sodium ion in the form of sodium chloride is needed in the human body but large amounts of it cause problems which is why one should not eat too much salt Many organisms in the ocean depend on the proper concentration of ions in sea water to live

Dice are objects used in games when something random needs to be done such as moving a piece a random number of places on a board Most dice are cubes that have the numbers 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 on the faces Dice are sometimes made in other shapes than cubes but the six sided die is the most common A die is usually rolled by the players hand

Some games are played with two dice and some use only one Some games that use dice are Monopoly Yahtzee Risk Dungeons and Dragons and many more Dice with different numbers of sides are called polyhedral dice

Weights can be put inside a die to make it only land on a certain number once it is rolled 

Many natural sciences use matrices quite a lot In many universities courses about matrices are taught very early sometimes even in the first year of studies Matrices are also very common in computer science

The horizontal lines in a matrix are called rows and the vertical lines are called columns A matrix with m rows and n columns is called an m by n matrix and m and n are called its dimensions 

is a 43 matrix This matrix has m4 rows and n3 columns 

The element A23 or a23 is 7

There are some matrices that are special 

A square matrix has the same number of rows as columns so mn 

This matrix has 3 rows and 3 columns mn3

A matrix that has many rows but only one column is called a column vector

There are no simple formulas for the determinants of larger matrices and many computer programmers study how to get computers to quickly find large determinants

There are three rules that all determinants follow These are

Hawaiian can be

The British Isles are a group of islands in north western Europe The biggest islands are called Great Britain and Ireland followed by the Isle of Man Great Britain the biggest island is home to three countries These are England Wales and Scotland The island of Ireland is divided into Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland Great Britain is the biggest island in Europe and Ireland is the third biggest

England Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland join together to make the United Kingdom 

Some people include the Channel Islands of Jersey Guernsey Sark in the term British Isles but they are a lot closer to France than to Great Britain In politics they are British islands but in geology they are French islands

The term tends not to be used in the Republic of Ireland because many people feel it implies that Ireland is politically British

Mandarin is the language of instruction of China and Taiwan

Mandarin is one of five major regional languages of China It spreads wider than any other regional language from the whole northern part of China down to Yunnan Province in the southwest corner of China In that big area there are many regional differences in vocabulary so somebody who moves from Beijing to Yunnan could not understand people there who were speaking their own language Yunnan hua The problem is bigger than for a person in Great Britain or the United States to go to Australia Therefore starting in the 1920s the Chinese government set up a national language based on the most widely understood words and pronunciations 

In China the language used in all schools is known as Standard Mandarin Pu Tong Hua meaning common language or Han Yu meaning language of the Han In places such as Malaysia it is known as Huayu In Taiwan it is known as Guo Yu meaning national language There are some minor differences in these standards

Mandarin is spoken by over 800 million people around the world more than any other language

Standard Mandarin is one of the six official languages at the United Nations

Mandarin is written with Chinese characters called Hn z Each Hnz has its own pronunciation and meaning An ordinary dictionary will contain about 10000 characters Spoken Mandarin uses very many compound words words that combine meanings the way English does in such terms as machine gun fire truck playground etc 

Some Chinese characters were originally fairly concrete pictures of the things they represent As time went on people chose to write simpler versions that are easier to write but do not look so much like the real thing just as we sometimes draw stick men rather than drawing people with real looking bodies arms legs etc Here are some examples

Most characters however are made by combining pictures using one to give a general meaning and the other to represent a sound For instance m is made by adding to The ma part is only there to represent the sound 

In ancient Chinese one character is generally enough for one word but spoken Mandarin uses mostly compounds like mma which is just mama Other examples show different ways of combining components

Just as the English used in Great Britain favors petrol but the English used in the United States almost always uses gasoline different regional languages in China may use different compound words to name the same thing

Mandarin is defined and designed based on Beijing accent In China there are over 600000 dialects and more accents although they all use Chinese language and characters but their pronunciation and some expressions are totally different China must find a standard pronunciation to make all people to understand and communicate Beijing has been the capital city of China for more than 1000 years so China defined Beijing Accent as standard mandarin

Beijing also has some local dialects that are not included by mandarin or standard Chinese language yet But different from the other dialects Beijing is capital city political economic culture and education center of China more and more new Beijing dialects have been or will be accepted as mandarin or standard Chinese language

The following samples are some Beijing dialects which are not accepted as standard mandarin yet by now bei er means very much ban suan means stagger bu lin means do not worry about cuo means eat chu liu means slip da lao ye men means man male 

The following samples are some Beijing dialects which have been already accepted as mandarin in recent years er ba dao means not very skillful ge men er means good male friends kou men means parsimony da xiao er means since childhood

George Washington was the first President of the United States from 1789 to 1797 He was also the commander in chief of all American forces during the American Revolutionary War For his central role in the beginning of the United States he is often called the father of his country 

His mother was Mary Ball and his father was Augustine Washington They were teachers at the local university They lived in Virginia As a child Washington did not attend school for very long

There is an untrue story that Washington cut down his fathers cherry tree When asked he did not lie and said that he did cut down the tree This story is supposed to show that Washington was honest However it was made up by Parson Weemes in an early biography written about Washington

Washington was a farmer like his father His large farm or plantation was called Mount Vernon He also worked as a surveyor someone who measures land 

Washington began his army career during the French and Indian War He first was a messenger for Virginia He later led troops against the French The British did not think soldiers from the colonies were as good as they were so Washington went home and started to farm again

In 1759 Washington married Martha Custis Washington They did not have any children

Washington was a delegate to the First Continental Congress which was created by the Thirteen Colonies to respond to various laws passed by the British government Washington was chosen by the Second Continental Congress to be the commanding general of the Continental Army Washington led the army from 1775 until the end of the war in 1783 

Washington is noted for leading troops across the Delaware River on Christmas Day 1776 in a surprise attack on Hessian mercenaries at Trenton New Jersey The British had more troops and more supplies than Washington However Washington kept his troops together and won the key battle 

Overall Washington did not win many battles but he never let the British destroy his army With the help of the French navy Washington made a British army surrender at Yorktown Virginia in 1781 in the final major battle of the war The war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783

When the Revolutionary war ended Washington was a national hero He was offered what would basically be a dictatorship over the colonies In a move that surprised everyone however Washington said no quit the army and went home to Mount Vernon He wanted the colonies to have a strong government but was tired of leading He also did not want the US to be run by a tyrant

A few years later Washington was called over to host the discussions for the new government He was voted president of the Constitutional Convention in 1785 Washington wanted the states to ratify the Constitution of the United States and they did largely thanks to the Federalist Papers which were written by Alexander Hamilton John Jay and James Madison 

In 1789 Washington was elected president without any competition Washington was the first President of the United States Washington helped the government get started While Washington did not belong to any political party and stayed neutral he agreed with Federalist policies such as the country having a standing army and a national bank He was re elected to a second term After his second term Washington decided not to run for reelection even though he was popular enough to probably win in a landslide His decision set a precedent that every president followed until Franklin D Roosevelt broke it in 1940 In Washingtons farewell address he warned the country not to divide into political parties and to not get involved in European wars Washingtons isolationist policy was supported by most Americans for over one hundred years His advice concerning political parties was completely ignored as parties were already forming at the time of his speech

Washington went back home to Mount Vernon after his second term ended in 1797 He died on December 14 1799 in Mount Vernon at the age of 67 He was the only leader of the early United States who decided in his will that his slaves were to be freed once he himself and his wife had died Washington DC and the state of Washington are named after him He is on the one dollar bill and the quarter coin

From his 20s George Washington was one of the largest landowners in Virginia Owning a lot of land was one of the reasons Washington was chosen as a leader By the 1780s Washington was one of the largest landowners in the United States He owned land in several states Some of this land was given to him by states as thanks for being a general Some this land he had never seen and he never made money on that land In addition to land Washington also owned more than 100 slaves However did not have much money in cash He actually had to borrow money while he was president At his death Washingtons estate was worth over 500000 That would be more than a billion dollars today George Washington owned about 30000 acres of land in six states some of it in the District of Columbia

Many people think George Washington had wooden teeth but this is not true He tried many different ways to replace his teeth though for instance he tried having teeth carved from elks teeth or ivory George Washingtons teeth started falling out when he was about 22 and he had only one tooth left by the time he became president It was hard to talk and hard to eat At one time he had fake teeth with a special hole so that the one tooth he still had could poke through he tried to keep them smelling clean by soaking them in wine but instead they just became mushy and black In 1796 a dentist had to pull out George Washingtons last tooth and he kept his tooth in a gold locket attached to his watch chain When the time came for the president to have his portrait painted cotton was pushed under his lips to make him look as if he had teeth But the cotton made his mouth puff out too far as is seen on the picture on the dollar bill

Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States He served as president from 1861 to 1865 during the American Civil War After many Confederate forces had already surrendered and the war was ending John Wilkes Booth assassinated Lincoln Lincoln has been remembered as the Great Emancipator because he worked to end slavery in the United States

Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12 1809 in Hardin County Kentucky His parents were Thomas Lincoln a farmer and Nancy Hanks His family was poor Abraham had one brother and one sister His brother died in childhood They grew up in a small log cabin house with just one room inside Although slavery was legal in Kentucky at that time Lincolns father who was a religious Baptist refused to own any slaves When Lincoln was seven years old his family moved to Indiana and later to Illinois In his childhood he helped his father on the farm but when he was 22 years old he left home and moved to New Salem Illinois where he worked in a general store Later he said that he had gone to school for just one year but that was enough to learn how to read write and do simple math In 1842 he married Mary Todd Lincoln They had four children but three of them died when they were very young Abraham Lincoln was sometimes called Abe Lincoln or Honest Abe The nickname Honest Abe came from a time when he started a business that failed Instead of running away like many people would have he stayed and worked to pay off his debt He has also been called the Great Emancipator because of his work to end slavery in the United States In 1863 he declared that all slaves held in the rebellious Confederate States were free He also sponsored the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution Ratified in 1865 nine months after his assassination that amendment completely outlawed slavery in the United States

Lincoln started his political career in 1832 when he ran for the Illinois General Assembly but he lost the election He served as a captain in the army during the Black Hawk War a war with Native American tribes When he moved to Springfield in 1837 he began to work as a lawyer Soon he became one of the most highly respected lawyers in Illinois In 1837 as a member of the Illinois General Assembly Lincoln issued a written protest of its passage of a resolution stating that slavery could not be abolished in Washington DC In 1841 he won a court case representing a black woman who claimed she had already been freed and could not be sold as a slave In 1847 he lost a case representing a slave owner claiming return of fugitive slaves

In 1846 Lincoln joined the Whig Party and was elected to one term in the House of Representatives After that he ignored his political career and instead became a very good railroad lawyer In 1854 in reaction to the passage of the Kansas Nebraska Act Lincoln became involved in politics again He joined the Republican Party which had recently been formed in opposition to the expansion of slavery In 1858 he wanted to become senator although this was unsuccessful the debates drew national attention to him The Republican Party nominated him for the Presidential election of 1860

Lincoln was chosen as a candidate for the elections in 1860 for different reasons Among these reasons were that his views on slavery were less extreme than those of other people who wanted to be candidates Lincoln was from what was then one of the Western states and had a bigger chance of winning the election there Other candidates that were older or more experienced than him had enemies inside the party Lincolns family was poor which added to the Republican position of free labor the opposite of slave labor Lincoln won the election in 1860 and was made the 16th President of the United States He won with almost no votes in the South For the first time a president had won the election because of the large support he got from the states in the North 

After Lincolns election seven States formed the Confederate States of America which led to the American Civil War Later four more states joined the Confederacy for a total of eleven In his whole period as President he had to rebuild the Union with military force and many bloody battles He also had to stop the border states like Kentucky Missouri and Maryland from leaving the Union and joining the Confederacy

Lincoln was not a general and had only been in the army for a short time during the Black Hawk War However he still took a major role in the war often spending days and days in the War Department His plan was to cut off the South by surrounding it with ships control the Mississippi River and take Richmond the Confederate capital He often clashed with generals in the field especially George B McClellan and fired generals who lost battles or were not aggressive enough Eventually he made Ulysses S Grant the top general in the army

With the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1 1863 Lincoln ordered the freedom of all slaves in those states still in rebellion during the American Civil War It did not actually immediately free all those slaves however since those areas were still controlled by the rebelling states of the Confederacy Only a small number of slaves already behind Union lines were immediately freed As the Union army advanced nearly all four million slaves were effectively freed Some former slaves joined the Union army The Proclamation also did not free slaves in the slave states that had remained loyal to the Union Neither did it apply to areas where Union forces had already regained control Until the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution in 1865 only the states had power to end slavery within their own borders so Lincoln issued the proclamation as a war measure 

The Proclamation made freeing the slaves a Union goal for the war and put an end to movements in European nations that would have recognized the Confederacy as an independent nation Lincoln then sponsored a constitutional amendment to free all slaves The Thirteenth Amendment making slavery illegal everywhere in the United States was passed late in 1865 eight months after Lincoln was assassinated

Lincoln made a famous speech after the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863 called the Gettysburg Address The battle was very important and many soldiers from both sides died The speech was given when they built the cemetery for the dead soldiers It is one of the most famous speeches in American history

Lincoln was reelected president in 1864 He proposed laws to make the nation become one again quickly While attending a play at Fords Theatre in Washington DC John Wilkes Booth a well known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland aimed a gun at the back of Lincolns head and fired at point blank range mortally wounding the President An Army surgeon Doctor Charles Leale assessed Lincolns wound as mortal The dying Lincoln was carried across the street to Petersen House and after being laid on the bed lost consciousness from blood loss After being in a coma for nine hours Lincoln died at 722 am on April 15 

He was the first American president to be assassinated

Lincoln has been ranked by scholars as one of the greatest US presidents

He was married to Grace Coolidge and had 2 children John and Calvin Jr His younger son Calvin Jr died at 16 while playing tennis at the White House He was wearing shoes without socks and died from a toe infection He was buried at the foot of Hill Cemetery

Coolidge served as the Mayor of Northampton Massachusetts He later served as the Governor of Massachusetts As governor he became famous because of his response during the Boston Police Strike Coolidge fired the police who went on strike and gave the jobs to unemployed World War 1 veterans 

In 1920 he was nominated Vice President under Warren GHarding The Harding Coolidge team won easily Harding died in 1923 and Coolidge became the next President

Coolidge finished Hardings term and was elected in 1924 to continue to be the countrys president

Coolidge was president during a prosperous economy and the country did not face many challenges He believed that the federal government should be as small as possible He supported tax cuts and wanted the federal government to keep its hands off the economy

Coolidge was criticized for refusing to give subsidies to farmers and when a giant flood happened in Mississippi during 1927 he did not want the federal government to be involved This was part of his belief of federalism that the countrys problems should be solved mainly by state governments and local governments rather than the federal government 

He surprised many people by choosing not to run for re election during 1928

The legacy of Calvin Coolidge is mixed People who support more federal government involvement in the economy do not like him People who support less federal government involvement in the economy like him

Calvin Coolidge was nicknamed Silent Cal because he did not talk much

Harry Truman was born on May 8 1884 in Lamar Missouri He prospered for 12 years as a Missouri farmer The presidential election of 1892 happened when Harry was eight years old Harry wanted Grover Cleveland to win Grover Cleveland did win He joined the United States Military in 1917Harry S Truman went to France in World War 1 and was captain in the Field Artillery Later on he had opened a clothing store in Kansas city He left the military in 1919 In 1919 He married Elizabeth Virginia Wallace As he was active in the democratic party he was elected judge of Jackson County Court

In 1922 Harry was elected county judge On February 17 1924 Bess had a baby girl and named her Mary Margaret Truman In November 1924 Harry Truman lost re election He was elected county judge again in 1926 In 1934 He was elected Senator of Missouri Harry became a member of the Interstate Commerce Committee He was vice chairman of a subcommittee on railroad safety In 1940 Harry Truman ran for re election to the Senate Governor Lloyd Stark was his primary opponent President Franklin Roosevelt wanted Stark to win St Louis Mayor Bernard Dickmann wanted Stark to win Harry had a hard time getting money Most people thought that Harry would lose About a month before the primary election the railroad unions said that they wanted Truman to win Two days before primary election day Bernard Dickmann also said that he wanted Harry to win instead of stark Harry won by about 8000 votes He also won the election in November 

Truman became chairman of a committee to investigate defense spending during World War 2 He helped eliminate billions of dollars of spending in the defense department that he believed was a waste He supported Roosevelts leadership of the country in the war but wanted to make the government more efficient and effective He gained a moderate amount of fame for leading that committe 

In 1944 President Franklin Roosevelt ran for re election again Roosevelt was in bad health and he did not have much longer to live The Democratic Party realized that whoever they selected as Vice President could potentially be the next president of the United States George Wallace Roosevelts former Vice President was not selected because he had a friendly attitude toward the Soviet Union which many saw as a dictatorship Roosevelt wanted Truman as his Vice President and Truman was selected as his Vice President 

They won the election and Roosevelt began his 4th term as president April 12th 1945 shortly after the election Franklin Delano Roosevelt died and Harry S Truman became president

After Franklin Roosevelt died Truman became president Truman said it felt like the moon the stars and all of the planets had fallen upon me

Harry Truman became president during the last few months of World War II While Truman was vice president he was never told much about the World War II by Roosevelt because back then the Vice Presidency was not considered to be an important political position Truman entered the presidency knowing not much more about US military operations in World War II than the average person Trumans defense advisors told Truman everything once he became president though

The United States made the Potsdam Declaration telling Japan to surrender the war or it will face prompt and utter destruction Japan did not surrender In result Truman authorized the dropping of the first Atomic bomb on Japan on August 6th 1945 The Soviet Union invaded Japan as it promised it would three months ago Truman ordered the second Atomic bomb to be dropped on the Japanese city Nagasaki on August 9th 1945 Japan surrendered and the war ended

The bombs were very destructive They destroyed both cities and killed hundreds of thousands of people For that reason the decision to use the weapons was controversial People who were against it such as general and future president Dwight Eisenhower believe it was a cruel and inhumane attack on innocent people when Japan was already close to being defeated People who supported the decision they felt it was necessary because it ended the war early Truman felt that if the US had invaded Japan instead of using the bombs to end the war quickly much more people would have died 

After the war Truman ordered Europe to be repaired with the Marshall Plan Germany was divided into two parts after the war The Soviet Union controlled East Germany The United States Britain and France controlled West Germany Truman ordered the Berlin Airlift which flew in tons of food to West Germany to feed the starving people He helped create the United Nations an organization which was based on the League of Nations The United Nations was founded on the purpose of developed nations working together to help humanity and to promote peace 

After World War II the Soviet Union and the United States were the only two powerful countries left With Germany being divided between the Soviet Union and the United States tensions began to increase between the two countries The Cold War began This was a war where the Soviet Union and the United States did not fight directly but each wanted to have a bigger influence than the other over the world The Soviet Union wanted to spread communism around the world Truman believed in a policy called containment which was devised by one of his defense advisors that the US should contain communism and stop it from spreading Truman declared the Truman Doctrine was the belief that the United States should give money to Turkey and Greece so that they are strong enough to defend themselves from communism

He sent Congress his Fair Deal It was based on Roosevelts New Deal It included more money to education more money to farmers and a higher minimum wage for workers Labor union leaders asked him for higher wages and more benefites After the coal miners strike he had the Department of Interior take over the mines While Truman sympathized for the working class when there was a huge railroad strike Truman believed it was illegal and unfair to people who could not get to work because the railroads were not operating so he threatened to draft the people into the army if they did not return to work He also desegregated the military allowing blacks and whites to fight together

In 1948 Harry Truman ran for a second term as President against Thomas Dewey He was the underdog and everyone thought he was going to lose The Chicago Tribune published a newspaper on the night of the election with the title Dewey Defeats Truman To everyones surprise Harry Truman won the election

On June 24 1950 North Korea attacked South Korea China was on the side of North Korea North Korea wanted to bring Communism into South Korea The US fought the Korean War to defend South Korea and it eventually ended shortly after Trumans term ended General Douglas MacArthur wanted to bomb China but Truman thought it was too dangerous to do that so he fired him Many people respected MacArthur so they were angry at Truman He made Mathew B Ridgeway general 

During the end of his term Harry Trumans approval rating at an all time low He was very unpopular because thousands of Americans died in the Korean War there was a moderate amount of corruption in his government and people were accusing many of Trumans employees of being communists He left office on January 20 1953

As time passed his reputation improved Many historians now believe that Harry Truman was a great president

Harry Truman moved back to Missouri He died on December 26 1972

John Adams was the second President of the United States and father of the sixth President John Quincy Adams He was also the first Vice President of the United States He was from Massachusetts

Adams was born in Braintree Massachusetts He went to Harvard College He married Abigail Adams in 1764

Adams wanted the Thirteen Colonies to be free from Great Britain However Adams was fair and thought every person should be treated fairly Even though he did not want British soldiers in Boston he was the lawyer who defended the British soldiers who were involved in the Boston Massacre

Adams was a representative from Massachusetts during the Second Continental Congress He helped Thomas Jefferson write the United States Declaration of Independence During the American Revolutionary War Adams helped make peace with Great Britain He served in France the Netherlands and England as an ambassador in the 1780s

Adams was the first vice president under George Washington After Washington chose not to run again Adams won the 1796 election Adams is thought to have been the first president to belong to a political party but like George Washington he thought himself above any particular party He ran for president on the Federalist ticket He beat Thomas Jefferson of the Democratic Republican Party President candidates and vice president candidates did not run together like they do today Since Jefferson got the second highest number of votes he became vice president

During his term he resolved a conflict against France peacefully He also passed the Alien and Sedition Acts which made it illegal to say bad things about the government Many people did not like those acts because they felt it took away their freedom of speech Adams was not re elected president and lost to Thomas Jefferson The Federalist Party was not as popular as it was when Adams was elected One of his last acts as president was to make John Marshall the Chief Justice of the United States This made sure that the Federalist Party would still be important

Of the first five US presidents Adams was the only one who did not own slaves He was also the only one to be from New England

Adams died on July 4 1826 This was the same day that Thomas Jefferson died and was also exactly when the adopten of the Declaration of Independence was signed

William Jefferson Clinton better known as Bill Clinton was the 42nd President of the United States He served from 1993 to 2001 He was 46 years old when he was elected His major opponents were George H W Bush and Bob Dole Clinton was the first president from the post World War II baby boom generation and was the third youngest president in the US He is a Democrat Before he was president Clinton was governor of Arkansas

Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe in Hope Arkansas He took the last name Clinton because it was his stepfather Roger Clinton Srs name Clinton grew up in Hot Springs Arkansas In high school Clinton played the saxophone Clinton went to college at Georgetown University During his college years Clinton worked under several politicians He later went to Oxford University and Yale Law School Clinton did not fight in the Vietnam War because he was in the ROTC for a short time 

Clinton married Hillary Rodham in 1975 In 1980 their daughter Chelsea Clinton was born

After law school Clinton was elected Attorney General of Arkansas in 1976 and governor of Arkansas in 1978 At 32 he was the youngest governor in the country at that time Clinton served as governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1993 Clinton was known for being a New Democrat while governor During Clinton changed the states school system There was also a scandal called Whitewater during Clintons term

During the early part of Clintons first term he put in place a tax code which would increase taxes on the rich and decrease taxes on the poor

In 1994 during Clintons first term in office the Congress switched to a Republican majority However Clinton still beat Republican Bob Dole in the 1996 election

The Republicans defeated Clintons proposal for the US government to adopt universal health care The Republicans proposed many new ideas to Congress to limit the size of government such as requiring the budget to be balanced and to stop people from abusing the welfare system

President Clinton was accused of wrongdoing by the US House of Representatives in December 1998 during the Monica Lewinsky scandal Although he lied that they did not engage in sexual activity he was found to have done nothing wrong by the US Senate in February 1999

The country faced very few challenges during his term The Cold War was over and there was very little need for the US military to get involved in the worlds affairs so defense spending was significantly lowered The economy was doing very well during his term though there is a debate whether the economy was well because of Clintons policies or because of the Republicans policies

The decade ended with the being the first time the United States did not have to borrow money to pay for its budget Clinton left office with high approval ratings

After his presidency he wrote some books and travelled around the world helping out the United States He is married to US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and now lives in New York He has written My Life a book about his life and several other books Clinton has received two Grammy Awards both for books he read on tape He is now the UNs envoy to Haiti He also became a vegetarian

The yield of a financial instrument usually a debt or other fixed income instrument is the amount the holder is paid each year for leaving his or her money invested in that instrument Unlike a corporate dividend a yield is fairly certain unless there is a bankruptcy

Yields vary with inflation However they tend to fit in a fixed order the least risky instruments such as Treasury bonds yield the least then safe and guaranteed instruments like long term deposits then overnight deposits and so on to the various municipal bond and corporate bonds Extremely risky instruments with high yield are usually called junk bonds

Economics is very concerned with yields and related money supply questions A key issue is the contrast with ecological yield some people advocate a monetary reform to ensure that the requirement to repay global debt does not reduce the Earths carrying capacity or carbon sink capacity If the payments of economic yield to holders of global debt exceed that which can be borne by the natural renewal of the Earth that is an energy subsidy These subsidies typically come from fossil fuel and other non renewable resources Full cost accounting for these versus renewable resources may limit the yield that can be guaranteed to holders of debt instruments

In practice this is an issue with money supply and monetary policy and does not affect each individual holder of a bond or other debt except insofar as it may lead from time to time to odious debt writeoffs or a major credit crisis These are surprisingly common in a business cycle anyway

Also there are so many restrictions on who can issue debt instruments in a bond market that the most egregious horrors do not happen in a developed nation They are however still quite common in Brazil and other emerging markets

Moral purchasing is when a person uses moral reasoning to decide what to buy For example when a person chooses to buy local goods instead of those from other countries helps neighbours and processes that one can point to quickly

A social network is a set of social actors and a set of social relationships among them Considering social relationships as a network calls attention in some manner to the importance of the pattern or structure of the set of relationships 

A personal social network is the pattern of relationships among a set of actors who have a relationship to a particular focal person A community social network is the pattern of relationships among a set of people andor organizations in a community Each of these networks can involve social support provide people with a sense of community and lead them to help and protect each other 

How big a personal network can become depends on the individual and the type of relationships considered The set of people that a person knows well or with whom a person frequently interacts seldom exceeds several hundred Similarly as the size of a community network grows maintaining relationships among all or even most members is strained by sheer size There is a Law of 150 which suggests that about 150 persons is the best size for a village or large clan Many experts think that a corporation has an ideal size of about 70 people these people and their spouses would also fit as a large social network

Social capital refers to properties of social relationships which can be utilized to yield a desired result or return just as human capital are skills and talents resident in a person that can be used to achieve a desired result and capital are material items that can be used to yield a desired result One example of social capital is people in a community network who are willing to help each other This use of a social network is most obvious during disaster recovery At that time people often come forward to help each other Other examples are people using their social network to find employment or to aid their career 

In psychology a free rider is a person who uses the social network but does not contribute help when required It is often thought that power structures evolve from the need to detect and exclude such free riders factdateJuly 2010 Social networks are vulnerable to them since the circumstances where help is required like disasters occur by surprise It might happen that someone cannot help at that one time  it might also happen that they are not there the next time Only after a lot of time does it become obvious who is and is not contributing to the safety of the group or who is avoiding the group when people really need their help

Some social networks are held together by the ties of religion A mosque church or temple is almost always a center of a social network and often that network has a name and an identity of its own that is not that of the religious organization

The Law of 150 is well documented by Robin Dunbar British Anthropologist Professor of Psychology University of Liverpool in R I M Dunbar Neocortex size as a constraint on group size in primates Journal of Human Evolution vol 20 pp 469 493  it is also proposed by some branches of sociology

A cabal is a group of people who try to control things in a secret way

Sometimes people say There Is No Cabal or use the abbreviation TINC to mean There Is No Cabal

A cabal does not mean people who are in power because they are meant to have power A cabal means people who have more power than they are meant to have

One new example of the use of the word Cabal is that the former chief of staff Lawrence Wilkerson of the Secretary of State Colin Powell said that the foreign policy of George W Bushs administration were run by a Cheney Rumsfeld cabal With this word he meant that the President had not really the power that he is given by the constitution and that the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense had more influence than they should have 

Creating is making new things that have not existed before usually by combining two or three things that existed Art is almost always called creative but so are other activities like music mathematics technology business craft building gardening and forestry if they combine things to get new things

When several people cooperate in more than one process of creating that is a creative network This cuts risk since anything creative involves some chance that it will simply not work

What is not creative is usually called imitative and includes anything that is mostly trying not to do what has never been done like law sports science war and especially education These involve more direct competition so risk comes from the competitor who may do it better The word team is used for such groups

Most people fear change and new things and so what is most stable and considered important by society tends to be imitative and done in teams But unless society encourages creating it loses out to others by competition in business or technology so there must be some creative networks somewhere in labs or art studios

Views of control of creative work also depend very much on religious and spiritual views of nature creating Man according to economist Lester Thurow Those ethical traditions that see Man in the image of God have created legal codes to tightly control what they are creating or have created These are now the basis of organizations such as WIPO or ICANN Often such laws also create control over things which are merely found not created

Many people give away what they have created and never think about it as property other people try to control it and get paid every time anyone sees it or even every time they just talk about it

Wikipedia uses the GNU FDL which is a content license that tries to get people to combine what they are creating with no one clearly in control This is considered strange by many people who are uncomfortable with that idea or seek to control some aspect of it themselves

Human science is the science of humans what makes them different from animals and their limits which tend to be the same as those of other animals Because human bodies are animal bodies human science is part of biology which leads to Life Science However human behaviour includes the use of words measures numbers knowing time and having memory and such habits as trade  thus economics and psychology are considered to be part of human science A general human science is anthropology which studies only the differences between humans and near relatives

One important debate in human science is whether the exchange of culture is only among humans or if it also goes on among our Great Ape near relatives If so then culture is part of primatology and there is no clear line between human science and life sciences

Another name for human science is Social Science since the most complex thing about humans is how they relate to each other in society The most general social science is ethics or economics depending on your point of view

However life science also deals with humans as objects of study while hard science such as chemistry deals with humans as the observer who does the study  sets the scale at which observation can happen incurs observer effects  as studied in philosophy of science 

Often sciences have different names based on whether they study humans or not For instance economics is the study of how humans make a living while ecology is the study of how non humans make a living Medicine is normally restricted to humans while veterinary medicine refers to the same techniques made on other species One relies more on ethics and less on economics when dealing with humans at least according to any ethical tradition

The living social and sensory observing aspects of humans are probably all part of the human sciences to the degree they affect how humans view themselves

Specific human sciences are include psychology sociology and linguistics There is debate as to whether mathematics is something human or if it is universal  see philosophy of mathematics on this

Flaying is a form of torture mutilation and execution It is the act of stripping the skin and flesh from the bones Flaying an enemy while alive is apparently a very ancient practice Accounts attribute the practice to the ancient Assyrians who were said to flay the skin from a captured enemy or rebellious ruler and nail it to the wall of his city as warning to all who would defy their power Searing or cutting the flesh from the body was sometimes used as part of the public execution of traitors in medieval Europe A similar mode of execution was used as late as the early 18th century in France one such episode is graphically recounted in the opening chapter of Michel Foucaults Discipline and Punish

Rice is a type of food It is grown in warm parts of the world mainly Asia Africa northern Italy and the West Coast of North America

Rice used to be the main diet in many countries It is not eaten raw usually it is cooked or boiled In some areas such as Spain rice is first fried in olive oil or butter then cooked with water or soup In other areas such as India rice is eaten with sauce or curry Rice can also be used to make alcohol such as Japanese sake

Rice is believed to have been first grown in ancient southern China and India Rice growing was brought to Japan possibly in the 1st century BC and became popular during the 2nd century and the 3rd century From India rice spread to southern Europe and Africa

Rice is usually planted in a flat field filled with water Before cropping the water is drained from the field Before farmers developed a good farming system and fertilizers they used to let lands rest for 1 to 2 years while farming in other lands 

In some hot areas close to the equator farmers do double cropping which means raising two crops one year

For other uses see Yogi

Yoga is an old discipline from India Yoga uses breathing techniques exercise and meditation It claims to improve health and happiness

Yoga is the Sanskrit word for union

Patanjali was a pioneer of classical yoga He defined yoga as the cessation of the modification of the mind

For example the famous sun salutation contains 12 poses of asanas one after the other and helps to balance body and soul

Even though economics is all about choice on the basis of what is available rather than what should be available the big question relates to who decides how resources should be distributed and how economics can embrace a trade off between different groups which each seek to make the most of their allocation of resources If what should be cannot be incorporated the subject of economics will be as dry as desert as described by Ayn Rand The challenge therefore is to construct a model combining what is to what should be and make the same acceptable to common man as well as politicians Not being able to sell the idea as such is a defeat to the discipline The issue is that of influence and not of theory as Adam Smith perceived that no group of business men ever met other than to exploit the consumer

Cattle is a word to describe animals which are mammals and belong to the genus Bos and is such that it is never specific to gender age breed or type The word cattle is in plural form never singular For example cattle is used by saying some cattle or many cattle There is no word in English that means one cattle or many cattles Within the general term of cattle itself are cows bulls oxen heifers steers bullocks and calves 

Cattle are large grass eating mammals with two toed or cloven hooves and a four chambered stomach which is an adaptation to help digest such material They can be horned or polled depending on the breed The horns come out on either side of the head above the ears and are a simple shape usually curved upwards but sometimes down Cattle usually stay together in groups called herds One male called a bull will usually have a number of cows in a herd as his harem The cows usually give birth to one calf a year though twins are also known to be born The calves have long strong legs and can walk a few minutes after they are born so they can follow the herd 

Cattle are native to most tropical and subtropical parts of the world except Australia and New Zealand Cattle have been domesticated for about 7000 years They are used for milk meat transport and power 

The word cattle has been used in English for about 1000 years and the meaning has changed In books that are written in Old English such as the King James Version of the Bible the word is used for all sorts of farm animals including horses sheep and goats The word comes from the Old French word chattels meaning all the things that a person owns

The word cattle is used for some wild animals as well as for domesticated cattle Wild cattle include the Water Buffalo from South East Asia the Musk Ox and Yak from Central Asia the Bison of North America and Europe and the African Buffalo The last Aurochs wild cattle of Europe were killed in Masovia Poland in 1627

An intact male bovine is called a bull A young male bovine is often called a bullock A mature female that has given birth to at least one or two calves is called a cow A young bovine between birth and weaning is called a calf Two or more of these young bovines are calves A young female bovine is called a heifer calf A young male bovine is called a bull calf A female that has never had a calf is called a heifer A female bovine that has had her first calf is often called a first calf heifer Calving is the act of a cow or heifer giving birth to a calf A freemartin is a heifer that is born infertile or unable to give birth to a calf because she was born with a male twin

Because very few bulls are needed to breed with many cows and heifers and to form a complete breeding herd most male cattle are used for meat They are castrated by removing the testicles to prevent them from being able to breed other cows and heifers and to take away the male characteristics that are common with bulls A male that has been castrated before reaching puberty is called a steer Stags are bulls which have been castrated after reaching puberty though stags are more often referred to as steers An ox is a male bovine that has been castrated after puberty and is trained and used for draft purposes such as pulling a plow or a wagon Cattle can either be horned which are two bony points coming out on either side of a beasts head one on each side or polled where no horns are grown but a somewhat pointy poll is found at the top of a cows head

The adjective that is used to describe something that is like a cow or an ox is bovine 

The words cow bull and calf are also used to describe some other large animals that are not related to cattle such as elephants moose and whales

Cattle are found all over the world from as far north as Canada and Russia to the dry inland of Australia The only continent they are not found on is Antarctica Different types and breeds of cattle are suited to different environments Bos indicus cattle such as the Brahman breed are suited to subtropic and tropical areas whereas Bos taurus cattle such as Angus cattle are more suited to temperate or colder climates Their large wide hooves are good in both wet areas and dry grassland Their hairy coat grows much longer in the winter and has an extra fluffy layer to hold in warmth They shed this extra layer in spring in preparation for the hot summer ahead Most cattle except those of the Bos indicus subspecies do not have sweat glands in their skin but their wet nose is a useful cooling system They can also pant like a dog as well

Cattle can make a range of noises from a gentle moo to a low growl in warning or to attract females especially among bulls When they are angry or upset they can bellow or bawl quite loudly Common knowledge is that calves bawl cows moo and bulls bellow

Cattle are herbivorous meaning that they are plant eating animals They are ruminants which mean they have a stomach with multiple chambers which helps digest their food more efficiently The four chambers are reticulum rumen omasum and abomasum The reticulum is known as the hardware stomach because it is mainly used as a storage area where nails rocks and other objects are stored and broken down that the cow accidentally swallowed The rumen is the largest chamber in a ruminants stomach and in cattle it can hold up to 50 gallons of partly and fully digested feed It is the chamber were fermentation takes place to help break down the grass that the cow has eaten The omasum also known as many piles is a compartment that squeezes or absorbs all the water that has accumulated from the digestion that has gone on in the rumen The abomasum is the four chamber that is very similar in function to a humans stomach and is thus called the true stomach Cattle have very strong tongues and strong lower front teeth that help them to eat grass They lack upper front teeth unlike that of a horse A cow often grazes by swallowing grass whole After a cow has eaten its fill and is resting they return or regurgitate the grass from their stomach to their mouth and rechew it with their very large back teeth to break it down further This is called chewing the cud Other ruminants like deer sheep and goats also do this It means that cattle do not need as much food as horses even though they are about the same size 

Cows have large breasts called udders which is often a large often pink sac found between the back legs The udder is divided into four parts or quarters each with a large teat that the calf is able to grasp with its mouth to suckle from Cows will begin milk production as soon as a calf is born and can continue to produce milk when bred again and when pregnant with their next calf Heifers unless they have given birth to their first calf do not produce milk Dairy cows tend to have much larger udders than beef cows and as such these type of cows will usually produce more milk than what is needed to feed one calf Dairy cows are female cattle that are raised to produce lots of milk for human consumption Beef cows on the other hand are female cattle that are used to raise a calf from birth that is used for beef later in its life Both types of cows will keep producing milk as long as it is demanded either by the calf by the milking machine or by the human that is hand milking them When milk from them is no longer needed they will not explode they simply dry up where the milk they produce is absorbed or taken back in by their bodies

Cows are pregnant for a similar amount of time as a human a little over 9 months or an average of 285 days 

Bulls can often be fierce and dangerous especially in the presence of their herd of cows and heifers In the wild they will often fight each other over mating rights and their herds of cows and will use their horns to gore each other Some bulls will fight to the death others will fight until either one of the bulls decides to run off Bulls with no horns can still do plenty of damage to each other by head butting the others head neck side or belly and will use their heads to push each other around A bull with horns often has a better chance of winning a fight than a bull with no horns They also protect the herds from other animals such as wolves jackals bears tigers and lions On farms bulls are usually quieter and more docile and can be led by a nose ring by their owners but they can be aggressive with other bulls and with strange people or animals who might get too near his herd Bulls are especially dangerous when they have been bottle raised as a calf and even when they are very docile Dairy bulls like Jerseys and Holsteins tend to be more aggressive than bulls of beef breeds like Hereford and Angus

For the reasons above most male cattle are either sent to slaughter while they are still calves or are castrated so that they are much less likely to fight each other or be aggressive towards the farmer that is raising them making them safer to handle and keep until it is time to send them to market Steers have no other purpose except to be raised sold and slaughtered for beef

Ever since people started using cattle in Prehistoric times cattle have been seen as a sign of wealth In many countries today particularly in Africa and Asia a persons wealth is judged by the number of cattle they own 

Cattle are very useful animals Their flesh can be eaten as meat Their milk can be drunk and turned into cheese and yogurt Their skin can be used as leather They can pull carts and plows They can make the power to turn flour mills or pump water The food that they eat is not expensive and often not in competition with what people eat

Dairy cattle are kept and raised specially for milking Herds of cows are kept and are regularly mated with a bull so that they produce calves This keeps the milk supply going However most commercial dairy farms do not keep bulls because of the concern that such bulls are very dangerous when being handled Instead cows are artificially inseminated with bull semen that is stored kept frozen in liquid nitrogen and is bred by a person who artificially inseminates cows for a living 

Some large dairy herds especially those used to produce organic or free range milk are kept on pasture where there is a good supply of grass and the fields are relatively small but not so small that they are not able to graze regularly during the season when grass is growing This is because the cows need to be brought in for milking every day twice a day and should not have far to travel 

A number of dairy herds are kept in barns or sheds for most of their lives and are given feed that has been especially made for them This feed contains grain like corn hay including grass and alfalfa or clover and fermented chopped feed called silage that is usually made from corn wheat or barley Cows are often kept in stalls where they have enough room to lay down comfortably Such large dairies must supply straw or saw dust for the cows to rest on without getting sore from the hard concrete floor

Cows can be milked by hand but in many countries where there are large dairies the cows are milked by a milking machine The milk is collected in a large stainless steel container where it undergoes pastuerization a process that heats milk to a very high temperature to kill any bacteria that are living in the milk The milk is then taken by truck to a milk or dairy factory to be made into the milk we drink by being separated to remove most of the cream It is then put into bottles or cartons to be sold Some milk is also turned into cheese ice cream butter cream and even yogurt All of these dairy products are packaged or put into cartons or bottles and sold

Many types of cattle are used for milk They include 

Beef cattle are bred and raised specifically to provide meat or beef Steers are the best type for this purpose because they can be kept in herds without fighting each other Heifers are also often used for beef especially those that are not suitable to be used in a breeding herd The cows of beef cattle are used to give birth to and raise calves for meat They are not usually used for milk although some types of cattle such as the Red Poll Dexter or Red Devon are used for both These type of cattle are called dual purpose breeds

Beef cattle are often allowed graze over large areas because they do not have to be brought in every day like dairy cattle The biggest farms in the world are cattle stations in Australia ranches in North America and ranchos in Latin America where they run beef cattle

Until the mid 20th century beef cattle were often sent to market on the hoof Cowboys or drovers would herd the cattle along the roads or on trails to the cattle markets in big towns or cities or to railway stations where they would be loaded and shipped to these towns or cities In Australia sometimes the cattle would travel for hundreds of miles along roads known as Traveling Stock Routes Big herds would have thousands of heads of cattle Nowadays cattle are usually sent to the market in huge lorries known as road trains In North America cattle are sent to auction marts slaughter plants or other farms or ranches by large semi trucks called cattle liners

The meat from a calf is called veal and from an older beast beef Meat that is cut into flat pieces for frying or grilling is called steak Every part of a beast can be used The skin becomes leather The meat which is not used by humans becomes pet food and almost everything that is left over becomes garden fertilizer Many other products can be and are often made from cattle for example car tires home insulation paint hand lotion soap jello and many drugs are made from parts of cattle Cows blood is often used in special effects in the creation of action or horror movies Bones from cattle can be made into knife handles or napkin rings The list is endless

Types of cattle that are used for beef 

Oxen are cattle trained as work or draft animals The word ox is used to describe just one They are castrated males 

An ox is over four years old and grown to full size when it begins to work Oxen are used for pulling plows and wagons for hauling heavy loads like logs or for powering different machines such as mills and irrigation pumps 

Oxen are most often used in teams of two for light work such as plowing In past days very large teams of fourteen to twenty oxen were used for heavy work such as logging The oxen are put into pairs and each pair must work together A wooden yoke is put about the neck of each pair so that the work is shared across their shoulders Oxen are chosen from certain breeds with horns since the horns hold the yoke in place when the oxen lower their heads back up or slow down

Oxen must be trained from a young age The owner must make or buy as many as a dozen yokes of different sizes as the animals grow Ox teams are steered by shouted commands whistles or the noise of a whip crack Men who drove ox teams were called teamsters in America wagoners in Britain or in Australia bullockies Many bullockies and teamsters were famous for their voices and for their foul language 

Oxen can pull harder and longer than horses especially for very large loads They are not as fast as horses but they are less often injured or less likely to startle than horses are Many oxen are still in use all over the world especially in poor countries
