In the context of Russian Orthodox church history the Old Believers became separated after 1666  1667 They split from the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church as a protest against church reforms introduced by Patriarch Nikon Old Believers continue liturgical practices which the Russian Orthodox Church maintained before the implementation of these reforms  Russian speakers refer to the schism itself as raskol

Patriarch Nikon wanted to bring the Russian Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church closer together For this reason he changed a few rituals and texts in 1651 These changes were made to the Russian rituals to be closer to the Greek ones of Nikons time According to the Old Believers Nikon did this without the support of the clergy and without a council When the changes were done people who still practised the old rites were persecuted

Wave particle duality is perhaps one of the most confusing concepts in physics because it is so unlike anything we see in the ordinary world

Physicists who studied light in the 1700s and 1800s were having a big argument about whether light was made of particles shooting around like tiny bullets or waves washing around like water waves At times light seems to do both At times light seems to go only in a straight line as if it were made of particles But other experiments show that light has a frequency and wavelength just like a sound wave or water wave Until the 20th century most physicists thought that light was either one or the other and that the scientists on the other side of the argument were simply wrong

In 1909 a scientist named Geoffrey Taylor decided that he was going to settle this argument once and for all He borrowed an experiment invented earlier by Thomas Young where light was shone through two small holes right next to each other When bright light was shone through these two small holes it created an interference pattern that seemed to show that light was actually a wave 

Taylors idea was to photograph the film coming out of the holes with a special film that was unusually sensitive to light When bright light was shined through the holes the film showed an interference pattern just like Young showed earlier Taylor then turned down the light to a very dim level When the light was dim enough Taylors photographs showed tiny pinpoints of light scattering out of the holes This seemed to show that light was actually a particle If Taylor allowed the dim light to shine through the holes for long enough the dots eventually filled up the film to make an interference pattern again This demonstrated that light was somehow both a wave and a particle

This made the idea that electrons in atoms show a standing wave pattern

The photoelectric effect shows that a light photon which has enough energy can cause an electron to be released off a metals surface Electrons in this case can be called photoelectrons

Johannes Ockeghem was the most famous composer of the Franco Flemish School in the last half of the 15th century and is often thought of as the most important composer between Dufay and Josquin des Prez He was an excellent choirmaster and teacher He spent most of his life working for the French royal court

The name Ockeghem is found with many different spellings in old documents He was almost certainly born in the town of Saint Ghislain His native language was probably French

Like many composers in this period he started to learn about music by singing in a church choir quite possibly in Saint Ghislain and then in Mons 

His first important job was working for Charles I Duke of Bourbon in Moulins Then in 1451 he went to work for King Charles VII of France By this time he was well known as a singer and composer He worked for the royal court for more than 50 years and was rewarded with promotions and honours Charles VII gave him important jobs After Charles VIIs death Louis XI became king He reigned for a long time and Ockeghem was in favour with the king He often travelled with the king visiting places such as Cambrai and even as far as Spain He met famous people including the composers Dufay and Binchois He also had other jobs in Paris

Louis XI died in 1483 We do not kinow much about where Ockeghem went after that but he probably died in Tours because that is where he left his will

Ockeghem was not a composer who wrote lots of music but it is hard to tell as some of it might have got lost There are 14 masses that survive and other vocal works His Missa pro Defunctis is the earliest surviving polyphonic Requiem Ockeghem based many of his masses on well known tunes in a way that is called cantus firmus technique Sometimes he put the borrowed tunes in the lowest part This was rather unusual

Ockeghems music influenced Josquin des Prez and other composers from Flanders and the Netherlands 

When Ockeghem died Josquin Des Prez composed a motet called La dploration de la mort de Johannes Ockeghem in his honour The music theorist Johannes Tinctoris described him as a great musician and one of the best singers he knew Many younger composers used some of Ockeghems melodies as a base for their own compositions In the Renaissance this kind of borrowing from the music ofc another composer was thought to be a great honour

Pocahontas was a Native American woman who married an Englishman John Rolfe and became a celebrity in London right before she died She was a daughter of Wahunsunacock He was the king of an area called the Tidewater region in Virginia for a while Her real names were Matoaka and Amonute Pocahontas was a childhood nickname referring to her playful nature Some people think she saved John Smiths life After her marriage she became officially Rebecca Rolfe A movie was made about her in 1995 by Disney

The name Pocahontas was a nickname given to her because she was always fun and happy She was very happy Her real name was either Matoaka or Amonute The Indians did not want the English settlers to know her real name After Pocahontas was baptized she was given the English name Rebecca She was called Rebecca Rolfe after she was married

Pocahontas was born around 1595 She was the daughter of Powhatan the chief Powhatan tribes that had over 14000 Indians John Smith said that he was captured by a group of Powhatan hunters He was about to be executed but Pocahontas saved him

After this the Indians and English became friends Pocahontas would go to the settlement to play games with the boys there When the colonists were starving Pocahontas brought them food

In 1609 John Smith was hurt by a gunpowder explosion He had to go back to England to get better Pocahontas thought that John Smith was dead until she went to England By then she had already married John Rolfe

Pocahontas and John Smith most likely did not love each other People got the idea that they might have loved each other from movies and other stories

Two English settlers met Pocahontas when they were trading with the Indians With the help of an Indian named Japazaws they tricked Pocahontas They said that they would give her back only if Chief Powhatan gave the English prisoners who he had captured and weapons

Chief Powhatan did not give the English settlers enough weapons So they continued to keep Pocahontas for about a year During this time they treated Pocahontas very well They told her about Christianity and taught her English After she was baptized Pocahontas took the English name Rebecca Later Pocahontas was allowed to go back to the Indians but she chose to stay with the English

When Pocahontas was living with the English she met John Rolfe John Rolfe loved Pocahontas and they were married The English and Indians became friends again

In 1616 Pocahontas and her husband John Rolfe went to England About eleven other Indians went with them John Smith was living in London at the time Pocahontas was in Plymouth she learned that he was still alive John Smith did not meet Pocahontas when she was in England

In March 1617 John Rolfe and Pocahontas got on a ship to return to Virginia but Pocahontas became very sick and died

Just after the death of Sophie Charlotte the village near the palace was called Charlottenburg and the palace itself Schloss Charlottenburg and the settlement was chartered as a town The king was the towns mayor until Lietzow was incorporated into Charlottenburg in 1720

Fredericks successor Frederick William I of Prussia rarely stayed at the palace Frederick William even tried to end the towns privileges It was not until 1740 at the coronation of his successor Frederick II that the towns became important again The eastern New Wing was built by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff between 1740 and 1747 as Frederick the Greats home Later Frederick II preferred the palace of Sanssouci which he had partly designed himself

When Frederick II died in 1786 his nephew Frederick William II succeeded him and Charlottenburg became his favourite residence as it was for his son and successor Frederick William III

After the defeat of the Prussian army at Jena in 1806 Charlottenburg was occupied by the French Napoleon occupied the palace while his troops camped nearby

Kreuzberg south of Berlin Mitte was one of the best known boroughs of Berlin famous for its nightlife and its left leaning electorate as well as its problems with crime the drug scene and a very high number of immigrants

Kreuzberg consists of two different parts the southeastern SO 36 part and the southwest SW 61 Until the Berlin Wall fell these were the last two numbers of the postal codes for the two areas

It was a separate borough from 1920 when it became a part of Gro Berlin until the borughs were changed in 2001 Then it was joined with Friedrichshain to form the new borough of Friedrichshain Kreuzberg Since these two localities are linked only by a single bridge over the Spree river the Oberbaumbrcke this joining seemed awkward to many residents The two areas could not agree on where the new boroughs town hall should be Friedrichshain was chosen by tossing a five Mark coin

Kreuzberg is known to many for numerous Turkish immigrants from eastern parts of Turkey and the yearly May Day riots This is because before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 Kreuzberg was isolated Its eastern parts were almost entirely surrounded by the Wall This area consequently had cheap rents and lower income families as well as squatters from the radical left The western part of Kreuzberg also bordered onto the wall and it was here where Checkpoint Charlie was

Kreuzberg got its name is from its highest point the Kreuzberg It is of m to ftnum66abbrnospellCommonwealthprecision2wikiyes above sea level The hill was a traditional place for weekend trips and had a lot of small restaurants for the visitors The hill got its name from a monument built in 1821 by Karl Friedrich Schinkel It was to remember the wars against Napoleon I of France

After 1860 industry began moving into Kreuzburg There was also an Exportviertel along Ritterstrae which had a lot of many profitable small businesses and the press quarter along Kochstrae was the home of most of Germanys large newspapers as well as the Ullstein Scherl and Mosse book publishers

Both of these industrial quarters were almost entirely destroyed during World War II with the bombings of a single night from 3 February 1945 To remember old tradition the Axel Springer press company built its new headquarters at Kochstrae again right next to the Berlin Wall

After World War II Kreuzbergs housing rents were regulated by law which made investments unattractive As a result housing was of low quality but cheap which made the borough a prime target for immigrants coming to Germany

Civil War was a large comic book story created by Marvel Comics The story was the main focus of a seven issue series that started in May 2006 and ended in February 2007 It involved every major Marvel character and a large number of minor ones Nearly every main Marvel title during this time dealt with this story 

The story was about the United States dealing with an accident during a superhero battle that caused 613 deaths To prevent this from happening again the government created the Superhero Registration Act This was a law that forced all people with superhuman powers to identify them self to the government Many superheroes believed this was a good thing and that it would save lives Others believed it was bad They felt that if the government knew who they were they would be in danger of others finding out They believed that the SRA took away many of their freedoms This caused the superheros to split into two groups Those supporting the SRA were led by Iron Man Those against it were led by Captain America

Many people have compared the story of Civil War to that of the United States after 911 and the Patriot Act

Emergency medical services in the United Kingdom are provided by one of the four National Health Services through local ambulance services known in England and Wales as trusts Each service in England is based on one or more local authority areas and so the country is divided across a number of ambulance services in a similar way to the British Police

In England there are twelve ambulance Trusts with boundaries generally following those of the regional government offices Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland have one ambulance service each the Scottish Ambulance Service the Welsh Ambulance Service and the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service

NHS ambulance services must by law answer four types of requests for care which are

The ambulance services have getting more and more busy There has been a big increase in the number calls in the last two decades as shown in the table below

Ambulance trusts may also undertake non urgent patient transport services on a commercial arrangement with their local hospital trusts or in some cases on directly funded government contracts The pateients do not pay for this service The hospital does In some place private firms do this job instead but it can be a big source of money for the trusts

Before 1974 local councils used to run the ambulance service Since then NHS regions and now ambulance trust have On 1 July 2006 the number of ambulance trusts fell from 29 to 13 

Most of the new Trusts follow government office regional boundaries But on the Isle of Wight the local hospitals will keep running the ambulances Also South East England and South West England were split into two Ambulance Trusts This has meant that a lot of old trusts disappeared The new Trusts are

The Scottish Ambulance Service is a Special Health Board funded directly by the Health Department of the Scottish Government In 2006 the service answered over 520000 emergency calls 

Scotland also has Britains only publicly funded Air Ambulance service It has two Eurocopter EC 135 Helicopters and two Beechcraft B200C King Air fixed wing aircraft

The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service is the ambulance service that serves the whole of Northern Ireland and was set up in 1995 

As with other ambulance services in the United Kingdom it does not charge its patients directly for its services but is funded through general taxation

To answer medical emergencies in Northern Ireland NIAS has over 270 The Service employs approximately 1044 staff based across 32 stations sub stations 4 Control Centres and a Regional Training Centre

The Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust was set up on April 1 1998 and has 2500 staff providing ambulance and related services to the 29 million residents of Wales

Its headquarters are at the HMStanley Hospital St Asaph Denbighshire and it is divided into three regions 

Private ambulance services are becoming more common in the UK They often providing medical cover at large events either with or instead of the voluntary sector providers Some organisers use a private firm instead of a voluntary ambulance service because of wider availability during the week or for a wider range of skills such as provision of qualified Paramedics 

The most common use for private ambulances is for Patient Transport Many trusts and hospitals choosing use a private company instead of the NHS service Private ambulances do not answer emergency calls Sometimes a private ambulance company is used as a follow up for stretcher transport or going non life threatening calls Recently some companies have been contracted to provide additional emergency crews and vehicles to supplement the core NHS staff at busy times

All ambulance companies and the NHS Ambulance trusts must follow the same laws so a private ambulance must have the same equipment and the people working in it be as qualified as the same type of NHS ambulance

Another type of private ambulance are those operated by undertakers who generally favour black vans with the words private ambulance written discreetly on the vehicle They are used for taking bodies between hospital embalmer and chapel of rest rather than use a hearse

The main voluntary ambulance providers are the British Red Cross and St John Ambulance in EnglandWales Northern Ireland The Islands and St Andrews Ambulance Association in Scotland The Order of Malta Ambulance Corps can sometimes be found in Northern Ireland also These groups have been providing both emergency and non emergency medical cover in the UK for over 120 years including active service in both World Wars This is before any government organised service 

The main activity of the organisations apart from training and education is providing ambulance cover at events as an extension of their First aid contract 

Depending on their agreement or agreements with their local ambulance service trust they may treat and transport certain categories of patient to hospital although for more serious incidents such as cardiac arrest it is likely that they would be expected to summon the assistance of the statutory ambulance service

Both organisations also provide reserve or support cover to some though not all of the ambulance trusts where ambulance crews from one of the organisations will attend 999 GP Urgent or PTS calls on behalf of the ambulance trust In these cases the organisation is paid by the trust This service is most often called on during major incidents when there is a high level of staff absence or when there is an unusually high call volume although in some areas voluntary crews are regularly used to supplement full time trust cover

Both organisations have also provided cover for the public when NHS ambulance trust staff have held strikes or walk outs

Big White Taxi Service is nickname sometimes used by NHS ambulance staff in the United Kingdom

They use it because the 999 emergency number is often misused by people who do not need an emergency ambulance but could go to their own local General Practitioner

The Republic of Texas was a sovereign state in North America between the United States and Mexico that existed from 1836 to 1845 It was started on March 2 1836 when the people living in Texas declared themselves it won independence from Mexico The Mexican army led by Santa Anna marched into Texas and attacked the new country However the Mexican army was defeated and Santa Anna was captured at a battle near the site of Houston The new republic did not have an easy time It did not have a proper government or any money Its borders were often raided by Mexico and there was fighting between the settlers and the Native Americans The US government did not recognize the Republic of Texas

In 1841 Santa Anna again became president of Mexico and the border attacks increased By this time thousands of new settlers had moved into Texas and people in the US supported the people of Texas The idea of Texas becoming part of the US became popular

The Republic of Texas ended on December 29 1845 when Texas became the 28th state of the United States of America

The twelve US trials in front of the Nuremberg Military Tribunal took place from December 9 1946 to April 13 1949 The trials were

The AnschlussAnschluss also known as the Anschluss sterreichs was the joining together of Austria and Germany in 1938

After the First World War when the empires of Austria Hungary and Germany were abolished many hoped that a new country of all Germans would be created by joining Austria and Germany

This was not allowed but it was a hope of the Nazis

Adolf Hitler met Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg on 12 February 1938 in Berchtesgaden Bavaria and ordered him to end the ban on political parties reinstate full party freedom release all imprisoned members of the Nazi party and let them take part in the government

If Austria would not do this Hitler threatened to send in his army

So Schuschnigg did what Hitler demanded and appointed Arthur Seyss Inquart a pro Nazi lawyer as Interior Minister and another Nazi Edmund Glaise Horstenau as a Minister without Portfolio

In January 1938 Schussnig had been told to fire the chief of staff of the Austrian Army Alfred Jansa from his position Jansa and his staff had plans for defending Austria against a German attack Hitler did not want this to happen

Schuschnigg realised that his new ministers were trying to take over from him To get support Schuschnigg allowed socialists and communists legally to appear in public again The parties had been banned on 12 February 1934 in the Austrian Civil War The communists said they supported the Austrian government The socialists wanted more promises from Schuschnigg before they were willing to side with him

On 9 March Schuschnigg announced a plebiscite on the independence of Austria for 13 March

To help his side to win Schuschnigg set the minimum voting age at 24 Many of those who supported Nazism and union with Germany were young so this move was to stop them from voting

Hitler said that the plebiscite would be subject to major fraud and that Germany would not accept it Also the German Ministry of Propaganda issued press reports that riots had broken out in Austria and that large parts of the Austrian population were calling for German troops to restore order Schuschnigg immediately said publicly that reports of riots were false

Hitler sent an ultimatum to Schuschnigg on 11 March saying that he must hand over all power to the Austrian Nazis or face an invasion

Schuschnigg resigned as Chancellor that evening He could not persuade France or Britain to help

In the radio broadcast when he announced his resignation he said that he accepted the changes and allowed the Nazis to take over the government in order to avoid bloodshed

Meanwhile Austrian President Wilhelm Miklas refused to appoint Sey Inquart as Chancellor and asked other Austrian politicians instead However the Nazis were well organised Within hours they managed to take control of many parts of Vienna including the Ministry of Internal Affairs As Miklas continued to refuse to appoint a Nazi government and Seyss Inquart still could not send a telegram in the name of the Austrian government demanding German troops to restore order Hitler became furious At about 10 PM well after Hitler had signed and issued the order for the invasion Gring and Hitler gave up on waiting and sent a forged telegram pretending to be a request by the Austrian Government for German troops to enter Austria Around midnight after nearly all critical offices and buildings had fallen into Nazi hands in Vienna and the main political party members of the old government had been arrested Miklas finally appointed Seyss Inquart Chancellor

On the morning of 12 March the 8th Army of the German Wehrmacht crossed the German Austrian border They were not stopped by the Austrian Army Instead the German troops were greeted by cheering Austrians with Hitler salute Nazi flags and flowers

This is why the move into Austria without one single shot being fired is sometimes called the Blumenkrieg

Hitlers car crossed the border in the afternoon at Braunau his birthplace In the evening he arrived at Linz and was welcomed at the city hall Goering in a telephone call that evening said There is unbelievable jubilation in Austria We ourselves did not think that sympathies would be so intense

On 2 April 1938 200000 Austrians gathered on the Heldenplatz to hear Hitler proclaim the Austrian Anschluss Hitler later commented Certain foreign newspapers have said that we fell on Austria with brutal methods I can only say even in death they cannot stop lying I have in the course of my political struggle won much love from my people but when I crossed the former frontier there met me such a stream of love as I have never experienced Not as tyrants have we come but as liberators

The Anschluss was given immediate effect by a law on 13 March subject to ratification by a plebiscite Austria became the province of Ostmark and Seyss Inquart was appointed Governor The plebiscite was held on 10 April and officially recorded a support of 9973 of the voters

Most historians agree that the result was not fixed but the voting process was neither free nor secret Officials were present directly beside the voting booths and received the voting ballot by hand In some parts of Austria the referendum on the independence of Austria on 13 March was held despite the Wehrmachts presence in Austria For instance in the village of Innervillgraten a majority of 95 voted for Austrias independence

Austria remained part of the Third Reich until the end of World War II when a preliminary Austrian Government declared the Anschluss null und nichtig on April 27 1945 After the war then allied occupied Austria was recognized and treated as a separate country but was not restored to sovereignty until the Austrian State Treaty and Austrian Declaration of Neutrality both of 1955 largely due to the rapid development of the Cold War and disputes between the Soviet Union and its former allies over its foreign policy

Nestorianism is a movement within Christianity The idea behind the doctrine was that there were two different persons of Jesus One of them was the man Jesus the other was the aspect of son of God or Logos Perhaps the most prominent supporter of the idea was Nestorius archbishop of Constantinople Nestorius lived from about 380 to about 450 AD The Council of Ephesus condemned this view in 431 This led to a split of the church into the Assyrian Church of the East and the Byzantine Church 

For this reason the Assyrian Church of the East is sometimes called Nestorian The church holds the view that Chist has two essences that are united in one person 

The only two churches that teach Nestorianism today are the Assyrian Church of the East and the Church of the East Abroad

In Japan Daikokuten is one of the Seven Lucky Gods Daikokuten came from the Indian god Shiva Daikoku wears Japanese robes and has a happy and smiling personality

Daikokus pictures are found in the temples of Tibet and China and the god enjoys an high position as a household god in Japan Daikokus connection with wealth and success started a strange ritual known as Fuku nusubi This ritual started with the belief that the person who stole figures of gods and goddesses was promised good luck if they were not caught while stealing Eventually stealing divine figures became so common that the Toshi no ichi or the year end market held in the Asakusa Kannon temple became the main place where the sale of these images was held

A seesaw is a long narrow board which is fixed in the middle a little way above the ground When one end of the seesaw goes up the other goes down

Children often like to play on seesaws Two children sit on the seesaw one at each end The child who is down pushes the ground with his feet so that he goes up and his friend goes down Then the friend pushes up so the first child goes down They continue to go back and forth until they are ready to stop playing on the seesaw

It works best with two children who are about the same size or else the heavy person will make his end stay down On some seesaws there is room for two or three children on each end There is a handle for each child to hold on to so that they do not fall off

In mechanics anything that is balanced in the middle and goes up and down like a seesaw might be described as something that seesaws 

A swing is a hanging seat usually found in a playground for children Acrobats in a circus can also have swings which hang from the top of the tent Sometimes garden chairs are made to swing gently 

The seat of a swing is attached to a chain or a rope The child sits on the swing and kicks off from the ground with his feet The swing then starts to swing to and fro The child can make the swing go higher by pulling and pushing the rope and by making his legs straight as it goes up

In childrens playgrounds some swings are made for very young children They have safety bars with holes for the legs Their parents can push them to help the swing

Usually the ground is made of a soft material so that they do not hurt themselves too much if they fall off although this should not happen if they are being sensible Sometimes several swings are hung from one long metal or wooden frame

Many children have swings in their own gardens or back yards A tyre can be hung by a rope from the branch of a tree to make a swing

Swings are fun At the highest point on a swing the swinger is weightless The swingy may enjoy the feeling of being weightless or might become concerned about their weight

Playground slides are slides for children to play on in playgrounds The child climbs up a ladder or some stairs then sits down at the top and slides all the way down Some children like to slide down on their backs or on their stomachs This can sometimes be dangerous on big slides

Slides are made of metal or wood They must have a smooth surface so that the child does not hurt himself Sometimes in amusement parks there are giant slides called helterskelters

There are slides at swimming pools where people can slide down into the water with a splash These are called water slides or shutes

Antipsychotic drugs or Neuroleptics are drugs that act on the central nervous system and that usually have sedating properties The name neuroleptic was introduced in 1955 from the 1990s the term antipsychotic is used more frequently Neuroleptics make the patient calm Today they are mostly used for the treatment of psychosis as it occurs in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder They can also be used to treat depression and mood swings Very storng antipsychotics can be combined with an opioid to produce a special analgesic the patient will be conscious but heavily sedated and feel very little pain 

The main inventor of this drug was Andrew J Smith whom at the time was 16 when he made it He created this drug that has saved hundreds of people with schizophrenia

There are four races in the Eve universe that are playable by subscribers there is a fifth race but only Eve Online employees can get them

Amarr

The Amarr is a race centered around religion They were the first of the four races to develop ships capable of travelling space Their main weapon type is a laser which fire high energy beams to the enemy to deal damage They do not use ammunition like the other races but instead use a type of ammunition called a crystal in order to focus the laser The two subgroups of lasers are Beam and Pulse

Caldari

The Caldari is a race centered around corporations They are a very military driven race and specialize in both missiles and hybrid turrets railguns in particular and can shoot further than other races

 490 Veritas

490 Veritas is a big asteroid which may have been involved in one of the more huge asteroid asteroid collisions of the past 100 million years

At 115 and 125 km in diameter Veritas and 92 Undina are the biggest of the 300 strong Veritas family of asteroids David Nesvorn of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder traced the orbits of these bodies back in time and calculated that they formed in a collision of a body at least 150 km in diameter with a smaller asteroid some 8 million years ago Veritas and Undina would have been the biggest pieces of that collision

The thought Veritas collision would have been too far from Jupiter for the pieces to have been slung into a collision course with Earth However solar radiation would have caused the resulting dust to drift inward to Earth orbit over a time span consistent with the record of dust in the ocean sediment

Today continuing collisions among Veritas family asteroids are estimated to send five thousand tons of cosmic dust to Earth each year 15 of the total

He introduced measures to combat terror and when a widespread strike took place in Amsterdam Arnhem and Hilversum in May 1943 special summary court martial were used and a collective fine of 18 million guilders was imposed Sey Inquart allowed the execution of around 800 people before liberation Some people say it was not 800 people but over 1500 including the execution of people under the so called Hostage Law the death of political prisoners who were close to being liberated the Putten incident and the reprisal execution of 117 Dutchmen for the attack on SS and Police Leader Hanns Albin Rauter From July 1944 most of Sey Inquarts powers were transferred to the military commander in the Netherlands and the Gestapo but he was still an important and powerful person

There were 2 small concentration camps in the Netherlands

There was also a Jewish assembly camp at Westerbork and a number of other camps controlled by the military the police the SS or Sey Inquarts administration These included a voluntary labour recruitment camp at Ommen In total around 530000 Dutch civilians worked for the Germans of whom 250000 were sent to factories in Germany

Seyss Inquart was an anti Semite within a few months of his arrival in the Netherlands he sacked Jews from government the press and leading positions in industry Anti Jewish measures got stronger after 1941 approximately 140000 Jews were registered a ghetto was created in Amsterdam and a transit camp was set up at Westerbork In February 1941 600 Jews were sent to the Buchenwald and Mauthausen concentration camps Later the Dutch Jews were sent to Auschwitz As Allied forces approached in September 1944 the remaining Jews at Westerbork were sent to Theresienstadt Of 140000 registered Dutch Jews only 44500 survived the war

When Hitler committed suicide in April 1945 Sey Inquart became the Foreign Minister in Admiral Karl Dnitzs new German government

The Nazi regime had tried a scorched earth policy and some docks and harbours were destroyed Sey Inquart agreed with Armaments Minister Albert Speer that destroying everything to stop things being used by the allies or a new government after the war was wrong Sey Inquart also helped in the so called hunger winter of 1945 to distribute food and allowed Allied airplanes to drop Swedish white bread for the hungry people of the occupied north of the country He remained Reichskommissar until 8 May 1945 when after a meeting with Karl Dnitz to confirm his blocking of the scorched earth orders he was captured in Hamburg

At the Nuremberg Trials Sey Inquart faced charges of conspiracy to commit crimes against peace planning starting and fighting wars of aggression war crimes and crimes against humanity

His defence lawyer was Gustav Steinbauer Sey Inquart was nonetheless found guilty of all charges except conspiracy On hearing of his death sentence Seyss Inquart made it clear he accepted responsibility for excesses during the war Death by hangingwell in view of the whole situation I never expected anything different Its all right He was hanged on 16 October 1946 at the age of 54 together with nine other Nuremberg defendants His last words were I hope that this execution is the last act of the tragedy of the Second World War and that the lesson taken from this world war will be that peace and understanding should exist between peoples I believe in Germany

Ancient Athens is the name for the city of Athens in about the 5th century BC It was one of the most powerful cities in ancient times It was important because they made a good democracy

From 900 BC till 600 BC kings and nobles ruled Athens Nobles seized lots of land since farmers who could not pay their debts could have their land taken from them Slaves were treated cruelly

However when Solon became ruler about 594 years before Jesus was born he made many reforms with the help of the Council He made a supreme court He canceled farmers debts and limited the amount of land that could be owned by nobles Merchants began using coins The people who did not work were punished All free men could be citizens even though the lower class could not vote

Shortly after the reforms of Solon the Age of Tyrants began Instead of many people ruling one man took all the power This is called dictatorship When Cleisthenes a noble became powerful he stopped dictatorship and gave rights to all free men Cleisthenes was called the father of Athenian democracy Ten committees were given the right to declare war collect money and see if the people with power were honest They could secretly stop anyone who did not do his duty or seemed to be taking too much power So direct democracy was begun

In 477 BC Athens began the Delian League to join the city states for protection The leagues money was kept in the temple of Apollo However people soon began to disagree The other states said that Athens was becoming a tyrant No one was powerful enough to stop Athens so Athens ruled Pericles was when Athens was strongest and this time was called the Golden Age of Greece

When King Xerxes of Persia fought in Asia Minor Athens helped the people of Asia Minor In time the Persians attacked the Greeks Because of this a war began

On the plain of Marathon many Persians with bows and arrows fought the Greeks Even though there were many more Persians than Greeks the Greeks won because they had spears and swords of metal

Themistocles a statesman of Athens warned the Athenians that the Persians would return so they should make their navy bigger The people did so and Sparta offered to help The Persians arrived and attacked the Greeks both on land and on sea However because of a Greek traitor the Persians won

Although the city of Athens was burnt down before the Persians left most of the people had run away to the nearby islands for safety Themistocles ordered the Greeks to prepare for another attack This time he told them to leave their ships in the Bay of Salamis About 480 years before Jesus was born the Persians arrived but they were surprised and confused by the harbor that was so full of ships they could not travel in it This time a few hundred Greek ships destroyed many many Persian ships Xerxes went away

The next year another battle happened which 32000 Greek hoplites and 50000 other soldiers won The Persians did not attack Greece again

Even though Sparta and Athens helped each other in battle they were very different culturally In 431 to 404 BC these two city states fought in a conflict called the Peloponnesian War after the name of the lower part of the peninsula Sparta had help from other states Athens kept inside the city walls but many people died because of a terrible sickness including Pericles

Athens navy was taken by Spartans who had been trained severely since they were children In 404 BC Athens surrendered to Sparta

For 30 years Sparta ruled but many people did not like Spartan government and Thebes another city state helped Athens defeat Sparta For nine years Thebes was the most powerful state

However Greece was much weaker because of the wars inside her country Philip of Macedonia began to move into Greek territory Although Demosthenes warned Athens of the danger Athenians did not care At Chaeronea Philip of Macedonia controlled Greece

When Philip died his son Alexander the Great even though he was only 30 years went out to capture the world He won Asia Minor Persia Egpyt and some parts of India but he died when he was 33 because of a fever

The people in Athens ate simply usually barley cakes onions fish and fruit For clothes the men wore short pieces of cloth aprons and sandals for work A woman wore a chiton which was a long loose cloth that was attached to the shoulder The loose garment was like a blouse because of a rope worn around the waist Sandals were made by putting the foot on a piece of skin while the shoemaker made a covering for the foot

Children liked to have pet rabbits and to play ball games For fun they also raced little chariots pulled by dogs They were taught by slaves and learned poetry music and dancing Exercise was also important

When a young man became 18 he began two years of training for the army After that he could join in the mens classes where broken wikt linkjavelinjavelin throwing was done For protection in wrestling he tied leather strips around his wrists He also cut his hair Teachers from many lands taught the young men

The Greek hoplites fought so close together that their shields overlapped with each other Their spears were very long

Women in ancient Athens were treated with little respect They could not become citizens of Athens because the men thought they were not important enough This means they could not vote and did not have any say in what happened in Athens and they could not run for election

Girls could not be citizens They left their home at the age of 15 to get married sometimes with a man who was much older than she was Her marriage would be arranged by her father On most occasions the father would pick a rich husband for his daughter and for most girls marriage was just living together The girl and her mother had no say in who she married it was entirely the fathers choice

Vairavaa or Vessavaa is the name of the chief of the Four Heavenly Kings and an important person in Buddhism 

The name Vairavaa comes from the Sanskrit viravaa which means Great Fame

Vairavaa is also known as Kubera in Sanskrit or Kuvera in Pli 

The character of Vairavaa is set up on the Hindu god Kubera but although the Buddhist and Hindu deities share some characteristics both of them have different functions and myths 

He is often shown with a yellow face He carries an umbrella as a sign of his power He is also sometimes shown with a mongoose often shown spitting out jewels The mongoose is the enemy of the snake which is a symbol of greed or hatred the spitting out of jewels shows generosity

In the Pli writings of the Theravda Buddhist tradition Vairavaa is called Vessavaa Vessavaa is one of the Four Great Kings each one of which rules over a direction Vessavaas direction is the northern quarter of the world

Vessavaa has the name Kuvera from a name he had from a past life as a rich mill owner who gave all the money he got from one of his seven mills to charity and gave aid to the poor for 20000 years 

As with all the Buddhist deities Vessavaa is properly the name of a person who has the god inside him rather than a permanent individual Each Vessavaa is a human and when he dies he will be replaced by a new Vessavaa Like other beings of the Ctummahrjika world his lifespan is 90000 years but other sources say nine million years

When the Buddha was born Vessavaa became his follower He often brought the Buddha and his followers messages from the gods and other humans and protected them

The members of Fugazi did not use illegal drugs drink alcohol or have casual sex This was called being straight edge The term straight edge was invented by Minor Threat MacKayes previous band

There are two ways to measure GDP of different countries and compare them One way called GDP at exchange rate is when the currencies of all countries are converted into USD The second way is GDP or GDP at Purchasing Power Parity

Purchasing Power Parity is measured by finding the values of a basket of consumer goods that are present in each country If that basket costs 100 in the US and 200 in England than purchasing power parity exchange rate is 12 

What sets GDP apart from other economic indicators such as GDP per capita nominal GDP and real GDP is that GDP takes the costs of living into account This explains why GDP is used to measure the quality of life in a country However when measuring a countrys economic power use GDP at exchange rate

For example suppose that Japan has a higher GDP per capita than the US That means that Japanese on average make 2 more than normal Americans However they are not necessarily richer Suppose that one gallon of orange juice costs 6 in Japan and only 2 in the US The Japanese can only buy 3 gallons while the Americans can buy 8 gallons Therefore in terms of orange juice the Americans are richer The US has a GDP of 14 while Japan has a GDP of 12 The GDP exchange rate is 1412 or 76

Now apply this to daily life The orange juice represents the previously mentioned basket of goods which represents the cost of living in a country Therefore even if a country has a higher GDP per capita that countrys people may still live poorer if the cost of living is more expensive

GDP per capita is the GDP of a country divided by its population It shows how much money people earn on average So basically GDP is the dollar value of all goods and services produced within a countrys borders in a given year then divided by the population in a given year

A domestic warren is a fake enclosed establishment of animal husbandry that is used for the raising of domestic rabbits for meat and fur 

There was a clear distinction between free warren and domestic warren But today that is nearly gone One even speaks of a prairie dog warren

A burrow is a hole or tunnel that was dug into the ground by an animal to create a space that can be used for living or short time shelter The burrowing way of life is quite popular among the animals Many animals construct or use burrows in many different types Mammals are perhaps most well known for burrowing especially Insectivora like the voracious mole and rodents like the fertile gopher and groundhog The rabbit a member of the family Lagomorpha is a well known burrower There are estimations that a single groundhog burrow occupies a full cubic meter displacing 320 kilograms of dirt Even Carnivora like the meerkat and Marsupials like the kangaroo mouse are burrowers

Burrows can be constructed into a wide variety of substrates Kangaroo mice construct burrows in fine sand Termites construct burrows in wood Some sea urchins and clams can burrow into rock Burrows can also range in complexity from a simple tube a few centimeters long to a complex network of interconnecting tunnels and chambers hundreds or thousands of meters in total length such as a well developed rabbit warren

A burrow is a hole made by an animal

Sogyal Rinpoche is a Tibetan Dzogchen Lama of the Nyingma tradition He has been teaching for over 30 years He travels widely in Europe America Australia and Asia 

He is the founder and spiritual leader of Rigpa which is an international network of over 100 Buddhist centres and groups in 23 countries around the world He is also the author of the best selling book The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying which has been printed in 30 languages and 56 countries 

Rinpoche often speaks at major conferences in all areas of society including medicine and healing universities and educational institutions interfaith dialogue movements for peace and non violence the world of business and leadership and the field of serving the dying and hospice care

Sogyal Rinpoche was born around 1950 in the region of Kham in Eastern Tibet Jamyang Khyentse Chkyi Lodr says that he is the reincarnation of Tertn Sogyal a teacher to the Thirteenth Dalai Lama Jamyang Khyentse raised him as a son and made sure he got good training 

When things got bad in Kham Khyentse Rinpoche and his young student went to Central Tibet and Lhasa In 1955 they met Tenzin Gyatso His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama They then went to India They settled in Gangtok at the invitation of the king of Sikkim 

Rinpoche went to Catholic School in Kalimpong Then he went to study at a university in Delhi before coming to the West In 1971 he was granted a place to study comparative religion at Trinity College Cambridge as a visiting scholar He continued to study with many masters of all schools of Tibetan Buddhism especially His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche and His Holiness Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche

Rinpoche soon began teaching in Paris He often translated for His Holiness Dudjom Rinpoche He also went with Dudjom Rinpoche to the United States in 1976 

In the summer of 1977 he started a centre in London which he called Dzogchen Orgyen Chling Many great masters taught there Dudjom Rinpoche His Holiness Sakya Trizin Gyalwang Karmapa Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche and others

In 1979 Sogyal Rinpoche chose the name Rigpa for his work It means the innermost essential nature of mind

In 1994 a 10 million civil lawsuit was filed against Sogyal Rinpoche It was alleged that over a period of many years Rinpoche had used his position as a spiritual leader to induce some of his female students to have coitus with him The complaint included counts of intentional infliction of emotional distress breach of fiduciary duty as well as assault and battery In December 1995 the issue was settled out of court through mediation  

In the wake of the ensuing publicity women who had previously remained silent began to talk about their experiences with Rinpoche As one student pointed out in a report filed by Mick Brown

  Sogyal Rinpoches need for a partner is not in question Rather the issue concerns the inappropriateness of sexual relationships with his students In the West it is not considered ethical to engage in sex within the confines of a pastoral or teacher student relationship where there are clear power imbalances    

In 1995 a young English woman attended one of Sogyal Rinpoches residential retreats and was led to believe she had been singled out for special attention only to discover that she was being invited to join a harem At first I was flattered and very open and trusting He encouraged me to fall in love with him  but I realised he was toying with me I noticed several other young pretty women going in and out of his apartment when I confronted him with this he dropped me and ignored me for the rest of the time I was there

Supporters have argued that lamas of the Nyingma school are not required to take vows of celibacy and indeed Sogyal Rinpoche does not claim to be a celibate monk The central role model of the Nyingma school its founder Padmasambhava had five principal tantric consorts who were also his students While there is a precept against sexual misconduct in Buddhism with respect to a non monastic lama this precept is rather limited in scope and would apply only if the female is not free but rather under the protection of her father mother husband king or herself bound by a vow of celibacy Nevertheless amongst those who complained about Sogyals sexual misdemeanours were relatively new converts to the faith who were therefore unlikely to possess sufficient Buddhist experience to be labelled qualified consorts According to Buddhist principles engaging in union with an unqualified partner results in rebirth in hell Present social mores also deem sexual relations between teachers and students to be abusive because of the imbalance of power present in the relationship Thus while not violating basic Buddhist moral principles tantric principles were violated and social mores breached

Soma is a drink used in ancient India in the culture It is written of in the Vedas in which there are many hymns praising it

Left Hand Path is a term used in occultism for one kind of spiritual path It is the opposite of the Right Hand Path which is what most people think of when they think of religion or spirituality 

The use of this term in occultism came from a term used in Hindu Tantra Vama marga in Sanskrit This ancient form of tantra used the breaking of rules as part of the practice Rules about diet and sex were broken on purpose For example rules against eating meat and drinking alcohol might be broken Such a practice might require eating meat and drinking alcohol while having sex in a graveyard or cremation ground

People who follow the Left Hand Path in the West are not interested in giving up pleasure or the world in order to be spiritual They are not interested in worshiping God or following rules made up by others They seek to gain power and freedom by breaking through taboos fears and restrictions

Many people link this term with Satanism and black magic but they are not the same The Left Hand Path is sometimes described as amoral

John Dee was a noted English mathematician astronomer astrologer geographer occultist and consultant to Queen Elizabeth I He also studied to alchemy divination and Hermetic philosophy

Dee lived during a time when people were just learning the difference between science and magic He was one of the most learned men of his time He lectured to crowded halls at the University of Paris when still in his early twenties Dee was an expert in mathematics astronomy and navigation He trained many of those who would go on voyages of discovery for England In fact he coined the term British Empire

At the same time he was very interested in magic and Hermetic philosophy He spent the last third of his life studying mostly these subjects During his time these subjects were not thought to be opposed to science They were thought to be part of science

He wrote Monas Hieroglyphica in 1564 He also wrote the preface to the first English translation of Euclids works

Dee was born in London in a Welsh family The last name Dee cames from the Welsh word du meaning black He graduated from St Johns College Cambridge when he was eighteen He was a founding fellow of Trinity College He lectured briefly at Cambridge Then he left England to study in continental Europe and lecture in Paris and Louvain He returned to England in the 1540s

In 1555 he was arrested and charged with practicing black magic for having cast horoscopes of Queen Mary and Princess Elizabeth the charges were expanded to treason against Mary Dee appeared in the Star Chamber and cleared himself When he was released he became a scientific advisor to Elizabeth I even deciding on the best date for her to be crowned in 1558

He traveled Europe with money from Elizabeth I He was possibly acting as a spy for her He became a close associate of many Elizabethan explorers and entrepreneurs such as Sir Humphrey Gilbert

In 1564 Dee wrote the Hermetic work Monas Hieroglyphica about a symbol of his own design which stood for the mystical unity of all creation This work was highly valued by many people of Dees time However there was a secret about it which has been lost This makes the book hard to understand today

He published a Mathematical Preface to Henry Billingsleys English translation of Euclids Elements in 1570 He wrote about how important mathematics was for the other arts and sciences Because this book was written for the public it was Dees most popular work

Dee was not satisfied with his knowledge In the early 1580s he started to use supernatural ways to get more knowledge He wanted to get knowledge from the angels

He met Edward Kelly in 1582 and Kelly became his companion Kelly was a convicted forger Kelly helped Dee to get visions from angels using a crystal ball The angels gave them a language called Enochian and dictated several books through Kelly Dees crystal ball ended up in the British Museum It went unnoticed for many years in the mineral collection Most of the still existing papers of Dee are also in the British Museum

In 1583 while Dee was away in Europe his home and library at Mortlake were destroyed by a mob Later Dee came to believe that many of his books had been stolen by former friends and associates He asked Queen Elizabeth for help She made him Warden of Christs College Manchester in 1592 He remained in this position until 1604

When Elizabeth I died in 1603 so did Dees influence he was forced to retire to his home at Mortlake where he died in poverty

About ten years after his death the antiquarian Robert Cotton found some of Dee writings mostly records of Dees communications with angels Cottons son gave these writings to the scholar Mric Casaubon who published them in 1659 as A True Faithful Relation of What passed for many Yeers between Dr John Dee and some spirits

This was the public had heard about Dees spiritual conferences The book was extremely popular and sold quickly Because Casaubon wrote in his introduction that Dee was really dealing with evil spirits when he believed he was communicating with angels Dee was thought of as deluded for some time

Dee was married three times and had eight children His eldest son was Arthur Dee He was also an alchemist and Hermetic writer

Burrow is a hill in Shropshire with an Iron Age hill fort at the top that is known as Burrow Camp The nearest villages are Hopesay and Aston on Clun It was possibly very important during the Iron Age as it has two natural springs



A Marilyn is a mountain or hill in the British Isles with a relative height of at least 150 metres The name was coined as an ironic contrast to the designation Munro that is used of a Scottish mountain with a height of more than 3000 feet which is homophonous with Monroe

There are currently 1554 Marilyns identified in Great Britain and surrounding islands 1214 in Scotland 179 in England 156 in Wales and 5 on the Isle of Man 

Many of the largest hills are Marilyns including Ben Nevis Scafell Pike and Snowdon On the other hand many large hills including some Munros and other well known hills are not Marilyns because they do not meet the relative height criterion 

A Munro is a Scottish mountain with a height over 3000 feet They are named after Sir Hugh Munro who produced the first attempt at a catalogue of such hills known as Munros Tables in 1891

Munro did not set any measure of relative height by which a peak qualified as a separate mountain and much debate has since taken place over how distinct two hills must be if they are to be considered as two separate Munros

Despite their modest height walking and climbing in the Scottish mountains may be made dangerous by their latitude and exposure to Atlantic weather systems Even in summer conditions can be very bad thick fog strong winds driving rain and freezing summit temperatures are not unusual Winter broken wikt linkascentascents of certain Munros are widely accepted to provide among the most challenging ice climbs in Europe Some walkers are unprepared for the often extreme weather conditions on the exposed tops and many fatalities are recorded every year often resulting from slips on wet rock or ice

In topography prominence also known as autonomous height relative height or shoulder drop or prime factor is a concept that is used in the categorization of hills and mountains also known as peaks It is a measure of the independent stature of a summit 

The prominence of a peak is the height of the peaks summit above the lowest contour line encircling it and no higher summit

A Jamaica coalition was the name given to a possible broken wikt linkcoalitioncoalition government of Germany

The Theremin mn is one of the first fully electronic musical instruments It was invented by Russian inventor Lon Theremin in October 1920 after the outbreak of the Russian civil war Its invention grew out of a search for ways to detect movement It was the first musical instrument to be played without being touched The control section has two metal antennae to sense the positions of the players hands One hand controls the pitch The other hand controls the volume To play the theremin the player moves his hands around the two metal antennas The electric signals from the theremin are amplified and sent to a loudspeaker

The sound of the theremin is associated with alien surreal and eerie sounding portamento glissando tremolo and vibrato sounds It has been used in film soundtracks such as Spellbound The Lost Weekend Ed Wood Mars Attacks and The Day the Earth Stood Still The theremin was a key feature of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop which produced the theme music for Doctor Who and other BBCtv programs Theremins are also used in art music and in popular music genres such as rock and pop The Russian Dmitri Shostakovich was one of the first to include parts for the theremin in orchestral pieces including a use in his score for the 1931 film Odna 

The terpsitone was an electronic musical instrument invented by Lon Theremin It consisted of a platform fitted with antennas through and around which a dancer would control the musical performance By most accounts the instrument was nearly impossible to play

Theremin was interested in a role for the theremin in dance music He developed performance locations that could automatically react to dancers movements with varied patterns of sound and light He worked with the American Negro Ballet After the Soviet consulate had apparently demanded he divorce Katia the inventor fell in love with and married the young prima ballerina Lavinia Williams His marriage to the African American dancer caused shock and disapproval in his social circles but the couple remained together

Theremin abruptly returned to the Soviet Union in 1938 At the time the reasons for his return were not clear Some claimed that he was simply homesick while others believed that he had been kidnapped by Soviet officials Beryl Campbell one of Theremins dancers said his wife Lavinia called to say that he had been kidnapped from his studio and that some Russians had come in and that she felt that he was going to be spirited out of the country

Theremin was put to work in a secret research and development laboratories in the Soviet Gulag labor camp system Theremin created the Buran eavesdropping system which recorded conversations in French and American embassies by measuring the window glass vibrations using a low power infrared beam from a distance Lavrentiy Beria head of the KGB then used Buran to spy on US British and French embassies

In 1945 Theremin invented the first covert listening device for spying Theremins device was embedded in a carved wooden plaque of the Great Seal of the United States On August 4 1945 Soviet school children presented the bugged carving to US Ambassador Averell Harriman as a gesture of friendship to the USSRs World War II ally It hung in the ambassadors Moscow office until 1952 when the bug was discovered by a British radio operator who heard conversations on an open radio channel The CIA found the device in the Great Seal carving Peter Wright a scientist and former MI5 counterintelligence officer eventually figured out how it worked

After his release from the labor camp in 1947 Theremin volunteered to remain working with the KGB until 1966 By 1947 Theremin had remarried to Maria and they had two children Lena and Natalia

After working for the KGB Theremin worked at the Moscow Conservatory of Music for 10 years where he taught and built Theremins electronic cellos and some Terpsitones There he was discovered by a visiting New York Times correspondent but when an article by Christopher Walker appeared according to Lydia the Vice President of the conservatory said The people dont need electronic music Electricity is for killing traitors in the electric chair fired Theremin closed his laboratory and had his instruments destroyed

After 51 years in the Soviet Union Lon Theremin started travelling first visiting France in June 1989 and then the United States in 1991 each time accompanied by his daughter Natalia where he was reunited with Clara Rockmore who performed a number of concerts at this time He also made a demonstration concert at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague in early 1993 before dying in Moscow in 1993 at the age of 97

Lon Theremin is the subject of the documentary film Theremin An Electronic Odyssey written directed and produced by Steven M Martin The documentary was a winner at the Sundance Film Festival in 1994 The film features legendary thereminists Clara Rockmore and Lydia Kavina as well as electronic instrument pioneer Robert Moog Nicolas Slonimsky The Beach Boys founder Brian Wilson and Theremin himself

The judiciary that is the judges and Courts of Germany are independent The are not controlled by the Federal Government or the State Governments There are laws which say what sort of cases the courts can hear and pass judgment on and what type of punishment a court can give But no law or minister can say that a person is guilty Only the courts can do this

Courts give protection to ordinary people from bad governments they are also protected from bad governments themselves

Germany has had free courts for longer than it has been a democracy although under the Nazis many judges ignored the law and did what the Nazi Party wanted This is why they were tried at the Nuremberg Judges Trial

Germany is a Rechtsstaat That means it is a government based on law All citizens are guaranteed to be equal and government decisions can be challenged in court

No law or minister can say that a person or group of people is guilty

Federal law sets out the structure of the judiciary Running courts is up to the Lnder The Lnder are run the lower levels of the court system only the highest courts are paid for by the federal government

This federal Land split means that the Federation can make sure laws are enforced equally throughout the country because it says what courts must be set up The Lnder administer the courts and this stops the federal government from being able to order the courts to do things or to appoint the judges This helps keep the courts independent

Germany has a system of Roman law This is different from the United States and England which use the common law

In a common law system courts rely on precedents In Germany courts look to a comprehensive system of legal codes The codes set out legal principles or basic ideas and have to decide each case by comparing the facts of the case to those principles not to what another judges decided earlier

Because the legal codes are very important and complicated judges must be very well trained

Judges are not chosen from practising lawyers as in the UK and USA Instead being a judge is a separate career

At the end of their legal education at university all law students must pass a state examination before they can continue on to an apprenticeship that provides them with broad training in the legal profession over two years They then must pass a second state examination that qualifies them to practice law After the second exam a person must choose either to be a lawyer or to be a judge

Those who choose to be a judge start working at courts immediately However they are on probation for up to four years before being appointed as judges for lifetime

Germany has three types of courts

The are four levels of ordinary courts

Most cases in the local courts are decided by a single judge However in criminal cases in which the sentence is expected to exceed two years the professional judge is assisted by two part time judges with equal rights as the professional judge There are 687 Amtsgerichte

These courts have two sections One for major civil cases and the other for criminal cases The regional courts have three judges for complicated cases but most cases are heard by one judge

Specialized courts deal with administrative labour social fiscal and patent law

The is a Federal Patents Court in Munich adjudicates disputes relating to industrial property rights Patents are a federal issue so now state courts have been set up

Each Land has a state constitutional court These courts are administratively and financially independent from any other government body For instance a Land constitutional court can write its own budget and hire or fire employees

These courts here cases where the constitution and the rights it gives are in question

For example a criminal case might be appealled from the Bundesgerichtshof if a persons human rights are involved

The Federal Constitutional Court the Bundesverfassungsgericht can check that the way other courts look at the law to make sure they do not forget these basic rights Sometimes the Federal Constitutional Court has overturned the decisions of other federal courts

The Bundesverfassungsgericht protects peoples rights under the constitution in another way It is the only court that can ban a political party if it is acting or says it will act against the constitution

The Flag of Denmark the Dannebrog is red with a white Scandinavian cross It is the oldest flag in the entire world

The flag is supposed to have fallen from the sky during a battle in 1219 in Estonia The Danes were about to loose the battle when this sign from above gave the warriors new energy and made them win 

In reality the Dannebrog of 1219 was most likely a crusade banner  the war in 1219 was a crusade against the Estonians who were not Christians 

The battle took place in the 15th of June and every year the flags birthday is celebrated in this day 

In some countries the flag is a symbol of the state In Denmark the Dannebrog is very much a symbol of the people and the flag is used for all kinds off private celebrations  such as birthdays weddings and christmas For Danes the Dannebrog is a sign of happiness and celebration and not of patriotism

The coat of arms of Denmark consists of three crowned blue lions with nine red hearts all in a golden shield

The seal of King Canute VI of Denmark is the oldest known example of the coat of arms of Denmark It is from around 1190 

Until around 1960 Denmark also had a large coat of arms Both were used by the government In 1959 the large coat of arms changed status and became the royal coat of arms  that is a coat of arms for the king and the royal family The large coat of arms is inspired by one which was designed in 1819 and adopted by king Frederik VI 

The large coat of arms comprise symbols representing all parts of the Danish kingdom  or to be precise only territories that are still part of the Kingdom of Denmark In the coat of arms shown to the left the upper left part of the shield represents Denmark In the lower part the three crowns represents Sweden this is for historic reasons The polar bear represents Greenland and the ram represents the Faroe Islands The two lions in the upper right side represents the principality of Slesvig Until 1972 it also included other symbols representing principalities in Germany and parts of present day Sweden that used to be ruled by the Danish king 

In 1972 when King Frederik IX died and Margrethe II became queen the coat of arms of the royal family was redesigned and today it only comprises symbols representing the current parts of the Danish Kingdom

Jacob Obrecht was a composer from the south Netherlands He was one of the greatest composers of his time He is best known for his church music including many masses as well as motets and songs

Obrechts father was a trumpeter His mother died when he was about 2 years old and his father remarried We know nothing about Obrechts musical education He may have learned to play the trumpet like his father who worked for the Burgundian court Perhaps his father introduced him to people at the court such as the famous composer Antoine Busnois He certainly must have known Busnois music

From 1480 1484 he was a choirmaster at Bergen op Zoom Then he got a very good job as choirmaster at Cambrai Cathedral However a year later he took another job in Bruges He wrote a lot of church music during his years in Bruges He travelled to Italy and went to the town of Ferrara where a lot of famous musicians worked He stayed there for several months This may have been the reason why he then lost his job in Bruges His next job was in Antwerp where he worked from 1492 to 1498 He then got his old job back in Bruges From 1501 to 1503 he once again worked at Antwerp where he was choirmaster at the church of Our Lady In 1504 he got the job of maestro di cappella at Ferrara but the following year he died of the plague

Obrecht composed extremely quickly He is supposed to have written one of his masses in one night This was different to Josquin des Prez who spent a long time composing his pieces and making changes to them before he let anyone have copies Obrecht was influenced by the music of Busnois and Ockeghem Obrecht himself was a big influence on Josquin even though Josquin was older than Obrecht

In recent years musicologists have studied Obrechts music a lot and made many discoveries including the correct dates for many of his works

Antoine Busnois was a French composer and poet of the early Renaissance Burgundian School He wrote church music such as motets as well as broken wikt linksecularsecular chansons He was the most important composer of the late Burgundian school after the death of Guillaume Dufay

We do not know where Busnois was born It might have been in the tiny village of Busnes in the Artois district  Maybe he took his name from the village

Nothing is known about his musical education We know that he got into trouble in 1461 because he was said to be in a group of people who beat up a priest on five occasions At that time he was a chaplain in Tours cathedral While the attack was being investigated he went to mass This led to him being excommunicated but later the pope pardoned him

In 1465 he moved from the cathedral to the collegiate church of St Martin also in Tours where he became a subdeacon Johannes Ockeghem was treasurer there and the two composers seem to have known each other well Later in 1465 Busnois moved to Poitiers where he not only became matrise but managed to get lots of good singers from the region By this time he was famous as a singing teacher and composer However he left the job for some reason in 1466 and then moved to Burgundy

By 1467 Busnois was a composer at the court of Burgundy Soon Charles the Bold was on the throne Charles fought many wars and sometimes took Busnois and other musicians on his military journeys In 1477 Charles was killed at the Battle of Nancy Busnois continued to work for the Burgundian court until 1482 Nothing is known about what he did after that He died in 1492

He was very well known as a composer and his music was sung in many parts of Europe He was the probably the best known musician in Europe between the time of Guillaume Dufay and Johannes Ockeghem 

Busnois wrote broken wikt linksacredsacred and broken wikt linksecularsecular music It is likely that a lot of his music is now lost Two of his masses and eight motets have survived The style of his music is somewhere between the simple homophonic music of Dufay and Binchois and the more elaborate imitation of Josquin

Busnois may have been the composer of the famous tune Lhomme arm one of the most popular tunes of the Renaissance The tune was often used as a cantus firmus for mass composition He may have been the very first composer to write a mass based on Lhomme arm This mass was a big influence on many composers

Busnois is remembered today for many of his chansons Some of the tunes were used by later composers in their masses

Robosexuality is where a person is sexually attracted to machines such as robots The word robosexuality comes from combining the words robot and sexual

A robosexual can be heterosexual homosexual bisexual or pansexual This is because the robot may have sexual features Many robots in the world do not show male or female qualities so a pansexual robosexual would feel attracted to these if the robot appeared human If a person is attracted to a robot that does not appear human it is called paraphilia

Roughly 50 of all the robots in the world are in Asia 32 in Europe and 16 in North America 1 in Australasia and 1 in Africa 

40 of all robots in the world are found in Japan 

In Japan and South Korea ideas of future robots have been mainly positive The number of robots in Japan means more people in Japan are likely to have a love of gadgets Manga and anime series in both countries often show love or sex between robots and humans This would mean more robosexuality

Japanese religious beliefs allow the idea that robots have souls This also make the idea of love between humans and robots more acceptable or ordinary

The idea of physical sexuality is less accepted in the west than in Japan Western societies are more likely to be against or even fear the development of robots This is because a lot of films and books show robots as replacing humans instead of helping them Also the religious beliefs in this area of the world show robots to be wrong because they are doing Gods part in creating which they say only God should do

RealDoll is a lifesize sex doll sold in America that can be sold with robotic implants People who feel sexually attracted or have sex with these are robosexual However one important thing to notice is that this American machine does not move and think by itself unlike their Japanese and South Korean counterparts

Moulin Rouge was mostly shot at Fox Studios in Sydney Australia It was nominated for eight Oscars It won two for art direction and costume design In 2006 it was ranked 25 on the American Film Institutes list of best musicals

The Moulin Rouge is a famous nightclub with a cabaret The name Moulin Rouge means Red Windmill In the late 1800s there was a real windmill where the nightclub stands near Montmartre in Paris Now there is a large model of a windmill on the roof of the building Since the 1889 this nightclub has been famous for its dancing in particular for the can can a very lively dance in which the dancers wearing long frilly skirts kick their legs very high and show their underwear Even though this entertainment was not thought of as very polite it was very popular and the can can became a symbol of Paris The Moulin Rouge is still very popular

The word Bohemian was first used in Paris to mean a Gypsy because many people thought that Gypsies came from Bohemia The word was then used for poor artists and writers who often travelled to Paris from other towns and tried to earn money by their painting or writing Paris was a famous town for both painters and writers to gather to learn from each other and to enjoy the life of the city Many of them lived at Montmartre not far from the Moulin Rouge One of the most famous painters to live in Montmartre was Henri Toulouse Lautrec He loved to paint the can can dancers and prostitutes He did many posters to advertise the nightclubs The posters are now famous works of art

La bohme means the Bohemian It is the name of a famous opera written by Giacomo Puccini It is about a young man who lives in a group of poor artists and writers and who meets and falls in love with a beautiful girl The opera is very well known and Baz Luhrmann deliberately used parts of the story in his movie The plot of the movie is very much like another opera called La traviata written by Giuseppe Verdi It is also thought that Luhrmann may have got the idea to make Moulin Rouge after watching Dil Se This movie was made in 1998 and directed by Mani Ratnam It is a love story set in India

There have been four previous movies called Moulin Rouge The earliest was a silent movie made in 1928 The latest was made in 1956 and was about the life of the painter Toulouse Lautrec Baz Luhrmann used Toulouse Lautrec as an important character in his movie

Baz Luhrmann had directed another movie in which a love story is set against a background of dance costumes and colourful scenes This is Strictly Ballroom made in 1992 In Moulin Rouge he chose the colourful life of Paris in a time often called the Naughty Nineties as a background But Lurhmanns plan was not to make a movie about history He wanted to make a movie that the people of today would enjoy just as much as the people of Paris had enjoyed the can can in the 1890s So Luhrmann did not use the music dance styles and lighting of the 1890s He used popular modern music that young people already knew and he used modern lighting special effects and costume ideas to create a movie that young people would think was very entertaining

Kate Winslet Charlize Theron Renee Zellweger and Catherine Zeta Jones were all thought of for the part of Satine Courtney Love was almost cast in the role but lost out to Kidman at the last minute because Luhrmann felt that Love would not fit into the movie well Heath Ledger Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe were all considered for the part of Christian

Production on the movie began in November 1999 and was finished in May 2000 with a budget of just over 50 million Nicole Kidman reportedly wasnt interested in doing the musical until she heard Baz Luhrmann would be directing it Filming generally went smoothly with the only major problem being when Nicole Kidman injured her knee while filming one of the more complicated dance sequences The production also overran in its shooting schedule and had to be out of the Fox Studios in Sydney to make way for Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones This meant some parts had to be filmed in Madrid Spain

The movie is set in the year 1900 Christian is a British writer who came to the village of Montmartre in Paris in 1899 when the Bohemian movement was at its most popular He sits in a flat looking down on the closed down theatre called the Moulin Rouge while writing on a typewriter The story he is writing is about the woman he loved Satine

In 1899 Christian arrives in Paris and makes friends with a group of Bohemians who visit the Moulin Rouge regularly They are trying to produce a musical called Spectacular Spectacular which the owner of the Moulin Rouge Harold Zidler plans to show at the cabaret The Bohemians leader Toulouse Lautrec is pleased with Christians talent at writing and insists that he write their musical Spectacular Spectacular Once they find out that Christian is an amazing writer they come up with an complicated plan of presenting Christian to Satine who is a beautiful courtesan in the hopes that she will be impressed with him and persuade Zidler to hire Christian as the writer of the musical

Satine understands what her work involves although she hopes of leaving the Moulin Rouge to become a real actress Through a series of misunderstandings she mistakes Christian for the rich and powerful Duke who will invest in the musical Spectacular Spectacular She is enchanted by his poetry She declares that she has fallen in love with him but is shocked to realize hes actually a poor Bohemian poet 

After a bit the real Duke finds Christian and Satine together They manage to trick him into believing that they were working on the musical Spectacular Spectacular The main cast arrive and improvise the plot of the show on the spot a beautiful Indian courtesan has her kingdom invaded by an evil maharaja She sets out to seduce him to save her kingdom but accidentally seduces and then falls in love with a penniless sitar player The two must hide their love and avoid the maharaja though it is implied that one of them may die at the end of the story The Duke agrees to support the show But he quickly shows that he is a violently jealous man who will shut down the Moulin Rouge if he does not get Satine to himself Nevertheless he accepts that Satine will be busy with rehearsals and in close contact with Christian the writer of the musical

Christian and Satine fall in love while Zidler struggles to keep the Duke interested in the musical Spectacular Spectacular even though Satine has not yet slept with him Harold Zidler also discovers that Satine is dying of a disease called tuberculosis but does not tell anyone because of his motto The show must go on Meanwhile Christian continues to work on the play in which the courtesan and the penniless sitar player end up together The Duke however does not appreciate the ending and tells the cast that the courtesan must end up with the maharaja To convince the Duke to change his mind Satine finally agrees to spend the night with him Christian is overcome with jealousy while Satine has dinner with the Duke who offers her everything she has dreamt of However when Satine spots Christian on the street below she refuses the Dukes offer and he tries to rape her After she escapes Satine and Christian plan to run away

By now the Duke has realized Satines tricks and tells Zidler that if the maharaja does not get his courtesan he will have the penniless sitar player killed Nonetheless Zidler must inform Satine of her final condition before she agrees to give up on the escape plan She goes to Christian and lies to him convincing him that her love was an act in the hopes that this will make him want to leave Paris and therefore save his life

As the show opens Satine performs tiredly knowing that her life is almost up Christian refusing to give up on Satine confronts her backstage When she tries to force him off again he takes the place of the shows hero throwing money at her feet to pay his whore and storming off the stage Satine confesses her love for him in the form of his secret song and Christian and Satine get back together in full view of the audience and the Duke The Duke attempts to shoot Christian but Zidler forces him off The audience applauds what they think is a good drama but backstage Satine is overcome by her illness and dies in Christians arms As her final wish she asks Christian to tell their story

A year later still in his flat overlooking the empty red windmill Christian finally types the last page of his work ending it with the couplet The greatest thing you will ever learn is just to love and be loved in return 

The following is a list of some of the songs featured in the movie along with the artist that popularized them

Some people want to use Tau in place of Pi the special number that comes from circles Tau would be equal to two times pi or about 6283 

These people want to use Tau because they think it would be easier for everyone to understand There are many reasons in math why Tau could be useful or helpful One of the simplest is that it would make learning about radians easier

A radian is a way of measuring the angle of a circle It says that the number of radians in an angle is equal to the length of the outside of the circle or the arc length that is covered by an angle divided by the Radius or distance from the point in the center of a circle to anywhere on the outside There is a picture down on the bottom right that shows this

If the distance covered around the outside of a circle is equal to the radius than one radian is being covered Around the whole outside of a circle there are about 6283 radians  or Tau radians 

The advantage of this is that if you turn one quarter of a circle you will have turned Tau 4 radians If you turn one half of a circle you have covered Tau 2 radians This just makes more sense You can see a drawing of this in the bottom right of the page

Not many people use Tau yet but more and more are

There was also once a letter Omega in the Cyrillic alphabet It was there so people could spell Greek names both in Cyrillic and in Greek in the same way But this letter is no longer used today

Stratford P Sherman wrote in a November 18 1991 article in Fortune magazine about the need for America to read more He began by saying that most Americans could not understand the article He referred to a study by John P Robinson a sociology professor at the University of Maryland showing that the average American at that time spent only 24 minutes per day in reading He mentioned the continuing decline in newspaper sales and referred to a guess by Leonard Riggio CEO of Barnes Noble that 50 of books sold by his company were never read He quoted Samuel Robert Lichter director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs on his preference for the ease of turning on the TV instead of reading a book Sherman went on in his article to mention the growing need for skillful commmunication in American business but also the decreasing quality of the same activity He quoted Monsanto CEO Richard Mahoney on the importance of reading in helping a business manager to see connections between events He described print media as being first among different media with respect to the amount of information conveyed by so few widely understood symbols portability suitability for the users own speed of use and economical distribution of broad and deep information which can be used immediately

Sherman said that Motorola was making preparations to pay 5000000 to teach workers reading and other basic skills and that since 1982 Ford Motor Company had already sent 32000 workers on a similar program He said that Simon Schuster predicted a market of 500000000 per year in the sales of remedial programs to corporations He quoted a spokesman for the National Association of Broadcasters as saying that the biggest predictor of scholastic success is the time parents spend reading to their children However Sherman said that the amount of time thus spent meant that the outlook was not bright

An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations is better known simply as The Wealth of Nations It was written by Adam Smith in 1776 It looks at division of work following self interest and freedom of trade

The book was the beginning of classical economics and market economics Smith said that if everyone did what was best for themselves the result would be best for society Before that economics was about the kings personal interests and the wealth of a nation was measured by the kings treasury Smith said whats important is whats best for the whole nation and that wealth should be measured by the yearly income of the nation He wanted to discover how wealth can grow and how people could do things to support that growth Smiths book said land labor and capital were the three factors of production and the main contributors to a nations wealth

Prices naturally adjust to having more or less of something supply and demand If there is too much of something prices go down so that people have more reason to buy it If a lot of people want something there may not be enough of it there will be a competition among the people who want to buy it and some people will agree to pay more to get what they want and prices go up 

Smith said markets should be free At the time some big companies were controlled by the government Sometimes the rulers made laws that were good for themselves but not for workers or customers For example in the American colonies colonists could grow cotton but were not allowed to make clothing from it They had to ship it to England to be made into clothing then buy it back after it was finished Smith said this was bad for individuals and for society He thought it was better for money to flow freely and naturally between buyers and sellers without outside interference Money would naturally go to the sellers who made the best product at the best price This way if people did what was best for them it would end up being best for society as a whole almost like an invisible hand was guiding everything

Pop art is a modern art movement that was popular in the 1950s and 60s It was created by the Scottish sculptor and artist Eduardo Paolozzi in 1952 Andy Warhol Robert Indiana and Roy Lichtenstein are examples of pop artists Pop art rose to dominance in the 60s 

Pop art has themes and techniques drawn from popular mass culture such as advertising and comic books Pop art employs images of popular as opposed to elitist culture in art

The Independent Group founded in London in 1952 is regarded as the precursor to the pop art movement They were a gathering of young painters sculptors architects writers and critics who were challenging modernist approaches to culture as well as traditional views of Fine Art The group discussions centered on popular culture implications from such elements as mass advertising movies product design comic strips science fiction and technology 

At the first Independent Group meeting in 1952 co founding member artist and sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi presented a lecture using a series of collages titled Bunk that he had assembled during his time in Paris between 19471949 This material consisted of found objects such as advertising comic book characters magazine covers and various mass produced graphics that mostly represented American popular culture One of the images in that presentation was Paolozzis 1947 collage I was a Rich Mans Plaything which includes the first use of the word pop appearing in a cloud of smoke emerging from a revolver After Paolozzis seminal presentation in 1952 the IG focused on the imagery of American popular culture particularly mass advertising

The artists use mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques which downplay the expressive hand of the artist 

Pop artists went for absolute clarity Most forms were bordered with black lines as in comic books The objects are often plain like a poster and without perspective The colours are clear achromatic and primitive colours 

Objects of the everyday life get isolated and modified or processed in collages Pop art is a connection between reality and art handled with abstract means Some of their catchwords are popular consumable cheap funny and outstanding

Much of pop art is rather academic as the unconventional organizational practices used often make it difficult for some to understand Pop art and minimalism are considered to be the last modern art movements and so the precursors to postmodern art or some of the earliest examples of postmodern art themselves

The Museum of Modern Art is a modern art museum in New York New York United States on 53rd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues It has been called the most important museum of modern art in the world Some of the artists featured at the museum include Jackson Pollack Vincent van Gogh Andy Warhol and Robert Indiana

The Rankine scale is a thermodynamic temperature scale It is based around absolute zero Rankine is similar to the Kelvin scale in that it starts at absolute zero and 0Ra is the same as 0K but is different as a change of 1Ra is the same as a change of 1F and not 1C Note that the abbreviation R is ambiguous as it can also refer to the Raumur scale 

The Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales are defined so that absolute zero is 0 kelvins or 0 degrees Rankine The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are defined so that absolute zero is 27315 C or 45967 F

The Rankine scale was originally used in the United States

High fidelity or hi fi is a way of describing a very good home music system High fidelity means that the sound is as close to the original as possible with no changes or added noise People who like hi fi are sometimes called audiophiles Hi fi is often now called high end audio

In the 1930s and 1940s vacuum tubes were used to make radios and electronic amplifiers Radio was becoming popular and microphones amplifiers and loudspeakers began to be sold The manufacturers began to compete to produce the best product A lot of research was done at Bell Laboratories and products were made by Western Electric

Then a new kind of vinyl record with less noise and better sound was invented The term high fidelity began to be used by manufacturers to help sell their new records and equipment In the 1950s hi fi became the popular term replacing phonograph and record player Rather than playing a record on the phonograph people would play it on the hi fi

In the late 1950s and early 1960s Westrex invented the stereo record that used two speakers This led to more improvements in home audio The word stereo replaced the word hi fi Records were now played on a stereo 

Some people bought individual parts and even built their own equipment The term high fidelity is still used for very good music systems

Slum clearance in the 1920s and 1930s saw the center of Derby become less populated as families were rehoused on new council estates in the suburbs where houses for sale were also built Rehousing council house building and private housing developments continued on a large scale for some 30 years after the end of World War II in 1945

Derby became a high profile town internationally in sport following the appointment of Brian Clough as manager of Derby County FC in 1967 Promotion to the Football League First Division was achieved in 1969 and County won of the English league three years later Following the Cloughs resignation in 1973 his successor guided County to another league title in 1975 but this is the clubs last major trophy to date relegation followed in 1980 and top flight status was not regained until 1987 since when Derby have spent a total of 10 seasons in the top flight The club moved from its century old Baseball Ground in 1997 to the new Pride Park Stadium

Derby was awarded city status on 7 June 1977 by Queen Elizabeth II Until then Derby had been one of the few towns in England with a cathedral but not city status

Despite its strategic industries Derby suffered comparatively little damage in both world wars This may in part have been due to the jamming of the German radio beam navigations systems X Verfahren and Knickebein camouflage and decoy techniques were built mainly south of the town eg out in fields near Foremark

Derby is home to several sports clubs 

Derbys main football club is Derby County whove won the FA Cup and the Football League There are also three senior non league football clubs based in the city Derby also had a short lived baseball team which played at Derbys former ground

Arthur Keily the marathon runner and Olympian was born in Derbyshire in 1921 and has lived his whole life in Derby In Rome in 1960 he broke the English Olympic record recording a time of 2hours 27mins

Derby has the first public park in the country to have an arboretum which lies to the south of the city centre The arboretum was set up by the philanthropic landowner and industrialist Joseph Strutt in 1840 The arboretums website states that the arboretums design was the inspiration for the vision of great urban parks in the USA notably Central Park in New York City

There are four museums Derby Museum and Art Gallery Pickfords House Museum The Silk Mill and The Royal Crown Derby Museum

Stereophonic sound also simply called stereo is the reproduction of sound using two or more audio loudspeakers This creates a pleasant and natural sound heard from various directions as in natural hearing 

The word stereophonic comes from Greek stereos solid and phn sound It was coined by Western Electric

In popular usage stereo usually means two channel sound recording and sound reproduction using data from two speakers The electronic device for playing back stereo sound is often called a stereo

Ely is a cathedral city in the East Cambridgeshire district of Cambridgeshire in the east of England and convert23kmmi1abbronlkon north north east of Cambridge

Ely has been called a city for a long time because it has a cathedral But the Royal Charter making it a city was only issued in 1974 Elys population was 15102 in 2001 This means Ely is the third smallest city in England Only after Wells in Somerset and the City of London are smaller

The University of Cambridge rowing team has a boathouse on the bank of the river and train there for the annual Boat Race against the University of Oxford

The 1944 Boat Race was raced on the River Great Ouse near Ely the only time it has not been held on the River Thames The race was won by Oxford despite Cambridge being ahead early in the contest

Sound recording is the electrical or mechanical preservation of sound Most recordings are of music or human speech and they are usually for entertainment purposes but sound is sometimes recorded for scientific or historical reasons 

A recording medium is the object that a recording machine records onto or the recording itself Sound is recorded onto a medium where it is stored and can be moved from place to place The sound is recreated by playing back the recorded medium Methods machines and media have changed much since sound was first recorded

The two main kinds of sound recording are analog and digital recordings

The first machines for recording sound were mechanical not electrical The phonograph was invented by Thomas Alva Edison in 1877 Phonographs had a rotating cylinder coated with a soft material such as tin foil lead wax or amberol Sound waves vibrated a small needle so that its motion carried the waves As the cylinder rotated the needle would draw the motion of the sound waves in the soft coating making the cylinder a recording of the sound that was in the needle

This recording could be played back by tracing another needle through the groove to reproduce the small vibrations in the playback needle These vibrations could be amplified to create louder more audible sound

The phonograph was useful for making single recordings but a big disadvantage was the difficulty of making copies of the cylinders

This changed with the invention of the gramophone around 1888 The gramophone works in much the same way as the phonograph but instead of a cylinder the needles grooves are etched into a disk record which rotated on a spinning table Because the record media was flat reproducing them was much simpler Pressing the original recording onto a plate of shellac created a negative master where the grooves stood out in relief instead of being pressed into the surface The master could be used to produce many copies through the opposite process

The first records were made mostly of rubber or shellac but later copying processes created records from vinyl

Originally records spun at a rate of 78 rotations per minute or 78 rpm As technology improved records could spin more slowly but still reproduce sound better and play for longer amounts of time 45 rpm became common in the middle 20th century and by the late 1900s most records were 33 rpm Records 

In the late 1930s the tape recorder appeared Tape recorders use a magnetic tape as a medium with a recording head to store the sound on the tape Sound waves are converted into an electrical signal inside the recorder This signal goes into the head where it changes the polarity of very small magnets Tape moves past the head at a constant speed and its magnetic particles are rearranged by these magnets to a pattern that represents the sound wave These magnetic patterns are much like the small grooves of a cylinder or disc record in the way that they represent the vibration energy of sound waves

When a tape is played back it runs past a playback head which reads the magnetic patterns off the tape and converts them back into an electrical signal The electrical signal can then be converted into sound waves or copied to some other kind of sound processing machine

A magnetic tape is divided into several tracks Each track uses up part of the width of the tape and can store a completely different recording that can be played back at the same time as the other tracks A two track tape has one track on half of the tape and another track on the other half A four track tape has four tracks all lying next to one another like a highway with four lanes Most tape recordings today are stereophonic meaning that they have two tracks which are meant to be played together Usually one is played on the listeners left side and the other is on the listeners right side to match the listeners two ears

Early tapes were wound flat on a storage reel and transferred to a take up reel as they were recorded or played After recording or playback they were rewound so that they were stored only on the storage reel This kind of system is usually called reel to reel today It is still used today for some professional recording and playback but for home use reels were mostly replaced with other kinds of tape in the 1970s Cassettes are small cartridges containing two reels inside Cassettes move a four track tape in either of two directions corresponding to their side A and side B labels The reel on the left contains the unplayed or unrecorded tape and the reel on the right contains the tape that has already passed the recording or playback head When you turn the cassette over the tape still moves from left to right but this is really the opposite direction The side A recording plays two tracks as stereo and the side B recording plays the other two

Eight track tapes were popular for a while in the 1970s and 1980s Eight tracks work much like cassettes but the tape is a loop it repeats after being played all the way through Because it has eight tracks there are four programs to select from each in stereo Eight tracks are not very popular anymore but can still be found in hobbyist collections

Professional tape recording systems may have even more tracks or might use them differently Usually a system like this is designed to allow someone to mix the tracks in different ways than they were originally recorded However there is a kind of recording called quadraphonic that uses four track tape to play four different tracks at the same time A good quadraphonic recording can sound much more real than stereo or monophonic recordings

Tape recording technology was used from the early days of computing to store digital information As computer technology improved so did magnetic tape technology In the 1980s Digital Audio Tape technology emerged DAT is designed to work much like cassette except DATs magnetic patterns represent digital data instead of sound vibrations This digital data is a digital audio recording which can be copied and reproduced with many different computer systems Moving to digital takes the medium one step farther from the original sound Instead of being a sound medium the DAT is a data medium and the data is a sound medium This is more technically complex but also more flexible DAT has been used for many kinds of data recording in addition to sound

The compact disc medium was developed in the 1980s as a new way to bring digital recordings of music to the market Except for the introduction of the CD ROM and several kinds of recordable CD the CD has not changed much since then Like DAT it is a data medium rather than a way of recording vibrations directly It was introduced to provide music in a way that is cheap for manufacturers but relatively high quality but it has since been adapted to meet many data storage needs Like DAT the CD requires computer technology to record and to play

By the 1990s CDs had replaced cassettes and records as the main kind of commercial music media Today although CDs are still very popular online digital recordings like MP3s are gaining fast

The earliest methods of recording sound involved the live recording of the performance directly to the recording medium This was an entirely mechanical process often called acoustical recording The sound of the performers was captured by a diaphragm with the cutting needle connect to it The needle made the grooves in the recording medium

To make this process as efficient as possible the diaphragm was located at the apex of a cone and the performer would crowd around the other end If a performer was too loud then they would need to move back from the mouth of the cone to avoid drowning out the other performers As a result of this in early Jazz recordings a block of wood was used in place of the bass drum

The advent of electrical recording made it possible to use microphones to capture the sound of the performance The leading record labels switched to the electric microphone process in 1925 and most other record companies followed their lead by the end of the decade Electrical recording increased the flexibity and sound quality However once the performance was still cut to the recording medium so if a mistake was made the recording was useless

Electrical recording made it possible to record one part to disc and then play that back while playing another part recording both parts to a second disc This is called over dubbing The first commercially issued records using over dubbing were released by the Victor Talking Machine Company in the late 1920s However overdubbing was of limited use until the advent of analogue audio tape Use of tape overdubbing was pioneered by Les Paul and is called sound on sound recording In this way performances could be built up over time

The analogue tape recorder made it possible to erase or record over a previous recording so that mistakes could be fixed Another advantage of recording on tape is the ability to cut the tape and join it back together This allows the recording to be edited Pieces of the recording can be removed or rearranged See Audio editing

The advent of electronic instruments effects and other instruments has led to the importance of MIDI in recording For example using MIDI timecode it is possible to have different equipment trigger without direct human intervention at the time of recording

In more recent times computers have found an increasing role in the recording studio as their use eases the tasks of cutting and looping as well as allowing for instantaneous changes such as duplication of parts the addition of affects and the rearranging of parts of the recording

Theta is the eighth Greek letter written or 

Theta also refers to

A Storage area network is a computing solution for accessing and storing data To the user Storage Area Networks appear to be local to the operating system but they are actually remote

To understand the difference between a SAN and Network Attached Storage the difference between the file system and storage must be made clear

The file system is the interface that allows the user to access their data that is stored in physical storage From the point of view of the user their data is saved as files The file system takes care of storing the file data which might actually be broken up into pieces and stored in different locations in storage

On a personal computer the file system and storage are on the same machine In Network Attached Storage the file system and storage are on a remote server In a Storage Area Network the file system is on the local machine and the storage is on a remote machine

Zeta or ZETA can refer to

The rings of Saturn is the name of the rings around the planet Saturn They consist of many small particles ranging in size from microscopic to the size of a bus that form clumps that in turn move around Saturn The particles in the rings are made almost entirely of water ice with just a small amount of dust and other chemicals There are some gaps in the rings The moon Pan causes the gap called the Encke gap in Saturns A ring

Network attached storage is a solution from computing It means that storage is put on a computer network Different users can then access this using different protocols Today boxes that already can do this are available rather cheaply Also such boxes can be built easily using a small or old computer with an operating system like Linux

The different clients can then access the data using different protocols like SMB or NFS NAS is easier to do than a Storage area network

A group of Native Americans decided to call the place where they live the Republic of Lakotah This group is called the Lakotah Freedom Delegation They believe the Republic of Lakotah should be treated as a separate country but at the moment no other country in the world agrees that it is

When white people first came to North America from Europe the Lakotah people who are a native tribe had already been living there for thousands of years The Lakotah legally had nothing to do with the USA until they made treaties with each other in the 1800s

Since then the Lakotah people have lived inside the borders of the USA On December 17 2007 the Lakotah Freedom Delegation said that Lakotah should become a separate country again as it was before they made treaties with the USA

They drew up borders which includes bits of North and South Dakota Nebraska Wyoming and Montana At the moment most people consider these regions still to belong to the USA

In December 2007 the group traveled to Washington DC and spoke to the government They announced that the Lakotah were withdrawing from the treaties they had with the USA They said the USA had not been following the treaties and this had been causing problems on Lakotah land

For example the USA and the Lakotah made an agreement called the Treaty of Fort Laramie which meant the Lakotah could keep the Black Hills The Black Hills is a very sacred and special place for the Lakotah But the USA broke the agreement and invaded the Black Hills when they found out that gold was buried there Now the Black Hills is home to the famous mountain carvings of Mount Rushmore

The group says that the Republic of Lakotah is not a new country but a country that has just been revived But some members of the Lakotah tribe complain that they were not told about the plans Many of the leaders of the Lakotah tribe were not asked beforehand Traditionally a vote needs to be held if a treaty is going to be changed and 75 of Lakotah males need to vote in favor of the change But a vote was not held when the plans for the Republic of Lakotah were being made

The group argues that Lakotah is allowed to be its own country by law They use the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties Article Six of the United States Constitution and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to back up their plans

The Lakotah Freedom Delegation say they might follow the example of the Philippines or the Marshall Islands countries which used to belong to the United States but then achieved independence

Anyone is allowed to be a citizen of the Republic of Lakotah as long as they give up their citizenship of the United States The group plans to make its own passports and driving licenses

The government will be run in the traditional Lakotah way The elderly people who receive a lot of respect in Lakotah tradition will choose leaders to run the country

At the moment supporters of the Lakotah Freedom Delegation are arguing over the name of the country Some people like the name Republic of Lakotah but others prefer Lakotah Oyate Oyate is the Lakotah word meaning nation

The government plans to use solar energy and wind power to make electricity because these methods do not hurt the environment

A place does not exist as a country until other countries in the world recognise its borders or its government and treat it as a separate country The Lakotah Freedom Delegation has contacted the embassies of Venezuela Bolivia Chile and South Africa asking to be recognised as an independent country The group has also mentioned Russia Finland and Iceland and said that Ireland and East Timor are interested in the plans But at the moment no other country in the world is treating Lakotah as a separate country

The US government is unlikely to support the Republic of Lakotah because it means the USA will lose some land Theyve said that the groups plans do not mean anything

Chanson is the French word for song The word is often used in music to mean any song with French words but it is more often used when talking about songs in which lyrics have been set to music by French classical composers

Very often chansons refers to the French songs that were sung in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance People who sang these chansons were called chansonniers They had various forms including ballade rondeau and virelai Some composers at the time liked to set popular poetry to music The earliest chansons were for two three or four voices many of them being for three voices  By the 16th century most were for four voices Sometimes the singers were accompanied by instruments 

The first important composer of chansons was the medieval composer Guillaume de Machaut In the Renaissance Guillaume Dufay and Gilles Binchois wrote many simple chansons Later Johannes Ockeghem and Josquin des Prez composed chansons which had lots of imitation between the voices Clment Janequin wrote more simple homophonic chansons He worked in the area around Paris Later composers such as Orlando de Lassus were influenced by the Italian madrigal The style of music started to be used in music for instruments

The first book of sheet music printed from movable type was Harmonice Musices Odhecaton a collection of 96 chansons by many composers published in Venice in 1501

During the 16th century French songs started to be composed with lute or keyboard accompaniment In the 19th century many composers wrote songs with piano accompaniment These chansons were often called mlodies

In France today chanson often refers to the work of more popular singers such as Georges Brassens Jacques Brel dith Piaf Camille Olivia Ruiz French chansons of Jacques Brel have been translated and are interpreted in English by Arnold Johnston Professor at West Michigan University More than 100 chansons of Brel Brassens Barbara Bcaud Ferrat Aznavour Trenet et Ferr have been translated and are interpreted in German language by the Duo Stphane Didier

A type asteroids are fairly uncommon closer asteroids that have a strong broad 1 m olivine feature and a very reddish spectrum shortwards of 07 m They are thought to come from the completely differentiated mantle of an asteroid

A type asteroids are so rare that as of 2005 only 17 had been found

C type asteroids are asteroids made of carbonates They are the most common variety taking up around 75 of known asteroids and an even higher percentage in the farther part of the belt beyond 27 AU which is dominated by this asteroid type The amount of C types may actually be higher than this because C types are much darker than most other asteroid types except D types and others common only at the extreme farther edge of the Main Belt

This type of asteroid has very similar spectra to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites whose chemical make up is about the same as the Sun and the primitive solar nebula except that they do not contain hydrogen helium and other volatiles Hydrated minerals are present

C type asteroids are very dark with albedos usually in the 003 to 010 range Consequently whereas a number of S types can normally be viewed with binoculars at opposition even the biggest C types require a small telescope The potentially brightest C type asteroid is 324 Bamberga but that objects very high eccentricity means it rarely reaches its maximum magnitude

Their spectra contain moderately strong ultraviolet absorption at wavelengths below about 04 m to 05 m while at longer wavelengths they are very featureless but slightly reddish The so called water absorption feature around 3 m which can be a sign of water content in minerals is also present

The biggest unequivocally C type asteroid is 10 Hygiea although the SMASS classification places the biggest asteroid 1 Ceres here as well because that scheme lacks a G type

Marcus Aemilius Lepidus was a Roman politician He was one of the closest men to Julius Caesar He was Caesars deputy in Rome when Caesar was away from Rome defeating Pompey in the battle of Pharsalus in Greece He served as Pontifex Maximus after Caesars death 

Together with Octavian and Mark Antony he formed the Second Triumvirate to oppose the conspirators The Triumvirate was legally set up its purpose was to sideline the Consuls and Senate which means it was the effective end of the Roman Republic

Lepidus was older than the other two triumvirs After the Battle of Philippi he governed Spain and part of North Africa He was blamed for a revolt in Sicily giving Octavian the excuse to strip him of all his offices except for Pontifex Maximus He died peacefully in exile in Circeii in Italy in the year 13 BC

Lacrosse invented by the Native Americans is a popular team sport in North America and a national summer sport for Canada It involves the use of nets or heads as they are called which consist of a wooden or metal shaft with a net on the end Hockey is a game based on this sport 

How the game is played 

Lacrosse has two teams each with ten players There is one goalie three defensemen three midfielders and three attackmen The goalies defend the goals and if the ball goes into the goal the team who got the goal scores Whoever scores he most goals by the end of the game wins with an overtime period being played if the game is tied The game has four quarters and starts with a faceoff at the beginning of each quarter A faceoff is when the ball is on the ground to start the game and one person from each team fights for the ball

Steve Reich is an American composer of music in the style of minimalism He is known for his music made with tape recordings and instrumental music with a steady beat

He also wrote pieces that used what is called a phasing technique With phasing technique two parts might be playing the same part but at slightly different speeds It is almost like a canon or round He wrote pieces like these for piano violin and again for tape recordings 

A girl group is a popular music show It shows many young female singers who normally harmonise together

In Ancient Greece a metic was a foreigner living in a Greek city state The metic did not have the same citizen rights as a citizen who was born in the state he was living in

The term metic was especially used in ancient Athens in the 4th and 5th centuries BC A notable metic was Aristotle who was born in Stageira but lived in Athens for a long time

Regardless of how many generations of the family had lived in the city metics did not become citizens unless the city chose to bestow citizenship on them as a gift This was rarely done Citizenship at Athens brought eligibility for numerous state payments such as jury and assembly pay which could be significant to working people During emergencies the city could distribute rations to citizens None of these rights were available to metics They were not permitted to own real estate in Attica whether farm or house unless granted a special exemption 

Metics shared the burdens of citizenship without any of its privileges Like citizens they had to perform military service and if wealthy enough were subject to special tax contributions Citizenship was very rarely granted to metics More common was the special status of equal rights under which they were freed from the usual liabilities 

The system came to an end in Hellenistic Athens when the purchase of citizenship became very frequent The census of 317 BC gave 21000 citizens 10000 metics and 400000 slaves in Attica 

In the Greco Roman world free people living on the territory of a polis were called paroikoi in Asia Minor katoikoi

Democracy in Ancient Athens was very different from modern democracy

To be classed as a citizen in fifth century Athens you had to be male born from two Athenian parents and over eighteen years old Women slaves metics and children were not allowed to become citizens

Citizens could be involved in the running of Athens and could be elected for important positions

Athens had a direct democracy This meant that each citizen had an equal say and opportunity in the governing of Athens All of the citizens of Athens would meet on a hillside 40 times a year to discuss how to run the city better

All democratic countries now have an indirect democracy This means we elect members of parliament to make decisions concerning government There are now too many people in different countries for them to meet on a hillside and many people are too busy to be able to go 40 times a year

All citizens could attend forty meetings a year Meetings were held on a hillside called the Pynx People would stand on a raised platform called the bema to speak Speakers wore a garland whilst speaking Any citizen could speak

All decisions concerning the running of Athens were decided here taxes war policy etc Any decisions were made by a show of hands

A black pig would be sacrificed to the gods at the start of the meeting to make sure the meeting went well

Cleisthenes a democratic reformer divided Attica into ten tribes in 510 BC The Boule was made up of 50 male Athenian citizens from each of the ten tribes This meant that 500 men were elected but only 50 served at any one time

Gucci is an Italian fashion house

It was started by Guccio Gucci in Florence in 1921 Gucci is seen as one of the most famous successful and easily recognizable fashion brands in the world Gucci is now owned by the French conglomerate company Pinault Printemps Redoute

BusinessWeek magazine says that Gucci made more than US7 billion in 2006 and was 46th in the magazines yearly Top 100 Brands For this reason Gucci is the second biggest selling fashion brand after LVMH Most importantly Gucci is the biggest selling Italian brand in the world Gucci has about 425 shops in the world and it sells its products to other shops by franchisees and department stores

Gucci was started in 1906 by Guccio Gucci In 1938 Gucci grew bigger and a small shop opened in Rome Guccio Gucci designed many of the companys famous clothes In 1947 Gucci made the bamboo handle handbag which is still used In the 1950s Gucci also made the striped webbing and the suede and metal moccasin shoes

Guccio Guccis wife Aida Calvelli had a large family with six children but only their sons not their daughters help lead the company After Guccios death in 1953 Aldo helped lead the company to being a major fashion shop in more than one country opening the companys first small shops in London Paris and New York Even in Guccis younger years the family was well known for its arguments Arguments about inheritances stock holdings and day to day operations of the shops often divided the family and caused alliances to be made Gucci grew in other countries Gucci decided to grow a lot in East Asia in the late 1960s opening shops in Hong Kong Tokyo and Korea At that time the company also made its famous GG logo and the Flora silk scarf and the Jackie O shoulder bag which was made famous by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis the widow of US President John F Kennedy

Gucci stayed as one of the biggest luxury clothes companies in the world until the late 1970s when some bad business decisions and family arguments almost made the company bankrupt At the time the brothers Aldo and Rodolfo controlled equal 50 shares of the company but contributed less to the company than Guccio Gucci and all his sons did In 1979 Aldo made the Gucci Accessories Collection or GAC which was meant to increase sales for the Gucci Parfums sector which his sons controlled GAC sold small accessories such as cosmetic bags lighters and pens which were cheaper than the other items in the companys accessories catalogue Aldo relegated control of Parfums to his son Roberto in an effort to weaken Rodolfos control of the overall operations of the company

Aldo Gucci grew into new markets such as an agreement with American Motors Corporation so that in 1972 AMC Hornet small Sportabout car became one of the first American cars to give a special luxury made by a famous fashion designer The Gucci cars had striped green red and buff material inside as well as the Guccis logos and outside color selections

The Gucci Accessories Collection was popular but it brought the Gucci strength down After a few years the Parfums section started to sell better than the Accessories section The newly made wholesaling business brought the once exclusive brand to over a thousand stores in the United States alone with the GAC line deteriorating the brands standing with fashionable customers In the 1960s and 1970s writes Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter Gucci had been at the pinnacle of chic thanks to icons such as Audrey Hepburn Grace Kelly and Jacqueline Onassis But by the 1980s Gucci had lost its appeal becoming a tacky airport brand

Opera is a drama set to music An opera is like a play in which everything is sung instead of spoken Operas are usually performed in opera houses The singers who sing and act out the story are on the stage and the orchestra is in front of the stage but lower down in the orchestra pit so that the audience can see the stage

An opera is normally divided into two three four or even five acts In older operas the music was mostly recitative and arias During the recitative things would happen in the story The aria was a song for a solo singer a setting of a lyric As well as recitative and aria there would be choruses The chorus were a group of singers who sing in the crowd scenes The opera would start with an overture for the orchestra The overture would usually include tunes that are going to be heard later in the opera 

In operas from the 19th century onwards there is often little or no difference between recitative and aria Composers like Wagner wanted to get away from operas which had lots of separate arias in which the singers showed off with the audience clapping loudly after each one He wanted continuous music so that the mood would not be broken

Sometimes operas have a lot of dancing in them French opera especially would often have one act which was full of dances

Not all operas have music all the time

Grand opera is opera which is all set to music

Opra buffe or Opera buffa is comic opera The story is very light hearted and funny

Opra comique is a French term for opera which has some spoken words Surprisingly it does not mean a comic opera An opera like Carmen which is a tragedy is still an opra comique due to the fact that it uses spoken dialogues instead of recitatives

Singspiel is a German term for a type of opera with lots of magic and fantasy in the story There were spoken words between the songs Mozarts Magic Flute is an example

Operetta is a short opera which is light hearted and usually has some spoken words

Opera singers have to have powerful voices as well as a good technique Most opera houses are very big and the singers need to be heard at the back They also need to be good at acting They need to be able to learn their music quickly and to sing from memory It is a help to be good at languages because operas are often in Italian German French English or Russian etc Some opera companies like the English National Opera sing their operas in English Others like the Royal Opera House sing operas in whatever language they were composed in Translations are printed on a screen above the front of the stage so that the audience can understand what is being sung

Although singers train to get a wide range they cannot be expected to sing any role in their voice range For example some sopranos may have big dramatic voices suitable for parts like Tosca in Puccinis opera Tosca Some may have a very light and high voice called coloratura suitable for parts like the Queen of the Night in Mozarts Magic Flute Some may have a medium range called mezzo soprano suitable for parts like Carmen in Bizets opera Carmen

Very often in opera the heroine is a soprano and the hero is a tenor Basses may often have the part of a powerful king or he may be the bad guy

The 18th century lexicographer and critic Dr Johnson described opera as an exotic and irrational entertainment By exotic he meant that it came from a foreign country By irrational he meant that the things which happened in the stories were strange and not like real life A play can be like real life but an opera is being sung so things are not going to happen like they normally do in real life A singer might be singing I must go I must go and he may stand on the stage and sing this for several minutes before at last he goes A singer may be pretending to die and will sing a beautiful song before he or she finally dies These things are conventions which means that they are a kind of habit we have to accept when watching and listening to opera Another convention of earlier operas was to have the part of young men sung by women This is sometimes called a breeches role or trouser role They are often small parts such as page boys or teenagers who flirt with older women such as the part of Cherubino in Mozarts The Marriage of Figaro or Oktavian in Richard Strausss Der Rosenkavalier It should be remembered that in the 18th century it was usual for the main female part to be sung by a man who was a castrato That seems a very strange convention to us now

There are lots of famous operas and the best ones have some of the greatest music ever written The music could not have been written like that if it had not been written for opera For example Mozart is very clever at writing music where maybe six people are all singing different things at once because they all have different ideas about the situation in the story

The first opera ever written was performed in 1597 in Florence in Italy It was called Dafne and the composer was Jacopo Peri This opera is now lost but three years later in 1600 he worked together with another composer called Giulio Caccini to write an opera called Euridice The music for this still exists It was nearly all recitative This kind of writing was new but if opera was to tell a story it was important to have a solo voice singing words that could be heard They were trying to produce something like an ancient Greek tragedy It was performed at a kind of club called camerata for intellectual people to a small audience It was not great music but the amazing thing was that there was a composer of genius around His name was Claudio Monteverdi and only seven years later in 1607 he wrote the first really good opera Orfeo which was produced in Mantua Monteverdi must have realized that opera had the possibilities of putting poetry music scenery and acting all together He took the kind of songs that were popular at the time and joined them with speaking or recitative Later in life he joined these so that the music flowed more dramatically

In 1637 the first public opera house was opened in Venice Soon lots of theatres in Italy started to produce operas The stories were usually about ancient times like the Roman Empire or Greek myths They started to put in comic bits to make people laugh Soon there was opera in Paris Vienna Hamburg and in the small courts of Germany which in those days was lots of little countries each with their own prince who ruled and who kept musicians at court The composers who are best remembered today include Jean Baptiste Lully who was an Italian who moved to France and wrote operas for the French king and George Frideric Handel who was a German who moved to England and wrote operas for the opera houses in London In Italy there were composers like Francesco Cavalli who had been a choirboy in Monteverdis church choir in Venice and Alessandro Scarlatti 1660 1725 who lived in Naples

During this period known as the Baroque period the opera was an entertainment for the upper classes who went to the opera to be seen in public Opera was a social occasion where you could meet people and talk even during the music Both the singers and the audience behaved in ways that we would think were bad manners

Christoph Willibald Gluck was a composer who tried to make people take opera more seriously In 1762 he wrote an opera called Orfeo which was performed in Vienna It had lots of choruses and ballet numbers like French opera but the words were in Italian and the music really concentrated on the story rather than being just a display for clever singers to show off Some of its music is very famous today eg the Dance of the Blessed Spirits which is played on a flute and Orfeos aria Che far senza Euridice

Mozart learned from Glucks ideas about opera This can be seen in his opera Idomeneo which is about a Greek story Other Italian operas by Mozart include Don Giovanni Le Nozze di Figaro and Cosi fan tutte He also wrote operas in German The Abduction from the Serail and The Magic Flute These are Singspiel operas which tell magic and fantasy stories

Ludwig van Beethoven only wrote one opera Fidelio It is a story of a woman who rescues her lover from prison Rescue operas were popular in France but this one is in German It is a serious opera about how a woman can save a man by being true and faithful

In the 19th century Richard Wagner continued Glucks ideas Wagner had very personal ideas about how his operas should be performed and he liked to train the singers himself He wanted them to take the drama of his operas seriously instead of treating the music as a way of showing off their voices He always wrote the libretti himself and they were always in German They are mostly about serious subjects from German folklore and myths although he did write one comic opera The Mastersingers of Nrnberg Wagner used leitmotifs which means that there are tunes which are used for particular characters or ideas in the opera This allows the music to develop with the story and can be used in interesting ways For example when Sigmund says that he does not know who his father is we hear his fathers tune in the orchestra The audience of course know

In Italy Gioachino Rossini wrote lots of operas There was no difference in style between his comic and his serious operas Often the same overture was used for both He wrote exactly all the notes that the singers were to sing he did not want to leave it to them to improvise their own ornamental notes Everything was carefully thought out Musicians are not sure whether to call him a Classical or Romantic composer Composers like Vincenzo Bellini and Gaetano Donizetti are definitely Romantic They had the ability to write lovely lyrical tunes The most famous Italian opera composer of the 19th century was Giuseppe Verdi His music is not always continuous like Wagners Sometimes it stopped for the audience to applaud Verdi had a wonderful sense of drama and could write beautiful melodies which captured peoples hearts He loved Shakespeare and based several of his operas on Shakespeare plays Otello Macbeth and Falstaff 

The 19th century was the time when Nationalism was important Composers were writing music typical of their own countries Wagner as we have seen took German myths for his opera stories In Spain they had their own kind of opera called zarzuela In Russia Mikhail Glinka wrote Ruslan and Lyudmila which was based on a Russian fairy tale Other Russian composers include Alexander Borodin who wrote Prince Igor and Modest Mussorgsky who wrote Boris Godunov Both these operas are about stories from Russian history Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov wrote a fairy tale opera Sadko and Pyotr Tchaikovsky used some very Russian tunes in Eugene Onegin and The Queen of Spades 

Czech composers wrote national operas The most famous Czech opera composers were Antonn Dvok Bedich Smetana and Leo Janek In France the most famous composer was Charles Gounod who wrote an opera called Faust

In the 20th century composers had many different styles of composing This was true of all kinds of music including opera Richard Strauss was really a Romantic although almost all his operas were written in the 20th century His harmonies show that he had studied Wagners operas Der Rosenkavalier has lots of romantic tunes although it is a story about Vienna in the Classical period In Italy composers like Giacomo Puccini wrote operas in the verismo style This meant operas with stories that felt like real life The characters in the stories were usually from the lower classes 

Alban Berg also wrote operas about poor or simple people He wrote an opera called Wozzeck which is the tragedy of a man who is too simple to understand that people are being unkind to him and using him Bergs music is often built on the twelve tone series which he had learned from Schoenberg Stravinskys The Rakes Progress is in yet another style called Neo classical because the music is made to sound a bit like music of the Classical Period In England Britten wrote many great operas like Peter Grimes and Billy Budd Most of them are about unfortunate people who want to be part of society but are not accepted 

More recent composers who wrote operas include the Hungarian Gyrgy Ligeti the Polish Krzysztof Penderecki the English Sir Harrison Birtwistle and the Americans Philip Glass and John Adams

In 1974 the old county of Sussex was split into East Sussex and West Sussex

For example

Orlande de Lassus was a Franco Flemish composer who lived in the last part of the Renaissance Lassus and Palestrina are the two most famous composers of that time who were writing church music in a polyphonic style 

He was born in Mons in the province of Hainaut in the Low Countries which is mostly what is today the south part of the Netherlands and Belgium We know very little about his childhood There is a story that when he was a choirboy he was abducted three times by another church who wanted him to sing in their choir because he had a beautiful voice There is no proof that this story is true At the age of twelve he left his country and went to Mantua Sicily and later to Milan in Italy and then to Naples where he worked until the early 1550s Next he moved to Rome where he worked for the Grand Duke of Tuscany who had a large household there In 1553 he became maestro di cappella of the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano in Rome This was an excellent job for a man who was only 21 years old However he only stayed there a year Later in 1555 Palestrina took that job Lassus left Rome to go home to the Low Countries to see his parents who were ill but by the time he got home they were both dead

We are not sure what he did between then and 1554 He may have gone to France and England In 1555 he returned to the Low Countries and had some of his first works published in Antwerp In 1556 he joined the court of Duke Albert V of Bavaria who was very keen on music and was trying to make music in his country as good as the music in Italy Lassus was one of several Netherlanders to work there and by far the most famous He seems to have been happy in Munich and he stayed there In 1558 he married the daughter of a maid of honour of the Duchess they had two sons who both became composers By 1563 Lassus had been made maestro di cappella He stayed there for the rest of his life although several other kings and aristocrats offered him jobs in other places He had many honours including being knighted by the Pope

In 1590 his health started to be bad In 1594 his employer decided it was costing him too much to employ Lassus so he wrote a letter to him to say that he was dismissed Lassus never saw the letter because that very same day he died

Lassus composed a lot of church music He had to compose masses for the morning and evening services Many of these are parody masses which means they were based on tunes from other compositions Others were influenced by composers from Venice 

He wrote many motets which were probably sung at services as well In some of these motets he shows a sense of humour For example one of his motets makes fun about bad singers the music stops and starts and stutters It was a kind of musical joke Sometimes he had to write music for special occasions He had visited Italy several times and learned the Italian way of writing polyphonic music

Lassus also wrote many songs in French as well as German He also wrote madrigals He even wrote drinking songs

He never wrote anything that was strictly instrumental music

The Moral Code of the Builder of Communism was a set of twelve rules It was made in the Soviet Union by the Communist Party of the USSR Every member of the party and every Komsomol member was supposed to follow these rules 

The Moral Code was made at the 22nd Congress of the CPSU in 1961 as part of the new Party Programme

The very first moral principle was Devotion to the cause of communism

Many people try to compare these rules to the Ten Commandments The two texts have very little in common though Russian language books of the time sometimes say that these are founded on the Bible One of the passages of the Bible cited is he who does not work neither shall he eat This text was also used in the Soviet Constitution of 1936 

The rules were thought more as guidelines In contrast the Ten Commandments were made to be rules of conduct and perhaps even laws For example You shall not commit adultery of Moses loosely corresponds to Mutual respect in a family concern about the upbringing of children of the Code

The Code also is about what a person should do as a commitment to the society he or she lives in It does not speak of personal virtue For example the Do not steal may be loosely matched to Concern of everyone about the preservation and multiplication of the common wealth 

Four of the rules making up one third of the Code are of a political character

The Code contained a number of popular Soviet cliches in fact it was intentionally formulated to contain catch phrases either invented by Soviet ideologists or borrowed

Iconoclasm is a word It is used to describe when symbols of a culture are destroyed by people of that same culture This is usually done for religious or political motives Often it occurs together with major political or religious changes It is generally different from the destruction by one culture of the images of another for example by the Spanish in their American conquests The term does not generally include the specific destruction of images of a ruler after his death or overthrow for example Akhenaten in Ancient Egypt 

People who engage in or support iconoclasm are called iconoclasts This word is also used for people who are against established dogmata or conventions Similarly people who revere or venerate religious images are called idolators In a Byzantine context they are known as iconodules or iconophiles

Iconoclasm may be carried out by people of a different religion but is often the result of sectarian disputes between factions of the same religion The two Byzantine outbreaks during the 8th and 9th centuries were unusual because the use of images was the main issue in the dispute rather than a by product of wider concerns In Christianity iconoclasm has generally been motivated by a literal interpretation of the Ten Commandments which forbid the making and worshipping of graven images of God

Triple Zero is the national emergency number within Australia If someone has an emergency situation that is life threatening or time critical this number will connect then to a Telstra operator who will then connect them to the Police Fire or Ambulance Service as required 112 is a secondary emergency number that will direct calls to the Triple Zero answering point It is against the law to use this number if there is no emergency 

Before 1961 Australia did not have a national number for emergency services Each of the different emergency branches had their own number In 1961 the Postmaster General introduced the Triple Zero number in most of the major Australian cities and by the end of the 1980s it had become nation wide The number Triple Zero was chosen for several reasons one of which was that it was easy to dial in darkness because the number zero was next to the finger stop on most Australian telephones

A person would dial Triple Zero if they require a response from police Fire or Ambulance for life threatening or time critical events

When Triple Zero is dialled a Telstra operator will answer and ask the caller the following Emergency Police Fire or Ambulance The Telstra operator will then connect the caller to the required emergency service The emergency service calltaker will then query the caller further and dispatch assistance as required

German districts are administrative units used in Germany for local government 

The districts are in between the Lnder and the local municipal levels They are not to be confused with the larger Regierungsbezirk 

Their equivalent in other nations is the county or arrondissement 

Most of the districts are rural districts There are 295 Landkreise 

Cities with more than 100000 inhabitants are not usually part of a district but do the work of a district themselves These are known as urban districts The equivalent in the United Kingdom is a unitary authority they do the work of a town and a county There are 107 of these Kreisfreie Stdte

This makes a total of 402 districts

In North Rhine Westphalia there are some cities with more than 100000 inhabitants which are not urban districts for example Iserlohn Recklinghausen Siegen Paderborn Bergisch Gladbach Witten and Neuss These cities belong to a district but still do so the districts jobs themselves as though they were independent

The districts are responsible for the following

All these tasks are carried out by local authorities operating together Urban districts have these responsibilities and also those of the municipalities

The district council the Kreistag is the legislative body of the district and is responsible for local self administration The parliament is elected every five years except in Bavaria where it is elected every six years

The person in charge of the districts government is the Landrat or Landrtin In parts of northern Germany this is also the name of the district administration in southern Germany it is known as Kreisverwaltung

This is a list of urban districts in Germany

Germany is divided into 429 districts 313 are rural districts and 116 urban districts which are listed below

They are the equivalent of an independent city in the United States or unitary authority in the United Kingdom

 following the Gttingen Law of January 1 1964 the town of Gttingen is incorporated into the district of Gttingen but the rules on urban districts still apply as long as no other rules exist

 following the Law on the region of Hannover Hannover counts since November 1 2001 as an urban district as long as no other rules apply

There are no longer any urban districts The town of Saarbrcken used to be an urban district but became incorporated into the Saarbrcken Town Federation on January 1 1974

Mary Queen of Scots was Queen of Scotland from 14 December 1542 until 24 July 1567 when she was forced to give up her kingdom 

Mary was the daughter of King James V of Scotland who died just after she was born She was crowned queen when she was only 6 days old She married three times Her first husband was King Francis II of France They were both young when they were married and they had no children Francis died from an ear infection that had spread to his brain leaving Mary a widow

When Mary returned to Scotland after spending her youth in France she found that she was not popular in her kingdom She had been brought up as a Catholic but many people in Scotland had become Protestant It was difficult for Mary to avoid siding with either the Catholics or the Protestants As Mary was now free to marry again there were lots of noblemen who wanted to become her husband For her second husband she chose an English lord named Henry Darnley who was of royal blood Darnley was good looking and charming but he was often very childish and he was jealous of Marys secretary an Italian named David Rizzio 

Mary became pregnant While she was expecting the baby Darnley and his friends got drunk one night and decided to kill David Rizzio They came into Marys private rooms at Holyrood Palace while she was talking with Rizzio and they stabbed him to death Darnley got away with the murder because he was the queens husband but Mary never forgave him for murdering her friend Rizzio When her baby was born it was a boy who would later become King James VI of Scotland

A powerful Scottish nobleman the Earl of Bothwell was loyal to Mary and hated Darnley He arranged for Darnley to be killed He tried to make it look as though Darnley had been killed in a fire at his house but everyone knew that Bothwell was behind the murder and some people believed that Mary had also been part of the plot to kill her husband Mary then agreed to marry the Earl of Bothwell This was not a wise move because Bothwell had many enemies Marys enemies forced her off the throne and made her young son king in her place Mary was put in prison but she escaped and crossed the border into England which was ruled by her cousin Elizabeth Queen of England

Mary hoped that Elizabeth would help her to get her throne back but Elizabeth did not She kept Mary a prisoner for many years Mary was eventually accused of making plans to murder Elizabeth and so she was executed

This is a list of the administrative divisions of Germany It includes the KreiseLandkreise as well as the kreisfreie Stdte The list is sorted alphabetically by state

Guillaume Dufay was a Franco Flemish composer and music theorist of the early Renaissance He was the most important composer of his time He belonged to the group of composers known as the Burgundian School He had more influence on music in Europe than any other composer of the 15th century

From what it says in his will it seems likely that he was born in Beersel which is near Brussels in what today is Belgium He was the illegitimate child of an unknown priest and a woman called Marie Du Fayt When he was small Dufay moved with his mother to Cambrai where they stayed with a relative who was a canon of the cathedral there Dufay soon showed musical talent and he was given a musical education at the cathedral He sang in the choir there When he was only 16 he was given a benefice as chaplain near Cambrai He travelled to Konstanz for a meeting

From November 1418 to 1420 he was a subdeacon at Cambrai Cathedral In 1420 he left Cambrai again and worked in Rimini in Italy at the house of a rich family In 1424 he returned to Cambrai because the relative in whose house his mother was staying was ill After the relative died he went back to Italy He worked in Bologna for a Cardinal He became a deacon and then a priest

When the Cardinal was made to leave Bologna in 1428 Dufay went to Rome to work for the pope He became a member of the Papal Choir In 1434 he was made maistre de chappelle in Savoy He seems to have left Rome when the papal choir had money problems Yet in 1435 he was again in the service of the papal chapel but this time it was in Florence In 1436 Dufay composed the festive motet Nuper rosarum flores one of his most famous compositions which was sung at the dedication of Brunelleschis dome of the cathedral in Florence

During this period Dufay also began his long association with the dEste family in Ferrara some of the most important musical patrons of the Renaissance He may have got to know them during his first stay in Italy Rimini was not far from Ferrara and he spent time in both towns where he got financial support

At this time the arguments between the Pope and the Council of Basel continued Dufay thought he might find himself without a job so he went back to Cambrai In order to be a canon at Cambrai he needed a law degree which he got in 1437 he may have studied at Turin University in 1436 One of the first documents mentioning him in Cambrai is dated December 27 1440 when he was given 36 lots of wine for the feast of St John the Evangelist We do not know how long he took to drink it

Dufay stayed in Cambrai during the 1440s At the same time he was also in the service of the Duke of Burgundy While in Cambrai he worked with Nicolas Grenon on completely renewing the cathedral collection of music This meant that he had to write a big collection of polyphonic music for services He also worked in the administration of the cathedral In 1444 his mother died and was buried in the cathedral and in 1445 Dufay moved into the house of the person who had been canon just before He kept this home for the rest of his life although he did spend six more years in Italy where he wrote many of his compositions When he returned again to Cambrai he was made canon of the cathedral He was the most famous composer in Europe by that time He often composed music for the court of Burgundy and he met many younger composers who were becoming famous such as Busnois Ockeghem Tinctoris and Loyset Compre During this period Dufay probably wrote his mass based on the song Lhomme arm as well as the chanson based on the same song Maybe he wrote this when Philip the Good called for a new crusade against the Turks who had recently captured Constantinople He also wrote a Requiem mass around 1460 which is lost

After an illness of several weeks Dufay died on November 27 1474 He had asked for his motet Ave regina celorum to be sung for him as he died with pleas for mercy to be read between some of the movements but there was not enough time for this to be arranged so it was sung at his funeral instead Dufay was buried in the chapel of St Etienne in the cathedral of Cambrai his portrait was carved onto his tombstone In later years the cathedral was destroyed and the tombstone was lost but it was found in 1859 and is now in the Palais des Beaux Arts museum in Lille

Dufays music was performed all over Europe People who wanted to perform his music had to write it out by hand There was no music printing in those days

Dufay wrote church music including masses motets Magnificats hymns simple chant settings and antiphons His secular music includes rondeaux ballades virelais and a few other kinds of chanson His style of composition laid the foundation for the next generations of Renaissance composers Some of his techniques were old fashioned He used isorhythms in his motets which had been popular in medieval music He used a way of harmonizing chants which became known as fauxbourdon He was popular because he was skilled at writing melodies which were beautiful to sing

Upper Egypt is a narrow strip of land on both sides of the Nile that extends from modern day Aswan to the area south of modern day Cairo The northern part of Upper Egypt between El Aiyat and Asyut is sometimes called Middle Egypt

Brandenburg was only on western bank of the Havel until 1196 But even after that year the parts on either side of the river were regarded as two different towns for centuries

In 1314 the two towns joined the Hanseatic League In the Thirty Years War the towns were robbed and destroyed Potsdam became the new capital and the Royal Court left the town of Brandenburg In 1715 the two halves of the town were merged to form a single town

The concentration camp Brandenburg Grden was in Grden a suburb of Brandenburg during the years of Nazi Germany

After the fall of the Berlin Wall the population dropped from over 100000 in 1989 down to roughly 75000 in 2005 through emigration The migration mainly affects the young people and thus the future of the city is uncertain

The Roma people are a wandering people found mainly in Eurasia and in Central Europe but also in the rest of the world They are sometimes called gypsies The Council of Europe uses the word Roma in all official talks and papers 

This is to stop the use of bad names and to give respect to the name Roma which is what they like to call themselves

The 18th century idea about the Indian birth of the Roma is based on the likeness between Romani and languages spoken in the Indian subcontinent and is supported by genetic evidence But the lack of close likeness to any given Indian way of speaking has left undecided the question of the original heritage of the proto Roma with both single and plural origins proposed by linguists

Individual groups can be classified into big groups of groups the Roma of East European birth the Sinti in Germany and Manouches in France and Catalonia the Kal in Spain Ciganos in Portugal and Gitans of southern France and the Romanichals of Britain

The Roma language is made official by many countries of Europe under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages

Obituary The Daily Telegraph 26 January 2008

This is a list of cities in Germany with more than 100000 inhabitants

 2006 Population

A Regierungsbezirk is a government region of Germany in some federal states 

Regierungsbezirke are divided into districts either Landkreise or urban districts cities which constitute a district in their own right The Regierungsbezirk is governed by a Bezirksregierung and led by a Regierungsprsident

Not all Bundeslnder have this sub division some are directly divided into districts Currently five states are divided into 22 Regierungsbezirke ranging in population from 5255000 to 1065000

The first Regierungsbezirke were created by the Kingdom of Prussia in 180816 which divided its provinces into 25 Regierungsbezirke The Regierungsbezirke of North Rhine Westphalia are in direct continuation of those created in 1815 Other states of the German Empire created similar entities named Kreishauptmannschaft or Kreis During the Third Reich the Nazi government unified the naming since then all these entities are called Regierungsbezirk

On January 1 2000 Rhineland Palatinate disbanded its three Regierungsbezirke Koblenz Rheinhessen Pfalz and Trier  the employees and assets of the three Bezirksregierungen were converted into three public authorities responsible for the whole state each covering a part of the former responsibilities of the Bezirksregierung

On January 1 2004 Saxony Anhalt disbanded its three Regierungsbezirke Dessau Halle and Magdeburg The responsibilities are now covered by a Landesverwaltungsamt with three offices at the former seats of the Bezirksregierungen 

On January 1 2005 Lower Saxony disbanded its four Regierungsbezirke Braunschweig Hanover Lneburg and Weser Ems

In 2005 North Rhine Westphalia planned to abolish its five Regierungsbezirke and create three self government entities The old Prussian style Regierungsbezirk had no self government organs

Joseph Martin Joschka Fischer was German foreign minister and Vice Chancellor in the government of Gerhard Schrder from 1998 to 2005 He was a leading figure in the German Green Party and according to opinion polls he was the most popular politician in Germany for most of the governments duration He left office on 22 November 2005

Fischer was born in Gerabronn in Baden Wrttemberg His parents were Germans from Hungary His nickname Joschka is from Jska which is the Hungarian nickname for Joseph Fischer dropped out of high school in 1965 and started working for a photographer which he quit in 1966

In 1967 he became active in the German student movement and Left wing politics Working in a left wing bookstore in Frankfurt was when he started going to leftist university events as a guest student He studied the works of Marx Mao and Hegel and became a member of the militant group Revolutionary Combat

Fischer took part in some street battles when the anarchist Putzgruppe attacked the police and hurt some officers a lot Photos of one battle in March 1973 show Fischer clubbing policeman Rainer Marx httpwwwjoschkaforgFischer getting a workout

In the German Autumn of 1977 there were a lot of terrorist attacks by the Red Army Faction Fischer says that these attacks especially the kidnapping and murder of Hanns Martin Schleyer made him give up violence as a way to get political change

Instead he became involved in the new social movements and later in the newly founded German Green Party mainly in the state of Hesse

In May 1981 the Minister of Economics of the state of Hesse Heinz Herbert Karry was murdered The gun that killed the minister was stolen from an American army base in 1973 and Fischers car was used in the robbery

As Foreign Minister Fischer apologised for the violence of his Putzgruppe days

From 1983 to 1985 Fischer was a member of the Bundestag for the Green party In 1985 he became Minister for the Environment in Hesse in the first Social Democrat Green coalition Fischer caused a stir when he arrived to take his oath of office ceremony wearing trainers These trainers are now on display in a museum in Bonn

Fischer was again Environment Minister in Hessen from 1991 to 1994 and later on became co chairman of the Greens parliamentary party in the Bundestag During his years in opposition Fischer was respected for his speeches For a large part of the 1990s with the SPD was not very popular and Fischers friends often called him real Leader of the Opposition

In September 1998 the Social Democrats led by Gerhard Schrder beat the Christian Democrat government of Helmut Kohl With the SPDs 42 and the Greens 7 a coalition government could be formed After several weeks of talks between Social Democrats and Greens the new government took power on 27 October 1998 Fischer became Minister of Foreign Affairs

In 1999 Fischer supported German participation in the Kosovo War This was very extremely controversial within the largely pacifist Green Party because it meant that for the first time since World War II German soldiers would actively go into combat He justified this war with allegations that Serbia was planning to commit genocide against the Kosovo Albanians

Fischer was also in favour of stationing German troops in Afghanistan but he advised Schrder not to join the war in Iraq He is known as a good friend of Kofi Annan By 2005 he was the second longest serving foreign minister in German postwar history

In 2005 Fischer was accused by critics of carelessly relaxing controls on visa regulations for Ukraine thus allowing many illegal immigrants to enter Germany with fake identities A parliamentary committee was established to examine the case and unlike in other such committee hearings Fischers statement was shown live on public TV Fischers appearance before the committee took twelve hours

After the defeat of the coalition government in the 2005 election Fischer announced that he would retire to the backbench After 20 years of power now I want my freedom back he was quoted as saying On 13 October 2005 it was announced that Frank Walter Steinmeier would succeed Fischer as Foreign Minister

Since the beginning of September 2006 Joschka Fischer has been a senior fellow at the Liechtenstein Institute on Self Determination at Princeton University a visiting professor at Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University He has also spoken at other American universities notably Brandeis University on various topic in foreign affairs and international relations

Fischer has often been the most popular German politician even among supporters of other parties

Until 1996 Fischer had been an outspoken lover of good wines and food He often bet cases of expensive wine with other politicians on the outcome of elections Fischer had also been overweight Within a short time he lose a lot of weight Fischer said that this was due to his giving up alcohol completely and changing his diet He had also been doing fitness training and even running marathons He cashed in on his weight loss by writing the book My long race towards myself about his experience which became an immediate bestseller Recently he has been putting on weight again

Fischer has been married five times his first four marriages to Edeltraud Fischer Inge Vogel Claudia Bohm and Nicola Leske all ended in divorce In October 2005 he married Minu Barati who was his common law wife for 2 years With Inge his second wife he has two children David and Lara In April 2005 Fischer became a grandfather for the first time

The following sources reflect the views of US adversaries of Fischer and his policies especially Germanys decision not to participate in the 2003 US led invasion of Iraq

Fischer writes a monthly commentary series The Rebel Realist for Project Syndicate a non profit association of newspapers around the world

The Flora family of asteroids is a big group of S type asteroids in the closer part of the main belt whose origin and properties are not well understood right now About 4 5 of all main belt asteroids belong to this family

Because of its poorly defined edges and the location of Flora itself near the edge this asteroid group has also sometimes been called the Ariadne family when Flora did not make it into the group during an analysis

The biggest member is 8 Flora which mesures 140 km in diameter and takes up about 80 of the total family mass Nevertheless the parent body was almost for sure destroyed by the impacts that made the family and Flora is probably a gravitational aggregate of most of the piecesFactdateFebruary 2007 43 Ariadne makes up much of the remaining mass about a further 9 with the remaining family members being fairly small below 30 km in diameter

Because of the high background density of asteroids in this part of space one might expect that a great number of asteroids unrelated to the collision that made the family would be present However few have been found This is because unrelated asteroids are hard to distinguish from family members because the family is of the same spectral type that dominates the closer main belt overall The few unrelated asteroids that have been found are all small They include 298 Baptistina 422 Berolina 2093 Genichesk 2259 Sofievka 2952 Liliputia 3533 Toyota 3850 Peltier 3875 Staehle 4278 Harvey 4396 Gressmann and 4750 Mukai

Suharto was an Indonesian military and political leader He was a military officer in the Indonesian National Revolution He is better known as the second President of Indonesia He held the office for a long time from 1967 to 1998

His New Order administrations authoritarian and increasingly corrupt practices led to much discontent in the 1990s Suhartos almost unquestioned authority over Indonesian affairs slipped dramatically when the Asian financial crisis lowered Indonesians standard of living People inside the military and other institutions no longer supported him There were some problems inside the country during the early 1990s Suharto became more and more isolated in a political way After mass demonstrations in 1998 Suharto was forced to resign Suharto had been the face of Indonesia for over 30 years After retiring he lived in seclusion There were people who wanted to try him for genocide This failed however because he had a very bad health His legacy remains hotly debated and contested both in Indonesia and abroad

Industrialization is part of a process where people adopt easier and cheaper ways to make things Using better technology it becomes possible to produce more goods in a shorter amount of time A single person can produce more things 

After industrialization people also do more specialized jobs For example before industrialization a shoemaker produced the whole shoe He worked on one pair of shoes finished that and then did the next pair of shoes With industrialization there are many people involved in making shoes An individual shoemaker has a smaller task however There is one person that cuts the sole of the shoe Another person stitches it on In short there is division of labour The machines to make the shoes cost a lot of money so the factory will be owned by a wealthy person who can afford the machines

John Bodkin Adams was a British doctor fraudster and suspected serial killer

Adams worked for one year in a hospital in Bristol He then moved to Eastbourne England where he became a general practitioner He cared for a lot of old female patients and many of them were very rich 132 left him money or gifts when they died Rumours started that Adams was killing them with heroin and morphine and the police decided to investigate Many of the possible victims had been cremated so there were few bodies for the police to analyse

Adams was arrested and tried for the murder of one patient in 1957 but found not guilty Another charge was withdrawn  an event the judge later criticised The trial was reported in newspapers around the world and was described at the time as one of the greatest murder trials of all time

Some have claimed that the trial was not held fairly Police files show that the prosecution gave secret records to the defence to help them defend Adams Evidence was lost by the prosecution and then found later by the defence When it was produced during the trial the prosecution pretended that it had never seen it Also the case that was chosen was probably one of the least likely to succeed 

One historian claims that the government did not want Adams to be convicted because he would then have been hanged If this had happened many doctors would have refused to treat government patients and the government would have become very unpopular

Adams was later found guilty of 13 other crimes  prescription fraud lying on cremation forms obstructing a police search and failing to keep a register of the dangerous drugs he used

He had his license to be a doctor taken away in 1957 but it was given back in 1961 He was banned from prescribing dangerous drugs for life

Scotland Yards files on the case were meant to be secret until 2033 but special permission was given in 2003 to open them

Even though he was found not guilty most experts now consider him to have been a serial killer The judge in his trial later wrote a book in which he said Adams was probably guilty The police thought that Adams killed 163 of his patients

Girolamo Savonarola was an Italian Dominican priest and leader of Florence from 1494 until his execution in 1498 Savonarola is famous for burning books and for the destruction of what he considered immoral art Savonarola was a priest but he preached against the moral corruption of the clergy and the Church of Rome His main enemy was Pope Alexander VI He is sometimes seen as a forerunner of Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation however he remained a devout Roman Catholic

In the twentieth century a movement for the canonization of Fr Savonarola began to develop within the Roman Catholic Church particularly among Dominicans Many believe that his excommunication and execution were not legal However his beatification and canonization is opposed by many Jesuits who think Savonarolas attacks on the papacy to have been a serious crime

Savonarola was born in Ferrara the which was the capital of the independent Duchy of Ferrara

In his youth he studied the Bible and then went to the University of Ferrara He wrote two poems which showed his anger at morally corrupt clergymen The first about the end of the world was written when he was only 20 Savonarola wrote the second poem De Ruina Mundi in 1475 In this poem he said the Roman Curia was a false proud whore

Savonarola became a Dominican friar in 1475 and entered the convent of San Domenico in Bologna He studied theology In 1479 he went to the convent of Santa Maria degli Angeli In 1482 the Dominicans sent him to Florence the city of his destiny After five years he went back to Bologna where he became master of studies

He returned to Florence in 1490 and began to preach about the end of the world He had visions and prophecies which he said had come to him from God and the saints Several disasters made his prophecies real He spoke about the failing power of the ruling Medici family Savonarola never tried to make war on the Roman Curia He wanted to put an end to the sins of the popes who cared more about their riches and power than they did about God 

After Charles VIII of France invaded Florence in 1494 the ruling Medici were removed Savonarola became the new leader of the city both as a secular leader and priest He set up a rather modern democratic republic in Florence Savonarola wanted to make Florence a city devoted to God a good Christian and religious Republic Homosexuality had been acceptable in Florence and many were important people One of Savonarolas first laws was to make sodomy a crime which would be punished by death

In 1497 he and his followers went to the Piazza della Signoria and began to burn mirrors cosmetics obscene pictures pagan books gaming tables musical instruments fine dresses womens hats and the works of immoral and ancient poets They also burnt paintings by some famous artists such as Sandro Botticelli and Michelangelo This event is now called the Bonfire of the Vanities

Florence soon became tired of Savonarola The city had become an unhappy place to live Savonarolas promises that God would change things in the city did not come true and his predictions of the end of the world did not happen During his Ascension Day sermon on May 4 1497 groups of young men rioted in the streets people began singing and dancing and the taverns reopened The riot became a revolution

On May 13 1497 Savonarola was excommunicated by Pope Alexander VI In 1498 Alexander demanded his arrest and execution On April 8 soldiers attacked the Convent of San Marco and after a bloody battle Savonarolas guards and religious supporters were killed He surrendered and during the next few weeks was tortured to make him say that he was gulity of heresy corruption and other crimes against the Church

On the day of his execution he was taken out to the Piazza della Signoria with Fra Silvestro and Fra Domenico da Pescia two religious friends of Savonarola They were stripped of their clerical clothing and called heretics and schismatics The three men were put on crossesand burned alive Savonarola died in the same place where he had burnt the paintings and books

Niccol Machiavelli author of The Prince also saw and wrote about the execution The Medici soon retook control of Florence

A eunuch is a castrated man His genitals are removed This can be cutting off the testicles or removing the penis and the testicles

Over the millennia since eunuchs had a lot of different functions in different cultures such as domestics treble singers religious specialists government officials military commanders and guardians of women or harem servants When eunuchs ran a harem a monarch could be sure he was the one who fathered his wifes children since real eunuchs were always infertile

The ANTARES Experiment is a telescope that is built at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea But it is not a normal telescope that uses light to see distant objects Instead it uses neutrinos very small and light particles that can fly through the earth

To detect these neutrinos it uses 900 light sensors attached to 12 strings that float in the sea The strings are fixed on the sea floor by an anchor and held straight by a buoy floating in the sea Although the neutrinos are invisible they can create a different particle a muon in water which then gives off light by the Cherenkov effect because it travels faster than light in water The sensors are so sensitive that they need only very little light and can even detect single photons This is necessary because the muons produce only very little light

The detector is located in the Mediterranean about 40 kilometres off Toulon in southern France There the sea is 2500 metres deep It is built by a group of physicists from 12 European countries Currently 10 strings are running The last two strings will be installed in May 2008

It is the largest neutrino detector in the Northern hemisphere Two similar detectors are located in the ice of the South Pole

The Cherenkov effect is an effect in physics discovered by Pavel Alekseyevich erenkov

Whenever a particle with an electric charge moves faster than light in a medium it sends out photons and thereby loses energy The photons that are sent out can be measured as they are simple light

Because nothing can move faster than light in a vacuum there is no Cherenkov light in a vacuum However if we say that light in water moves only with 75 of its speed in vacuum particles with very high energy are now able to move faster than light and create Cherenkov light

Because the Cherenkov effect is strongest for light with short wavelengths Cherenkov light often appears blue

Budai or Budai Luohan pronounced Hotei in Japanese also known as the Laughing Buddha is the person who might be the next Buddha after Gautama Buddha

He has become incorporated into Buddhist Taoist and Shinto culture and is based on a Chinese monk He is in many temples restaurants and businesses Budai has become a god of happiness and plenty when taken in by Taoism and Buddhism In Japan Hotei is one of the Seven Lucky Gods He is almost always shown smiling or laughing hence his nickname in Chinese the Laughing Buddha

Budai comes from the time of Sakyamuni Buddha where there was a monk named Angida whose name also meant calico bag In the legend Angida was an Indian snake catcher who caught poisonous snakes to stop them from biting people Budai and Angida look similar they both are plump seen laughing and carrying a bag

In the Chinese tradition Budai was a monk who lived in china at about 907 to 923 He was a man who was good and loving Apart from his character his likeness with the Maitreya Bodhisattva is also a Buddhist hymn which he said before his death

Budai is almost always shown carrying a sack which never empties and is filled with many precious things including rice plants sweets for children food and the sadness of the world His duty is protector of the weak the poor and children

In Chinese Buddhist temples Budais statue is put in the front part of the entrance hall He is shown as a stout smiling or laughing man in robes with a largely shown stomach which shows happiness good luck and plenty

Some statues show small children at his feet Another item that is usually seen in Budai statues is a begging bowl to show that he is a Buddhist All of these images show Budai as a wandering monk who goes around and takes the sadness from people Because he represents richness and happiness statues are often found in homes and businesses in China and Japan

The main story that concerns Budai in Chan is a short koan In it Budai travels giving candy to poor children only asking a penny from people he meets One day a monk walks up to him and asks What is the meaning of Chan Budai drops his bag How does one get to Chan he continued Budai then picks up his bag and walks away

In Thailand Budai is sometimes confused with another monk very respected in Thailand Phra Sangkadchai or Sangkachai Phra Sangkadchai a Thai spelling of Mahakaccayanathera was a Buddhist in Pali in the time of the Lord Buddha Lord Buddha praised Phra Sangkadchai for his excellence in explaining complicated dharma in an easily and understandable way

1 Phra Sangkadchai has a bit of hair on his head while Budai is bald

2 Phra Sangkadchai wears the robes in Theravadin Buddhist fashion with the robes folded across one shoulder leaving the other uncovered Budai wears the robes in Chinese style covering both arms but leaving the front part of the upper body uncovered

One belief surrounding the figure of Budai in popular folklore is that if a person rubs his belly it brings wealth good luck and prosperity This belief however is not part of any Buddhist ritual but more of a Chinese practice He is often admired for his happiness plenitude and wisdom of contentment

In Japan Juroujin also known as Gama is one of the Seven Lucky Gods according to Taoist beliefs He is the God of long life

He has a staff and a fan He is shown as an old man with a long beard and a scroll is tied to the staff which which has the lifespan of all living things written on it The deer the crane and the tortoise symbols of long life sometimes follow him

In computer programming source code is a text file version of a computer program or software that contains instructions that the computer follows to do something Source code is written in a programming language which a human can read and change A large program may contain many different source code files that all work together These days most source code is compiled when it is finished This translates the code into assembly language or machine language which is much faster and easier for the computer to read but hard for a human to read

A computer program may be open source which means the source code is shared with anyone who wants to look at it and change it or closed source which means only the people who made the program can look at and change the code

When compiled by a C compiler and executed this will print Hello world on the computer screen and then finish

Gilles Binchois was a Franco Flemish composer His name is spelt in various ways Binchoys Binch or Binche or Gilles de Bins He is one of the earliest composers of the group known as the Burgundian School His style of composition had a very important influence on music at the Burgundian court Together with Guillaume Dufay and John Dunstaple he belongs to the greatest of 15th century composers

He was probably born in Mons in what is now Belgium His father a councillor to Duke Guillaume IV of Hainault had a job in a church in Mons Nothing is known about Gilles until 1419 when he became organist at the church of Ste Waudru in Mons In 1423 went to live in Lille He may have worked as a soldier

Sometime near the end of the 1420s he joined the court chapel of Burgundy He sang with the choir there He spent many years working at the Burgundian court He was not allowed much time to be away so he did not travel much We know that he went to Mons in 1449 on which occasion he met Guillaume Dufay When he retired he went to live in Soignes He had a good pension

Binchois wrote beautiful melodies which were much simpler than a lot of the music of the Middle Ages They are easy to sing and remember Many later composers used melodies by Binchois as a basis for their own masses Most of his broken wikt linksecularsecular songs are rondeaux which became the most common song form during the century Binchois did not often write in strophic form He preferred to write music which did not follow the rhyming rhythm of the verse

John Dunstaple or Dunstable was an English composer who lived in the last part of the medieval era and the early part of the Renaissance He was one of the most famous composers in the early 15th century He had a lot of influence on music in England as well as on the continent  He helped to develop the style of the Burgundian School

The spelling Dunstaple is more often used today because in documents from his time this is the spelling that is more common although some documents spelt his name Dunstable

Dunstaple was probably born in Dunstable Bedfordshire around 1390 We know very little about his life He was well educated and he worked for the Duke of Bedford who was the fourth son of Henry IV and brother of Henry V He may have spent some time in France because the duke was Regent of France from 1423 to 1429 and then Governor of Normandy from 1429 to his death in 1435 Dunstaple owned property in Normandy and also in Cambridgeshire Essex and London according to tax records of 1436 He also worked for the Duke of Gloucester

Many composers at that time were priests but Dunstaple was not although he had connections with St Albans Abbey He was probably married During his life he was not just known as a composer but also as an astronomer astrologer and mathematician

He died on Christmas Eve 1453 and was buried in the church of St Stephen Walbrook in London which was later destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666 

We hardly have any original manuscripts of Dunstaples music England was a very musical country at the time but almost all that music was destroyed between 1536 and 1540 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries when Henry VIII was ruling Most of Dunstaples works which survive were works which were found on the continent mostly in north Italy This shows that he must have been famous throughout Europe He influenced Dufay and Binchois The Flemish composer and music theorist Tinctoris wrote in 1476 that he was the most important musician of new music which had started in England

Dunstaple was one of the first to compose masses using one melody as cantus firmus  He wrote many carols but we do not know which ones are by him because he did not sign his name to them He wrote broken wikt linksecularsecular music but it has been lost

The Crimean War also called the Eastern War was a war fought between Russia and France the United Kingdom the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Ottoman Empire on the other side Most of the fighting happened in the Crimean Peninsula with other fighting in western Turkey and around the Baltic Sea 

The Crimean War is sometimes called the first modern war since the weaponry and tactics used had never been seen before and affected all other wars after it It was also the first war where a telegraph was used to quickly give information to a newspaper

The Ottoman Empire was declining by the mid 1800s European countries which wanted as much land around the world as possible looked to the Ottoman Empire The war itself started after the Ottoman Empire said Russia and not France had the right to protect the Holy Land near the area of modern day Israel

The Crimean War was a very important point in the history of warfare It was not only different in the weapons it used it was also the first war related to by press by photography and journalists Another very important factor was that it was the first war with real field hospitals started by Florence Nightingale The defeat of Russia in the war caused increased development of weaponry and the end of serfdom in 1861

Homophobia is the fear or poor treatment of homosexuals The word was created in the 1960s by a psychologist named George Weinberg There are events to stop homophobia like the gay pride parades and International Day Against Homophobia on May 17 In some places it is illegal to treat homosexuals badly and it is a hate crime to hurt them Against such discriminations the Declaration of Montreal and the Yogyakarta Principles were adopted in 2006

The Congo River is the largest river in Africa Its overall length of 4700 km makes it the second longest in Africa The river and its tributaries flow through the second largest rain forest area in the world second only to the Amazon Rainforest in South America The river also has the second largest flow in the world behind the Amazon and the second largest watershed of any river again trailing the Amazon its watershed is a little larger than that of the Mississippi River Because large parts of the river basin sit above and below the equator its flow is very good as there is always at least one river having a rainy season The Congo gets its name from the old Kingdom of Kongo which made their home in the lands at the mouth of the river The Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo both countries sitting along the rivers banks are named after it From 1971 to 1997 the Democratic Republic of the Congo was called Zaire and its government called the river the Zaire River

The sources of the Congo are in the highlands and mountains of the East African Rift as well as Lake Tanganyika and Lake Mweru which feed the Lualaba River This then becomes the Congo below Boyoma Falls The Chambeshi River in Zambia is usually taken as the source of the Congo because of the accepted practice worldwide of using the longest tributary as with the Nile River

The Congo flows mostly west from Kisangani just below the falls then slowly bends southwest passing by Mbandaka joining with the Ubangi River and running into the Pool Malebo Kinshasa and Brazzaville are on opposite sides of the river at the Pool where the river narrows and falls through a few cataracts in deep canyons running by Matadi and Boma and into the sea at the small town of Muanda

The mouth of the Congo was visited by Europeans in 1482 by the Portuguese Diogo Co and in 1816 by a British exploration under James Kingston Tuckey that went up the river as far as Isangila Henry Morton Stanley was the first European to travel along the whole river

Although the Livingstone Falls stop water coming in from the sea almost all of the Congo is navigable in parts especially between Kinshasa and Kisangani Railways now cross the three major falls and much of the trade of central Africa passes along the river including copper palm oil sugar coffee and cotton The river can also be valuable for hydroelectric power and the Inga Dams below Pool Malebo are some of the first dams built

In February of 2005 South Africas power company owned by the state Eskom said that they had a proposal to increase the holding amount of the Inga a lot through improvements and the building of a new hydroelectric dam The project would bring the highest output of the dam to 40 GW twice that of Chinas Three Gorges Dam 

In the Mesozoic period before the continental drift opened the South Atlantic Ocean the Congo was the upper part of a river about 12000 km long that flowed west across the parts of Gondwanaland now called Africa and South America

The visible spectrum is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light 

A typical human eye will react to wavelengths in air from about 380 to 750 nm 

The familiar colors of the rainbow in the spectrum include all those colors that can be produced by visible light of a single wavelength only the pure spectral or monochromatic colors 

But there are no clear boundaries between one color and the next

Color displays mix red green and blue color to approximate the color spectrum In the illustration the narrow red green and blue bars show the relative mixture of these three colors used to produce the color directly above

Pieter Brueghel the Elder was a Dutch or Flemish Renaissance painter and printmaker He is known for his landscapes and peasant scenes He is nicknamed Peasant Bruegel to distinguish him from other members of the Brueghel family But he is the most famous of them and therefore in most of the cases when someone speaks of Brueghel he thinks of him From 1559 he dropped the h from his name and started signing his paintings as Bruegel

There are records that he was born in Breda Netherlands but it is uncertain whether the Dutch town of Breda or the Belgian town of Bree called Breda in Latin is meant He was the son of a peasant living in the village of Breughel He was an apprentice of Pieter Coecke van Aelst and he married his daughter Mayken 

In Bruegels later years he painted in a simpler style than the Italian art in his time The most obvious influence on his art is the older Dutch master Hieronymus Bosch

Bruegel specialized in landscapes populated by peasants He is often credited as being the first Western painter to paint landscapes for their own sake

He showed the rituals of village lifeincluding agriculture hunts meals festivals dances and games These show the folk culture of 16th century life

Although there were only a few pockets of resistance nearly 900 people committed mass suicides in fear of the Red Army Coroner lists show that most drowned in the nearby River Tollense and River Peene where others poisoned themselves This was fuelled by atrocities and rapes committed by Red Army soldiers until the city commander had the access to the rivers blocked on May 3

The Red Army was the name of the army of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics It was the name used mainly during World War II

People who hated communists used the name Red Army to describe any left wing group which they said was trying to promote communism and was paid for by the USSR

Albrecht Drer was a German painter engraver and mathematician 

He was born and died in Nuremberg Germany and is best known as a maker of old master prints His prints were often in a series so that there is a group of different prints about a subject The most famous series are the Apocalypse and his two series on the passion of Christ the Great Passion and the Little Passion 

Drers best known individual engravings include Knight Death and the Devil Saint Jerome in his Study and Melencolia I His most iconic images are his woodcuts of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse from the Apocalypse series the Rhinoceros and numerous self portraits in oils Drer possibly did not cut his own woodblocks but may have employed a skilled carver who followed his drawings faithfully He painted a number of religious works in oils and made many brilliant watercolours and drawings which through modern reproductions are now perhaps his best known works  

Drers prints made him famous across Europe before he was 30 and many people say he is the greatest artist of the Renaissance in Northern Europe

Drer was the third child and second son of his parents who had between fourteen and eighteen children His father was a successful goldsmith from Ajts near Gyula in Hungary 

Drers godfather was Anton Koberger who left goldsmithing to become a printer and publisher in the year Drer was born He quickly became the most successful publisher in Germany and owned twenty four printing presses and had many offices in Germany and abroad His most famous publication was the Nuremberg Chronicle published in 1493 in German and Latin It had 1809 woodcut pictures by the Wolgemut workshop Drer may well have worked on some of these as the work on the project began while he was with Wolgemut 

Drer had started to learn goldsmithing and drawing from his father His father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith but he was so good at drawing that he started as an apprentice to Michael Wolgemut at the age of fifteen in 1486 A self portrait a drawing in silverpoint is dated 1484 Wolgemut was the leading artist in Nuremberg at the time and had a large workshop making different types of works of art in particular woodcuts for books Nuremberg was a rich city a centre for publishing and many luxury trades It had strong links with Italy especially Venice a relatively short distance across the Alps

After completing his term of apprenticeship in 1489 Drer followed the common German custom of taking a wanderjahre in effect a gap year Drer was away nearly four years travelling through Germany Switzerland and probably the Netherlands Drer wanted to meet Martin Schongauer the best engraver of Northern Europe but Schongauer died shortly before Drers arrival He stayed at the house of Schongauers brother and got some pictures that Schongauer owned 

His first painted self portrait is now in the Louvre It was painted in Strasbourg probably so that Drer could send it back to his fiance in Nuremberg In fact very soon after he got back to Nuremberg on 7 July 1494 Drer was married to Agnes Frey She was the daughter of a well known brass worker in the city He was 23 and the marriage was arranged while Drer was away travelling his absence They had no children and most people think that they did not marry for love but because it was good to link the two families Also a single man could not set up in business for himself in Nuremberg Drer painted some portraits of his wife but experts say that they lack warmth The experts think that if Drer loved his wife he would have taken more time over those pictures to make her look more beautiful and friendly

Within three months Drer left for Italy The start of plague in Nuremberg was one reason for his leaving 

In Italy he went to Venice where artists were working in a more modern style Drer wrote that Giovanni Bellini was the oldest and still the best of the artists in Venice 

On his return to Nuremberg in 1495 Drer opened his own workshop He started to use what he learned in Italy more and more so his work was quite different from the other artists in Nuremberg who used only the traditional German style 

Drers father died in 1502 and his mother died in 1513 

Drer probably did not cut any of the woodblocks himself This was a job for experts But he had designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut as part of his training in Wolgemuts studio and he had seen many carved and painted altarpieces made in the studio This means he knew what could be made into a woodblock print and how to work with the expert block cutters Drer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself or glued a paper drawing to the block Either way his drawing was destroyed when the block was cut 

His famous series of sixteen great designs for the Apocalypse are dated 1498 He made the first seven scenes of the Great Passion in the same year and a little later a series of eleven on the Holy Family and saints Around 15031505 he produced the first seventeen of a set illustrating the life of the Virgin which he did not finish for some years Neither these nor the Great Passion were published as sets until several years later but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers

The Venetian artist Jacopo de Barbari whom Drer had met in Venice visited Nuremberg in 1500 and Drer said that he learned much about the new developments in perspective anatomy and Body proportions from him deBarbari did not want to tell Drer everything he knew so Drer began his own studies and he kept studying for the rest of his life This is a series of drawings show Drers experiments in human proportion before he made his famous engraving of Adam and Eve This is the only existing engraving signed with his full name

Drer made large numbers of other practice drawings especially for his paintings and engravings and many survive most famously the Praying Hands He also continued to make images in watercolour and bodycolour including a number of very beautiful still lives of meadow sections or animals including his Hare

In early 1506 he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507 By this time Drers engravings were very popular and were being copied In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of San Bartolomeo This was the altar piece known as the Adoration of the Virgin or the Feast of Rose Garlands It includes portraits of members of Venices German community but shows a strong Italian influence Later the Emperor Rudolf II took it to Prague Other paintings Drer made in Venice include The Virgin and Child with the Goldfinch Christ disputing with the Doctors and a number of smaller works

Drer was admired by the Venetians but he was back in Nuremberg by mid 1507 He stayed in Germany until 1520 His reputation had spread throughout Europe He was on friendly terms with most of the major artists of Europe and exchanged drawings with Raphael

The years between and his journey to the Netherlands are divided according to the type of work he made During the first five years 15071511 after his return from Venice Drer mostly painted He made his four best paintings Adam and Eve Virgin with the Iris the altarpiece the Assumption of the Virgin and the Adoration of the Trinity by all the Saints During this period he also completed the two woodcut series the Great Passion and the Life of the Virgin

He complained that painting did not make enough money so from 1511 to 1514 he concentrated on printmaking The famous works he made in this period were the thirty seven woodcuts for the Little Passion published first in 1511 and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 1512 In 1513 and 1514 he created his three most famous engravings The Knight Death and the Devil Melencolia I and St Jerome in his Study

Melencolia I has a magic square which is believed to be the first seen in European art The two numbers in the middle of the bottom row give the date of the engraving 1514

In 1515 he created his woodcut of the Rhinoceros The rhinoceros was in Lisbon but Durer never saw it He made it from a sketch and description from another artist It was not very lifelike but still being used in some German school science text books early last century The rhinoceros was from an extinct Indian species

Up to 1520 he produced a wide range of works including portraits in tempera on linen experiments in etching on plates of iron and parts of the Triumphal Arch and the Triumphs of Maximilian which were huge woodcut projects ordered by Maximilian I Holy Roman Emperor

In the summer of 1520 Drer made his fourth and last major journey 

He wanted to renew the Imperial pension Maximilian had given him Maximilian had died in 1519 so the city of Nuremberg stopped paying it Drer also needed new patrons following the death of Maximilian and to avoid an outbreak of sickness in Nuremberg

He took his wife and her maid and left Nuremberg for the Netherlands in July 1520 to be at the coronation of the new emperor Charles V He travelled by the Rhine to Cologne and then to Antwerp where he made many drawings in silverpoint chalk and charcoal 

Drer went to Aachen for the coronation but also made trips to Cologne Nijmegen s Hertogenbosch Brussels Bruges Ghent and Zeeland In Brussels he saw the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land the Aztec treasure that Hernn Corts had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of Mexico Drer wrote that this treasure trove was much more beautiful to me than miracles These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100000 florins Drer appears to have been collecting for his own cabinet of curiosities and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns a piece of coral some large fish fins and a wooden weapon from the East Indies

Drer took many prints with him He wrote in his diary to whom he gave exchanged or sold them and for how much This is some of the few times the price of prints was recorded so historians think it very important to show the values of prints compared to paintings at that time Drer returned home in July 1521 He had an unknown illness which stayed with him for the rest of his life and slowed his rate of work 

Back in Nuremberg Drer started work on a series of religious pictures There are many practice sketches and studies but no big paintings from this time This was partly because of his illness but more because of the time he spent preparing to write books about geometry and perspective the proportions of men and horses and fortification 

His writings show that Drer was highly sympathetic to Martin Luther and he may have been influential in the City Council declaring for Luther in 1525 However he died before religious divisions had hardened into different Catholic and Protestantchurches Drer probably thought of himself as a reform minded Catholic 

Drer died in Nuremberg at the age of 56 He left money and goods worth 6874 florins  a considerable sum His workshop was a part of his large house His widow lived there until her death in 1537 The house is now a museum

El Greco was a painter sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance He usually signed his paintings in Greek letters with his full name Domnicos Theotokpoulos showing his Greek origin

El Greco was born in Crete which was the center of Post Byzantine art at that time He trained and became a master of that kind of art before travelling at 26 to Venice as other Greek artists had done In 1570 he moved to Rome and opened a workshop and made a series of works While he was in Italy El Greco added elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance to his style In 1577 at the age of 36 he moved to Toledo Spain where he lived and worked until his death in 1614 In Toledo El Greco painted his best known paintings

El Grecos dramatic and expressionist style puzzled other painters at the time but came to be appreciated in the 20th century El Greco is considered to have influenced both the Expressionism and Cubism styles His personality and works inspired poets and writers like Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis Many modern scholars think that El Greco belongs to no conventional school He is best known for long figures and often fantastic or dramatic coloring combining Byzantine traditions with Western painting traditions His paintings generally have very bright parts contrasting with very dark parts

Born at 7 Melville Road Cambridge John Maynard Keynes was the son of John Neville Keynes an economics lecturer at Cambridge University and Florence Ada Brown a successful author and a social reformer His younger brother Geoffrey Keynes was a surgeon and bibliophile and his younger sister Margaret married the Nobel prize winning physiologist Archibald Hill

Keynes early romantic and sexual relationships were almost all with men One of his great loves was the artist Duncan Grant whom he met in 1908 and he was also involved with the writer Lytton Strachey Keynes appeared to turn away from homosexual relationships around the time of the first World War In 1918 he met Lydia Lopokova a well known Russian ballerina and they married in 1925

Keynes was a successful investor building up a big fortune He nearly lost all of his money after the Stock Market Crash of 1929 but he soon got back his fortune He enjoyed collecting books for example he collected and protected many of Isaac Newtons papers

Bertrand Russell said Keynes was the most intelligent person he had ever known commenting Every time I argued with Keynes I felt that I took my life in my hands and I seldom emerged without feeling something of a fool

Keynes went to Kings College Cambridge in 1902 to study mathematics but moved to economics which he studied at Cambridge under AC Pigou and Alfred Marshall Marshall is believed to have prompted Keyness shift in interest from mathematics and classics to economics Keynes received his BA in 1905 and his MA in 1908

Keynes accepted a lectureship at Cambridge in economics funded personally by Alfred Marshall Soon he was appointed to the Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance where he was able to put economic theory into practice

During World War I he worked for the Adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and to the Treasury on Financial and Economic Questions

Keynes also attended the Conference on the Versailles Treaty to end World War I He wrote The Economic Consequences of the Peace in 1919 and A Revision of the Treaty in 1922 In his books he said that the reparations which Germany was being made to pay would ruin the German economy and would lead to further fighting in Europe These predictions were shown to be true when the German economy suffered in the hyperinflation of 1923 Reparations were only completed in 2010

Keyness magnum opus was the General Theory of Employment Interest and Money was published in 1936 The ideas in that book were very different from classical economics

Historians agree that Keynes influenced US president Roosevelts New Deal but disagree as to what extent Spending more the government earned in taxes was used in the New Deal from 1938 But the idea had been agreed to by President Herbert Hoover Few senior economists in the US agreed with Keynes in the 1930s With time however his ideas became more widely accepted

In 1942 Keynes was raised to the House of Lords as Baron Keynes of Tilton in the County of Sussex where he sat as a Liberal member

During World War II Keynes argued in How to Pay for the War that the war effort should be largely financed by higher taxation rather than deficit spending in order to avoid inflation

Keynes died of myocardial infarction at his holiday home in Tilton East Sussex His heart problems were made worse by the strain of working on post war international financial problems He died soon after he arranged a guarantee of an Anglo American loan to Great Britain Keynes father John Neville Keynes outlived his son by three years Keyness brother Sir Geoffrey Keynes was a distinguished surgeon scholar and bibliophile His nephews include Richard Keynes a physiologist and Quentin Keynes an adventurer and bibliophile

The American Robin is a migratory songbird It is also known as the North American Robin It belongs in the thrush family Turdidae It was named after the European Robin This is because the European Robin has a bright orange red face and breast The two species are not closely related The American Robin has seven subspecies T m confinis is the most different subspecies

The American Robin lives throughout North America It is a rare vagrant to western Europe It has also been a vagrant to Greenland Jamaica Hispaniola Puerto Rico and Belize The American Robin can be found in many different kinds of habitats It likes open areas of ground to feed and areas with trees or shrubs to broken wikt linkbreedbreed and sleep Because it has a large range the IUCN Red List says that the American Robin will not decline and is listed as Least Concern

The American Robin begins to breed shortly after returning to northern North America after spending the winter in the south The female will choose where to build the nest She will make the nest with grass sticks paper feathers rootlets and moss Once the nest is built she will lay 3 to 5 eggs After the chicks leave the nest both parents will continue to take care of them until they can live on their own

American Robin eggs and juveniles are eaten by squirrels snakes Blue Jays Common Grackles American Crows and Common Ravens The adults are eaten by hawks cats and larger snakes Sometimes the Brown headed Cowbird lays its eggs in the Robins nest This is called brood parasitism However the Robin usually rejects the cowbird eggs

This species was first described in 1766 by Linnaeus It was described in the twelfth edition of his Systema naturae He called it Turdus migratorius This name comes from two Latin words The first word Turdus means thrush The second word migratorius comes from migrare which means to go The term robin has been recorded and used for this species since 1703

The American Robin is large songbird It has a round body Its legs are long It has a long tail It has a long yellow bill It is dark gray brown on its head back wings and tail It has an orange red breast There is a white patch on the underside of the belly near the tail This can be seen when it is flying American Robins that live in western North America are very pale American Robins that live in eastern Canada are very bright They have a white throat It has black stripes in it Females have lighter gray brown heads than males They also have lighter orange red breasts A young American Robin is also lighter than the male It has dark spots on its breast Both sexes are 2028 cm long They have a wingspan of 3140 cm American Robins that live in western North America are very pale American Robins that live in eastern Canada are very bright

The American Robin was named after the European Robin This is because the European Robin has a bright orange red face and breast The two species are not closely related

The American Robin has seven subspecies They are very hard to tell apart The different subspecies will breed with each other

The American Robin can be found all over North America It is found from Alaska and Canada south to Mexico Most American Robins winter in Florida and the Gulf States to Mexico to the Pacific Coast They will sometimes winter in southern Canada and the northern United States

The American Robin is a rare vagrant to western Europe Most of the American Robins have been found in Britain The most recent sighting of an American Robin in Britain was in January 2007 It has also been a vagrant to Greenland Jamaica Hispaniola Puerto Rico and Belize

American Robins are found in many different kinds of habitats Some of them are gardens parks yards fields pastures tundra woodlands pine forests and shrublands They like open areas of ground to feed They like areas with trees or shrubs to breed and sleep

The American Robin has a large range It is estimated that its range is 16 million square kilometers It is also estimated that there are about 320 million individual American Robins The IUCN Red List says that the species is not believed to reach the threat of decline It is therefore considered Least Concern

American Robins used to be killed for their meat They were killed in the southern states The meat was thought as a very good food The American Robin is now protected in the United State by the Migratory Bird Act

The American Robin is most active during the day During the winter it groups together in large flocks at night They sleep together in thick vegetation During the day these large winter flocks break up into smaller flocks They feed in these smaller flocks During the summer American Robins are less social This is because they are defending their breeding territories

Juvenile Robins spend their first four months of life near their nesting place They then flock together with other American Robins before they migrate to their wintering places

The American Robin eats invertebrates In the spring they like to eat earthworms and snails Some other invertebrates that American Robins eat are beetles grubs and caterpillars It will also eat fruits and berries Some kinds of berries that they like to eat are chokecherries hawthorn berries dogwood berries sumac fruits and juniper berries

The American Robin begins to breed shortly after returning to northern North America after spending the winter in the south It is one of the first North American birds to lay eggs It has two to three broods each breeding season The breeding season starts in April and ends in July It is one of the first birds to sing at dawn Its song is made up of several small groups of sounds that are repeated

The female chooses where to make the nest She will usually make the nest on one or many branches that are hidden in leaves In the west the female will make the nest on the ground or in thickets In Alaska the female will make the nest on a cliff The female makes the nest She starts with the inside She uses grass and sticks to make a cup shaped center Other things that the female will use are paper feathers rootlets and moss After the center is done she uses mud on the outside of the nest to make it stronger She then puts soft grass in the cup The nest is usually 152 to 203 cm long It is 76 to 152 cm high

The female will lay 3 to 5 eggs in the nest They are blue or blue green They are 28 to 3cm long They are 21 cm wide Only the female incubates the eggs It takes 12 to 14 days for the eggs to hatch

For the first few days the chicks have no feathers and their eyes are closed The young live in the nest for about 13 days As the chicks grow older the female will protect them only at night and during bad weather After the juveniles leave the nest they will follow their parents around and beg them for food

Both parents help feed and protect the fledged juveniles until they can live on their own The adults will give an alarm call to warn the juveniles that there is a predator near by The parents will then attack the predator Some of the predators they will attack are cats and dogs They will even go after humans if the human gets close to their young Fledged juveniles are only able to fly short distances The coloring of the juveniles helps them hide better in bushes or trees This kind of coloring is called camouflage

Bird banders have found that only 25 of juvenile American Robins live through their first year The average life of an American Robin lasts about 2 years The longest known lifespan of a wild American Robin is 14 years

Eggs and juvenile Robins that still live in the nest are eaten by squirrels and snakes Some birds also eat eggs and juvenile Robins These birds are Blue Jays Common Grackles American Crows and Common Ravens The adult American Robin is eaten by hawks cats and larger snakes When feeding together in flocks American Robins will watch each other for signs of predators If a predator is seen they will make a warning call Sometimes the Brown headed Cowbird lays its eggs in the Robins nest This is called brood parasitism The Robin usually rejects the cowbird eggs Because of this brood parasitism by the cowbird is rare

The American Robin is known to carry a disease called the West Nile Virus This disease comes from mosquitoes Crows and jays are the first to die from this disease The American Robin is more responsible for the transmission of the disease to humans This is because the American Robin lives longer with the disease than the crows and jays This allows the American Robin to spread the disease to more mosquitoes which then spread the disease to humans and other animals

The American Robin is the state bird of Connecticut Michigan and Wisconsin It was also shown on a 1986 Canadian 2 note but it is no longer on the bill

There is color named after the American Robins eggs It is called Robins egg blue

The Robin is considered a symbol of spring A good example is a poem by Emily Dickinson It is called I Dreaded That First Robin So There are other poems about the first robin of spring One of them is The First Robin by Dr William H Drummond According to the authors wife it is based on a Quebec false belief The belief says that whoever sees the first robin of spring will have good luck

New Age music is a type of music which is often related to New Age belief It is usually soft and instrumental it means only few New Age music pieces have a singer New Age music is good for resting thinking and meditation

One of the first people in this genre was Stephen Halpern He created music to be used for meditation He could not find a record company for his works so he published them himself and sold them in New Age stores His music is very relaxing and has a slow rhythm

Some of the famous artists who work in this field are Yanni Kitar Jean Ven Robert Hal Loreena McKennitt Vangelis Enya and George Winston

When Dupr gave organ recitals he often played his own compositions as well as those of other composers especially Bach Like Widor and Vierne he composed long works in several movements which he called symphonies When he played in church services he would start by playing composed music which was suitable for the time of year Then he would improvise playing complicated fugues trio sonatas and chorale improvisations He was so good at improvising that many people thought he had composed the music beforehand

When playing in concerts he was often given a tune and then he would immediately make up a large work from that tune In 1906 when he was still a student he played for a wedding and two services when the famous Widor was going to be absent Dupr asked Widor what music he should play Widor told him to improvise something Dupr waited for Widor to go out of the church before he started practising but Widor crept back in and listened to him He realized that Dupr would manage very well

Dupr was famous as an organ teacher He taught two generations of well known organists including Jehan Alain Marie Claire Alain Pierre Cochereau Jeanne DemessieuxJean Guillou Jean Langlais and Olivier Messiaen 

Dupr composed a great deal of organ music When he was a boy he got to know Aristide Cavaill Coll the most famous organ builder in France Cavaill Coll had built the organ that Duprs father played so he was used to the sound of modern French organs  Most of Duprs music for the organ is very difficult to play It includes the Three Preludes and Fugues Op 7 Even Widor thought that the Prelude of the third piece was simply impossible to perform However Dupr could play it and many organists after him learned to play it too Other notable works of Duprs include the Symphonie Passion the Esquisses and vocation and the Cortge et Litanie 

As well as composing lots of music Dupr prepared study editions of the organ works of Bach Handel Mozart Liszt Mendelssohn Schumann Csar Franck and Alexander Glazunov He also wrote music for people who were learning to play the organ and books on how to improvise on the organ

Montmartre is a hill 130 metres high and is also the name of the district which surrounds the hill It is situated in the north of Paris and famous for its nightlife

Many artists had studios or worked around the community of Montmartre such as Salvador Dal Claude Monet Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh

Montmartre means mountain of the martyr it owes its name to the martyrdom of Saint Denis who was decapitated on the hill around 250 AD Saint Denis was the Bishop of Paris and is the patron saint of France

The hills religious symbolism is thought to be even older as it has been suggested as a likely druidic holy place because it is the highest point in the area

Notrium is a freeware video game for the PC It is at version 1341 Notrium was developed by independent Finnish programmer Ville Mnkknen It is the seventh game that Ville has made but it is only the fifth game to be made in English Released in 2003 it won second place in the Adventure Game of the Year contest on GameTunnel

The game takes place on the invented planet Notrium The game world is split up into squares each of which has its own climate land and goals The player can move between squares to reach the other areas though some of the areas can only be reached by using vehicles or teleportation There are climates such as jungle desert and tundra All area squares can are changed by a day night cycle except for levels that are set indoors

The games graphics are all randomly generated at the start of the game except in special game areas This random generation changes where items and plants are though most items and scenery will stay in their environment square Environment squares do not change when the game is started For example a tree in the Jungle zone will be put in a different place each time a new game is begun but the player character will still start in the same place as always

The plot of the game is that a team of four an Alien a Human an Android and a Psionic creature have left Earth in a spacecraft because Earth was going to be destroyed After the player has chosen the character heshe wants to control the game begins The spacecraft is shot at by missiles from the planet Notrium which is close by The players character gets into an escape pod and crashes on the planets surface From there the player must find a way to survive as well as a way to escape

Journal entries which are different for each character appear every game day for two game weeks These entries tell about what happened to the characters while they were on the spacecraft For example the journal of the Human tells that he was the captain of the ship while the journal of the Android shows that he was the ships mechanic Other happenings can be discovered by going to special places in the game or finishing a goal

Notrium has more than one ending to the game Different characters can get different endings Some endings can only be won by one character while other endings can be won by other characters as well

A person plays Notrium looking from a top down view The player may move in all directions while facing in a different one similar to the way a first person shooter is controlled and similar to the freeware PC shooter game Crimsonland 

During the game the player can find items and objects such as plants weapons and machines Most important items like a force field to protect the character are not found in one piece The player can build them out of two or three other parts 

Gameplay is about collecting parts to build defending from enemies and then winning one of the games endings Depending on the character the player has picked the game is played in a different way The fast moving Alien starts with a very strong attack and gets more attacks over time but it cannot use any weapons The Human starts with a very weak attack but he can make many weapons and armor to get more powerful 

The game also has weather If Notrium is played on a setting harder than easy the character will be changed by the weather Standing near a fire will make the player more hot and standing under a tree will make the player less hot In some areas of the game there is dangerous weather like sandstorms blizzards or acid rain

Notrium was made to be easy to mod and a guide about how to change is is on Villes website When the player starts a new game after getting a new mod he or she can choose what mod they want to play 

Mods can make many changes such as putting new items or goals into the game changing or making new environment squares Mods can even make a new character that the player can choose such as in the Werivar mod

Burj Khalifa or Khalifa Tower is a very tall skyscraper in Dubai United Arab Emirates Before the building opened it was called Burj Dubai The building is 160 stories high Construction of the tower was started in 2004 The building was opened on 4 January 2010 It is the tallest structure made by humans in the world The building is more than convert300mft taller than Taipei 101 Taipei 101 was the tallest building before Burj Khalifa was built 

Adrian Smith designed the tower He worked with Skidmore Owings and Merrill until 2006 It was built by Samsung Engineering Construction Besix and Arabtec The tower cost US 15 billion to build The building is part of a 2km building project on Sheikh Zayed Road Downtown Burj Khalifa It is located near Dubais main business district

The main contractor was Samsung CT of South Korea They also built the Taipei 101 and Petronas Twin Towers Other contractors who helped with the building included Belgian group Besix and Arabtec from the UAE The Turner Construction Company was chosen as the construction project manager 

The design architect Adrian Smith did not like the first design of the upper part of the building He added 27 new floors and an aluminium spire to the top of the plans The design of Burj Khalifa based on those used in Islamic architecture Burj Khalifa has been said to have had several other planned height increases since it was first built This has not been proven to be true yet The TVradio communications mast was added to the towers plans in 2007 This was after building work had begun in 2006 Pressurized air conditioned refuge floors are located about every 35 floors These were put into the tower in case of an emergency or fire

The unusual design and engineering problems of building Burj Khalifa have been shown in many television documentaries These include the Big Bigger Biggest series on the National Geographic and Five channels and the Mega Builders series on the Discovery Channel

The most important building materiel of Burj Khalifa is reinforced concrete A special concrete was needed because of the high pressures of the buildings weight and the hot local climate Persian Gulf temperatures that can reach convert50cf Any major cracks could have could have caused a large amount of damage to the building

The foundation of the building is Convert15mft deep It was built with 192 columns being put into the ground Each column was 15m in diameter and 43m long 55000 tonnes of steel rebar was used in the construction of the tower It took 22 million man hours to build A high density low permeability concrete was used in the foundations of Burj Khalifa A cathodic protection system is used to lessen any bad effects from corrosive chemicals in local ground water

A fountain system was built outside the tower It was designed by WET Design of California They built and planned out the fountains at the Bellagio Hotel Lake in Las Vegas The fountain cost Dh800 million It is lit by 6600 lights and 50 coloured projectors The fountain is 275ft long It shoots water 150ft into the air to the sounds of classical and modern Arabic and world music On 26 October 2008 the fountain was named the Dubai Fountain

Emaar Properties said on 9 June 2008 that construction of Burj Khalifa was slowed because of changes to finishes An Emaar official said that the luxury finishes that were decided on in 2004 when the tower was first planned were being being replaced by better finishes The design of the apartments were also made better This was done to make them both look better and work better Their were problems with the marble decorations flooring the top floors sanitation system broken glasswork and a poorly done wall mural of the Sultan of Oman A new ending date of 2 December 2009 was then given Burj Khalifa opened on 4 January 2010

Burj Khalifa was built mainly by people from South Asia Press reports said in 2006 that skilled carpenters at the site earned UK434 a day and labourers earned UK284 According to a BBC investigation and a Human Rights Watch report the workers lived in very bad conditions Often they were not paid for the work Their passports were taken by their employers It was said that they were working in dangerous conditions that caused high number of deaths and injuries Companies not paying workers has been reported to the authorities several times

On 21 March 2006 about 2500 workers protested They were mad about buses that were delayed for the end of their shifts They damaged cars offices computers and construction equipment A Dubai Interior Ministry official said they caused almost UK500000 in damage Most of the workers who were part of the riot returned the following day but would not work

The building is not only the tallest structure in the world it also holds the following records

The Henry Head bunker is found on the La Perouse side of the inlet to Botany Bay near the edge of a cliff that drops down into the ocean on Henry Head La Perouse New South Wales Australia 

This fort and bunker building was built in between 1892  1895 with a large disappearing gun emplacement The fort was used until 1910 upon which the fort became useless

The fort that had 2 six inch gun emplacements and special lookout positions was reused during World War II to protect the entrance to Botany Bay The underground bunker and tunnels inside the fort had vaulted weapons storage rooms with double walls and ceilings The doubling up of walls and ceilings was a special way of stoppng the walls from collapsing if the fort suffered a direct hit from a missile fired from an enemy ship The battery is currently not in use ImageWWIIBunkA HENRYHEAD0042JPGDisappearing gun emplacement ImageWWIIBunkA HENRYHEAD0107JPGLooking at the back wall of the inside bunker ImageWWIIBunkA HENRYHEAD0030JPGGun emplacement ImageWWIIBunkA HENRYHEAD0110JPGInside the underground section of the fort ImageWWIIBunkA HENRYHEAD0092JPGOne of the hallways forming part of the underground complex ImageWWIIBunkA HENRYHEAD0105JPGGun emplacement ImageWWIIBunkA HENRYHEAD0023JPGGun emplacement looking south along the coast ImageWWIIBunkA HENRYHEAD0055JPG 

The Georges Head Fort is located on the Georges Head in the suburb of Mosman in Sydney New South Wales Australia The Georges Head fort is one of many forts that were built on Sydney Harbour meant to defend the colony of New South Wales just encase another country tried to invade our country Australia The fort became the boss of all other forts in the 1890s organizing all of Sydneys harbour forts 

The area where the fort now stands was once home to Aborigines that lived in the area for thousands of years and long before Europeans visited and decided to stay 

Georges Head fort was built in 1871 after the British Army decided to leave Australia in 1870 When they left the responsibility for protecting Sydney and Sydney Harbour was now in the hands of rich colonies like New South Wales and Victoria who now had to organise its own defences

Georges Head was near the entrance to Sydney Harbour and was meant to attack baddies before they could get into the harbour The fort was on a very good spot and was positioned high above sea level with clear views to the entrance of Port Jackson Other forts were also on Middle Head South Head Shark Point and Bradleys Head but none were ever used for fighting ships or troops from other countrys

Georges Head was armed with four 80 pounder cannons and two 68 pounder cannons These cannons were muzzle loading which meant the cannon balls or bullets along with the explosive charge were loaded into the front of the cannons barrel It took three months and 250 soldiers to roll the gun barrels all the way from North Sydney to the forts They came along a dirt road which later became Military Road Once they were put in place the cannons had been placed so close together that it created the risk of one cannon firing upon another Also the cannons and the men could be seen from ships in the harbour In 1877 large mounds of earth were placed between the pits to make sure the guns neither could fire upon each other and to help protect the gun crew from enemy fire When construction of the fort was finalised there were a total of 41 gun emplacements around Sydney Harbour

The planning of defence was planned using telescopes and plotters sitting in the middle of the second gun pit From the telephone exchange the Port Jackson District Commandant could talk with all the other forts around the harbour Telephone wires ran through tunnels down the cliff and under the harbour to forts on the other side

Georges Head was later chosen as the best place to spy and fire mines which were laid underwater In 1888 Georges Head battery was upgraded for the latest in harbour defences in the form of submarine bombs Minefields were laid across the main shipping channels of Port Jackson from 1876 to 1922 and a base was built at Chowder Bay for the submarine miners From Georges Head miners watched for ships entering the harbour Their job was to explode the mine closest to an approaching enemy ship Each underwater mine was attached to an electric cable that ran up the cliff to the firing post

The work of the submarine miner was secretive technical and dangerous During a demonstration in 1891 a crowd of several thousand watched as a terrible accident killed four miners and injured another eight

Ful was the pen name of the poet Muhammad bin Suleyman He is one of the greatest contributors to the Dvn tradition of Turkish literature 

Fuzl wrote his collected poems in three different languages Azerbaijani Turkish Persian and Arabic Although his Turkish works are written in Azerbaijani he knew both the Ottoman and the Chagatai Turkish literary traditions as well He was also very able in mathematics and astronomy

Fuzl was born around 1483 in what is now Iraq he was probably born in either Karbal or an Najaf Fuzls ancestors had been of nomadic origin but his family had long since settled in towns

Fuzl was educated by his fatherwho was a mufti in the city of Al Hillah and then by a teacher named Rahmetullah It was during this time that he learned the Persian and Arabic languages in addition to his native Azerbaijani 

One of the few things that is known of Fuzls life during this time is how he arrived at his pen name In the introduction to his collected Persian poems he says In the early days when I was just beginning to write poetry every few days I would set my heart on a particular pen name and then after a time change it for another because someone showed up who shared the same name Eventually he decided upon the Arabic word fuzlwhich literally means impertinent improper unnecessarybecause he knew that this title would not be acceptable to anyone else Despite the names pejorative meaning however it contains a double meaningwhat is called tevriyye in Ottoman Divan poetry as Fuzl himself explains I was possessed of all the arts and sciences and found a pen name that also implies this sense since in the dictionary fuzl is given as a plural of fazl and has the same rhythm as ulm and fnn

In 1534 the Ottoman sultan Sleymn I conquered the region of Baghdad where Fuzl lived from the Safavid Empire Fuzl now had the chance to become a court poet under the Ottoman patronage system and he composed a number of poems in praise of the sultan and as a result he was granted a stipend But he did not really get it Therefore he citicized bureaucracy in one of his best known works the letter ikyetnme

The loss of his stipend meant that Fuzl never became secure He died during a plague outbreak in 1556 in Karbal either of the plague itself or of cholera

Klids was the author of Meghadoot Shkuntal and other works in Sanskrit He has a similar place in Sanskrit as a poet and a dramatist as Shakespeare in English 

Klidss plays and poetry are based on Hindu mythology and philosophy He is a master of imagination

There is very little that one knows about the life of Klids pretty sure It is not clear where he lived and the time range when he might have lived lasts from 130 BC to 600 CE

Klids did not mention in his works any king as his patron

Klids wrote three plays Mlawikgnimitra Abhijnashkuntala and Vikramorwasheeya Abhijnashkuntala that is regarded as a masterpiece was the first to be translated into English and German

Mlawikgnimitra tells the story of King Agnimitra who falls in love with the picture of an exiled servant girl named Mlavik When the queen discovers her husbands passion for a servant girl she becomes very angry and orders that this girl is sent to prison but it turns out that the girl is a princess therefore the affair is accepted in the end

Abhijnashkuntala tells the story of a king Dushyanta who meets in the forests Shakuntal the adopted daughter of a wise man who lives with him in a cottage in the forests Dushyanta and Shakuntal fall in love with each other and get married Dushyanta stays with Shakuntal in the forests for while until he gets called back to his court for some pressing matter After many difficulties there follows a happy end 

Vikramrwasheeya is more mystical than the above two plays

Klids wrote two very good epic poems Raghuvamsha and Kumrasambhawa and the lyrical Meghadoota and Rutusamhra

A hydraulis is an early type of pipe organ that was powered by water It was invented in the 3rd century BC probably by the Hellenistic scientist Ctesibius of Alexandria It was the worlds first keyboard instrument Many centuries later it developed into the modern pipe organ

The water organ works by having water and air arriving together in the camera aeolis Here water and air separate and the compressed air is driven into a wind trunk on top of the camera aeolis to blow the organ pipes Two perforated splash plates or diaphragms stop the water spray from getting into the organ pipes 

The water having been separated from the air leaves the camera aeolis at the same speed as it enters It then drives a water wheel which in turn drives the musical cylinder and the movements attached To start the organ the tap above the entry pipe is turned on and given a continuous flow of water the organ plays until the tap is closed again 

During the Renaissance many Italian gardens had water organs The most famous water organ of the 16th century was at the Villa dEste in Tivoli It was about 6 metres high and was powered by a beautiful waterfall It could play three pieces automatically but there was also a keyboard

A User interface allows a user to interact with a machine User interfaces mainly provide two things

Many machines can be very dangerous A machine should have a user interface that can be handled easily even if the person operating the machine has panicked The user interface should therefore be intuitive and simple to use An example of such a user interface is that of the kill switch A kill switch must shut off the machine at all costs  the idea is to avoid injury or harm to people This is very different from shutting off the machine at the end of the shift or when it is no longer needed

According to EN ISO 13850 the kill switch has to be red on a yellow background 

The colors used to mark different states are close to those used by signals used on the road

There may be additional symbols for example

In many cases such symbols are better because some people are color blind They need to be explained like warnings though

The word Bohemian was first used in Paris to mean a Gypsy because many people thought that Gypsies came from Bohemia The word was then used in the late 19th century for poor painters writers musicians and actors who often travelled to Paris from other towns and tried to earn money Paris was a famous town for painters writers and musicians to gather to learn from each other and to enjoy the life of the city Many of them lived at Montmartre not far from the Moulin Rouge One of the most famous painters to live in Montmartre was Henri Toulouse Lautrec He loved to paint the can can dancers and prostitutes He did many posters to advertise the nightclubs The posters are now famous works of art 

In the 20th century the word Bohemian spread to other countries and was used to describe the lives of many different artists of different sorts The sort of behaviour that was thought of as Bohemian included whether a person had a regular job how they dressed their political views their religious views their sexual behaviour and the entertainment they liked 

People who were called Bohemians were often very poor because they tried to live by painting acting or writing It was hard to make a living They generally wore old or second hand clothing and could not afford a good hair cut They often shared the room in the roof of a house which was cheap because it was cold in winter hot in summer and often had birds living there as well In some ways the life of a bohemian artist was difficult but it gave people freedom to express themselves that was often not found in more conservative society where everyone worried about what other people thought of them and cared a lot about things like clothes and houses Sometimes students from richer families would come to live a Bohemian life style so that they could feel the same freedom to express themselves 

During the 20th century many cities apart from Paris have areas where people have lived Bohemian lifestyles One of the problems is that these areas often become fashionable for rich people This soon drives away the poor artists and students because they can no longer afford the rent

Henry Willis was a British builder of pipe organs He built a very large number of organs many of them for big cathedrals and concert halls in Britain such as St Pauls Cathedral Truro Cathedral and the Royal Albert Hall He also built an organ for Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle Many of the organs that he built are in other parts of the world especially in countries that belonged to the British Empire 

Many organists who gave organ recitals liked Henry Williss organs because they had lots of different sounds which helped to make the organ sound like an orchestra He made organs for churches where the architects were getting rid of the central screen so that the organ could be heard better in the main part of the church He used ideas that had been created by the French organ builder Cavaill Coll and by Barker He made several inventions himself including the thumb piston which made it possible for an organist to change the combination of stops without taking his hands off the keyboard

Four generations of the Willis family continued the family tradition of organ building until 1997 when Henry Willis the fourth retired and the new Managing Director of the firm was not a member of the Willis family The Company founded in 1845 Henry Willis Sons Ltd still makes organs in Liverpool

Aristide Cavaill Coll was a French organ builder Most organists think of him as the greatest organ builder of the 19th century and one of the greatest who ever lived He invented many new things and his organs changed the way that composers could write for the instrument Csar Franck and Charles Marie Widor in particular were strongly influenced by the new type of organ that he was building

Cavaill Coll grouped the stops of the organ into different families so that the result was similar to the families of instruments in an orchestra He made the lowest of the three manuals the most important one It was called the Great The other manuals could be coupled to the Great He made changes to the English swell box and divided the windchests on which the pipes were resting This made it possible to have louder reed stops because of the higher wind pressure

In music a voluntary is a piece of music usually for organ which is played as part of a church service The music that an organist plays before and after a service is always called a voluntary

The word voluntary can be used for the title of a piece of music  The title was often used by English composers in the late Renaissance or Baroque periods for a piece of organ music that was free in style ie it did not have to be composed in a strict form such as sonata form or a fugue It was meant to sound as if it was being improvised

Composers such as Orlando Gibbons John Blow and Henry Purcell wrote voluntaries although sometimes they preferred to use other titles such as fancy or even fugue However these fugues were not composed in the proper fugue style they just started off with imitation as in a fugue but continued in a freer style

Some voluntaries were called double voluntaries These were pieces written for organs with two manuals The pieces contrasted a loud manual with a soft one

Some voluntaries were known as trumpet voluntaries These were voluntaries which had a tune which was played on a stop called a trumpet or a cornet Two very famous trumpet voluntaries often played at weddings are the trumpet voluntary by Henry Purcell and the one by Jeremiah Clarke In the 18th century the composer John Stanley wrote many trumpet voluntaries

The German word Burgermeister often spelled in English as Burgomaster or Burgomeister means master of the citizens

Area codes in Germany for telephones have two to five digits not counting the first zero The first or leading zero must be dialled when calling from inside Germany and not when calling from outside Germany The area code is not needed when dialling another telephone in the same area unless one of the telephones is a mobile phone Usually shorter area codes are used by larger cities and longer area codes to smaller towns

The first digit shows the region1 are special numbers such as mobile phones shared cost service televoting numbers and 010 for dial around services The OLD codes 0130 for free phone numbers and 0190 for premium rate numbers are now moved to 0800 and 0900 to meet international standards

German car number plates show the place where the car carrying them is registered When a person changes their main home in Germany or buys a new car they must buy new number plates 

Number plates can be bought which are valid all year round or between 2 to 11 months within any 12 months This allows changing between summer and winter cars such as a convertible and a sedansaloon without having the time and money wasted for de and re registering 

The present number plate format used since 1994 uses black print on a white background and first provides information about the country where the car is registered within the European Union German licence plates show a D on the blue strip on the left which shows the European Unions flag 12 golden stars in a circle on blue ground

After that there are between one and three letters for the city or region where the car is registered such as B for Berlin These units usually coincide with the German districts in few cases an urban district and the surrounding district share the same letter code Usually if an urban district and a rural district share the code the number of the following letters is different For example the urban district SR has one letter after the code The surrounding district Straubing Bogen has two letters after the code It depends on the number of registered cars whether the City or the district has two letters because there are more possibilities with two letters so the part with more citizens usually has two letters For example the urban district Regensburg has more citizens than the rural district Regensburg so the city has two letters after the code R  

The number of letters in the cityregion code usually shows the size and location of the district the largest German cities generally only have one letter codes most other districts in Germany have two or three letter codes Districts in eastern Germany usually have more letters for two reasons

This is only a rule of thumb there are a number of exceptions eg Germanys second largest city Hamburg or the west German district Ammerland

The reason for this scheme is however not to display size or location but simply to have enough combinations available within the maximum length of eight characters per plate

After the location name there are the emission test and vehicle safety test stickers followed by one or two letters and one to four numbers These letters and numbers can be chosen by the vehicle owner or if they prefer random ones can be allocated by the licensing office The total quantity of letters and numbers on the plate is never higher than eight One letter with low numbers are normally reserved for motorcycle use since the plate space of these vehicles is smaller

Various combinations that could be considered politically unacceptablemainly due to implications relating to Nazi Germanyare disallowed or otherwise avoided The district Schsische Schweiz uses the name of its main town Pirna in its code PIR to avoid the use of SS the name of the nazi group similarly SA is also unused This is why cars for the government and parliament in Saxony Anhalt are registered with LSA In 2004 in Nuremberg a car owner was refused a number plate beginning N PD because of the connection to the political party the NPD 

Banned combinations include the Nazi abbreviations HJ NS SA SS and KZ Some registration offices have overlooked this rule by mistake however there are a few cars registered carrying prohibited codes such as B SS 12 Some counties also allow these combinations if they are the initials of the owner but in this case if the car is sold and re registered in the same county by the new owner the number can be changed

Certain types of vehicle bear special codes

The German Federal Presidents license plate is 0 1 the Chancellors 0 2 the Foreign Secretarys 0 3 The plate of the President of the Bundestag is an exception it shows 1 1 This is to show that the Bundestags President is not part of the government but still ranks higher in importance than the Chancellor These vehicles are tax exempt and need not to be insured since the German government acts as insurer

Reserved code elements Reserved code elements are codes which while not ISO 3166 1 codes are in use for some applications in conjunction with the ISO 3166 codes The ISO 3166MA therefore reserves them so that they are not used for new official ISO 3166 codes thereby creating conflicts between the standard and those applications

The following alpha 3 codes are subject to an exceptional reservation

The following three codes were also under exceptional reservation until the update from 2006 03 29 included them in the standard

The following alpha 3 codes are subject to a transitional reservation

The following alpha 3 codes are subject to an indeterminate reservation having been notified to the United Nations Secretary General under the 1949 andor 1968 Road Traffic Conventions

Visibility is a word used in meteorology It is used to talk about how far a normal person can see depending on the weather If there is low visibility such as in a blizzard a person will not be able to see far If there is high visibility such as on a bright sunny day a person will be able to see a long way

Visibility less than convert100mft is often called zero When it is this low roads may be closed or lights and signs are turned on to warn drivers These are put in areas that often have very low visibility Warning lights help stop accidents Automobile crashes with many cars happen often in places like this if the warning lights and signs are not put up

Visibility is said to be good when a person can see farther than about 10 kilometers

An advisory is put out by meteorologists to warn of low visibility such as a dense fog advisory from the US National Weather Service These tell drivers to not travel until the fog leaves Airport travel sometimes is delayed or slowed down by low visibility

A blizzard is a large winter storm It brings low temperatures strong winds and a lot of blowing snow Blizzards start when a high pressure system touches as low pressure system The word blizzard is sometimes used incorrectly by news media to talk about big winter storms even if the storm is not a blizzard

Some areas are more likely to be hit by blizzards than others but a blizzard can occur in any place where snow falls In North America blizzards happen often in the northern east states and in the provinces of Canada In this region blizzards can happen more than twice each winter They also occur often in the mountain ranges of western North America Because these regions have low populations blizzards sometimes are not reported

A very dangerous type of blizzard is a whiteout In a whiteout downdrafts and snowfall are so thick that people cannot tell the ground and sky apart People caught in a whiteout lose their sense of direction very fast This is a large danger to pilots when they are flying airplanes because they cannot tell how close they are to the ground and may crash

The Great Blizzard of 1888 was very damaging for the Northeastern United States In that blizzard 400 people died 200 ships sunk and snowdrifts were 10 or 15 feet high In the Great Plains states were hit by the Schoolhouse Blizzard that trapped children in schools and killed 235 people 

In 18801881 there was a winter that people in the Dakotas called the Hard Winter The author Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote her book The Long Winter about that winters story It talks about one blizzard after another and how it changed Lauras family and everybody around her The book is almost all true Her story of two men from the town of DeSmet South Dakota going after some wheat stored some miles south of DeSmet in February 1881 is true and Ingalls later married one of the men Almanzo Wilder If the two men had not found and brought back the wheat the people would have starved The snow and ice thawed in April and the railroads could start again The train picture above was photographed on March 29 1881 not far from DeSmet

34 people died during a 3 day spring blizzard on March 1920 in North Dakota One of the people who died was Hazel Miner a teenage girl who died of freezing to death when she got lost on her way home from her one room school 

The Armistice Day Blizzard in 1940 surprised many people with how fast the temperature dropped It was convert60FC1 in the morning but by noon it was snowing Some of the people froze to death in the snow 154 people died in the Armistice Day Blizzard 

105 years after the Great Blizzard of 1888 a giant blizzard named the Storm of the Century hit the US in 1993 It dropped snow on 26 states and reached as far north as Canada and as far south as Mexico In many southern US areas such as parts of Alabama more snow fell in this storm than ever fell in an entire winter Highways and airports closed across the US The blizzard also made 15 tornadoes in Florida When the storm was over 270 people died and 48 were reported missing

Samuel Sebastian Wesley was an English organist and composer He was the greatest English composer of church music of his day He lived at a time when the standard of music in England had become very bad He did a lot to improve it especially church music He had a hard life earning enough money This was largely his own fault he was a difficult man with a bad temper and often argued with his employers 

He was born in London the illegitimate son of the composer Samuel Wesley and his partner Sarah Suter He was given the name of his father and the name Sebastian after the composer Johann Sebastian Bach 

As a boy he sang in the choir of the Chapel Royal The Chapel Royal was not nearly as good as it had been in the 16th and 17th centuries when it had been associated with many famous composers When choirboys made mistakes the music teacher William Hawes would hit them with a riding whip Samuel Sebastian was an excellent choirboy and he and another boy were sent to Brighton to sing to King George IV who had gone there for his holiday He also sang at St Pauls Cathedral

When he was a young man he played the organ in several churches in London and started to compose He wrote some music for melodramas in theatres When he was 22 he became organist of Hereford Cathedral This changed his life because his career now focussed on church music The choir at Hereford was not very good The organ was broken and his lodgings were not nice However he was able to perform in the Three Choirs Festival and he composed some church music including the popular anthem Blessed be the God and Father written for an Easter Day service when the choir only had boys and one male singer He married the sister of the dean of the cathedral Her family did not approve and did not go to the wedding

In 1835 he moved to Exeter Cathedral He improved the choir there and persuaded the authorities to renovate the organ He had a good salary there but soon got fed up because he argued with his employers He often went fishing instead of going to work sending one of his choir boys to play the organ instead  One day when Wesley was supposed to play God Save the King he played Rule Britannia This sort of behaviour did not do his reputation much good He wanted to get a doctorate degree from Oxford University so he wrote an anthem O Lord thou art my God The professor at Oxford William Crotch wanted him to make some changes in the music but he refused In the end he was given the degree anyway 

The next job he had was at Leeds Parish Church This was the only job he had in his life which was not at a cathedral but his choir at Leeds was probably better than any of the cathedral choirs he had The services there were very good and he improved the choir singing  Leeds was not a nice town in those days It was very badly polluted through industry Wesley earned extra money by giving music lessons He was also in demand for giving organ recitals in different churches He gave the choir more modern music to sing including his own compositions He wrote an introduction to a book of psalm tunes in which he critized the state of the church in England He did it in a very personal way and it made his employers angry

One day he went fishing when he should have been at choir practice He fell when climbing over a stile and broke his leg After that he always walked with a limp While he was in hospital he wrote an anthem Cast me not away to words from Psalm 51 When the music gets to the words the bones which thou hast broken he set them to strange crunching chords

In spite of his awkward behaviour the people in Leeds were sorry when he left He conducted a performance of the Messiah and he was given a portrait of himself

He went to Winchester Cathedral At first he got on very well with the clergy He performed and composed new music He spent a lot of time collecting and publishing all the anthems he had written He composed hymn tunes He persuaded his employers to spend money on improving the organ

Although he was being paid a good salary Wesley did less and less work He performed less and left a lot of the playing to his pupils so that he could go fishing and sailing He did not like the new precentor who was appointed in 1858 

In 1863 he composed an anthem Give the King thy Judgement for the marriage of the Prince of Wales He did not like Winchester He said there were no other good musicians to talk to

When the job of organist at Gloucester Cathedral became available he took it and left Winchester very quicky Once again he found himself in a cathedral with a bad choir and an organ in a bad state of repair but this time he seemed to make little effort to do anything about it He spent a lot of time editing other peoples music Once more after a gap of 30 years he was able to perform in the Three Choirs Festival He conducted the music of Louis Spohr his father Samuel Wesley and also some music by the young Hubert Parry who was not yet well known When he conducted he often did not think about what he was doing and got muddled In 1871 he conducted Bachs St Matthew Passion the first time it had been performed in England outside London 

He was offered a knighthood but chose to be given money instead He started to become ill He had a kidney disease The last time he played the organ was at Christmas in 1875 He died on 19th April 1876 and was buried next to his daughter in Devon There was no music at all at his funeral

Wesley is remembered for his music composed for the Church of England He wrote many anthems including Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace Blessed be the God and Father The Wilderness and Ascribe unto the Lord The last two of these are verse anthems The popular short anthem Lead me Lord is part of Praise the Lord O my soul

He wrote a number of organ works One of his most charming pieces is Holsworthy Church Bells He also wrote chamber and orchestral music

Wesley had an important influence on organ building He went to the Great Exhibition in 1851 and saw organs with pedals that instead of being exactly parallel spread out at the top like a fan He liked these radiating pedal boards and persuaded the great organ builder Henry Willis to put pedal boards like that in the organs he built 

Samuel Sebastian Wesley was a very famous performer and throughout his life he was often asked to play the first concerts on new organs His music is still very popular today and some of his short anthems are not too difficult for the average church choir to sing

The friends have to pay for the meal but they have not got enough money Musetta gets the bill to be paid by Alcindoro The sound of soldiers is heard and picking up Musetta Marcello and Colline carry her out on their shoulders while everyone claps When all have gone Alcindoro arrives with the repaired shoe He looks for Musetta The waiter hands him the bill He is horrified by how much he has to pay and sinks into a chair

At the toll gate

The Hundred Years War was fought between France and England during the late Middle Ages It lasted 116 years from 1337 to 1453 The war started because Charles IV of France died in 1328 without a son Edward III of England then believed he had the right to become the new king of France through his mother 

The French did not want a foreign king so Philip VI of France said he ought to be king because women could not transmit the right to rule to their sons The two countries went to war because of this disagreement

At the beginning of the war France was the stronger of the two countries France had about 17 million people while England had only about 4 million people France had an alliance with Scotland against England and England tried to ally with parts of the Low Countries The English won a great victory at sea in the Battle of Sluys in 1340 which prevented France from invading England After that the war was fought almost totally in France England won again at the Battle of Crcy in 1346 the English longbow was part of the reason for the victory

From 1348 to 1356 there was very little fighting because of the Black Death Then Edward the Black Prince won the Battle of Poitiers for England King John II of France was captured during the battle The English invaded France again but were not able to take any more cities A truce gave England about one quarter of France

The new king Charles V of France was more successful with Bertrand du Guesclin as his best knight The Black Prince was busy at another war and Edward III was too old to lead an army again So France allied with Castile against England and Portugal France won back many French towns from the English during this time A peace followed from 1389 1415

Then the most famous part of the war began Henry V of England invaded France and won the Battle of Agincourt with many bowmen King Charles VI of France was insane and unable to rule and nearly all his sons died young The queen of France Isabeau of Bavaria married one of her daughters to Henry V and signed the Treaty of Troyes to make Henry V the next king of France Both Henry V and Charles VI died at almost the same time So the English believed Henry VI of England was the new king of France and many French people agreed Charles VIs last son Charles VII of France said he ought to be the new king but many people said he did not deserve to be king because somebody else had probably been his father

The English continued to capture land in France until Joan of Arc led the army to success at the Siege of Orleans and the Battle of Patay in 1429 She regained many cities and brought Charles VII to his coronation but she did not recover Paris Her enemies captured and killed her After her death the French continued to take back territory although more slowly France had a diplomatic win in 1435 with the Treaty of Arras The war ended in 1453

Isabeau of Bavaria was queen of France and wife of Charles VI of France She married on July 17 1385 and played an important role in running the country when her husband developed insanity She was very unpopular and the country was losing the Hundred Years War during this time

The cockroach is an insect of the order Blattaria There are 4000 species About 30 species invade human homes This is less than 1 of all the cockroach species Four species are pests 

The families of Mantodea Isoptera and Blattaria are usually combined by entomologists into a larger group called Dictyoptera Current evidence strongly suggests that termites have evolved directly from true cockroaches and many authors now consider termites to be in the family of cockroaches

Historically the name Blattaria has been used largely interchangeably with the name Blattodea Blattodea refers to a larger group that includes fossil groups related to roaches but not true cockroaches themselves These earliest cockroach like fossils are from the Carboniferous period between 354295 million years ago However these fossils differ from modern cockroaches in having long ovipositors and are the ancestors of mantis as well as modern cockroaches The first fossils of modern cockroaches with internal ovipositors appear in the Lower Cretaceous A proposed phylogeny of the families is shown in the diagram

Cockroaches in the broader sense have existed a very long time The earliest cockroach fossils are 354295 million years old Science student Cary Easterday found a giant 300 million year old fossil cockroach convert9cmin0lkonabbron long in a coal mine in Ohio

An inductor is an electrical device used in electrical circuits because of magnetic charge

An inductor is usually made from a coil of conducting material like copper wire that is then wrapped around a core made from either air or a magnetic metal If you use a more magnetic material as the core you can get the magnetic field around the inductor to be pushed in towards the inductor giving it better inductance Small inductors can also be put onto integrated circuits using the same ways that are used to make transistors Aluminum is usually used as the conducting material in this case

While a capacitor does not like changes in voltage an inductor does not like changes in current

Inductors are used often in analog circuits Two or more inductors that have coupled magnetic flux make a transformer Transformers are used in every power grid around the world Inductors are also used in electrical transmission systems where they are used to lower the amount of voltage an electrical device gives off or lower the fault current Because inductors are heavier than other electrical components people have been using them in electrical equipment less often

Al Ibdhiyyah is a form of Islam It is different from the Shia and Sunni denominations It is the dominant form of Islam in only one Muslim country Oman There are also Ibadis in Algeria as well as Libya It is probably one of the earliest schools founded less than 50 years after the death of the prophet Muhammad The sect developed out of the seventh century Islamic sect known as the Khawarij or Kharijites Ibadis do not consider themselves to be Kharijite

The name is from Abdullh ibn Ib at Tamm Followers of this sect however claim its true founder was Jabir ibn Zaid al Azdi from Nizwa Oman

Ib communities are generally seen as conservative Ibiyyah rejects the practice of qunt or supplications while standing in prayer Sunni Muslims traditionally think the Ibiyyah are a Kharijite group Ibs reject this Ibs think other Muslims are not kuffar unbelievers but as kuffar an nima those who deny Gods grace Today this attitude has changed a lot They believe that the attitude of a true believer to others is expressed in three religious obligations

Unlike the Kharijites Ib have abandoned the practice of assassination of mainstream Muslims

Ibs agree with Sunnis in approving of Ab Bakr and Umar ibn al Khattab whom they regard as the two rightly guided Caliphs They think Uthman ibn Affan has introduced bida innovations into Islm They approve of the revolt which overthrew him They also approve of the first part of Als caliphate and like Shias disapprove of ishas rebellion against him and also disapprove of Muwiyyas revolt However they regard Als acceptance of arbitration at the Battle of Siffin against Muwiyyas rebels as un Islamic and as rendering him unfit for the Imamate and they condemn Al for killing the early Kharijites of an Nahr in the Battle of Nahrawan

Ibadis also have several doctrinal differences with orthodox Sunni Islam chief among them

In their belief the fifth legitimate Caliph was Abdullah ibn Wahb al Rasibi All Caliphs from Muwiyya onwards are regarded as tyrants except Umar ibn Abdul Aziz on whom opinions differ However various later Ib leaders are recognized as true imms including Abdullah ibn Yahya al Kindi of South Arabia and the imms of the Rustamid dynasty in North Africa

Ib Muslims are also found in Jabal Nafusa in Libya Mzab in Algeria East Africa and Djerba Island in Tunisia The early medieval Rustamid dynasty in Algeria was Ib and refugees from its capital Tahert founded the North African Ib communities which exist today

The Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or German Workers Party was a political party in Germany just after World War I  It did not last for very long and became the Nazi Party 

Eight days before elections in Bavaria the DAP was founded in Munich in the Caf Gasteig on 5 January 1919 by Anton Drexler and Michael Lotter The DAP grew out of the Free Workers Committee for a Good Peace which Drexler had also started 

Most of the DAPs first members were friends of Drexlers from the Munich rail depot Drexler wanted a party that was nationalist and aimed at ordinary people Most other nationalist parties were middle class parties The first membership was about forty people 

On 24 March 1919 Karl Harrer joined the DAP to try to get more control over the DAP for the Thule Society There were still not many members and meetings were often held in local pubs

When Adolf Hitler was still a corporal in the German army he was ordered to spy on the DAP during one of its meetings at the Sterneckerbru on 12 September 1919

Hitler was very good at making speeches so Anton Drexler asked him to join the party Hitler thought about this and then joined near the end of September 1919 There were no membership numbers or cards when Hitler joined the party In January 1920 the DAP began to give membership cards and numbers They started at number 500 to make the party look bigger Hitler got number 555 but he was also committee member number 7 Later Hitler said he was party member number 7 to make it look like he was a founder member of the DAP 

The small number of party members were quick to believe in Hitlers ideas 

To try to make the party more popular the DAP changed its name on 24 February 1920 to the National Socialist German Workers Party The name was borrowed from a different Austrian party active at the time At first Hitler wanted the new name to be the Social Revolutionary Party but Rudolf Jung persuaded Hitler to use NSDAP

Hitler was the 55th member of the party Other well known early members were

ECW was a professional wrestling brand of World Wrestling Entertainment based on the independent Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion that lasted from 1992 to 2001 It started on June 13 2006 with a weekly television series The ECW brand was one of WWEs three brands the other two being RAW and SmackDown

WWE got Extreme Championship Wrestling and its video library in 2003 and later began reintroducing ECW through a series of DVDs and books The big popularity of ECW merchandise prompted WWE to organize ECW One Night Stand an ECW reunion pay per view in 2005 The financial and critical success of the event encourages WWE to start a second One Night Stand the next year With rejuvenated interest in the ECW product WWE began exploring the possibility of reviving the promotion full time On May 26 2006 WWE announced the launch of ECW as a stand alone brand congruous to Raw and SmackDown with its own show on the Sci Fi Channel Despite initial concerns that professional wrestling would not be accepted by the Sci Fi Channels demographic network President Bonnie Hammer said that she believed ECW would fit the channels theme of stretching the imagination Sci Fi Channel is owned by NBC Universal parent company of USA Network and exclusive cable broadcaster of WWE programming

The ECW brand initially tried to differentiate itself from WWEs other brands The hard cameras were placed in a different location and the ring mat had an ECW logo on it The male performers were also referred to as Extremists as opposed to Superstars and female performers were called Vixens instead of Divas It also had the first ECW talent Later however changes were made to differentiate it from the original ECW promotion including changing the original promotions rules where weapons were legal in all matches and there were rarely any count outs or disqualifications WWE now classifies such matches as having Extreme Rules and are only fought when specified The only pay per view event hosted exclusively by the ECW brand since its launch was December to Dismember in December 2006 On March 14 2007 before another one could be scheduled WWE announced that all future pay per views would feature all three brands 

Former ECW owner Paul Heyman served as the on air ECW Representative According to an interview in the UK newspaper The Sun Heyman wrote the brands weekly scripts and gave them to writers for possible changes and then Vince McMahon for final approval After the December to Dismember 2006 Heyman was relieved from both his on and off air duties with World Wrestling Entertainment After Heyman left there was no ECW authority figure until August 14 2007 when Armando Estrada was announced as the General Manager

ECWs weekly series was first given a thirteen episode run as a summer series on the Sci Fi Channel The first episode got a 279 rating making it the highest rated show on cable in its time slot Because of its good ratings it was given an extended run through the end of 2007 On October 23 2007 the network renewed the series through 2008

While the show started out a ratings success it began drawing criticism from fans of the original ECW early on This was most evident by the negative crowd reaction old school fans gave the main event of Batista vs the Big Show at the August 1 2006 show from Hammerstein Ballroom

On October 16 2007 a talent exchange was started between the SmackDown and ECW brands allowing their respective talent to appear on either brand

At ECWs launch WWEcom introduced Hardcore Hangover a video feature which allowed fans only in the United States to stream or download video footage from the weekly show On October 16 2007 it was replaced by a new feature which made full episodes of the show available for streaming on WWEcom the day after they were shown After making a list of names from fans and conducting an online poll the feature was named ECW X Stream on October 31 2007

ECW brand shows are held in big arenas as a part of the SmackDown brands Tuesday taping schedule This is in sharp contrast to the first Extreme Championship Wrestling which ran most of its events in smaller venues The show usually airs live on Tuesdays directly before when touring the west coast or after SmackDown has taped though it has been recorded and placed on a broadcast delay until later in the night depending on what circumstances dictate

ECWs initial theme song was Bodies by Drowning Pool which had been used by WWE for Extreme Championship Wrestling since before the brand was established Since then the theme song has changed between a number of different songs before settling on Dont Question My Heart sung by Kyle Morrison of the band Shattersphere A remix of Dont Question My Heart by Saliva featuring Brent Smith is now used 

Starting with the January 22 2008 version ECW began broadcasting in HD along with a new HD set which is shared among all three WWE brands

On February 2 2010 WWE Chairman Vince McMahon announced that ECW would be going off the air and would be replaced with a new weekly program in its slot in what McMahon announced as the next evolution of WWE the next evolution of television history It was later announced that the show would air its final episode on February 16 2010 On the February 4 2010 episode of WWE Superstars the new shows name was announced as WWE NXT The ECW brand is set to be disbanded with every ECW wrestler becoming a free agent after the show ends

For Jewish people YHWH is the most holy name of God as written in the ancient Hebrew language The language has no vowels so the pronunciation is not agreed on However most academics agree that Yahweh is one guess of how to say it but probably is not correct 

It has also been pronounced as Jehovah in English or Yehowa in Hebrew This is because Hebrew pointing or vowel symbols are often put under the YHWH making 

Traditionally religious Jews do not say this name aloud This is because it is believed to be too holy to be spoken when there is no Temple in Jerusalem However they often use substitutes when referring to the name of the their God For example they use HaShem or Shem HaMeforash 

Today all three Abrahamic religions say that there is only one god So YHWH is often referred to as just God or Allah However the Jewish Tanakh is not clear on this point It refers to other gods in several places most notably in the versions of the Commandments given at either Mount Sinai or Mount Horeb and detailed in Exodus and Deuteronomy both of which command the Jews not to worship any other god besides YHWH

Sometimes the four letters are called the Tetragrammaton which is Greek for four letters

These four letters are usually JHWH in German French and Dutch and either YHWH YHVH JHWH or JHVH in English In some English language Bibles it is written in all capital letters as LORD as in Jewish tradition Others such as the Jerusalem Bible use Yahweh

Jehovah and Yahweh are the most common English pronunciations of the Tetragrammaton

The name Jehovah is used by the religious organisation of Jehovahs Witnesses

Ruins are the parts of buildings that are left after they have been destroyed and cannot be properly used any more Many ruins are ancient and famous like the ruins of the forum of Ancient Rome or the ruins of Tintagel Castle on the coast of Cornwall Ruins can be caused by wars or by natural disasters such as earthquakes fires and volcanos Sometimes people leave a house or a village to stand empty and move somewhere else When this happens the house or village slowly becomes a ruin 

Historic ruins are often a good place for archaeologists to search for evidence of the way people used to live Often the ruins have all sorts of interesting things buried in them Archaeologists call the things that they find artefacts Artefacts might include beautiful artworks jewellry and gold coins but usually they are ordinary things like cooking pots mugs spoons hair combs pipes old shoes broken toys and rats nests Historians use the evidence found by the archaeologists to write about the place and what might have happened there 

Other people who find ruins very interesting are artists Many artists have drawn or painted pictures of ruined buildings In the 18th and 19th centuries pictures of ruins became very popular

Annaberg is a district in the Free State of Saxony Germany

The district of Annaberg was established in 1874 The capital city was formed in 1945 when the towns of Annaberg and Buchholz were joined to form Annaberg Buchholz

Golden age is an expression that people use when they are talking or writing about a time that is past when everything seemed to be good 

There are several ways that the term can be used 

617 Patroclus is a binary minor planet made up of two similarly sized objects orbiting their common centre of gravity It is a Trojan sharing an orbit with Jupiter It was found in 1907 by August Kopff and was the second Trojan asteroid to be found Recent evidence suggests that the objects are icy comets rather than rocky asteroids

Patroclus orbits in Jupiters trailing Lagrangian point L5 in an orbit called the Trojan node after one of the sides in the legendary Trojan War Patroclus is the only object in the Trojan camp to be named after a Greek character the naming rules for the Trojan asteroids were not made until after Patroclus was named

In 2001 it was found that Patroclus is a binary object made up of two asteroids which are almost the same size In February 2006 a team of astronomers led by Franck Marchis measured accurately the orbit of the system using the Keck Laser guide star adaptive optics system They thoughtrefucb 1 that the two asteroids orbit around their center of mass in 42830004 d at a distance of 68020 km describing a close to circular orbit Putting together their sightings with thermal measurements taken in November 2000 the team thought what the size of the asteroids of the system could be The slightly bigger asteroids which measures 122 km in diameter continues to have the name Patroclus The smaller asteroid measuring 112 km is now named Menoetius after the legendary Patrocluss father Its provisional designation was S2001 1

Because of the density of the asteroids is less than water and about one third that of rock the team of researchers led by F Marchis suggest that the Patroclus system previously thought to be a pair of rocky asteroids is more similar to a comet in make up It is thought that many Trojan asteroids are in fact small planetesimals captured in the Lagrange point of Jupiter Sun system during the farther migration of the giant planets 39 billion years ago This scenario was suggested by A Morbidelli and colleagues in a series of articles published in May 2005 in Nature journal

Fra Angelico was an Italian Early Renaissance painter Giorgio Vasari who wrote the Lives of the Artists said he had a rare and perfect talent

Fra Angelico has been known by many different names When he was born he was called Guido di Pietro People who knew him when he was older called him Fra Giovanni da Fiesole When Giorgio Vasari wrote about him in Lives of the Artists in the 1500s he was already known as Fra Giovanni Angelico

The Italians usually call him il Beato Angelico He has been called this for a long time because he was thought to be blessed by God who gave him the talent of painting and also because he was such a good and holy man The name Blessed Angelico has now been made official because in 1982 Pope John Paul II conferred beatification which means that he is now on the way to being made a saint

Vasari says about him It is impossible to think of enough good things to say about this holy father who was so humble and modest in everything that he did and said and whose pictures were painted with such cleverness and holy faith

Fra Angelico was born in Mugello near Fiesole in Tuscany Italy probably about 138587 and died in Rome in 1455 Nothing is known about his parents He was baptized Guido or Guidolino

In 1407 he joined the Dominican Order at Fiesole In 1423 when he became officially a friar he changed his name from Guido to Fra Giovanni Like the other brothers of the Dominican Order he wore a white robe and a black cloak and shaved part of his head 

Fra Angelico had a brother called Benedetto who was also a Dominican friar Fra Benedetto painted illuminated manuscripts Fra Angelico possibly learnt to paint manuscripts as well The convent of San Marco in Florence has several manuscript books that he is thought to have painted He was very busy with other work at the convents where he lived but he still found time to paint pictures which very soon became famous In January and February of 1418 he was paid for paintings that he did in the church of Santo Stefano del Ponte

Between 1418 and 1436 Fra Angelico painted an altarpiece for the church in Fiesole which has been damaged Age caused the some of the paint to come off or fade and other artists have painted over some of Fra Angelicos work while trying to repair the paintings The top part of the altarpiece is in the National Gallery London It shows Christ in Glory surrounded by more than 250 figures and is a large and magnificent piece of work It has been described as one of the best works in the gallery

In 1436 a new Dominican Convent of San Marco was established in Florence in some older monastery buildings Fra Angelico was one of the friars from Fiesole who moved to Florence This was an important move for Fra Angelico because Florence already had a great number of artists from whom he could learn The convent had a very wealthy patron of the arts called Cosimo de Medici who loved to buy works of art for himself and his favourite churches Cosimo took the largest of the friars rooms called cells at the convent so that he could have a quiet place for religious thought Fra Angelico painted a picture showing the Magi at Bethlehem on the wall of Cosimos cell

Cosimo employed Fra Angelico to paint more pictures for the convent All the cells for the friars were built upstairs around the sides of a square courtyard with a garden in the middle On the wall at the top of the stairs Fra Angelico painted a fresco of the Angel Gabriel announcing the birth of Jesus to the Blessed Virgin Mary This is one of his most famous pictures Fra Angelico then began to paint a picture in each of the monks cells Each cell has large picture with a round top on the wall beside the window  At least six of these paintings were done be by Fra Angelico and others were done by artists who copied his style of painting These pictures were to help the friars with their prayers 

In 1439 he finished one of his most famous works which is the altarpiece for San Marcos Church which is where the friars worship It shows the Madonna and Child on a throne surrounded by saints from different dates who are all grouped together as if they were standing in a room in Heaven talking about holy things This type of painting called a Sacred Conversation later became very popular but this is one of the first ones

In 1445 Pope Eugenius IV sent a message for Fra Angelico to come to Rome to paint the frescoes of the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament at St Peters The chapel was later demolished by Pope Paul III to make way for the new StPeters Basilica and Fra Angelicos work was lost Vasari says that one of the popes asked Fra Angelico if he would like the very important job of Archbishop of Florence But Fra Angelico did not want such a high job and he suggested the name of another friar for the position In 1447 Fra Angelico went to the city of Orvieto with his pupil Benozzo Gozzoli to paint some pictures for the Cathedral there One of his other pupils was called Zanobi Strozzi but he did not become as famous as Benozzo

From 1447 to 1449 Fra Angelico was back at the Vatican where Pope Nicholas V had built a small chapel where he could pray privately The pictures that Fra Angelico and his pupils painted there are the lives of two young saints St Stephen and St Lawrence who were both martyrs The small chapel with its bright colours and gold leaf decorations is like a jewel box From 1449 until 1452 Fra Angelico was back at his old convent of Fiesole where he was the Prior Fra Angelicos pupils were probably left in Rome to finish the work on the chapel 

In 1455 Fra Angelico went back to Rome probably to look at the work in Pope Nicholas Chapel He died at the Dominican Convent and was buried in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva Pope John Paul II beatified Fra Angelico on October 3 1982 making him officially known as the Blessed Angelico In 1984 the pope made him the patron of Catholic artists

Fra Angelico never wanted to be important and even though he was so talented he never put himself above other people He thought his most important job was caring for others He always prayed before he picked up his brushes to paint and he never made any changes to his pictures later because he believed that the Holy Spirit was guiding him He painted a great number of scenes of the Crucifixion and he would always cry while he was painting them

The words on his grave say

Fra Angelico was working at a time when the style of painting was in a state of change The changes had begun a hundred years before his time with the works of Giotto Fra Angelico would have seen the famous pictures of the Life of Saint Francis that Giotto did for the church of Santa Croce in Florence In Giottos paintings the figures look more real and solid and lifelike than in the pictures of other painters of the 1300s Giotto was also very good at painting the emotions on peoples faces and the actions that showed how they were feeling His work was a big influence on every artist who saw it

At the same time rich patrons like Cosimo de Medici liked to show off their wealth They often did this by ordering paintings that had lots of bright colour and real gold backgrounds The red colour called vermilion was one of the most expensive But the most expensive colour was a beautiful blue made by grinding up a semi precious stone called Lapis lazuli This type of painting is called International Gothic Some artists of Fra Angelicos day were expert at doing paintings that would make very rich people happy But other painters like Masaccio were followers of Giotto and painted in a very plain way

Fra Angelico was able to paint in both ways If the Pope or a rich family wanted an altarpiece or a fresco that had gold and expensive bright colours then Fra Angelico could do it But his most famous paintings have no gold and no bright colours They are the simple gentle paintings of the life of Jesus that he did for the friars in their cells at San Marcos

Giorgio Vasari was an Italian painter architect and writer He is most famous for his book The Lives of the Great Architects Painters and Sculptors of Italy which is usually known as Vasaris Lives Although some other writers had written about art this book which was published in 1550 makes Vasari the first art historian 

Vasari was born in 1511 to a wealthy family in the city of Arezzo in Tuscany When he was 13 he was sent to Florence to study at the workshops of the well known artists Andrea del Sarto Florence is so famous for the arts that students like Vasari have been going there to learn painting and sculpture ever since Giotto in the 1200s The two most famous artists in the world Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were both alive when Vasari was a boy and had both studied in Florence Vasari had the good luck to meet Michelangelo who was like a great hero to Vasari 

Vasari learnt well and became one of the favourite artists of the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family who ruled Florence at that time He did all sorts of important jobs for them One of the most important buildings in the city was the Palazzo Vecchio which was really a Medieval fortress where the town council had always met Vasari got the job of decorating the walls of the enormous meeting room with painted frescos 

Vasari was very good at directing important artistic jobs but he was not really as good a painter as he was architect One of his most important architectural jobs was to begin the building of the Uffizi in Florence These are two long buildings that face each other across a long narrow courtyard with one end opening on the town square and the other end opening onto the Arno River At the end where the river is Vasari designed a beautiful loggia which is a sort of two storey veranda that joins the two buildings It makes the narrow courtyard and the view of the river look like a stage set where wonderful things might happen The Uffizi is now one of the most famous art galleries in the world

Vasari had another important job for the Medici family Eleanor the wife of Duke Cosimo I had bought a house It was by far the biggest house in the city and was across the river from the Uffizi The Medici family was not always popular The previous duke Alessandro had been murdered So to keep the family safe they needed an escape route from the Palazzo Vecchio to the Pitti Palace on the other side of the river Vasari was expected to design it The escape route is named after its designer It is called the Vasari Corridor 

The corridor begins at the Palazzo Vecchio and runs along the top floor of the Uffizi and across the loggia near the river then it runs on top of arches along the street by the riverbank above a nice covered walkway at street level where nowadays people can buy souvenirs The Vasari Corridor then gets to a bridge the Ponte Vecchio It is the oldest most famous bridge in the city and on both sides it had rows of shops and houses But the Medici did not mind that They just had anything that was in the way pulled down When the Corridor gets to the other side of the river it makes some twists and turns Some buildings were knocked down to make way but the Mannelli family who lived in a large tower were not so obliging and so the corridor is made to go around its walls Eventually it gets to the Pitti Palace which is an enormous building of brown stone with big carved lions heads beneath all the windows Vasari built other buildings that are more beautiful but the Vasari Corridor is probably his most famous

Vasaris masterpiece is his book The Lives of the Great Architects Painters and Sculptors of Italy first published in 1550 It is a book of biography It tells the stories of the lives of Italian artists from Giotto who lived around 1300 to Michelangelo who was still alive when Vasari was writing his book For some of the artists very little is known about them except the stories that Vasari heard and wrote in his book Even though nowadays it is known that Vasari sometimes made mistakes he gives a wonderful picture of the characters of the artists and tells all sorts of amusing stories 

Vasari does not just tell the stories of the artists lives He also describes their artworks in great detail It is because of Vasari that art historians know of many important artworks that have been lost It is because of Vasari that we know that the Mona Lisa once had eyebrows Vasari writes about the artworks as a history He believed that the Gothic art of the Middle Ages was not as good as the art of Florence in the 15th century and that Michelangelo who painted in the early 16th century was the greatest artist since the days of Ancient Greece He believed that the change towards the great art of the Renaissance began with Giotto around 1300 Vasari puts all these ideas into his book and shows how one artist learnt from each other and how the changes in art came about Vasaris Lives is the first art history book that was ever written

Gravitation is the scientific statement that all objects having masses try to move toward each other In everyday life gravitation is commonly thought of as the weight of an object

Gravitation keeps the Earth and the other planets in their orbits around the Sun It keeps the Moon in its orbit around the Earth It causes tides convection and many other things that happen Gravitation is also the reason that the Earth the Sun and most other objects in space exist Without it matter would not have come together into these big masses Without gravitation life as we know it would not exist

Physics describes gravitation using the theory of general relativity Newtons law of universal gravitation is very similar to the theory of relativity but much more simple

The term gravity is often used to mean gravitation In science the terms gravitation and gravity are used differently Gravitation is the theory about the attraction Gravity is the force that pulls objects towards each other

In the late 17th century Galileo did a famous experiment about gravity where he dropped balls from the Tower of Pisa He later rolled balls down inclines With these experiments Galileo showed that gravitation accelerates all objects at the same rate regardless of weight

In 1687 English mathematician Sir Isaac Newton wrote the book Principia In this book he wrote about the inverse square law of gravitation Newton said that the closer two objects are to each other the more gravity will affect them His theory about gravitation was used to predict the existence of the planet Neptune based on changes in the orbit of Uranus

Newtons theory was later used to predict the existence of another planet closer to the Sun than Mercury When this was done it was learned that his theory was not entirely correct These mistakes in his theory were corrected by Albert Einsteins theory of General Relativity Newtons theory is still commonly used for many things because it is much more simple to work with than the theory of General Relativity and is usually accurate enough for many uses

Citizenship of the European Union was started by the Maastricht Treaty signed in 1992 It is extra to being a citizen of one of the member countries of the European Union and gives extra rights to nationals of European Union Member States

Before the Maastricht Treaty the European Communities treaties allowed workers and their families to travel and live in any member country This idea started when the European Coal and Steel Community was set up by the Treaty of Paris in 1951 This allowed workers in the coal and steel industries to move to another country for work In 1957 the European Economic Community was set up by the Treaty of Rome That treaty allowed all workers to move freely 

The European Court of Justice took a wider idea of freedom of movement The Court said people should be allowed to move to another country to get a better life style not just to earn more money by working The law made by the European Court the reason the reason a worker wanted to move abroad does not moatter they could start part time and full time work and get extra help from the new country

Other decisions of the ECJ allowed any citizen of a member country live anywhere in the EU  and be treated the same as a citizen of the new country

The idea of EU citizenship was started by the Maastricht Treaty and was extended by the Treaty of Amsterdam The Treaty of Amsterdam said that union citizenship will not replace national citizenship but only be extra it

Article 17 of the amended EC Treaty states that Citizenship of the Union is hereby established Every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union Citizenship of the Union shall complement and not replace national citizenship

The amended EC Treaty provides the following rights to EU citizens

Citizens of new countries which join the EU can have some of the rights limited for up to seven years after they join

Messiah is an oratorio by George Frideric Handel It is Handels most famous work and in England the most often performed of any big choral work The title Messiah means the anointed one and is the name given to Jesus Christ in the Christian teaching

George Frideric Handel was born in Germany When he was a young man he came to England and he liked it so much that he soon visited England again and stayed there for the rest of his life becoming a naturalised Englishman says the legend Actually he was composer for the King of Hannover who then became King of England and Handel followed his employer

The main reason why Handel liked England at that time was because the people liked his music and gave him support At this time Handel was known as a composer of operas For about 20 years Handel spent most of his time working on operas composing them organising performances and looking for opera singers to sing his works

By the late 1730s however peoples tastes started to change and opera was not so popular Handel changed to writing oratorios Although it is thought that Handel invented the oratorio he in fact did notOratorio is Italian after the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri at Rome where famous musical services were held in the 16th century Handel is just one composer of many who wrote oratorios His oratorios are based on the English tradition of the Masque which was something between a play and an opera However oratorios were about stories from the Old Testament Instead of ancient Gods or Roman emperors he used dramatic stories from the Bible Among many great oratorios that he wrote Messiah is his most famous one However it is different from his other oratorios in some ways

The words of Messiah were written by a librettist Charles Jennens He chose several passages from the Bible and made a libretto which he sent to Handel in 1741 Handel immediately realized that a great work of music could be made from Jennens libretto He thought that Jennens was a very clever person and in his letters to him he calls the work Your Oratorio Messiah Handel sat down in the front room of his house in Brook Street London and wrote the whole oratorio in twenty four days It is a long work lasting over four hours and when one thinks that Handel had to write out all the parts for the choir and orchestra he must have worked unbelievably hard When he had finished the work he put it in a drawer for seven weeks Perhaps he thought it would never be played in London because at that time the London audiences did not seem to like him

Just at that time he got an invitation to go to Dublin He was asked to give a concert to get money for charity The main charity for which money was being raised was the debtors prison In those days people who ran into debt were sent to prison There they were fed by charity If no one fed them they just starved to death Handel had nearly been sent to a debtors prison himself a few years earlier 

He went to Dublin as soon as he could and he was there by November On 23 December he performed his oratorio LAllegro Unlike the London audiences people in Dublin loved it This was followed by Alexanders Feast Imeneo and in April Messiah He was a very great success in Dublin and he stayed there until August when he returned to London

The writer Alexander Pope helped people to change their minds and listen to Handels new music He had just published volume 4 of Dunciad In this work he said how wonderful Handels choruses were When he heard Messiah he must have known that he had written the truth

Messiah tells the story of Christ It is divided into three parts Part One tells of the coming and the birth of Christ Part Two is about his death on the cross and his Ascension into Heaven and Part Three has some thoughts about Christ with words from the books of Job and Corinthians Book One Handel usually performed his oratorios in theatres not in churches and his audience went as a change from going to the opera They did not go for religious worship 

Handels oratorios are normally dramatic with the four solo singers each taking the part of a character from the Bible Messiah is different The soloists sing about the story of Christ The great choruses where the choir sings praise the Lord in the wonderful music Some of the music is homophonic some of the choruses are dramatic dialogues or they are a fugue or they describe things dramatically

The most well known of all the movements in The Messiah is the one popularly known as the Hallelujah Chorus because of the frequently sung word Hallelujah It occurs at the end of the Part Two of the oratorio

There is a famous story about King George II who attended a royal performance of Messiah When it came to the Hallelujah Chorus he stood up Whenever the king stood up everyone in his presence had to stand up so the whole audience stood No one is really sure whether the king stood up because he liked the music or for some other reason but it has become tradition for the audience to stand up when the Hallelujah Chorus is sung

The word Franciscan is used to refer to a follower of one of the religious orders that follow the Rule of St Francis St Francis lived in the 13th century They usually lead simple lives without much money Today there are three main branches of these orders They mostly see themselves as part of the Roman Catholic or Anglican Church There are also small communities in the Old Catholic and Protestant Church

The term Cistercian is used to refer to an order of Roman Catholic monks Officially the order is called Ordo Cisterciensis or Sacer Ordo Cisterciensis These people follow the same rules as the Benedictines that is to say those of St Benedict Over time the Benedictines made some changes to the rules and the way of life 

The Cistercians reject these They went back to what St Benedict had taught Sometimes their rules were more strict than those St Benedict had given They also went back to manual labour especially work in the fields Because of this the Cistercians helped spread technologies around Medieval Europe In 1882 certain monasteries formed a new order called the Trappists With time they split completely from the Cistercians

Langston Hughes was a famous American poet novelist playwright and short story writer Hughes was one of the writers and artists whose work was called the Harlem Renaissance

Hughes grew up as a poor boy from Missouri the descendant of African people who had been taken to America as slaves At that time the term used for African Americans was Negro which means a person with black skin Most Negroes did not remember or think about their link with the people of Africa even though it was a big influence on their culture and in particular their music Hughes was unusual for his time because he went back to West Africa to understand more about his own culture Through his poetry plays and stories Hughes helped other black Americans to see themselves as part of a much bigger group of people so that now the term African American is used with pride

Hughes became a famous writer but all his life he remembered how he started out and he helped and encouraged many other struggling writers

Langston Hughes was born on February 11902 in JoplinMissouri His parents were James Hughes and Carrie Langston Hughes who was a teacher Langstons father James Hughes was so upset about the racism towards African Americans that he left his family and moved to Mexico Young Langston was cared for by his grandmother in Lawrence Kansas while his mother worked to support the family Langstons Grandmother was a great story teller She told stories that made him feel proud to be an African American 

After his grandmother died Hughes went to live with some family friends for a time and then as a teenager went to live in Lincoln Illinois with his mother who had remarried He was often left alone because his mom was at work Even though his childhood was difficult and had lots of changes he was able to use these things in the poetry that he started to write while he was at school He never forgot the stories of his grandmother and tried to help other African Americans when they were having problems These were the people that he later wrote about in his own stories

When Hughes went to school in Lincoln there were only two African American children in the class The teacher talked to them about poetry She said that what a poem needed most was rhythm Langston later said that he had rhythm in his blood because bib ware as everyone knows all African Americans have rhythm The children made him the class poet

At high school in Cleveland Ohio Langston learned to love reading He loved the poetry of the American poets Paul Laurence Dunbar and Carl Sandburg He wrote articles for the school newspaper he edited the school yearbook and he wrote his first short stories and plays

When Langston Hughes was 17 he went to spend some time with his father in Mexico He was so unhappy while he was there that he thought about committing suicide Hughes could not understand how his father felt He said I had been thinking about my father and his strange dislike of his own people I didnt understand it because I was a Negro and I liked Negroes very much

Hughes later wrote this poem 

When he was finished at high school in Lincoln in 1920 he went back to Mexico to ask his father to pay for him to go to university Hughes father was a lawyer and a wealthy landowner He could afford to send his son to university but he made difficulties about it He said that Hughes could only go to university if he went overseas and studied engineering Hughes wanted to go to university in the US After a time they made an agreement that he should go to Columbia University but study engineering not an arts degree He went to Columbia in 1921 but left in 1922 partly because of the racism in the university

Until 1926 Hughes did many different types of work In 1923 he went as a crewman on the ship SSMalone and went to West Africa and Europe He left the ship and stayed for a short time in Paris where he joined several other African Americans who were living there In November 1924 Hughes returned to the US to live with his mother in Washington DC In 1925 he got a job as an assistant to Carter G Woodson who worked with the Association for the Study of African American Life and History Hughes did not enjoy his work because he did not have enough time to write so he left and got a job as a busboy wiping tables and washing dishes at a hotel Hughes is sometimes called The Busboy Poet Meanwhile some of his poems were published in magazines and were being collected together for his first book of poetry While he was working at the hotel he met the poet Vachel Lindsay who helped to make Hughes known as a new African American poet

In 1926 Hughes began studying at Lincoln University Pennsylvania He had help from patrons Amy Spingarn who gave him 300 and Godmother Charlotte Osgood Mason Hughes graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1929 and became a Doctor of Letters in 1943 He was also given an honorary doctorate by Howard University For the rest of his life except when he travelled to the Caribbean or West Indies Hughes lived in Harlem New York

Langston Hughes sometimes went out with women but he never married People who have studied his life and poetry are sure that he was homosexual In the 1930s it was harder to be open about being gay than it is nowadays His poetry has lots of symbols which are used by other homosexual writers Hughes thought that men who had very dark skin were particularly beautiful It seems from his poetry that he was in love with an African American man He also wrote a story which might tell of his own experience Blessed Assurance is the story of a fathers anger because his son is queer and acts like a girl

Hughes life and work were an important part of the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s alongside those Zora Neale Hurston Wallace Thurman Countee Cullen Richard Bruce Nugent and Aaron Douglas who together started a magazine Fire Devoted to Younger Negro Artists Hughes and these friends did not always agree with the ideas of some of the other African American writers who were also part of the Harlem Renaissance because they thought their ideas were Middle class and that they treated others who had darker skin less education and less money with discrimination All his life Hughes never forgot the lessons that he learned about poor and uneducated African Americans in the stories that his grandmother told

In 1960 the NAACP awarded Hughes the Spingarn Medal for distinguished achievements by an African American Hughes became a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1961 In 1973 an award was named after him the Langston Hughes Medal awarded by the City College of New York

Hughes became a famous American poet but he was always ready to help other people particularly young black writers He was worried that many young writers hated themselves and expressed these feelings to the world He tried to help people feel pride and not worry about the prejudice of other people He also tried to help young African Americans not to express hatred and prejudice towards white Americans

Hughes wrote 

On May 22 1967 Hughes died at the age of 65 after having surgery for cancer His ashes are buried under the floor of the Langston Hughes Auditorium in the Arthur Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem Over his ashes is a circle with a beautiful African design called Rivers At the centre of the design are words from a poem by Hughes My soul has grown deep like the rivers

Silverwing is a best selling novel written by Kenneth Oppel published in 1997 by Simon Schuster It tells the story of a group of silverwing bats The tone and artistic honour of this series of bestsellers has been compared to the classic animal novel Watership Down Silverwing is the second installment of the Silverwing series following the prequel Darkwing

The first book has been made into a successful 13 episode animated television mini series shown on the Canadian cable channel Teletoon and currently being shown on Toon Disneys Jetix These episodes have also been strung together to make 3 movies The whole series is now available on DVD

The main character is a runt named Shade The novel and its sequel Sunwing tell the story of the hard time of Shade and his friends to find his father and free his fellow bats from an ancient and unjust punishment The second sequel Firewing describes the adventures of Shades child

The bats punishment came about long ago when a great war was fought between the birds and the land animals The bats sharing aspects of both declared themselves neutral As a result the bats were only allowed to come out at night never to see the sun again without suffering terrible penalties Shade sets the main plot of the novel in motion when he breaks that law and starts a chain of events that leads to the destruction of his groups home forcing their premature migration and his separation from them 

When hes separated from his group he is found by a Brightwing bat named Marina and soon the two are in a city where pigeons are very angry with the two bats They are soon being beaten by the pigeons The reason is that two giant cannibal bats have killed a few pigeons and Shade and Marina are being held responsible for the killings

While the two small bats escape the scene changes to the two giant bats on the night they escape Their names are Goth and Throbb two carnivorous bats who have only been chasing mice for a while They escape from the humans who trapped them

Soon after escaping Shade meets with a bat named Zephyr and is attacked by an owl Goth defends him by attacking and eating the owl and introduces himself and where hes going It turns out he needs Shades help to find his jungle Shade suggests that he can find his group first and they can help Goth in his search for his homeland Marina believes that Goth and Throbb should not be trusted but Shade trusts them since they saved them from the owl 

Soon Shade realizes the truth when he sees Throbb eating a Brightwing Shade runs off but runs into Marina whom he feared had been killed They soon escape after Goth and Throbb are shot by darts from a human flying machine which is actually an airplane Shade saw the dart hit Goth in the chest Yet he is not sure whether the dart hit Throbb

Soon after they meet with Goth and Throbb again but escape into the sewer where they meet the rat twins Romulus and Remus They are treated as spies by Prince Remus and as punishment are sent to be eaten by Remuss crazy brother Romulusbut he turns out to be not crazy after all frees them in the end 

They are soon captured by Goth and Throbb and Goth explains about his god Cama Zotz saying that the said Zotz has greater power than Shades Nocturna When Shade half believes Goths story he soon gives the impression of deciding to go with Goth to the jungle to grow big and strong and have Goth kill his family because he was always mistreated and never cared for or so he says He is given a bat to eat but fakes it first then is forced to eat it by the threat to Marina This disgusting act gives him the opportunity to drug Goth and Throbb with a soporific herb While the False Vampires sleep Shade and Marina escape They are chased by owls then by Goth and Throbb During the fight Throbb gets hit by lightning and bursts into flames Goth survives but only by a scant margin

After they leave however Goth moves again and kills a bird near him The last moments the bird saw was a set of double rowed teeth Although weak he tries to fly once he does he soon vows revenge against Shade

Shade and Marina meet up with Shades group telling stories of what had happened to them They decide to find Shades father Cassiel and Chinook volunteers to help They plan to go after hibernating but Shade wishes to go now It ends with Shade starting to fall asleep with Ariel and Marina roosting beside him

Shade Silverwing is the protagonist of the series He is a runt Silverwing and often made fun of by his peers who take pride in their size and strength  While Shades strength may be lower than the other bats he is a master of the sound often making illusions or moving materials with echoes 

Marina Brightwing is Shades newfound friend When Shade had been blown away by the storm she met him  She is a lot bigger than Shade and does not fail to remind him of it

Chinook is Shades competitor and the biggest and strongest newborn of the group All the bats like him and he said he caught two tiger moths which are known by all the others in the group to be an extraordinary achievement by such a young bat Shade loathes him for his airs and size Shade and Chinook become friends later in the story His parents are Plato and Isis 

Frieda is an older bat of the Silverwing group She is wise in many ways and makes good decisions Frieda has a silver band on her forearm She was a big contributor to the rebellion against the owls fifteen years previous

Ariel is Shades mother She had protected Shade from the wrath of the rest of the group She had lost her mate Cassiel before Shade was born

Goth is a sly and smooth talking cannibal bat half responsible for the killing of many pigeons He is a prince in his own group and worships Cama Zotz the brother of Nocturna whom the Silverwings and other bats like them believe in Goth comes from the jungle and had been captured by humans

Throbb is another one of the cannibal bats Unlike Goth he is a coward and according to Goth he feeds on carcasses already killed by other cannibal bats in the jungle

Gino Severini was an Italian painter He was a founding member of the Futurist movement

Impressionism is a style of painting which began in France in the late 19th century Impressionist painting shows life like subjects painted in a broad quick style with brushstrokes that are easily seen and colours that are often bright The name Impressionism comes from a painting by Claude Monet which he showed in an exhibition with the name Impression soleil levant An art critic called Louis Leroy saw the exhibition and wrote a review in which he said that all the paintings were just impressions The word stuck 

Impressionist painters are mostly known for their work in oil paint on canvas Some Impressionist painters also made watercolours and prints There is also some Impressionist sculpture

In the 19th century most artists learned to paint by attending an art school called an academy The academies were very strict about the way that young artists learnt to paint The popular style of painting was called Classicism Classical paintings were always done inside a studio They often showed stories from mythology An artist would prepare for a painting by doing lots of drawings The paintings were very smoothly and carefully painted 

At the same time there were several painters who loved to paint the French landscape and the village people in a realist way that was different from Classicism They would often make small quick paintings out of doors and then finish them in the studio These artists include Gustave Courbet and Jean Baptiste Corot Edgar Degas wrote in 1883 There is one master Corot We are nothing in comparison nothing A group of young painters who admired the work of these artists became friends and started painting together These artists were Claude Monet Pierre Auguste Renoir Alfred Sisley Frdric Bazille Camille Pissarro Paul Czanne and Armand Guillaumin 

Every year the academy in Paris would hold a big exhibition called the Salon de Paris In 1863 an artist called Edouard Manet put a picture into the show called Lunch on the Grass The judges at the Salon refused to hang this work in the gallery because it showed a naked woman sitting on the grass with two men wearing clothes If the painting had been about Ancient Greek mythology this would not be a problem but these men were wearing ordinary suits and the womans dress and hat were lying on the grass Perhaps she was a prostitute The judges said that the painting was indecent Monet and his friends also had their paintings turned away They were angry and they met with Manet to discuss this The Emperor Napoleon III gave permission for another exhibition called the Salon des Refuses which showed all the pictures that had been refused Many people went to see this exhibition and soon discovered that there was a new movement in art quite different from the style that they were used to 

In 1872 Monet and his friends formed a society called the Cooperative and Anonymous Association of Painters Sculptors and Engravers They began to organize their own art show In 1874 thirty artists held their first exhibition The critic Louis Leroy made fun of their work and wrote an article called The Exhibition of the Impressionists The public who came to the exhibition also began to use this name The painters themselves soon started to use the name Impressionists and they have been called by that name ever since They had eight exhibitions between 1874 and 1886 They paid a dealer called Paul Durand Ruel to organise exhibitions and he arranged shows in London and New York Bit by bit their paintings became popular Some of the Impressionists Monet and Renoir lived to be old and famous but others died very poor The main artists who are called Impressionists include Claude Monet Auguste Renoir Paul Czanne Camille Pissarro Alfred Sisley Edgar Degas Berthe Morisot Armand Guillaumin Mary Cassatt Gustave Caillebotte and Frederic Bazille 

Many artists worked with the Impressionists for a short time but then began to try out new ideas These artists all painted in different ways but together are called the Post Impressionists They include Georges Seurat Paul Czanne Paul Gauguin Henri de Toulouse Lautrec and Vincent van Gogh 

While the French Impressionist painters were at work in France painters in other countries were also beginning to paint outdoors in a broader style Eventually the Impressionist style spread to many countries across Europe to North America and Australia Some artists continued to paint in the Impressionist style right through the 20th century 

Before the time of the Impressionists many artists worked by painting portraits Before the invention of the camera painted portraits were the main way to record a persons appearance But by the time the Impressionists started painting there were many photographers who had studios where people could go to be photographed As cameras improved photographers started taking snapshots of scenery and people outdoors 

Photography had two effects on painters Firstly it meant that it was much harder for them to live by painting portraits Many artists became very poor Secondly the image taken by a camera often has interesting angles and viewpoints that are not usually painted by artists Impressionist painters were able to learn from photographs Many Impressionist paintings make the viewer feel as if they were right there looking at the scene through the eyes of the artist

Impressionist painters did not paint from their imagination from literature history or mythology like most other painters of the 19th century They painted what they saw in the world around them the town where they lived the landscape where they went on holiday their family their friends their studios and the things that were around their home Sometimes they were commissioned to paint a portrait of someone 

Impressionist painters liked to paint ordinary things that were part of everyday life They painted women doing the washing and ironing ballet dancers doing exercises horses getting ready for a race and a bored looking waitress serving a customer Nobody before the Impressionists had ever thought that these subjects were interesting enough to paint

Even though many Impressionist artists painted people they are thought of mainly for their landscape painting Impressionist painters were not satisfied with doing some drawings or quick painted sketches outdoors and then making grand pictures in the studio Impressionist painters were not satisfied with painting the shape of the land the buildings and trees They wanted to capture the light and the weather

The Impressionist painters looked for a technique to paint landscapes that showed the light and the weather The light and the weather change all the time The light of the sun on the landscape changes every minute as the Earth turns Impressionist painters looked at the works of earlier French artists such as Camille Corot and Gustave Coubet Courbet often took his paints outdoors and made quick coloured sketches that he could then use to make large paintings in his studio The Impressionist painters were more interested in the sketches than the finished paintings 

Another artist Eugene Boudin used to sit on the beach at Deauville with his oil paints and make quick paintings of the people on holiday They would sometimes buy his paintings as souvenirs 

Claude Monet met Boudin and learnt that the only way to capture the way that a landscape looked at a particular time was to paint small pictures very quickly and without bothering to mix the paints up to make nice smooth even colours Impressionist painters would use big brushstrokes of different bright colours and let them get mixed up on the canvas instead of carefully mixing them up on a palette first By painting in this way without bothering with the details Impressionist painters capture a realistic impression of a the world that they saw around them 

Some of the things that they painted were snow gently falling over a town mist rising on a river in the pink morning light people walking through a field of wheat with bright red poppies growing in it sunlight dappling through leaves onto people dancing a train sending up clouds of smoke in a big railway station and water lillies floating on a pool under drooping willows 

Most Impressionist landscape paintings are small so that the artist could carry them outdoors Some artists particularly Claude Monet would take several canvases and as the day went on and the light changed he would put down one and take up another He rented a room from which he could see Rouen Cathedral so that he could paint it from the window at different times of day Monet also did a series of Haystack paintings showing them standing in the field from different angles and in all sorts of weather bright sunshine morning frost and snow Paintings that are done outdoors are called plein air paintings The Impressionist painters often used to go out together on painting trips so there are many pictures that can be compared 

The term impressionism has been used for other forms of art such as writing and music Octave Mirbeau is often described as an impressionist writer In 1887 music critics said the works of Claude Debussy were impressionist Later other composers were also described as impressionist including Maurice Ravel Paul Dukas Erik Satie and Albert Roussel

Thomas Morley was an English composer music theorist and organist He was the most important English composer of madrigals He studied the madrigals by Italian composers and created the tradition of the English madrigal a tradition that became extremely popular but which only lasted about 30 years

Morleys father was a brewer who lived in Norwich so it is likely that Morley was born there He may have been a choirboy in Norwich Cathedral We know that in 1583 he got the job of organist there In a book he published later in his life he said that William Byrd was his master If this means that he had lessons from Byrd he must have travelled away from Norwich  In 1588 he got a degree from Oxford and soon afterwards he became an organist at St Pauls Cathedral in London

In 1588 Nicholas Yonge published a book called Musica transalpina It was a collection of Italian madrigals with words translated into English Soon after this Morley started to publish his own madrigals In 1592 he became a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal

In London Morley lived near Shakespeare We do not know whether the two men worked together but Morley did set Shakespeares words It was a lover and his lass from As You Like It We do not know whether it was ever used in a performance of Shakespeares play It is quite possible because Morley was well known

From 1593 onwards Morley published a great deal of music and also made a lot of money out of music publishing both of his own and other composers music

It is thought that Morley died in October 1602

Morley wrote sacred music as well as madrigals His church music is strongly influenced by William Byrd 

His madrigals are his most important works They are often very lively and have tunes that are easy to sing One of his best known madrigals is called Now is the Month of Maying He started by using the Italian style and changed it to make it sound English The madrigals of Thomas Weelkes and John Wilbye are usually more serious 

As well as madrigals Morley wrote music for instruments including keyboard music Some of his pieces are in the famous collection called Fitzwilliam Virginal Book He also wrote music for the typically English combination of two viols flute lute cittern and bandora

Morley wrote a book about music theory called Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke It was published in 1597 and was read by many people for two centuries after his death It tells us a lot about how music was performed in Morleys

From 1532 he lived mostly in Frankfurt until he died in 1550

Beham made about 252 engravings 18 etchings and 1500 woodcuts He worked on small very detailed engravings This makes him part of the German printmaking school called the Little Masters since their works were so small He created and published his works himself but his larger works were mostly commissioned work to be sold

He also made prints to be used as cards wallpaper coats of arms designs for other artists and designs for stained or painted glass He also painted a table top for Cardinal Albrecht Archbishop of Mainz

Beham mostly engraved pictures of peasants and scenes from myths or history sometimes with erotic scenes as well Since he was working at the same time as Drer the most recognised artist at the time one of his early woodcuts Head of Christ was thought to have been done by Drer Beham also worked with his brother Barthel and shared ideas with him Later he re drew some of Drers works like gus Melancholia of 1539

After publishing a book about drawing horses for which he was exiled he wrote a book on drawing the human figure His book was mostly just a simplified book of Drers own books but his book was easier to use and cheaper than Drers books so artists preferred to buy his

A book of madrigals by him appeared in 1598 and a second in 1608 It is often called the finest book of English madrigals There were a total of 64 madrigals in these two books

Wilbye was influenced by Morleys madrigals and also learned directly from the madrigals of Italian composers such as Alfonso Ferrabosco He wrote many madrigals which have become extremely popular including Weep weep o mine eyes and Draw on sweet night He was very good at making his music match the meaning of the words He often used a mixture of major and minor modes

Thomas Weelkes was an English composer and organist He is one of the greatest composers of madrigals of his time as well as great composer of church music

Thomas Weelkes was baptised in the little village church of Elsted in Sussex on 25 October 1576 His father may have been the rector at that church There is no information about Weelkes childhood

We know that in 1597 he published his first volume of madrigals and that he was a young man then After working for a short time at the house of Edward Darcye he got the job of organist at Winchester College He was paid 13s 4d per quarter but was given food and somewhere to live He stayed there for two or three years 

During his time in Winchester Weelkes composed two more volumes of madrigals published in 1598 and 1600 He got his B Mus Degree from New College Oxford in 1602 and moved to Chichester to take up the job of organist and choir master at the Cathedral He was also a lay clerk at the Cathedral and was paid 15 2s 4d in addition to having food and lodgings The next year he married Elizabeth Sandham who came from a rich family They had three children

Weelkes fourth and final volume of madrigals published in 1608 has a title page where he says that he was a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal However his name does not appear in the records at the Chapel Royal so it is likely that he was only there for a short time until someone else was found for the job

In later years Weelkes got into trouble with the Chichester Cathedral authorities because of his heavy drinking and bad behaviour In 1609 he was in trouble because he was absent from work In 1616 he was in trouble again for swearing In the end he lost his job because he was drunk at the organ and used bad language during the service However he got his job back but his behaviour was still bad

Thomas Weelkes died in London in 1623 a year after his wife died He was buried in St Brides Church Fleet Street London In Chichester Cathedral there is a memorial stone to him

Thomas Weelkes is best known for his vocal music especially his madrigals and church music Weelkes wrote more Anglican services than any other important composer of the time mostly for evensong Many of his anthems are verse anthems which would have suited the small choir he was writing for at Chichester Cathedral

Weelkes was friends with the madrigalist Thomas Morley When Morley died in 1602 Weelkes wrote an anthem called A Remembrance of my Friend Thomas Morley Weelkess madrigals are very chromatic and use counterpoint and unusual rhythms

A black knight is a soldier or knight who either is not in service to a certain liege or does not want his liege or himself to be known and so does not have any heraldic standards or has painted them over with black paint A good and well equipped soldier without a certain fealty was a wild card or someone who you did not know what would happen and a group of them could be a big problem for kings Usually a black knight is given a bad light as a solider who has covered up his standards to not be found out where they came from

In made up stories black knights are usually evil knights that are good at fighting and usually work alone A good example of this would be the Arthurian legend of the black knight

A Black Knight is a knight who does not serve a lord

A paladin or paladine was a person with a lot of power in many countries during the medieval and in early modern Europe

The word paladin was first used in Ancient Rome for a chamberlain of the Emperor and also for the imperial palace guard called the Scholae Palatinae by Constantine In the early Middle Ages the meaning changed and the word was used for one of the highest officials of the Catholic Church in the popes service and also for one of the big nobles of the Holy Roman Empire who was then named Count Palatine The word paladin was also used in 19th century Hungary and in the German Empire and United Kingdom during the early 20th century

In medieval literature the paladins or Twelve Peers were known in the Matter of France as the retainers of Charlemagne Because of the way that this word was used in books paladin was then known to be a knight with honor 

The paladins of the imperial guard were named after the Scholae Palatinae

In the beginning the word paladin was applied to the Chamberlains and to some soldiers guarding the palace of the Roman emperor In Constantines time the word was also used for the best infantry of the army the Praetorian Guard that might guard the Roman Emperor during wars

After the Middle Ages the word palatine was put onto many different people of power across Europe The most important of these was the comes palatinus the count palatine who in Merovingian and Carolingian times was an official of the lords household and court of law 

During the 800s Carolingean rule came to an end and the title of Holy Roman emperor with it About a century later the title was made alive again by Otto I though the new empire was now centered in Germany rather than France The term palatine is found again under Charles IV but they were less powerful than the previous palatines

In the early days of England the word palatinate or county palatine was also used in counties of lords who could use powers normally used by the crown 

In Britain and Germany paladin was an official rank and was a very good title for one in the service of the emperors It was a Knight with additional honours they were allowed to use powers normally used by the crown

The word paladin is still used to describe a good heroic person or a defender of a good cause 

Some role playing games now use paladins as a character class that you can choose when starting a new game

A mathematical proof is a way to show that a math theorem is true One must show that the theory is true in all cases

There are different ways of proving a mathematical theorem

One type of proof is called proof by induction This is usually used to prove a theorem that is true for all numbers There are 4 steps in a proof by induction

1 State that the proof will be by induction and state which variable will be used in the induction step

2 Prove that the statement is true for some beginning case

3 Assume that for some value n n0 the statement is true and has all of the properties listed in the statement This is called the induction step

So 2 2n0 2

Proof by contradiction is a way of proving a mathematical theorem by showing that if the statement is false there is a problem with the logic of the proof That is if one of the results of the theorem is assumed to be false then the proof does not work

When proving a theorem by way of contradiction it is important to note that in the beginning of the proof This is usually abbreviated BWOC When the contradiction appears in the proof there is usually an X made with 4 lines instead of 2 placed next to that line

The movie shows the events before and after a robbery at a jewellery shop that went wrong The men are given nicknames with colours so that they do not know each others names Mr Blonde Mr Blue Mr Brown Mr Orange Mr Pink and Mr White They work for a gangster Joe Cabot and his son Nice Guy Eddie 

The robbery goes wrong and several of the men are killed and Mr Orange is shot and bleeding The rest of the men return to the hideout and talk about what went wrong Mr Blonde has captured a police officer Marvin Nash and beat him to try to get an answer Mr Blonde tries to torture the police officer while the rest of the men are away but is killed by Mr Orange who is actually an undercover police officer 

The rest of the men argue and are in a Mexican standoff and are all shot Mr Pink who hid from the shootout steals the diamonds and runs away

At the movies release at the Sundance Film Festival movie critic Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News compared the effect of Reservoir Dogs to that of the 1895 movie LArrive dun Train en Gare de la Ciotat where audiences watched a moving train approaching the camera and ran away frightened Bernard claimed that Reservoir Dogs had a similar effect and people were not ready for it Vincent Canby of the New York Times enjoyed the cast and the use of non linear storytelling He similarly complimented Tarantinos directing and liked the fact that he did not often use close ups in the movie Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times also enjoyed the movie and the acting particularly that of Buscemi Tierney and Madsen and said Tarantinos palpable enthusiasm his unapologetic passion for what hes created reinvigorates this venerable plot and mayhem aside makes it involving for longer than you might suspect

Roger Ebert was less enthusiastic he felt that the script could have been better and said that the movie feels like its going to be terrific but Tarantinos script does not have much curiosity about the characters He also stated that Tarantino has an idea and trusts the idea to drive the plot Ebert gave the movie two and a half stars out of four also claiming that he enjoyed it and that it was a very good movie from a talented director like other critics he enjoyed the cast but stated I liked what I saw but I wanted more

Reservoir Dogs has received a lot of criticism for its strong violence and language One particular scene that viewers did not like was Michael Madsen cutting off the police officers ear and Madsen himself reportedly had a great deal of difficulty finishing the scene especially after Kirk Baltz ad libbed the desperate plea Ive got a little kid at home Many people have left theaters during the movie and Tarantino commented at the time It happens at every single screening For some people the violence or the rudeness of the language is a mountain they cant climb Thats OK Its not their cup of tea But I am affecting them I wanted that scene to be disturbing During a screening of the movie at a Film Festival in Barcelona fifteen people walked out including horror movie director Wes Craven and special effects artist Rick Baker Baker later told Tarantino to take the walk out as a compliment and explained that he found the violence unnerving because of its heightened sense of realism

Critic John Hartl compared the ear cutting scene to the shower murder scene in Psycho and Tarantino to David Lynch He furthermore explored parallels between Reservoir Dogs and Glengarry Glen Ross After this movie Tarantino was also compared to Martin Scorsese Sam Peckinpah John Singleton Gus Van Sant and Abel Ferrara For its nonlinear storyline Reservoir Dogs has also often been compared to Rashomon Critic James Berardinelli was of a similar opinion he complimented both the cast and Tarantinos dialogue writing abilities Hal Hinson of The Washington Post was also enthusiastic about the cast complimenting the movie on its deadpan sense of humor Todd McCarthy called the movie undeniably impressive and was of the opinion that it was influenced by Mean Streets Goodfellas and The Killing

Church music is music that is intended to be part of Christian worship in churches chapels cathedrals or anywhere Christians meet to worship Church music is sacred music but not all religious music is church music Some music may be inspired by religion but it may not be church music For example some songs are about religion but they may not be church music Although it uses the words of the Requiem mass Verdis Requiem was composed for performance in a concert hall Brittens War Requiem was written for performance in a cathedral but it was not meant to be part of a service of worship so it would not usually be thought of as church music

Church music has varied enormously during the history of Christianity as different churches kept changing their ideas about what part music should have in religious worship Most church music is based on singing Music written for church choirs mostly used the words of the liturgy The organ is the most important musical instrument in church music although from time to time many other instruments have been used as well

During many periods in history composers writing for the church used traditional music rather than the newest fashions This was particularly the case in the early 17th century when composers such as Claudio Monteverdi often wrote in two different styles the old style for church music and the new style for secular music

During the early history of Christian worship the churches were spread through many countries in the Roman Empire The musical traditions that already existed in these countries were used so there was great variety Musical instruments were associated with the devil and with dancing and so they were thought to be wicked and were not allowed in churches  The only music that was allowed in churches was singing In the 4th century Bishop Ambrosius of Milan introduced the antiphon and encouraged newly composed hymns Psalms were an important part of the early Christian worship Responsorial psalms were psalms which were sung by one person and the congregation may have responded at the end of a verse with something simple such as Alleluia Gradually antiphonal psalmody was developed This meant that the choir stands on opposite sides facing one another and they sing the verses of the psalm alternately Antiphonal psalm singing can still be heard today in Anglican cathedrals

The kind of music heard in the Catholic church was known as chant or plainchant often known as Gregorian chant  The text were the standard words of the liturgy The words of the Mass were set to music by many composers Music for the dead was called Requiem Mass There was also music for Vespers and the Compline Until the 16th century the organ was only used to accompany the singing In the Renaissance period many great composers such as Giovanni da Palestrina and Orlande de Lassus wrote polyphonic music for the Catholic church They often wrote motets short pieces based on texts which were not part of the liturgy

During the period called Reformation some Protestant groups broke away from the Catholic Church From this time on Catholic and Protestant music developed in different ways

Martin Luther started the Protestant movement in Germany In the Lutheran church the chorale was the most important part of the musical worship Luther himself composed many chorale tunes These are like hymns The great Johann Sebastian Bach based much of his organ music on the chorale The choir often sang a motet Sometimes these choir pieces became very long and turned into cantatas The words were not from the liturgy but made up by poets or taken from the Bible  Bach wrote about 200 cantatas for the church He also wrote two great passions which tell the story of Jesus dying on the cross Other composers who have contributed to Protestant church music in Europe include Heinrich Schtz Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck Dietrich Buxtehude Johann Pachelbel and Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy

Music for the Catholic church includes instrumental music such as church cantatas Arcangelo Corelli and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote many examples of these Mozart also wrote several masses Great Italian composers of the 16th and 17th centuries who wrote church music include Giovanni Gabrieli and Claudio Monteverdi In the 19th century Rheinberger and Max Reger wrote music in the Romantic style French composers of this time wrote in a style which was similar to broken wikt linksecularsecular music

When King Henry VIII broke away from the Catholic Church he founded his own church known as the Anglican church Many great composers wrote music for the Anglican service Their music for choirs was mostly service settings and anthems They also wrote many hymn tunes Important composers include William Byrd and Thomas Tallis in the Renaissance Orlando Gibbons and Henry Purcell in the Baroque period and in later periods Samuel Sebastian Wesley Charles Stanford Ralph Vaughan Williams Edward Bairstow William Mathias and John Rutter

Church music in American churches developed at first in a similar way to European music The Book of Common Prayer was the basis of American worship Both Puritans and Baptists thought that congregational singing was important In the 18th century Singing Masters from Singing Schools in the north eastern states used to travel around to try to teach people in church to sing properly The most famous of these singing masters was William Billings  Because most people could not read a system called Lined out Hymnody developed in which the priest sang a line and the congregation copied him Later in the century during the First Great Awakening the hymn tunes of English composers such as Isaac Watts and Charles Wesley became popular

In the 19th century people from different churches met at Camp Meetings These were led by Evangelists The songs reflect the belief that sinners can be saved by broken wikt linkrepentrepenting The music of black people and of folk music became important influences Songs became tuneful and often had refrains In the middle of the century Sunday Schools for children became extremely popular and many songs were written for them Gospel songs and negro spirituals also became very widely used and influenced the development of church music in America

Church music in the Orthodox Church in East European countries is always sung It is based on the Byzantine musical tradition

In some parts of world there is a large Digital divide Sometimes it is just in half of a country or just a region for example Africa There are big cities where technologies are really cheap and there are lots of villages and rural communities where there is no technology In this case the Digital Divide creates others problems Because a part of the country is rich and another part is poor there are often problems with trading and connections

Duck Hunt is a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System game system The game was made by Nintendo and was released in 1984 in Japan In Duck Hunt players use the NES Zapper to shoot ducks on screen to get points The ducks come onto the screen one or two at a time and the player is given three shots to shoot them down 

Duck Hunt was one of the two first Pack in games for the NES The game did not get many reviews but many gamers enjoyed playing it and many people said it was a good game Before Nintendo made the game it also made a Duck Hunt game about the Laser Clay Shooting System released in 1976

In Duck Hunt players use the Nintendo Zapper Light Gun that must be plugged into their NES consoles Then they try to shoot down ducks or clay pigeons Duck Hunt was also released as an arcade game in 1984 and was also in the PlayChoice 10 arcade console

The game has three modes one duck mode with only one duck on the screen two duck mode with two on the screen and a third mode called clay pigeon shooting The clay pigeons are much smaller than the ducks and are harder to hit Players need faster reaction time when playing this mode than when shooting ducks In Vs Duck Hunt Clay Shooting mode is the second mode after two duck mode because the arcade Duck Hunt games never had a one duck mode 

During the game there is a dog that laughs at the player if no duck is hit If the player hits a duck the dog will congratulate them A popular urban legend is that players have found a way to shoot the dog This cannot happen in Duck Hunt but it can happen in a bonus round of the arcade game Vs Duck Hunt 

Duck Hunt does not have a way for more than one person to shoot ducks but a second player may plug in a NES controller in the other controller port and control the duck that appears This only can happen in one duck mode and can not be done with the clay pigeons

The music was composed or written by Koji Kondo and Hirokazu Hip Tanaka Both men made music for other Nintendo games at the time such as Metroid Some people have called the sound effects pretty much what youd expect for a game from the early 1980s  that is awful by todays standards but the games music was played on the Video Games Live concert tour

Because it was made in the 1980s Duck Hunt did not get very many reviews Most critics have not reviewed Duck Hunt All Game Guide called the game an attractive but repetitive target shooter and utterly mindless the game is fun for a short time but gets old after a few rounds of play Video Game Critic another website gave the game a review in 2004 scoring the game a D It said theres really not much substance to it overall Duck Hunt is pretty lame and only worth playing for a trip down memory lane Video game players say that they like the game IGN users gave it an 87 out of 10 and the Gamespot users gave the Mario Duck Hunt cartridge a 91 out of 10 It was rated the 155th best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Powers Top 200 Games list

The Gong Show is an American television game show that was produced in the late 1970s and early 1980s It was created and hosted by Chuck Barris The shows name came from a broken wikt linkgonggong used to shorten performances that were not liked The gong was sounded by celebrity judges who rated the performers

In the mid 1970s Barris hoped to make a new kind of game show based on the old amateur hour contest shows He held auditions to find talented acts to appear Nearly all the performers who came to the auditions were ordinary people who had one or two skills or thought they had special talent Many of the performances were broken wikt linkparty pieceparty pieces that people did to amuse others Others were more serious and tried hard to perform well

Most of the acts made Barris and his staff laugh They thought their idea for a show would not work because of the strange and funny performances Barris then realized that audiences might want to watch them for amusement He and his staff began to look for funny and unusual acts The show debuted in 1976 and became a hit

Two versions of The Gong Show aired at first A nighttime version hosted by broken wikt linkradio announcerradio announcer Gary Owens and a daytime version hosted by Barris himself Barris later took over the nighttime version also Each version worked the same but featured different judges and performers A live band played music for the performances Live audiences attended each show and cheered on the acts they liked When they did not like an act they would call on the judges to Gong em If a judge sounded the gong the act had to stop and lost their chance for a prize The performer who rated highest with the judges won a cash prize

Many celebrities served as judges on the show including Jaye P Morgan and Jamie Farr One well known comedian Murray Langston performed on the show with a paper bag over his head He called himself the Unknown Comic and told simple jokes when he appeared onstage Langston won his round and was invited back to appear other times Many people wondered who the Unknown Comic really was Langston later admitted he had appeared on the show just for some quick cash because he needed money He hid his identity so his performance would not hurt his comedy career since he was already well known

No real stars were made by Gong Show appearances but thousands of people got a chance to perform on national television and others got the chance to watch One popular member of the shows cast was Gene Gene the Dancing Machine who would dance in front of the shows band between acts Barris himself was also well liked by the audience He treated all the performers on the show kindly and seriously and hosted the show like it was a party

Many of the acts who auditioned for The Gong Show were not suitable for television or for times when children or families might watch Some of these acts appeared in a movie which was released in 1980

In time new and unusual acts became hard to find as more people performed on The Gong Show The television audience also lost interest Barris was tired from working on the show The Gong Show was cancelled by 1982 Reruns came later but they also stopped with time

Today The Gong Show is remembered fondly by the people who watched it Amateur talent contests still sometimes feature a gong for when an act does not go over well

Barris wrote a broken wikt linkmemoirmemoir titled Confessions of a Dangerous Mind that talked about his time on the show

Caligula was the third Roman Emperor He reigned from AD 37 and was assassinated after less than four years by members of his bodyguard and the Roman Senate He was popular with the Roman public in his time but his reign saw the slaughter of many innocent people without fair trials 

Caligulas father Germanicus the nephew and adopted son of emperor Tiberius was a very successful general and one of Romes most beloved public figures 

When Germanicus died at Antioch in 19 AD his mother Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with her six children where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius This conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family with Caligula as the sole male survivor Unscathed by the deadly intrigues Caligula accepted the invitation to join the emperor on the island of Capri in 31 where Tiberius himself had withdrawn five years earlier At the death of Tiberius in 37 Caligula succeeded his great uncle and adoptive grandfather

There are few surviving sources on Caligulas reign although he is described as a noble and moderate ruler during the first two years of his rule After this the sources focus upon his cruelty extravagance and sexual perversity presenting him as an insane tyrant 

Caligula worked to increase the authority of the emperor He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself However he started the construction of two new aqueducts in Rome the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus During his reign the empire annexed the Kingdom of Mauretania and made it into a province

In early 41 Caligula was assassinated as the result of a conspiracy involving officers of the Praetorian Guard as well as members of the Roman Senate and of the imperial court The conspirators attempt to use the opportunity to restore the Roman Republic was thwarted as the same day the Praetorian Guard declared Caligulas uncle Claudius emperor in his place

Surviving sources present a number of stories about Caligula that illustrate cruelty and insanity He has been accused of killing for mere amusement committing incest with his sisters and prostituting them with other men and turning the palace into a brothel 

He appeared in public dressed as various gods and demanded to be worshipped as a god He made his horse Incitatus a Senator and citizen of Rome a consul and a priest

The history of Caligulas reign is a problem Only two sources contemporary with Caligula have survived the works of Philo and Seneca and they give mostly anecdotes At one time there were detailed contemporary histories on Caligula but they are now lost Caligulas sister Agrippina the Younger wrote an autobiography which certainly included a detailed explanation of Caligulas reign but it too is lost No surviving source paints Caligula in a favorable light but the question of whether or not Caligula was insane remains unanswered

I think this article should have the GA title  Thamusemeantfan 0021 1 March 2008

After a brief scan this article looked worthy of the GA title  Thamusemeantfan 2039 24 February 2008 Quite a bit of the article was written by Isis and me At the start it looked like a good idea In my opinion the article has several problems

Those are just items that sprang to my mind in the last 10 minutes I am sure a critical reading of a sufficiently knowledgable person will reveal more of these Comparing what we have to what enWP has for example I can only see two ways ahead

If we take the first option I think that the mere extent of this would justify a Wikiproject This has become too big to be the work of less than 6 8 people The general work on world history I have are two books each of about 1500 pages  Eptalon 2148 24 February 2008

If this article is to become a good article then these articles would need to be created

This article a previous VGA nominee was denied because of multiple redlinks This has been fixed and I think this article is probably VGA worthy but have decided to nominate it here first  Thamusemeantfan 2030 24 February 2008

It was previously a VGA After the VGA rules changed and GA rules were introduced it was demoted to the level of regular article because of its size It is now more than 4KB applying the conditions on the 2nd requirement for GAs It meets all of the other requirements  Huji reply 1945 19 February 2008

I have worked quite hard on this article over the past few days I think that it definately meets the criteria for a GA if not a VGA I think it is a great article IuseRosary 0925 19 February 2008

This article does have some good points to it though

Clean up these things by the time that this proposal is up for voting and I am sure that people will be fine voting in support of it becoming a good article Good luck Razorflame 2041 19 February 2008

This failed the recent GA vote only because we were short one support vote It had 100 support but it only had 4 support votes This article should definitely be a GA because it meeets all the requirements Lets try to get this one to pass again Razorflame 1601 18 February 2008 I think this article still needs a few things to be ready

If I find the time I will also work on it Eptalon 1313 24 February 2008

Im bothered by the capitalization of vocabulary words that dont need to be capitalized There are probably 20 30 50 words that are unnecessarily capitalized I also think the amount of new vocabulary to anyone who isnt practically an expert on organs makes the article kind of confusing I dont know what if anything can be done about that though Tygrrr 2119 12 February 2008

The second issue is the killer as it shows the article is not in Simple Englishdone which for me is the first and main requirement to be made While there are always going to be times where it just may not be possible to be entirely in keeping with Simple English every attempt should be made to do so and this article lacks that in many areas This article really needs a full peer review before it will be ready for nomination  Creol 0843 15 January 2008

The New York Philharmonic is the oldest symphony orchestra in the United States which still exists and one of the most famous orchestras of the world It performs most of its concerts at the Avery Fisher Hall in New York

The orchestra started in 1842 At that time it was called the Philharmonic Society At its first concert the orchestra played a very long programme which included Beethovens Symphony No 5 conducted by Ureli Corelli Hill The musicians worked as a cooperative or communistic society This meant that the musicians themselves made up the rules about how the orchestra should be run who would become a member which music would be performed and who would conduct At the end of each season they divided any money the orchestra had earned amongst themselves

The orchestra were a great success but they needed a new concert hall They gave a fund raising concert which included Beethovens Symphony No 9 It was the first time it had ever been played in America The concert took place in Castle Garden on the southern tip of Manhattan There were about 400 performers in the orchestra and choir The words that the choir sings were translated into English It was the first time this work had been sung in English anywhere in the world However the tickets cost a lot of money US200 each so not so many people came It was some time before the orchestra got their concert hall  Many people thought Beethovens 9th symphony was a strange piece of music because the choir only sing in the last movement which is called Ode to Joy  In 1865 Theodore Eisfeld conducted the Orchestras memorial concert for the recently assassinated Abraham Lincoln but the last movement was not performed because it was thought that the Ode to Joy was not suitable for the sad occasion

Lake Enriquillo is a lake in western Dominican Republic near the border with Haiti Its Tano name was Hagueygagon but in colonial times it had the name Jaragua Lake It is in the Hoya de Enriquillo valley a long valley between the Sierra de Neiba to the north and the Sierra de Bahoruco to the south

The lake has an area of 265 km and its surface is around 44 meters below sea level the lowest point in the Caribbean There are three small islands in the lake Isla Cabritos Barbarita and La Islita

Only small rivers flow into the lake The rivers that flow from the Sierra de Neiba always have water Those rivers that flow from the Sierra de Bahoruco sometimes do not have water

It is a salt water lake with a higher concentration of salt than the sea water because the rivers that flow into the lake are small and the evaporation of its water is high

Many water birds visit the lake to feed including flamingos There are also American crocodiles and some fishes as tilapia Because it is an arid region the vegetation around the lake is poor with cacti and small shrubs

The lake is part of the Lago Enriquillo e Isla Cabritos National Park and of the Jaragua  Bahoruco  Enriquillo Biosphere Reserve

The Battle of Crcy happened on 26 August 1346 near Crcy in northern France and was one of the most important battles of the Hundred Years War The smaller English army won against the much larger French army New tactics and weapons make this an important battle in the history of warfare because the English used longbows to win against French knights The longbow was a faster weapon to fire than the French and Genoan crossbow and could send arrows farther than the crossbow could and could send an arrow through a suit of armour Before this battle during the Middle Ages knights had been the most important part of an army Because of this change some historians call this battle the beginning of the end of chivalry

In the battle the French knights protected by chainmail reinforced with metal plate were nearly exhausted by charging several miles into the battle Their horses had to to walk through deep mud and charge up a hill into English and Welsh arrow storm They were cut down Many French nobles died The knights horses were barely protected at all The storm of arrows killed or disabled the knights mounts and left the knights floundering in the mud on foot beneath a hail of arrows

The bolts of the hired Genoese crossbowmen at the forefront of the battle could not reach the English They fell short because the crossbow strings were wet The archers had also misjudged the range and shot too early and too low The English controlling the high ground were able to run a short distance down the hill and pick off the Genoese with volleys of arrows As the Genoese attempted to retreat they were cut down by the French knights who thought the withdrawal was cowardly This wasted the first charge of French cavalry and left them disorganized for the charge on the English

In a strong defensive position Edward III ordered that everyone fight on foot He split the army in three divisions one commanded by his sixteen year old son Edward the Black Prince The archers were set in a V formation along the top of the hill While they waited the English built a system of ditches pits and caltrops to hurt and bring down the enemy cavalry

Arthur Meier Schlesinger Jr born Arthur Bancroft Schlesinger was a American historian and social critic He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize His work explored the liberalism of American political leaders especially that of Franklin D Roosevelt John F Kennedy and Robert F Kennedy He served as Special Assistant and Court Historian to the President in John F Kennedys administration He wrote a lot about the Kennedy administration These writings have the title A Thousand Days 

When the United States thought about invading Cuba at the Bay of Pigs he was one of only two people who opposed the invasion The other was William Fulbright Schlesinger sat silent except for a private memorandum to the president He did this because he did not want to undermine the Presidents desire for a unanimous decision 

When it had become clear the invasion had failed Schlesinger later wrote In the months after the Bay of Pigs I bitterly reproached myself for having kept so silent during those crucial discussions in the cabinet room I can only explain my failure to do more than raise a few timid questions by reporting that ones impulse to blow the whistle on this nonsense was simply undone by the circumstances of the discussion

Schlesinger contributed many things to liberal theory He was mostly for the kind of liberalism Kennedy did He was admired for his wit scholarship and devotion to delineating the history and nature of liberalism Since 1990 he had been a critic of multiculturalism

He popularized the term imperial presidency during the Nixon administration by writing the book The Imperial Presidency

There are five levels of government in Germany The local government means the lowest two levels The levels are all legally independent political levels This means that each level has a job to do in running the country and is recognised in the German constitution the Grundgesetz The levels can only be reorganised if they agree and if it does not give too much power to a higher level

The five levels are

Some states have regierungsbezirke which are a group of counties and cities in an area to help run certain tasks across the area

Other states have Amt which is a collection of municipalities in a district usually because the municipalities themselves are too small to run many services

Regierungsbezirke and mte are not guaranteed by the constitution they are a way of helping the various levels of government to do their job

The idea of subsidiarity means that government jobs should be done by the lowest possible level

There are two types of tasks for a municipality Voluntary which a town or municipality can do if it wants and mandatory or things which must be done because of a federal or state law

Setting up a theatre a museum a sports field or a meeting hall is a voluntary task If the municipality can afford to set these things up the Land cannot stop them Also the Land cannot order the municiaplity to set these things up

The mandatory self government tasks are things which a municipality must do itself or must arrange to be done on its behalf For example one of the most important jobs of any local council is to providing the citizens with water electricity district heating gas as well as wastewater services and waste removal

A council could run its own waterworks or join with others to share a larger facility Modern electricity supply means that a council does not have to run their own power station anymore But they must help private companies get the electricity supply to local houses and factories

Although the Federation or state might have the right to control some things the idea of subsidiarity means that they are administered at the lowest possible level For example marriage ceremonies and issuing birth and death certificates are arranged by the town registrar the Federation and the Land arrange legal and expert supervision so that the task is done properly and is the same across Germany

Other transferred tasks include

Who runs the town or district government depends on where in Germany the town is

The town council or town council meeting is responsible for all jobs not given to the magistrat The magistrat is the executive responsible for administering services It is chosen by the town council and can have both professional and honorary members The mayor is head of the magistrat but not of the town council meeting The mayor is chosen separately by the people not the council the system is only used in Hesse It is the oldest system and the only system where a group of elected people are responsible for the administration instead of just one the mayor

The mayor is head of the council and the administration

Power is split between the Mayor and the town clerk The Mayor has some functions but day to day administration is done by the professional town clerk

Used in Bavaria and the old eastern lnder The mayor is elected by the people and he heads the council and the town government The council is responsible for nearly all decisions Some deision are taken by the mayor The council can give some its tasks to the mayor but in that case they cannot change the mayors decision

Mendelian inheritance is a set of rules about genetic inheritance 

The basic rules of genetics were first discovered by a monk named Gregor Mendel in the 1850s and published in 1866 For thousands of years people had noticed how traits are inherited from parents to their children However Mendels work was different because he did experiments on plants and designed those experiments very carefully 

In his experiments Mendel studied how traits were passed on in pea plants He started his crosses with plants that bred true and counted characters that were eitheror in nature He bred large numbers of plants and expressed his results numerically He used test crosses to reveal the presence and proportion of recessive characters

Mendels laws apply widely but not to all living things They apply to any organism which is diploid and which engages in sexual reproduction They would not apply to bacteria for example or to asexual reproduction They do apply to the great majority of plants and animals

Mendel explained the results of his experiment using two scientific laws

The factors determine the organisms traits and are inherited from its parents As the pair of chromosomes separate each gamete only receives one of each factor This Mendel called the Law of segregation

Mendels laws explained the results he got with his pea plants Later geneticists discovered that his laws were also true for other living things even humans Mendels findings from his work on the garden pea plants helped to establish the field of genetics His contributions were not limited to the basic rules that he discovered Mendels care towards controlling experiment conditions along with his attention to his numerical results set a standard for future experiments Over the years scientists have changed and improved Mendels ideas However the science of genetics would not be possible today without the early work of Gregor Mendel

He wrote two books and some articles on Cuban politics especially on the US embargo which he thinks is not good

In an article published in the British academic journal Democratization in 1998 he focused in particular on how the US embargo against Cuba helps create empathy by third parties towards Cuba so that Cubans think it is support for Cubas government So he argued that the US Government in addition to the embargos direct influence on supporting Cubas regime indirectly interferes with the possibility of improving Cuba That is because third countries foreign non governmental organizations and prominent individuals lend support to Cubas resistance to the US embargo and this offsets external pressures for democracy thereby allowing the Cuban regime to convert such empathy into a source of legitimacy at home

His scholarly work on internal Cuban politics notably on the 1996 purge of Havanas Centre for American Studies has been the object of academic reviews as it exposed the internal conflicts between Cubas political apparatus and the countrys intelligentsia previously unknown According to some reviews the book a work of investigative journalism helped by academic analysis dealt a strong blow to hard liners within the regime by exposing for the first time the internal conflicts between Cubas apparatus and its intelligentsia In 2001 Cuban exiled scholars Alberto lvarez and Gerardo Gonzlez who were among those purged from the CEA wrote the book Intelectuales vs Revolucin  El caso del Centro de Estudios sobre Amrica which strongly built upon Giulianos book to offer further insights on relations between Cubas political apparatus and the countrys intellectuals

Giulianos writings have also included lighter topics During his time in Kabul for example he wrote restaurant reviews for a local English language magazine 

In the early 2000s Giuliano was a consultant for the Italian Senates Committee on Human Rights At that time at least some of his writings were also intended to influence the positions of the Italian Government on certain human rights issues as was the case with material that he wrote on North Korea

Aang is a fictional character and the main hero in Nickelodeons television series Avatar The Last Airbender The character was made by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko and voiced by Zach Tyler Eisen He has take part in all the episodes of Avatar except Zuko Alone Aang is also in the first episode The Boy In The Iceberg Aang appears in other media like trading cards video games T shirts and web comics

Aang is the last Airbender They were the only race of people who could control the air He is 112 years old He has not become older because he had been frozen in an iceberg for 100 years and is still like a 12 year old because he used Avatar State to protect himself and his bison In the second show it is discovered that Aang is the living form of the Avatar This is the spirit of the planet in human form As the Avatar Aang controls the elements and must keep the Four Nations at peace The show follows Aangs journeys to do this

Most of Aangs habits such as vegetarianism are based on Buddhist and Taoist tradition Aang is the series unwilling hero He shows hesitation when joining his friends to save the world from the Fire Nation His lighthearted personality has been praised by critics The creators wanted Aang to win enemies with his wits and be a trickster hero

Aangs character was created by Bryan Konietzko The sketch showed a middle aged man with an arrow on his head Konietzko changed the character into a picture of a child with a flying bison At the same time Michael Dante DiMartino was interested in a documentary about explorers trapped in the South Pole The idea caused the pair to think

The plot they described relates with the first and second episodes of the series where the water people find the air guy while trapped in a snowy wasteland with some fire people that are pressing down on them The creators of the show made Aang to be frozen in an iceberg for 1000 years He was to wake inside a futuristic world where he would have a robot named Momo and a flying bison named Appa The creators lost interest in the theme and changed it to 100 years of suspended animation The robotic Momo was changed to a flying lemur and the herd of bison was reduced to one

Aangs character has a well grown cultural belief According to the shows creators Avatar based on the belief of Buddhism and Taoism A important part of the character is his vegetarian diet regular with Buddhism or Taoism In the Brahmajala Sutra a Buddhist code of ethics vegetarianism is encouraged In The King of Omashu Aang shows his vegetarian beliefs by refusing to eat meat Aang shows a reluctance to fight and an dislike of killing In The Spirit World Aang gets into a fight with an angry spirit who is destroying a village because the people burned his home Instead of fighting the spirit Aang talks with it 

Airbending the element that Aang mainly uses in the show is based on Baguazhang an internal Chinese martial art This fighting style focuses on circular movements and does not have many finishing moves These characteristics were meant to show the unpredictability of air and the peaceful nature of Airbenders in the show

In the episode Tales of Ba Sing Se Aangs name was written as in Chinese

The creators of the show call each season a book and each episode a chapter each of these books was take the name of element that Aang must control except the air Flashbacks also reveal events that happened before the show opened In a flashback during The Storm Aang remembered the day when elder monks told him that he was the Avatar Monk Gyatso Aangs teacher and father figure said that Aang must be raised as a normal child Nearing the end the monks began to believe that Gyatso interfered too much so they decide to send Aang to the Eastern Air Temple Aang refuses to be torn away from his mentor he writes a note for Gyatso before flying away on his bison Appa It is revealed in the first episodes of the show that a violent storm catches Aang and sends him into the ocean during his escape Aang then enters the Avatar State unknowingly for the first time to encase himself and Appa in a frozen air bubble An image of this air bubble resembling an iceberg ends the flashback

After the 100 years he was in the iceberg with his bison the story starts when Katara and her brother Sokka free Aang and Appa in the first episode In the next episode they all started the trip to the Northern Water Tribe with hope to find a waterbending master to teach Aang and Katara how to control the water During their journey they are chased by Zuko the banished prince of the Fire Nation who must capture the Avatar to return his honor In one episode Aang meets his previous incarnation Avatar Roku who said him that he must learn all four bending arts and win Fire Lord Ozai before the end of summer When the team named team Avatar arrived in the Northern Water Tribe a Waterbender named Master Pakku teaches Aang waterbending Later in the second season Aang meets Toph Bei Fong a blind earthbending who becomes his earthbending teacher Later Aang and his friends learn about the solar eclipse which will occur before the end of the summer and will block the Firebenders powerless During the season finale a guru tried to teach Aang how to open up his seven chakras in order to control the Avatar State When Aang has a vision of Katara being in danger he leaves the Air Temple where he is being taught before the seventh chakra is opened locking it He then battles in the underground caverns of Ba Sing Se He is killed when Azula strikes him with lightning but is brought back to life thanks to Kataras special water that has healing abilities and also her healing abilities

In the third season Aang and his friends had to win a new enemy  an killer hired by Zuko who shoots with his third eye Aang and his friends from Earth Kingdom attack the Fire Nation capital during the solar eclipse but the invasion failed because Azula knew about it In the next episode Zuko offers to teach Aang firebending Aang accepts despite the groups strong opposition In The Firebending Masters Aang learns firebending with the help of the last two dragons

Before the final battle with Ozai he is trapped with his friends because he does not find correct he kills Ozai After he sleepwalks into a forest he speaks with four previous Avatars and asking for advice Each gives him a reason to kill the Fire Lord Ozai discouraging him After discovering that the forest is atop a swimming lion turtle and receiving advice from said lion turtle he prepares to confront the Fire Lord Once Ozai arrives Aang engages him in battle After sparing Ozai when redirecting his lightning and then being backed into a corner Aang enters the Avatar State The Avatar State tips the battle in Aangs favor and makes swift work of Ozai Using a technique taught to him by the lion turtle which called Energybending Aang removes Ozais ability to firebend effectively eliminating the threat Later in the Fire Nation capital Aang is seen in monk robes standing beside Zuko while he become Fire Lord He is later seen relaxing with his friends in Ba Sing Se The series ends with Aang and Katara kissing

Michael Dante DiMartino one of the shows creators said

Aang is a vegetarian as shown in The King of Omashu and The Headband when he refuses to eat meat since the Air Nomads taught him that life is holy Aang states a reluctance to fight in The Spirit World Aang hopelessly negotiates with a spirit who is destroying a village instead of fighting Due to his non violent nature he also shows ethical reluctance refusing to killing Firelord Ozai and eventually strips Ozai of his bending instead of killing him In the show Aang has a complex network of friends extending over all four nations

Aang in The Storm said that he wishes he had been there to help Air Nomads a century ago but would rather live a childs carefree life Many times in the show Aang shows how much he cares for those are close to him He also showed that he can act immaturely and once tried to deceive others in order to keep the group together In Bato of the Water Tribe Aang thinks Katara and Sokka might leave to visit their father Aang hides the map showing their fathers whereabouts and lies about having it in the first place

In some episodes he shows flight abilities with airbending One technique for this is to make a sphere of air and ride on it which Aang calls the Air Scooter Other methods of flying include his glider and Appa In the Avatar State Aang can also fly inside a ball of air

In the shows intended demographics Aang has been received very well Kendall Lyons said that Aang seems to be the happy kid that you can easily familiarize yourself with and that he seems to bring comfort in the most dangerous or trouble situations There are many similar descriptions about Aang as a child like character who is reckless and excitable Reviews point out that as the Avatar Aang seems unstoppable but as Aang he is just another like an airbender The review says later that the show continues to focus on a more realistic character instead of a perfect one by showing many weaknesses in his character

Aangs character showed in the Avatar The Last Airbender Trading Card Game He is 1 of the 4 characters of Avatar The Last Airbender video game a video game based on the first season of the show Two sequels were made Avatar The Last Airbender  The Burning Earth a video game based on the second season of the show and Avatar The Last Airbender  Into the Inferno a video game based on the third season Avatar T shirts some with Aangs face on them are being sold on the Nickelodeon Shop website Tokyopop has published a films comic in which Aang is the main character like in Avatar The Last Airbender

Aang is in Escape from the Spirit World an online video game that is on Nickelodeons real website The game has some plot changes that are not in the show The shows directors Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko say the events are canon

In 2008 M Night Shyamalan a film director cast 12 year old Tae Kwon Do practitioner Noah Ringer as Aang in the film adaptation of the series The Last Airbender The casting of a white actor in the role of Aang in the Asian influenced Avatar universe triggered negative reactions from some fans marked by accusations of racism a letter writing campaign and a protest outside of a Philadelphia casting call for movie extras The casting decisions were also negatively received by several critics who stated that the original casting call expressed a preference for Caucasian actors over others

Jak and Daxter is a series of video games developed by the company Naughty Dog It is named after the two heroes of the games Right now five games are in the series

All of the Jak and Daxter games happen on a planet that is similar to Earth where many creatures who look like humans with long ears live A long time ago beings called Precursors lived on the planet but disappeared and the people use the machines the Precursors left behind Outside of cities and villages there are many wild and dangerous animals 

A substance called Eco is also used by the people It can be found as gas liquid or even solid crystals There are several different kinds of Eco and all the different Ecos can do special things Green Eco can heal injuries or damage and Blue Eco can make things move faster There is also Dark Eco a dangerous kind of Eco which can kill or mutate In the first Jak and Daxter game Jak and Daxter The Precursor Legacy the character Daxter falls into a pit full of Dark Eco and turns into an Ottsel a fictional or not real cross between an otter and a weasel

When Naughty Dog first told people about Jak and Daxter people were very excited because Naughty Dog had made the famous Crash Bandicoot series Jak and Daxter The Precursor Legacy was one of the first video games to use something called streaming which means that the game loads while it is being played so there are no loading screens It was also very similar to the games Super Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie because players need to jump explore and collect a special kind of object to win the game

After The Precursor Legacy the Jak and Daxter games started to be about other things not just jumping and finding things Jak II the second game gives the player guns to shoot and vehicles to drive This is like in the Grand Theft Auto video games 

The first three games of the Jak series Precursor Legacy Jak II and Jak 3 are still mainly about platforming The player controls the character Jak or the character Daxter in jumping puzzles to get to a goal The character can only get hit by wild animals or monsters only a few times before dying and having to start the goal over but the character can get life back by touching Green Eco In Jak 3 the player can get armor that lets Jak be hit more before dying 

The player can also use attacks or guns to kill the monsters before Jak or Daxter is hit and hurt

The term carbon footprint is how much carbon goes into the air because of something done by people Doing something that burns fuel will make carbon dioxide gas in the smoke Carbon dioxide has carbon in it Just as walking on the sand leaves a footprint burning fuel leaves carbon dioxide in the air which is called a carbon footprint

Oil gas and coal are called fossil fuels because they come from fossils of ancient plants and animals Those plants and animals had carbon in them So when we burn oil gas and coal the carbon becomes carbon dioxide and goes into the air as smoke This makes pollution It also makes the greenhouse effect which means that the carbon dioxide makes the earth warmer like a greenhouse A carbon footprint is the carbon dioxide that is put into the air because of a person a group of people an event or a product

The words carbon footprint are often seen in the news They are used with the word sustainability which means that we can keep doing something without making something bad happen That is if there is too much of a carbon footprint then there is no sustainability People and businesses are often asked to think about how much carbon they are putting into the air and how this changes the environment and maybe causes global warming This is often said about traveling by airplane or by car because burning fuel makes carbon dioxide gas

The Louisiana Purchase was a land purchase made by United States president Thomas Jefferson in 1803 He bought the Louisiana territory from France which was being led by Napoleon Bonaparte at the time for 15000000 USD At first the men sent to France were allowed to spend up to 10000000 USD in order to buy New Orleans and if possible the west bank of the Mississippi River But then the French government said that for five million more dollars they would sell all of the Louisiana territory Thomas Jefferson approved the deal and used his constitutional power to sign treaties to buy the land Napoleon sold the land because he was desperate for money and he was afraid of losing his North American territories to the BritishNapoleon Bonaparte had been busy with a war in Europe and no matter how badly that Bonaparte wanted to go about in his interests with America there was no way that he could do so with what he had been occupied in Europe with Thomas Jefferson took this as an opportunity to make America larger even if it meant going against his republican principles of only doing exactly what the Constitution said he could do

The Louisiana Purchase is important because it gave the US control of the Mississippi River and the port city of New Orleans both of which were used by farmers to ship their crops and get paid It also got rid of one country that might try to harm the new nation because France sold all of their North American territory
