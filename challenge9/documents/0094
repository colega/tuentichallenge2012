The Hipparcos Catalogue is a list of stars named after the Greek astronomer Hipparchus He listed the position of several hundred stars Each star in the catalogue has a designation of HIP or HP

Pashtuns also spelled Pushtuns or Pakhtuns or Pukhtuns Pashto speaking people of southeastern Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan They make the majority of the population of Afghanistan

The Pashtuns claim descent from the ancient Hebrews though most scholars believe it more likely that they arose from an intermingling of ancient Aryans from the north or west with subsequent invaders

The Pashtun people follow a strict code of honor known as Pashtunwli that requires them to support the poor the weak and the challenged to fight evil to provide shelter to anyone who needs it and many more

The Pashtuns are farmers herdsmen and warriors Most tribesmen are sedentary farmers combining cultivation with animal husbandry some are migratory herdsmen and caravaners Large numbers of them have always been attracted to military service

There are estimated to be about 12000000 Pashtun in Afghanistan and 28000000 in Pakistan They comprise about 60 tribes of varying size and importance each of which occupies a particular territory In Afghanistan where Pashtun are the predominant ethnic group the main tribes are the Durrn south of Kabul and the Ghilzay east of Kabul

The Cod Wars also called the Iceland Cod Wars were a series of confrontations in the 1950s and 1970s between the United Kingdom and Iceland regarding fishing rights in the North Atlantic The name of the conflict may be derived from a pun on the term Cold War possibly via the British tabloid press

In 1972 Iceland unilaterally declared an Exclusive Economic Zone extending beyond its territorial waters before announcing plans to reduce over fishing It policed its quota system with the coast guard leading to a series of net cutting incidents with British trawlers that fished the areas As a result a fleet of British Royal Naval warships and tug boats was employed to act as a deterrent against any future harassment of British fishing crews by the Icelandic craft

In 1976 a compromise between the two states allowed a maximum of 24 British trawlers access to the disputed 200 nautical mile limit Two hundred nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zones became recognized internationally on November 14 1994 after having been agreed at the conference on the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982

Sirius is a binary star system in Canis Major Orions larger dog It is the brightest star in the night sky with a magnitude of 144

Sirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun and has an absolute visual magnitude of 142 It is 25 times more luminous than the Sun but has a significantly lower luminosity than other bright stars such as Canopus or Rigel The system is between 200 and 300 million years old It was originally composed of two bright bluish stars The more massive of these Sirius B consumed its resources and became a red giant before shedding its outer layers and collapsing into its current state as a white dwarf around 120 million years ago

The Egyptians called this star Sopdet They relied on this star to predict when the flood season would start

The phrase the dog days of summer means the hottest days of summer Sirius is sometimes called the Dog Star Some of the ancient peoples thought that the heat from Sirius would add to the heat of the Sun

The society of Pakistan has many different cultures The east of country is mainly Punjabi the south is mainly Sindhi in the east are the tribal cultures In many areas the tribes and cultures are mixed most Pakistanis are Punjabis and most of the nation are Sunni Muslim

The cultures have been greatly influenced by the surrounding cultures of India Afghanistan Central Asia and the Middle East along with other places Pakistan in ancient times was a major cultural hub the home of ancient civilisations including the Indus Valley Civilization the foundation of Indian culture Many cultural practices have been inherited from the rule of many rulers of the region that have added their cultural traditions One of the most influenced cultures being the Mughals

Canopus or Alpha Carinae in the Bayer designation system is the brightest star in its constellation and the brightest star in the southern night sky

Canopus is quite unusual because its distance from Earth was not known until the 1990s Before the launching of the Hipparcos satellite telescope distance estimates for the star varied widely from 96 light years to 1200 light years Hipparcos established Canopus as lying 310 light years from our solar system 

The difficulty in measuring Canopus distance stemmed from its being a less luminous supergiant Such stars are rare and poorly understood They are stars that can be either in the process of evolving to or away from red giant status This in turn made it difficult to know how intrinsically bright Canopus is and therefore how far away it might be Direct measurement was the only way to solve the problem Canopus is too far away for Earth based parallax observations to be made so the stars distance was not known with certainty until the early 1990s

Canopus is 13600 times more luminous than the Sun and the most intrinsically bright star within about 700 light years In fact from 1 astronomical unit Canopus would have an apparent magnitude of 37 Canopus appears less bright than Sirius in our sky only because Sirius is much closer to the Earth

The surface temperature of Canopus is 7350 30 K Its diameter has been measured at 06 astronomical units 65 times that of the Sun If it were placed at the centre of the solar system it would extend three quarters of the way to Mercury An Earth like planet would have to lie three times the distance of Pluto for its star to appear the same size in the sky as our own sun Canopus is a strong source of X rays which are probably produced by its corona magnetically heated to around 15 million K

Canopus is part of the Scorpius Centaurus Association a group of stars which share similar origins

The Bayer designation for stars uses Greek letters to assign names to stars For example

It usually starts with the letter alpha assigned to the brightest star in the constellation then going down the Greek alphabet to assign letters for other stars Occasionally this rule is not followed

Flamsteed designations assign stars with specific names using numbers

The stars are assigned according to their right ascension which is the position from a certain vertical drawn around the celestial sphere

The Demographics of Pakistan are a study of the population and the people It is estimated that Pakistans population was over 170000000 in mid 2008 Pakistan had an estimated population of 169300000 as of July 2007 Between 1951 1998 the number of people in Pakistans cities and towns increased sevenfold And by the next decade the population is expected to exceed 176 million In the past the countrys population had a quite high growth rate Dramatic social changes have led to rapid urbanisation and the emergence of megacities Between 1990 2003 Pakistan sustained its historical lead as the most urbanised nation in South Asia with city dwellers making up 34 of its population

Pakistan has a multicultural and multi ethnic society and has one of the largest refugee populations in the world as well as a young population

The history of colonialism goes back thousands of years colonialism is the taking over of one country by another In ancient times peoples such as the Hittites and the Incas were involved in colonialism

However people usually use the word colonialism to talk about the European overseas empires rather than land based empires Overseas empires include British rule in India and French rule in Algeria  both of which could only be reached by ships

Land based empires are usually described as imperialism and include

The Ottoman Empire was created across Mediterranean North Africa and into Southern Europe and existed during the time of European colonization of the other parts of the world

European colonialism began in the fifteenth century when the Spanish and Portuguese began exploring the Americas and the coasts of Africa the Middle East India and East Asia

During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries England France and Holland made their own overseas empires However the end of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century many European colonies in the Americas gained their independence

Spain and Portugal became weakened after the loss of their New World colonies and could not get back the power they once had But Britain France and Holland turned their attention to South Africa India and South East Asia and began expanding

In the nineteenth century Europe underwent industrialisation the population got larger armies became more organised and had better weapons produced in factories This time became known as the era of New Imperialism Very quickly European powers were able to take over land and included the Scramble for Africa

After World War I the European countries who had lost the war had to give up their colonies to the countries that had won the war For instance Britain which won the war took over Tanzania from Germany

After World War II however Europes colonies started to become independent In 1999 Portugal returned the last of Europes colonies in Asia Macau to China ending an era that had lasted five hundred years

The Pakistan Movement was a political movement which was active during the first half of the 20th century At that time British India belonged to Great Britain In British India most people were Hindu and only very few were Muslim The people who made the movement feared they would lose their liberty when the English left They therefore wanted to create a separate state This struggle was led by the Muslim League and resulted in the partition of the British Empire in India The movement was led by Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah Other important leaders were Nawab Ismail Khan Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan Fatimah Jinnah Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy Chaudhary Khaliquzzaman AK Fazlul Huq and Sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar

The first person who had the idea of a separate state was not Allama Iqbal as is reckoned generally He only forwarded the theory onwards in his speech in 1930 It was a prevailing idea that has its origins in United Provinces of Agra and Oudh From 1901 onwards many muslim scholars had been proposing the idea of a separate muslim state within the subcontinentChoudhary Rahmat Ali proposed the name Pakistan in his Pakistan Declaration in 1933 People like Muhammad Ali Jinnah maintained their belief in religious unity Religious hostilities between Hindus and Muslims gave the movement a stronger backing

In 1940 during its meeting in Lahore the Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution that asked for an independent state of Pakistan Soon after World War II the United Kingdom became convinced that they would not be able to keep their colonies in South Asia as the British Empire suffered very badly from the war By 1947 British India was divided into a Muslim majority Pakistan and a Hindu majority India Bangladesh split form Pakistan in 1971

Tobias is a Greek form of the Hebrew name Tobijah from the Bible meaning Jehovah God is good It is a popular male first name in Germany Scandinavia the United States and among Jewish people In countries that speak English it is often shortened to Toby Other short forms are Tobi and Tobbe Tobias has also been a surname

Several people are called Tobias in The Bible

The surname Tobias may refer to the following people

A flying disc is a flat round object with a thick rim The rim make the disc easier to grip and throw and also keeps the disc from turning over as it flies Detailed throwing instructions are below but the basic goal is to throw the disc while also making the disc spin 

Also mentioned below is a flying ring made under the brand name Aerobie Although these designs are very different they both use air resistance in the same way to fly

Unlike the Aerobie flying discs are used in both Ultimate Frisbee and Disc Golf The Frisbee brand of flying disc is rarely used in official competition in either game which is why the team sport of Ultimate Frisbee is officially called simply Ultimate Still as Kleenex was once a word used to mean facial tissue Frisbee is still broadly used as a synonym for a flying disc

The Aerobie Superdisk is an alternative design of flying disc that although somewhat differently shaped still has very similar properties to the conventional disc It has less air resistance Because there is less resistance to motion the Aerobie discs can fly farther than the conventional disc The Aerobie flying ring has minimal drag and holds the world record for the longest flight by a human thrown projectile However due to the lack of a rim the Aerobie is less suited to angled curved flights and air bouncingFactdateJune 2008

The spin of the disc helps to keep the disc stable in flight and prevent unplanned tilting This is because a large angular momentum stabilises the disc in the same way that it keeps a gyroscope steady with the angular force forcing the mass of the disc away from the centre of mass perpendicular to the axis of rotation Any unequal force acting on a particular area of the disc is quickly redirected to be equal over the circumference of the disc

As the disc spins faster it becomes more stable due to the rapidity of the equalisation of forces

The force required to accelerate the disc is directly proportional to the mass of the disc This decreases the acceleration of the disc assuming that the force of projection is constant Therefore discs come in a variety of weights although those used for Ultimate are mainly 175 g in mass heavier than the majority of discs and considerably heavier than an aerobie

Flying discs can be thrown in many ways All involve spinning the disc to give it gyroscopic stability and accelerating its mass to a certain velocity Without spin a disc will wobble and fall without velocity the disc will not go anywhere Using these two guidelines any number of throws are possible Most discs are designed to create lift when thrown with the flat side up

Right side up throws are all similar in that they react the same way to the tilt of the disc when it is released A disc thrown right side up will accelerate in the direction of the low end of the disc A disc tilted leading edge up will lose speed at the end of the throw and make a gentle landing if tilted sideways it can curve around objects

There is a language for describing throws that curve Both descriptions are relative to the direction the person is facing and intends to throw This axis is marked in red in the picture

This is probably the most commonly learned throw and also one of the most powerful 

This throw is also known as the flick two finger or the side arm Focused in the wrist this throw takes little time to execute Along with the backhand it is one of the two most common throws used in Ultimate

The forehand is a versatile throw and can be adapted to many different situations

The Push Pass A relatively little used throw it is thrown with a grip similar to a backhand but is released on the forehand side from a forehand stance A pronating wrist snap similar to a forehand release pushes the disc forward while spin is imparted backwards by rolling the disc off the index finger A final flick of the index finger finishes the release It is difficult to impart as much spin to the push pass as one can typically impart to a forehand or backhand resulting in a less stable throw It is useful in Ultimate for very short throws released to the forehand side

The thumber forehand is also known as a The Beach Thumber Peach or in the sport of guts simply as a thumber Its primary advantage is that it can be thrown quite hard and with a great amount of spin and is relatively easy to learn It is often seen used in a game of Guts due to its power and velocity It is unpopular in Ultimate due to several disadvantages when compared to the standard forehand It is relatively difficult to impart different curves or release angles to it is harder to release extended away from the throwers body and it makes for slow grip transitions to a backhand or hammer

The Overhand is rarely used among ultimate players because the alternative the traditional forehand allows greater sideways arm extension useful in moving the disc around defenders The Overhand is most useful when the disc is caught above the head and must be thrown quickly without changing grips such as during a Greatest attempt

The Duck is thrown with a similar grip to the Overhand except it is the backward version of it While the Overhand is thrown with counter clockwise spin the duck is thrown with clockwise spin It is usually thrown with the arm out to the side or above the head It is called the duck due to the shape of the gripping hand during the throw as if making a duck shadow puppet This throw is used in attempts at The Greatest

A disc thrown upside down has a very different flight path than one thrown right side up The lift force does not enforce stable flight as it does on a right side up disc resulting in a more of a parabolic arc in flight As with a right side up throw however the flight path of the disc will curve toward the lower edge This banking effect is most pronounced when the disc is at a 45 degree angle and less pronounced when it is near vertical or near horizontal 

Gyroscopic precession causes the disc to rotate toward horizontal through its flight path Unlike a right side up throw however an upside down disc will not precess toward a stable flat state and will in stead oscillate past horizontal and begin to bank in the opposite direction This shuttlecock like effect is known as helixing and is generally avoided due to the difficulty in controlling a helixing flight path For this reason an upside down throw is typically released with either clockwise rotation and the left edge up or counterclockwise rotation and the right edge up The longer the disc is expected to remain in the air the closer to vertical it must be at release to avoid the helixing effect

Hammer The Hammer is gripped just like a normal forehand throw and is generally a mid range high and arching throw

A hammer when thrown by a right handed thrower will arc up and to the left as it moves away from the thrower and will bank towards the right in flight The banking effect will be more pronounced if the disc is thrown higher and spends more flight time near a 45 degree angle

Another upside down variant of the forehand the scoober is similar to a hammer but released away from the body from a backhand stance instead of over the head from a forehand stance The scoober travels in a path similar to the hammer although the initial release is typically more flat than a hammer release Although it is more difficult to impart power to a scoober than a hammer a scoober can be an effective short range throw and is used in Ultimate for breaking the mark and to throw over defenders in a zone defense

The Thumber is a throw that is rarely used in competitive play compared to the Hammer or standard forehand It has a flight path that is the mirror image of the Hammer It can be useful when the disc needs to drop quickly and fly with an opposite curve to a Hammer in order to avoid defenders

This table represents the fundamental disc throws with classic technique in the foreward form in fact exist many variations of throws and grips that make the number of pitches quite infinite 

The natural path is the trajectory the disc takes without pre release tilt

The hyzer path is the trajectory the disc takes when the outside edge of the disc is tilted downward

The anhyzer path is the trajectory the disc takes when the outside edge of the disc is tilted upward

The spin is the rotation of the disc

Every throw can be done with the right hand or the left hand and this is shown in the hand column

RHright hand LHleft hand Rthe path tends to the right of the thrower Lthe path tends to the left of the thrower 0 means that the path is quite linear

So R with RH and L with LH are outside in paths R with LH and L with RH are inside out paths

In spin column numbers represent the sign of the angular momentum relative to the upside of the disc

Throws may be signed as follows hand acronymthrow acronymtilt acronym For example LHBHIO is an inside out backhand throw pitched with the left hand RHFH0 is a linear forehand throw pitched with the right hand To have linear paths the disc must be released with a light opposite tilt than his natural path

Vilnius is the capital of Lithuania

Historians tend to identify the city with Voruta a legendary capital of Mindaugas who was crowned in 1253 as King of Lithuania The city was first mentioned in written sources in 1323 in letters of Grand Duke Gediminas that were sent to German cities and invited Germans and members of the Jewish community to settle in the capital city In 1387 the city was granted city rights by Jogaila one of Gediminas successors

Between 1503 and 1522 the walls were built to protect the city and at the time it had nine city gates and three towers Vilnius reached the peak of its development under the reign of Sigismund August who moved his court there in 1544 In the following centuries Vilnius became a constantly growing and developing city This growth was due in part to the establishment of Almae Academia et Universitas Vilnensis Societatis Jesu by the King Stephen Bathory in 1579 The university soon developed into one of the most important scientific and cultural centres of the region and the most notable scientific centre of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth Political economic and social activities were in full swing in the town In 1769 the Rasos Cemetery one of the oldest surviving cemeteries in the city was founded During its rapid development the city was open to migrants from both abroad and far reaches of territories of Grand Duchy of Lithuania Each group made its unique contribution to the life of the city and crafts trade and science prospered During the Russo Polish War Vilnius was occupied by Russia for several years The city was pillaged and burned and its population was massacred The citys growth lost its momentum for many years but the population rebounded and by the beginning of the 19th century citys population reached 20000 making the city one of the largest in Northern Europe

During World War I Vilnius as with the rest of Lithuania was occupied by the German Empire from 1915 until 1918 The Act of Independence of Lithuania that restored Lithuanian independence from any affiliation to any other nation was proclaimed in the city on February 16 1918 After the withdrawal of German forces Lithuanian forces were forced to retreat by advancing Russian occupation forces Vilnius changed hands many times for a while it was controlled by Polish self defence units who didnt want the city to be occupied by Russian Bolshevik forces Then the Polish Army regained control then Soviet forces again Shortly after its defeat in the Battle of Warsaw the retreating Red Army ceded the city back to Lithuania by signing a peace treaty on July 12 1920 On October 9 of the same year the Polish Army under General Lucjan eligowski broke the treaty and seized Vilnius after a staged coup The city and its surroundings were proclaimed as the separate state of Central Lithuania On February 20 1922 after an elections the whole area was attached to Poland with the city as the capital of the Wilno Voivodship The predominant languages of the city were still Polish and to a lesser extent YiddishImageVilnius HMG Orthodox churchjpgthumbleftOrthodox Cathedral of the Theotokos with Gediminas Tower in background

Over 75 of Virgin Atlantics flights fly from London Heathrow Airport Most of the rest fly from London Gatwick Airport Manchester Airport or Glasgow Airport

Virgin flies to nine cities in the USA nine cities in the Caribbean five cities in Africa five cities in Asia and to Sydney in Australia

Virgin Atlantic has lots of partners Here is a list of them

Also Virgin Atlantic has codesharing partnerships with these airlines

Virgin Atlantic has been talking to Lufthansa about bmi Lufthansa has said that it wants to sell bmi because it is not making enough money bmi is part of the Star Alliance but Virgin Atlantic is not If Virgin Atlantic buys bmi they may join Star Alliance This means that they can compete against British Airways on the London Heathrow Airport to John F Kennedy International Airport route British Airways is part of oneworld

Virgin Atlantic owns 25 Airbus A340 aeroplanes and 13 Boeing 747 aeroplanes It also has three orders one order is for 6 Airbus A380 aeroplanes another order is for 10 Airbus A330 aeroplanes and the last order is for 15 Boeing 787 aeroplanes The 787 aircraft should be delivered first in the year 2011 The A380 aircraft should be delivered in the year 2013 The A330 aircraft should be delivered in 2011

Virgin Atlantic used to have some other aircraft too It used to own 5 Airbus A320s 3 Airbus A321s 1 Boeing 747 100 22 Boeing 747 200s and 4 Vickers Viscounts Virgin Atlantics first plane was a Boeing 747 200

Virgin Atlantic uses three different classes on their aeroplanes Economy broken wikt linkpremiumPremium Economy and Upper Class

Economy class is the standard class on Virgin Atlantic aircraft It is the cheapest part of the aeroplane to travel in Passengers usually get a free meal some drinks and a bag with gifts in like a toothbrush The seats in this class have a maximum pitch of 31 in but this depends on what aeroplane you go in

Passengers that use Premium Economy have their own check in area get to  board before Economy passengers a drink before the flight get their own cabin crew and get a better seat The seat it wider and has a larger pitch

In November 2006 Virgin made a new seat It is wider than the old one and has a plug for laptops It is being put on all planes and now all Airbus A340s and all Boeing 747s that fly from London Heathrow Airport have the new seats

Upper Class is the name for Virgin Atlantics broken wikt linkbusiness class business class They do not have a first class service Virgin says the seats are the biggest lie flat beds on any business class but Air Canada and Singapore Airlines have said this too The seats have plugs for laptops and iPods

Upper Class passengers can also have their own chauffeur broken wikt linkdrive thrudrive thru check in their own security points at some airports access to the Virgin Clubhouse a larger broken wikt linkmenumenu for in flight meals and a bar that passengers can stand up or sit down at in flight

All the seats on all the aircraft have screens in the back of the seats to provide entertainment for passengers Most aeroplanes have a newer system where the passengers can choose what they want to watch called VPort Older systems called Odyssey and Super Nova just offer different channels for the passengers to pick from The screens on the older systems are also smaller

Anacondas are carnivores They mostly hunt at night Anacondas kill by constricting the prey until it can no longer breathe Sometimes they drown the prey Like all snakes they swallow the prey whole head first The anacondas top and bottom jaws are attached to each other with stretchy ligaments which let the snake swallow animals wider than itself Snakes do not chew their food they digest it with very strong acids  II in the snakes stomach Anacondas eat pigs deer caiman birds fish rodents and other animals After eating a large animal the anaconda needs no food for a long time and rests for weeks The young can care for themselves soon after birth including hunting They eat small rodents baby birds frogs and small fish

A sniper is a person who is trained to shoot perfectly at things that are very small or very far away The snipers target is most often a human or non human enemy A military sniper has often been given special training to use a sniper rifle a special type of gun Most of the time a sniper rifle has a telescope called a sniper scope to help the sniper see the target Snipers are also trained to be stealthy Snipers hide or use camouflage such as a ghillie suit that looks like the surrounding foilage so that it is hard for the enemy to see them A sniper is also called a marksman

Experienced hunters often share many of the skills that snipers need to know The two jobs are very similar The word sniper came from Britain when highly accurate shooters would huntalso known as snipebirds that were very hard to see and shoot

Many police departments have snipers on their SWAT teams Because police snipers do not always perform the same tasks as military snipers police snipers are sometimes known as marksmen 

Snipers shoot targets that are far away Because the bullet shot by a sniper has to travel a very long distance the sniper has to be very careful when taking aim There are three main things that have an effect on the accuracy of the shot The sniper must plan for these things 

The bullets used by snipers are usually heavy They are powered by a large amount of gunpowder This makes the bullet travel very fast The heaviness makes the bullet less affected by wind The speed makes the bullet less affected by gravity A fast bullet reaches a target quicker before it has time for gravity to affect it Large fast bullets do more damage to the target than lighter or slower bullets 

Most soldiers are trained so that they can shoot a target that is between convert200mft0 to convert300mft0 away and hit it with approximately half their shots Very well trained soldiers such as the US Marine Corps can hit a target that is between convert400mft0 to convert500mft0 away with approximately half of their shots A sniper is trained to be able to hit a target over convert800mft0 or half a mile away with almost every single shot Some snipers are so accurate that they can shoot something out of a persons hand but they usually aim for the targets head or chest These areas are harder to miss and are more likely to disable the target

Sniper rifles 

A sniper uses a special kind of rifle called a sniper rifle This rifle is much more accurate than normal rifles Almost all sniper rifles use a Sniper scope a special telescope that allows them to see targets very far away There are two different kinds of sniper rifles bolt action rifles which fire a single shot and then the user must ready the next shot and semi automatic rifles which fire a single shot each time the trigger is pulled and automatically ready the next shot for firing Typically bolt action rifles have a longer range and are more accurate than semi automatic rifles however because each round must be loaded by operating the bolt the rate of fire is slower than a semi automatic rifle which fires as fast as the shooter can squeeze the trigger At close ranges or where a shooter must make a quick follow up shot a sniper may prefer to use the semi automatic rifle instead A magazine is used on semi automatic rifles and most bolt action rifles Magazines hold more shots in the gun and make it much faster to ready the next shot With many rifles the shooter can carry more full magazines to put into the gun when the magazine that is in the gun is empty

Snipers usually wear camouflage clothing to avoid being seen Camouflage works by hiding the outline and shape of the human body so that it is not easily seen Camouflage does not work very well when the person wearing it is moving because the eye sees movement much better than shapes or colors Snipers often paint their faces green or black to make them shine less and blend in with the surroundings  Sometimes snipers wear special camouflage suits called ghillie suits Ghillie suits are made of shredded burlap or yute and often have plants attached to them Snipers will often make several different ghillie suits to help them hide in different kinds of terrain These suits are very effective at hiding the sniper Often a sniper can be invisible to an enemy standing right next to him  

Police snipers generally do not need camouflage because their main job is to make accurate shots not to hide from the criminal Sometimes police need to hide so police snipers are trained in hiding techniques

Snipers in War 

Military snipers are chosen for their intelligence their good sight and their ability to shoot very well They are trained to use their sight very well They are trained to see the enemy from far away and to notice small movements that might show that enemies are near They are also trained to hide themselves Snipers use these skills to destroy enemy troops Snipers generally work in a small unit of just two people a sniper and a spotter The spotter finds targets for the sniper with a telescope If the sniper misses the target then the spotter also helps the sniper adjust the next shot so it hits the target The spotter also protects the sniper from enemies at close range 

Snipers are often used as scouts for the army because they can easily hide themselves from the enemy even when they are close They use the sniper scope on their rifles to see farther than most soldiers are able to see Snipers are often able to notice details and remember information that ordinary soldiers would not When a sniper is in a team with a spotter it is usually the spotters job to use a radio to speak with other military units The team can report on the enemy position and enemy movements 

In World War I there were no special sniper rifles Instead snipers used normal rifles with a sniper scope mounted on them 

In World War II snipers were common They were an important part of the fighting Every squad of the Soviet army included sniper or a marksman Camouflage tactics were developed during this time Snipers were very useful during the Battle of Stalingrad One Russian sniper was said to have killed over 240 German troops Also it wasnt a limit for example Mihail Surkov killed 702 enemy troops and Semen Nomokonov killed sniper only 367 persons including a general

Police departments train and use snipers These snipers mainly serve on the SWAT team for their department Often they are called upon to provide security at special events or to make sure that other snipers do not murder someone This job is called counter sniping Most police snipers are trained by the military

Some snipers are famous for having killed hundreds of enemy soldiers One such sniper is US Marine Corps sniper Carlos Hathcock who was famous in the Vietnam War for wearing a white feather in his hat Other snipers are famous for being able to kill an enemy from very far away Carlos Hathcock held the record for the furthest distance kill for a very long time his farthest was over convert2500ydm0 However in the Afghanistan War snipers from the Canadian Army broke the record with a shot of convert2430myd Other snipers are known for difficult shots For example Matt Hughes had to make a convert860mft0 shot in very high winds by aiming over convert56ftm0 to the left of the enemy An example of a famous sniper in WWII is Vasily Zaytsev He supposedly killed 225 enemy soldiers during the Battle of Stalingrad

Snipers are often used in video games as elite soldiers Getting a headshot with a sniper rifle is thought of as a hard skill to learn In some movies assassins use sniper rifles examples include Phone Booth and Vantage Point Sometimes snipers have a bad reputation in the media for example in October 2002 two men went on a month long killing spree using a Sniper rifle in the Virginia and Maryland area

Joe DAmato was an Italian movie director

A sniper rifle is a type of gun used to accurately shoot targets a long distance away A person who uses a sniper rifle in the military is called a sniper 

A sniper rifle is much more accurate than a normal rifle Almost all sniper rifles use a sniper scope a special telescope that allows them to see targets very far away There are two different kinds of sniper rifles bolt action rifles which fire a single shot and then the user must ready the next shot and semi automatic rifles which fire a single shot each time the trigger is pulled and automatically ready the next shot for firing Fully automatic rifles which fire continuously when the trigger is pulled as long as there is ammunition generally are not used though in rare instances they can be converted into a sniper rifle In one such instance a heavy machine gun with a scope while not a true sniper rifle set the record for longest kill by a sniper for years until advances in rifle technology and sniper training allowed a sniper with a true sniper rifle to beat that record

Typically bolt action rifles have a longer range and are more accurate than semi automatic rifles however because each round must be chambered by hand the rate of fire is slower than a semi automatic rifle which fires as fast as the shooter can squeeze the trigger At close ranges or in situations where a shooter must make a quick follow up shot a sniper may prefer to use the semi automatic rifle instead Examples of bolt action sniper rifles are the M40 R700 and M24 Examples of semi automatic ones are the M21 Drugonov and the M82 Barret 50 caliber

Sniper rifles range in caliber from as small as convert22inmm2 with the 22 LR bullet fired by many small pistols to as large as convert5inmm1 with the 50 Browning Machine Gun bullet which is fired by vehicle mounted heavy machine guns Smaller rounds like the 22 LR are often used at very close range with a sound suppressor to quickly and quietly break street lights or kill vermin and small animals The round is generally too weak and has too short of a range for longer range work or shots on human sized targets In contrast large rounds like the 50 BMG are fired out of very large and heavy sniper rifles that are often used for destroying light vehicles and equipment They can fire at extreme ranges of over a mile but generally are too bulky inaccurate at short ranges and expensive for general purpose work 

Sniper rifle barrels must be cleaned everyday to get rid of any liquid Not cleaning the barrel can be disastrous and may even make the barrel explode on firing

On 7 October 1777 during the Battle of Saratoga Timothy Murphy a rifleman in Morgans Kentucky Riflemen shot and killed General Simon Fraser of the British army Murphy was said to have taken the shot at roughly 500 yards He was using the renowned Kentucky rifle Fraser was leading a recon in force against the rebellious colonists at Bemis Heights in New York As a result of Frasers death the recon failed This had a direct impact on the overall battle leading to the British defeat The Battle of Saratoga was considered one of the turning points of the War for Independence 

On May 9 1864 during the American Civil War a confederate sniper took what was to be considered an incredible shot at that time During the Battle of Spotsylvania Sgt Grace of the 4th Georgia infantry took aim and fired at a distant Union officer Grace was using a British Whitworth target rifle and the distance was 800 yards Graces target Major General John Sedgwick fell dead after uttering the words Why they couldnt hit an elephant at this dist Sedgwicks death resulted in a delay of the Union attack which in turn gave General Robert E Lee the edge he needed to win the day at Spotsylvania

Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol is a protocol for instant messaging It is inspired by XML

It is different to most protocols because it is an open standard This means that anybody who has a domain name and an internet connection can run their own server Most of the software and the clients are open source

Other software such as Google Talk and the Gizmo5 use the XMPP protocol It has been installed on thousands of servers across the internet There are over five hundred million users who use software based on the protocol Clients include Pidgin and iChat

Jeremie Miller started the Jabber project in 1998 The first major public release was in May 2000 This early software was the basis of XMPP It was a competitor to SIMPLE which was based on the SIP protocol

In August 2001 the Jabber Software Foundation was started The main role of the JSF was to manage the XML protocols for XMPP by documenting them As well as this the organisation was to co ordinate the many companies that were using the XMPP technology

In 2002 the Internet Engineering Task Force created a working group to formalize the protocol The group was named the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol Working Group or XMPP WG

In 2007 Jabber Software Foundation became XMPP Standards Foundation

XMPP can use HTTP to send data to the servers This is useful when there are strict firewalls in place because data can be sent through the web instead of through a different port

There are also open public servers which use standard ports so that users can connect from behind most firewalls

The World Bank is an international bank that lends money and other help to developing nations for infrastructure The World Bank has the goal of reducing poverty

The World Bank is different from the World Bank Group because the World Bank is made up of only two institutions the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association The World Bank Group has these two but also three more International Finance Corporation Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes

The World Bank is one of five institutions started at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944 The International Monetary Fund is another one Many countries sent people to attend the Bretton Woods Conference The most powerful countries with people there were the United States and United Kingdom which controlled most of the broken wikt linknegotiationnegotiations

The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are both based in Washington but the World Bank is headed by an American while the IMF is led by a European

From the start until 1967 the bank did not lend as much money as it does now Careful screening of loan applications was common The bank wanted to provide loans for reconstruction and development but if they lent out too much there would be less trust in the bank

Bank president John McCloy chose France to be the first country to receive a loan from the World Bank Poland and Chile applied but did not receive one The loan was for 987 million half the amount that France actually asked for There were very strict rules about the use of the funds Bank staff made sure that the French government would have a balanced budget and pay back what it owed to the World Bank first before it paid back other countries The United States State Department told the French government that the Cabinet should not have any communists To get the loan the French government removed the Communist coalition government The loan to France was given very quickly after that

The Marshall Plan of 1947 meant that many European countries already got help so the World Bank began to lend to non European countries Until 1968 loans were used mainly to pay for projects that would help the country pay it back

From 1968 to 1980 the bank worked mostly on meeting the basic needs of people in poor countries The amount of money being loaned out grew bigger and more loans were given This was because the loans were not just given for infrastructure but also for social services and other things

These changes were made by Robert McNamara who became the president in 1968 McNamara managed the Bank in the same way he had worked when he was United States Secretary of Defense and President of the Ford Motor Company McNamara changed the focus toward things such as building schools and hospitals improving literacy and farming McNamara started a new system of gathering information from nations applying for loans This helped the bank to process loan applications much faster To give out more loans McNamara told bank treasurer Eugene Rotberg to find new sources of money because the northern banks that had lent out the money did not have enough Rotberg used the bond market to increase the amount of money that the bank could lend One result of lending so much to help poor countries was that the countries in the Third World started owing a lot more money From 1976 to 1980 developing world debt rose at an average of 20 a year

From 1989 World Bank policy changed because many people were complaining Environmental groups and NGOs were also lent money to help fix the things that the people were complaining about Now bank projects include caring for the environment

The World Banks current focus is on meeting the Millennium Development Goals This means lending mainly to countries that are not very poor at interest rates which are a little bit higher than the ones it borrows at The IDA provides low or no interest loans and grants to the poorest countries The Banks mission is to help developing countries to develop more and become less poor They will also meet the MDGs by helping countries to become good places for investment jobs and sustainable growth This will help the countrys economic growth through investment and help the poor to share the results of economic growth

The World Bank says that there are five key factors necessary for economic growth

For the poorest developing countries in the world the banks plans are based on poverty reduction strategies The World Bank looks very carefully at local groups of people and the needs of the country to develop a strategy that works best for that country The government then says what it will do to help stop poverty and the World Bank works with it

Forty five countries gave US251 billion in aid for the worlds poorest countries aid that goes to the World Bank International Development Association which distributes the money to eighty poorer countries While richer nations sometimes pay for their own aid projects Robert B Zoellick the president of the World Bank said when the gifts were announced on December 15 2007 that World Bank money is the core funding that the poorest developing countries rely on

The President of the Bank is currently Robert B Zoellick He is responsible for chairing the meetings of the Boards of Directors and for running the Bank The Bank President has always been a US citizen chosen by the United States the largest shareholder in the bank The person is then approved by the Board of Governors They are president for five years and after that they might be chosen again

The Executive Directors represent the Banks member countries They make up the Board of Directors and usually meet twice a week to approve and discuss loans and guarantees new policies the budget ways to help countries and other important decisions

There are 24 Vice Presidents three Senior Vice Presidents and two Executive Vice Presidents

In 2010 voting powers at the World Bank were changed so that developing countries especially China have a bigger vote The countries with most voting power are now the United States Japan China Germany France and the United Kingdom Under the changes other countries that saw big gains included Brazil India South Korea and Mexico Most developed countries voting power was reduced Russias voting power was not changed China given more influence in World BankRTHK 26 April 2010ref

The World Bank has been criticized by non governmental organizations such as Survival International and academics including its former Chief Economist Joseph Stiglitz Critics say that the free market that the Bank supports is broken wikt linkharmfulharmful to economic development if done badly too quickly in the wrong order or in weak economies

In Masters of Illusion The World Bank and the Poverty of Nations Catherine Caufield argued that the way the World Bank works is bad for southern nations Caufield said that the World Bank focuses too much on development To the World Bank different nations all need the same remedy of development She argued that to have even modest success Western practices are used instead of traditional economic structures and values A second thing the World Bank thinks is that poor countries cannot become modern without money and advice from other countries

A number of academics in developing countries have said that the way the World Bank works only blames the poor for being poor

One of the strongest criticisms of the World Bank is the way it was run While the World Bank represents 186 countries it is run by a small number of powerful countries These countries choose who runs the World Bank so what they want is what the bank does

The World Bank is two different things a political organization and a practical organization As a political organization the World Bank does what donor and borrowing governments private capital markets and other international organizations want As a practical organization it must be neutral working mainly in development aid technical assistance and loans Because the World Bank has to do what donor countries and private capital markets want it says poverty is best solved by market policies Many people think this is wrong

In the 1990s the World Bank and the IMF made the Washington Consensus Many now agree that the Washington Consensus looked too much at the growth of GDP and not enough how long the growth lasted or whether growth was even good at all

Some studies show that the World Bank has increased poverty and been bad for the environment public health and cultural diversity Some critics also say that the World Bank has always supported Neoliberalism forcing developing countries to follow rules which have been damaging

People also say that the World Bank pushes US or Western interests in certain parts of the world Even South American nations have established the Bank of the South in order to cut down on US influence there The fact that the President is always a citizen of the United States nominated by the President of the United States makes some people unhappy The US has just over 16 of the shares in the bank some people say this makes the voting unfair because they have too much power as decisions only happen if the countries that support it have 85 of the banks shares The World Bank also does not need to explain what it does to anyone

A lot of the criticism is protesting The World Bank Oslo 2002 Protests the October Rebellion and the Battle of Seattle are among the protests that have happened Such demonstrations are held all over the world even amongst the Brazilian Kayapo people

In 2008 a World Bank report found that biofuels had driven food prices up 75 This was important news but it was never published Officials said that they thought it because George W Bush would be embarrassed

The World Bank has been criticised for the way it carries out the production accumulation circulation and functioning of knowledge The Banks production of knowledge has become important to explain why big loans are given out The Bank uses many scientists around the world organisations and other people to help make data and strategies The information is created to stop people looking too closely at what the Bank does The only knowledge system that is used is the Western one meaning that the systems that other countries used are put aside and the Western one forced in Knowledge production has become very useful for the Bank which plans carefully how to use it to explain why they focus on development

The effect of structural adjustment policies on poor countries has been one of the most important criticisms of the World Bank The oil crisis in the late 1970s made many countries have serious money issues The World Bank decided that it would help by giving out special loans called structural adjustment loans which meant the policies of the country had to be changed to reduce inflation Some of these policies included encouraging production and investment changing exchange rates and changing the way government resources were used These were most effective in countries where these policies could be implemented easily For some countries especially in Africa inflation became worse Stopping poverty was not part of these loans so the poor usually became poorer because the governments were told to spend less money and raise food prices

By the late 1980s people realised that structural adjustment policies were worsening life for the worlds poor The World Bank changed structural adjustment loans after that In 1999 the World Bank and the IMF introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper to replace structural adjustment loans Some people say that the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach is just another way of using structural adjustment policies as it continues to do a lot of the same things Neither way has solved the problems of why some countries are so poor By making some countries owe others money many believe that the World Bank has taken over those countries power to choose how they run their economy

Despite the goals of good governance and anti corruption the World Bank needs sovereign immunity from countries it deals with Sovereign immunity means nothing the World Bank does can be punished Some people say sovereign immunity is a shield which The World Bank wants resort to for escaping accountability and security by the people Because the United States has veto power it is the only country that can stop the World Bank from doing things it doesnt like

The World Banks work on a way to fix climate change and environmental threats has also been criticized People say it has no real vision and purpose and a limited focus on only what it can do in global and regional governance People also say it ignores some specific issues in certain parts of the world like issues of rights to food and land and sustainable land use Critics have also seen that only 1 of the World Banks lending goes to the environmental sector

Environmentalists are asking the Bank to stop worldwide support for coal plants and other things that pollute the environment For instance many people have criticized the 2010 decision of the World Banks approval for a 375 billion loan to build the worlds 4th largest coal fired power plant in South Africa The plant will increase coal mining and cause more pollution

Donald Campbell Dewar was the first First Minister of Scotland from 1999 until his death in 2000 He was the first person to hold the position of First Minister following the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999

After the 1997 General Election Dewar was in a position which the late John Smith would never have thought possible He was able to start the process to split Scotland from the United Kingdom and worked endlessly on creating the Scotland Act popularly known as Smiths unfinished business When ratified this was to give Scotland its first Parliament for nearly 300 years

The first elections to the Scottish Parliament were held on 6 May 1999 with Dewar leading the Scottish Labour Party against their main opponents the SNP under Alex Salmond He was elected as the MSP for Glasgow Anniesland Although Scottish Labour won the most seats they did not have a majority in Parliament to allow them to form an Executive without the help of a smaller party A deal was agreed with the Scottish Liberal Democrats to work together with Dewar agreeing to their demand for the abolition of up front tuition fees for university students

On 13 May Dewar was nominated as First Minister and was officially appointed by the Queen on 17 May at a ceremony in the Palace of Holyroodhouse He later travelled to the Court of Session to be sworn in by the Lord President and receive the Great Seal of Scotland

On 16 June Dewar set out the legislative programme for the Executive which included an Education bill to improve standards in Scottish schools land reform to give right of access to the countryside a bill to abolish the feudal system of land tenure and a bill to establish National Parks in Scotland

In April 2000 Dewar was admitted to hospital for tests on his heart following a previous test where a minor irregularity was discovered In May 2000 he later had surgery to repair a leaking heart valve and was forced to take a three month break from Parliament with Deputy First Minister Jim Wallace taking over as Acting First Minister He returned to work on 14 August 2000

Dewar dealt with the exams results fiasco and the lorry drivers strike and attended the Labour party conference in Brighton in September but at the end of September told the historian Tom Devine in Dublin that if there was no surge of the energy of old he would have to reappraise the situation within a few months time 

On 10 October 2000 around lunchtime Dewar sustained a fall He seemed fine at first but later that day suffered a massive brain hemorrhage which was possibly triggered by the medication he was taking after the heart surgery Donald Dewar died one day later at 1218pm in Edinburghs Western General Hospital He was 63 years old

Dewars funeral service was held at Glasgow Cathedral amid scenes of mourning unknown for a politician in Scotlands largest city He was cremated on 18 October 2000 and his ashes were scattered at Lochgilphead

Although he has become something of a political legend Donald would have abhorred any attempt to turn him into some kind of secular saint He would have been horrified at a Diana style out pouring of synthetic grief at his untimely death  Iain MacWhirter Sunday Herald October 15 2000

BBC Three has a unique 60 second news format This was adopted so that operation of the channel could be completely automated without the complication of dealing with variable length live news broadcasts The current controller of the station is Danny Cohen and the Head of Scheduling is Dan McGolpin

BBC Three is the successor to the similar BBC Choice channel and was launched on 9 February 2003 It was launched by Stuart Murphy who previously ran BBC Choice

Some of the programmes that have appeared for their first showing on BBC Three include EastEnders Little Britain Doctor Who Confidential and Torchwood The Apprentice Youre Fired When the first episode of Torchwood was launched in October 2006 on BBC Three 24 million people watched it This broke BBC Threes previous record of 18 million The second episode attracted an equally impressive 23 million viewers and boosted BBC Three to a 35 share of multichannel viewing that evening compared to the networks three month Sunday average of 09

The channel features hourly news updates called 60 Seconds which includes the top news sport and entertainment stories It is presented in a cheeky relaxed style in keeping with the rest of the channel As part of the BBCs discussions with the government in whether the channel could launch originally a longer news programme had been promised to provide a daily section of news and current affairs The News Show as it came to be called upon launch was later rebranded The 7 OClock News However the BBC discontinued the bulletin in 2005 claiming that in fact the programmes audiences were minuscule and the output was provided elsewhere on the BBC

Its share of the audience during its transmission hours is 26 among 25 34 year olds and 17 among all individuals BARB the official ratings agency averages out BBC Threes viewing figures over 24 hours even though the channel only broadcasts in the evening giving a distorted sense of the channels viewership Despite several official complaints from the BBC BARB continues to publish figures which the BBC argues are unrepresentative Nine million people watch BBC Three every week

The channel has had critical and popular successes winning more awards in its four year history than its commercial rivals have won in their combined 25 year history In total BBC Three has won 7 BAFTA awards 5 British Comedy Awards 15 Royal Television Society Awards and 5 Rose dOr Awards since the channel was launched in February 2003 Most recently it won Broadcast Magazines Digital Channel of the Year Award for Best General Entertainment Channel and MGEITF Non Terrestrial Channel of the Year

All three of BBC Threes dramas produced in 2004 received BAFTA nominations as did classical music show Flashmob The Opera

In 2008 BBC Threes Gavin and Stacey won the BAFTA audience award and the best comedy performance award was awarded to James Corden for his part

The channel has also come in for criticism from several corners the most prominent of which are some of the BBCs long standing presenters These include John Humphrys who argued that BBC Three and BBC Four should be shut down in the face of budget cuts to Radio 4s Today programme which he presents John Sweeney of Panorama and Jeremy Paxman are among other journalists have also criticised the channel and its content

BBC Vision director Jana Bennett confirmed in an interview for Broadcast magazine in May 2008 that the BBC Trust has been petitioned to change the start of transmission time from the current time of 7pm each evening to earlier in the afternoon A decision from the Trust is not expected until 2009

Bennett said that some of the extra hours would be given over to BBC Switch the BBCs teen programming strand

EmperorEmpress of India was used as a title by the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah II and also by the colonial British monarchs during the British Raj in India

Sometimes the term Emperor of India is also used to refer to Indian emperors such as Ashoka the Great of theMaurya Dynasty and Emperor Akbar of the Mughal empire However they did not claim this title for themselves 

Although the Mughal dynasty ruled over most of the Indian subcontinent from the 16th century onwards they simply used the title badshah However dring the Indian rebellion of 1857 against the British the rebel sepoys seized Delhi and called the Mughal Bahadur Shah II as Badshah i Hind or Emperor of India After the Brtish defeated the rebels he was captured and was forced to live in Rangoon Burma in 1858 this ended the rule of the Mughals

After the Mughal Emperor ended by the British East India Company the title Empress of India was taken by Queen Victoria from May 1 1876 

Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli is usually credited with creating the title for her Also the title was created when it became evident that Queen Victorias daughter Victoria Princess Royal would become an empress when her husband ascended the German imperial throne many people thought it was wrong for the daughter to be an empress while her mother was just a Queen

When Victoria died and her son Edward VII ascended the throne his title became Emperor of India The title continued until India and Pakistan became independent from the United Kingdom at midnight on 1415 August 1947

When signing their name for Indian business a British King Emperor or the Queen Empress used the initials R I or the shorter version Ind Imp after their name This was also used on many British coins including some 1948 coins of George VI

George VI continued to hold the title King of India for two years during the short Governor Generalships of Lord Mountbatten and of C Rajagopalachari until India became a republic on 26 January 1950 George VI remained as King of the United Kingdom and King of Pakistan until his death in 1952 Pakistan became a republic on 23 March 1956 so Elizabeth II was Queen of Pakistan for four years

I had wanted to wait for a response from Razorflame but as he does not seem to be available I feel I should make the post I made on his talk page available to a wider audience for consideration MindTheGap 2327 9 August 2008

Razor this edit is about as clear a violation of wWPOWN was I think Ive ever seen on any Wikimedia project and another example is here Given you appear keen to inform people you are contemplating another adminship bid soon its probably not a good idea to give those who have opposed in the past any more ammunition to use against you Regards MindTheGap 0259 8 August 2008

Hi  following a deletion discussion I have been doing some work on Rivers of Pakistan The sorts of issues I have come across are that there is no referencing and there is plagiarism  as well as poor quality English expression For example the article Hingol River was created by user922101184 and was a copyvio from httpwwwpakistanpaediacomparkshingolnationalparksofpakistan hingolhtml It was also identical to the English wikipedia version of the article which was created by UserSiddiqui  This user was among several banned for one year per enWikipediaRequests for arbitrationIndia Pakistan Note also sockpuppetry by UserSiddiqui discussed at enUsertalkThatcherArchive20Paknur which resulted in blocks of sockpuppets of Siddiqui in June 2008 

I thought maybe what I had learned about the article creation and the issues surrounding that editor at English wikipedia may be of some use to admins here  noting of course that behaviour and sanctions on English wikipedia does not prejudice views about behaviour and sanctions here I discovered this thread subsequent to post by Eptalon and others at Wikipedia talkNotice board for Pakistan related topics  ie  and  Matilda 2250 14 October 2008

Can an admin please take a look over RfD soon please as their are some requests that should have closed over a week ago and some require WPSNOW I think Cheers The Flying Spaghetti Monster 2229 18 August 2008

A vocation is a job that suits a person best It is also the desire to do a particular job especially a religious career like being a priest For religious people a vocation is often something they feel God has asked them to do A vocation is followed more for spiritual or emotional reasons than for money which is a helpful extra benefit from a vocation but not the reason for it

Vocations meet a psychological or spiritual need for the worker and the word can also be used for a job at which a person is gifted The word vocation comes from the Latin vocare meaning to call  In the past the word meant peoples being called to follow Christianity Martin Luther was the first to use it in the modern way to describe a life task

Christians believe God has created each person with gifts and talents designed for a reason Christians can be called to vocations that are faithful to Christian teachings such as marriage or to be a priest monk or nun chastity as a single person or the general calling to live a life that is right for the good of the Church or humanity

For those who are not priests or full time religious people Protestantism was important in telling them they still had a vocation Calvinism told people to work hard in life Calvin said a Christian had two callings a general calling to serve God and a calling to do a particular job at which they are useful Protestant ministers in the past said working hard gives God glory Without something to do they said people were more likely to sin 

This belief also has an impact outside of religion Modern occupations seen as vocations are those that involve caring or teaching such as medicine nursing teaching or veterinary work Politics may also be seen as a vocation Campaigning for human rights such as with the groups Amnesty International and Greenpeace can also be seen as a vocation although the word usually refers to a full time job People following other religions can also feel called to do a certain job by their gods

Opeth is a heavy metal band from Stockholm Sweden The band name came from the word Opet which was the name of a city in the Wilbur Smith novel Sunbird Opeth play progressive death metal Opeth are also influenced by progressive rock blues rock and jazz and their songs often have both electric and acoustic parts Opeth went on their first world tour after the release of their album Blackwater Park The bands members have changed many times since Opeth started in 1990 but band member Mikael kerfeldt has always been present Although he did not start the band kerfeldt is the only band member to perform in every album Opeth has released nine studio albums two live albums two box sets and two DVDs

Opeth was formed in 1990 by David Isberg Isberg asked Mikael kerfeldt to play bass guitar for Opeth without telling any of the other Opeth band members When kerfeldt showed up to play with the band the next day the band members refused to throw out their bass player for kerfeldt and all band members but Isberg and kerfeldt left to form a new band Lots of new band members joined and left the band Anders Nordin joined Opeth to play drums Nick Dring to play bass guitar and Andreas Dimeo to play electric guitar Dring and Dimeo left the band after one show and were replaced by Kim Pettersson on electric guitar and Johan DeFarfalla on bass guitar DeFarfalla and Pettersson left Opeth after their next two shows and Peter Lindgren joined to play electric guitar

Isberg quit in 1992 and joined the band Liars in Wait Now Opeth only had kerfeldt singing Nordin on bass guitar and Lindgren on electric guitar These three members began writing new songs sounding less like typical death metal and started using acoustic guitars and guitar harmonies making Opeth a more progressive death metal band Johan DeFarfalla began playing bass guitar again for Opeth and these four members recorded their first album Orchid

After touring the United Kingdom Opeth began to record their second album Morningrise The album had only five songs but was 66 minutes long Morningrise was a big success and the band toured the UK and Scandinavia playing songs from both albums They signed a contract with Century Media who re released these two albums again in 1997 After the tour kerfeldt and Lindgren fired DeFarfalla for personal reasons which made Nordin who was on a vacation in Brazil leave the band and stay in Brazil Martin Lopez who played for Amon Amarth joined Opeth in 1997 as well as bassist Martin Mendez just before recording their third album My Arms Your Hearse However kerfeldt had to play bass on some songs from My Arms Your Hearse The album was released on August 18 1998 and was another big success The album focused less on guitar harmonies and more on progressive metal riffs

In 1999 Opeth signed with UK label Peaceville Records in Europe which was distributed by Music For Nations Opeth began work on their next album but because of delays the band was only able to rehearse twice before recording the album Eventually Still Life was released on October 18 1999 Still Life was the first album recorded with Mendez and was also the first Opeth album to have the bands logo on the front cover Still Life is a concept album and kerfeldt explains that the album is about someone who is kind of banished from his hometown because he hasnt got the same faith as the rest of the inhabitants there The album pretty much starts off when he is returning after several years to hook up with his old babe The big bosses of the town know that hes back A lot of bad things start happening

After a few live shows in Europe Opeth returned to work on their next album with Porcupine Trees Steven Wilson producing This time it was tough kerfeldt said I feel pleasantly blown away by the immense result though It was indeed worth the effort Wilson also pushed the band to use new sounds and production techniques Steve guided us into the realms of strange noises for guitars and voice kerfeldt said Opeth released its fifth studio album Blackwater Park on February 21 2001 This release encouraged Opeth to go on their first world tour headlined Europe and playing to a crowd of 60000 at the 2001 Wacken Open Air festival in Germany

After touring in support of Blackwater Park Opeth returned home and began writing for the next album but kerfeldt had trouble coming up with new material I wanted to write something heavier than wed ever done still I had all these great mellow parts and arrangements which I didnt want to go to waste Jonas Renkse of Katatonia a long time friend of kerfeldt suggested writing music for two separate albums one heavy and one soft Excited about the idea kerfeldt agreed without asking his band mates or record label While his band mates liked the idea of recording two separate albums kerfeldt had to convince the label I had to lie somewhat saying that we could do this recording very soon it wont cost more than a regular single album With most of the material written the band rehearsed just once before entering the studio again with producer Steven Wilson in Studio Fredman Under pressure to complete both albums at the same time kerfeldt said the recording process was the toughest test of our history After recording basic tracks the band moved production to England to mix the heavy album Deliverance with Andy Sneap at Backstage Studios Deliverance was so badly recorded without any organisation whatsoever kerfeldt claimed that Sneap is credited as a saviour in the sleeve as he surely saved much of the recording

Deliverance was released on November 4 2002 and debuted at number 19 on the US Top Independent Albums chart marking the bands first US chart appearance Allmusic stated Deliverance is altogether more subtle than any of its predecessors approaching listeners with haunting nuances and masterful dynamics rather than overwhelming them with sheer mass and complexity Opeth played a single concert in Stockholm then returned to the UK to finish recording vocals for the second of the two albums Damnation at Steve Wilsons No Mans Land Studios Although kerfeldt first believed the band could not finish both albums Opeth completed Deliverance and Damnation in just seven weeks of studio time which was the same amount spent on Blackwater Park alone Damnation was released on April 14 2003 and gained the band its first appearance on the US Billboard 200 at number 192 The album also won the band a 2003 Swedish Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance The band launched its biggest tour yet playing nearly 200 shows in 2003 and 2004 Opeth performed three special shows in Europe with two song lists each one acoustic set and one heavy set The band recorded its first DVD Lamentations Live at Shepherds Bush Empire 2003 at Shepherds Bush Empire in London The DVD featured a two hour performance including the entire Damnation album as well as several songs from Deliverance and Blackwater Park and a one hour documentary about the recording of Deliverance and Damnation The DVD was certified Gold in Canada

Opeth was scheduled to perform in Jordan in late 2003 without a crew due to the fear of terrorist attacks in the Middle East Opeths tour manager distributed 6000 tickets for the concert but before the band left for Jordan Lopez called kerfeldt saying he was having an anxiety attack and could not perform forcing the band to cancel the show In early 2004 Lopez was sent home from Canada after more anxiety attacks on tour Opeth decided not to cancel the rest of the tour and Lopezs drum tech filled in for two concerts Opeth asked drummer Gene Hoglan of Strapping Young Lad to fill in Lopez eventually returned to Opeth for the Seattle show on the final leg of the Deliverance and Damnation tour Per Wiberg also joined the band on keyboards and after more than a year on tour Opeth went back home to start writing more new songs in 2004

Opeths European label Music for Nations closed its doors in 2005 and the band signed with Roadrunner Records After writing material for their eighth album in late 2004 the band rehearsed for three weeks before entering the studio the first time they rehearsed since the 1998 album My Arms Your Hearse Opeth recorded at Fascination Street Studios in rebro Sweden from March 18 to June 1 2005 and released the album Ghost Reveries on August 30 2005 again to critical and commercial success The album debuted at number 64 in the US and number nine in Sweden higher than any other Opeth release Keith Bergman of Blabbermouthnet gave the album 10 out of 10 one of only 17 albums to achieve a perfect rating from the site

On May 12 2006 Martin Lopez announced that he had officially parted ways with Opeth due to health problems and he was replaced by Martin Axenrot Opeth toured on the main stage of Gigantour in 2006 alongside Megadeth Ghost Reveries was re released on October 31 2006 with a bonus cover version of Deep Purples Soldier of Fortune and a DVD of the making of the album A recording of Opeths live performance at the Camden Roundhouse in London on November 9 2006 was later released as the double live album The Roundhouse Tapes On May 17 2007 Peter Lindgren stated he was leaving Opeth after 16 years The decision has been the toughest Ive ever made but it is the right one to make at this point in my life Lindgren said I feel that I simply have lost some of the enthusiasm and inspiration needed to participate in a band that has grown from a few guys playing the music we love to a worldwide industry Ex Arch Enemy guitarist Fredrik kesson replaced Lindgren as kerfeldt explained Fredrik was the only name that popped up thinking about a replacement for Peter In my opinion hes one of the top three guitar players out of Sweden We all get along great as weve known each other for maybe four years and he already has the experience to take on the circus like lifestyle we lead as members of Opeth

In November 2007 after nearly 200 performances in support of Ghost Reveries Opeth entered Fascination Street Studios with kerfeldt producing By January 2008 Opeth had recorded 13 songs including three cover songs The finished album Watershed was released on June 3 2008 and has seven tracks with cover songs included as bonus tracks on some versions The album has since debuted at number 23 on the US Billboard 200 making it their highest charting album yet It enjoyed success in many other countries as well entering the Australian ARIA album charts at number seven while debuting at number one on Finlands official album chart Opeth planned extensive touring in support of Watershed but some shows in Europe had to be cancelled because of some music festival cancellations and kerfeldt coming down with chicken pox On January 25 2009 Opeth played their first show in India at IIT Madrass cultural festival Saarang On March 06 2009 the band played in the Middle East at the annual Dubai Desert Rock Festival in Dubai On March 26 2009 it was announced that Opeth would take part in the first European Progressive Nation tour with bands Dream Theater Bigelf and Unexpect On April 24 2009 Opeth will headline the first day of Metal Hammer Magazines first UK metal music festival HammerFest

Although he was not the founder of the band Mikael kerfeldt is the only member to appear on every release He is Opeths main songwriter and lyricist and has defined much of the bands sound kerfeldt was influenced at a young age by heavy metal bands such as Slayer Death Black Sabbath Celtic Frost King Diamond and Morbid Angel kerfeldt was later influenced by progressive rock and folk music both of which had a strong impact on the sound of the band Opeths distinct sound combines elements of heavy metal with acoustic passages and elements of progressive metal and progressive rock kerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeths music

I dont see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything It would be impossible for us to play just death metal that is our roots but we are now a mishmash of everything and not purists to any form of music Its impossible for us to do that and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music Were not afraid to experiment or to be caught with our pants down so to speak Thats what keeps us going

Opeths earlier works often made use of twin guitar harmonies but they were abandoned in the bands later work I got tired of it the whole harmony guitar thing kerfeldt said It got out of hand in the mid 90s Every band was doing that thing Most of the bands songs exceed 10 minutes in length which Aaron Burgess of Alternative Press magazine criticized stating you cant really be a casual Opeth fan It takes enough as a listener just to get past the bands epic song lengths Vocally kerfeldt shifts between growling death metal vocals for heavy sections and clean sometimes whispered vocals over acoustic passages While death growls were dominant on the early albums later releases used more clean vocals such the 2003 release Damnation which had only clean singing The bands lyrics often reflect a bleak outlook on life with subjects such as failed relationships nature death and depression Some of the bands albums also have a consistent theme or concept throughout such as Still Life and My Arms Your Hearse The songs were put together as one continual piece with the last word or phrase of each song becoming the title of the next

Market share in business and marketing is the portion of the targeted consumer base that a company actually reaches for a particular service or product

For example it can be shown as the amount of money a company brings in from its consumers divided by the total amount of money paid from all consumers for that service or product

It can also be shown as the amount of productsservices sold by a company divided by the total volume sold to all the consumers in that market

It is necessary to commission market research to estimate the total market size and a companys market share

Increasing market share is one of the most important objectives in business The main advantage of using market share is that it removes the effects of industry wide macroenvironmental variables such as the state of the economy or changes in tax policy For example if you were one of only two psychiatrists in Chicago then it would not matter how bad the economy was because you would always have a huge slice of the consumer base pie for your service If your service was less needed then advertising more would help increase your market share 

The market shares for different companies tends to change over time causing change in the market share values the reason can be political ups and downs a disaster etc

In finance a share is a unit of account for various financial instruments including stocks mutual funds limited partnerships and REITs In British English the usage of the word share alone to refer solely to stocks is so common that it almost replaces the word stock itself

In simple words a share or stock is a document issued by a company which entitles its holder to be one of the owners of the company A share is issued by a company or can be purchased from the stock market

By owning a share you can earn a portion and selling shares you get capital gain So your return is the dividend plus the capital gain However you also run a risk of making a capital loss if you have sold the share at a price below your buying price

A companys stock price reflects what investors think about the stock not necessarily what the company is worth For example companies that are growing quickly often trade at a higher price than the company might currently be worth Stock prices are also affected by all forms of company and market news Publicly traded companies are required to report quarterly on their financial status and earnings Market forces and general investor opinions can also affect share price

The Church of Satan is a religious group that encourages people to accept their human nature and build their ego as it is described in The Satanic Bible written in 1969 by Anton LaVey They do not worship or believe in Satan and they do not believe in God Satan is just a symbol of freedom and the ego

The Church of Satan started in San Francisco California on Walpurgis night April 30 1966 by Anton Szandor LaVey who was the Churchs broken wikt linkhigh priestHigh Priest until he died in 1997

In the 1950s Anton LaVey formed a group called the Order of the Trapezoid which later became the leaders of the Church of Satan Those who came to LaVeys events included The Baroness Carin de Plessen Dr Cecil Nixon underground filmmaker Kenneth Anger City Assessor Russell Wolden Donald Werby anthropologist Michael Harner and writer Shana Alexander Other LaVey associates from this time period include noted Science Fiction and Horror writers Anthony Boucher August Derleth Robert Barbour Johnson Reginald Bretnor Emil Petaja Stuart Palmer Clark Ashton Smith Forrest J Ackerman and Fritz Leiber Jr 

In its first year the Church of Satan was often in the media because they performed a Satanic marriage of Judith Case and journalist John Raymond The ceremony was photographed by Joe Rosenthal who took the famous photograph Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima during World War II Another event was the public funeral of Church of Satan member and Naval Officer Edward Olson as his wife had asked

The Church of Satan was in many books magazine and newspaper articles in the 1960s and 1970s A whole documentary Satanis was also made about it in 1970 LaVey was also in Kenneth Angers film Invocation of my Demon Brother and helped as a technical adviser in The Devils Rain which starred Ernest Borgnine William Shatner and introduced John Travolta The Church of Satan was also shown in Luigi Scattinis film Angeli Bianchi Angeli Neri which in the United States was known as Witchcraft 70

In 1975 LaVey made arguments within the Church of Satan by stopping the Churchs Grotto system and removing people he thought were using the Church instead of doing things in the outside world After that LaVey hoped success in society would decide who did well in the Church of Satan LaVey chose to do less interviews People thought the Church might have ended or even that LaVey might have died

In the 1980s some Christians therapists who believed in recovered memories and the media were saying Satanists were a criminal group Members of the Church of Satan such as Peter H Gilmore Peggy Nadramia Boyd Rice Adam Parfrey Diabolos Rex and musician King Diamond were active in the media to deny the Church of Satan were criminals These stories became known as the Satanic panic The FBI later made a report saying these conspiracy theories were untrue

In the 1980s and 1990s the Church of Satan made many movies music films and magazines about Satanism Adam Parfreys Feral House publishing the music of Boyd Rice and the films of Nick Bougas including his documentary Speak of the Devil The Canon of Anton LaVey They were also frequently in the newspapers

After Anton Szandor LaVeys death his partner Blanche Barton became head of the Church of Satan Barton is still in the Church however in 2001 she gave her position to long time members Peter H Gilmore and Peggy Nadramia the current High Priest and High Priestess and publishers of The Black Flame the magazine of The Church of Satan The Central Office of the Church of Satan has also moved from San Francisco to New York Citys Hells Kitchen neighborhood where the couple live The Church of Satan does not recognize any other organizations as being Satanist factdateApril 2009 though it does recognize that one does not need to be a member of the Church of Satan to be a Satanist 

Some public figures have been involved with the Church of Satan including Kenneth Anger King Diamond Teresa Hidy David Vincent Marilyn Manson Aaron Joehlin Boyd Rice Marc Almond Alkaline Trio guitarist and singer Matt Skiba and drummer Derek Grant professional wrestler Balls Mahoney professional wrestler Sterling James Keenan journalist Michael Moynihan pianist Liberace death metal guitarist Matthew McRaith Sammy Davis Jr and the artist Coop As the Church of Satan does not let people see the membership records it is not known how many members they have

In October 2004 the Royal Navy officially recognised its first registered Satanist twenty four year old Chris Cranmer as a technician on the HMS Cumberland 

On June 6 2006 The Church of Satan held the first public ritual Satanic Mass in 40 years at the Steve Allen Theater in the Center for Inquiry in Los Angeles The ritual based on The Satanic Bible and The Satanic Rituals was led by Reverend Bryan Moore and Priestess Heather Saenz 

In December 2007 the Associated Press reported that a teenager had sent an e mail to the Church of Satan administration saying he wanted to kill in the name of our unholy lord Satan The Church told the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the message which then told local police who arrested the teenager 

The Church of Satan has two types of members Registered Members and Active Members Registered Members just have to pay 200 to the Church and are given a red card to show they are a member An Active Member has to be involved with the Church and local members Active Membership is divided into five Degrees

Active Members begin at the First Degree They must be approved for an Active Membership and this is based on their answers to a long list of questions Members cannot apply for higher Degrees and the requirements for each degree are not open to the public Promotion to a higher degree is only by being invited Members of the Third through Fifth degrees are the Priesthood and may be called Reverend Members of the Fifth degree are sometimes called Doctor although The Doctor usually means Lavey Some Active Members are called Agents qualified to explain the Church of Satan and the philosophy of Satanism to the media and others who are interested

People seeking membership must be old enough to be seen as adults in the country where they live The only exception made is for children of members who show they understand the Church philosophy and practices who wish to join What they can do is limited until they reach adulthood

Memberships may be ended through a decision of the ruling body of the Church of Satan consisting of the High Priest the High Priestess and the Council of Nine

Over the years the Church of Satan has stopped then restarted the use of Grottoes small groups for people who live near each other to work on projects or do ritual together or be friends Now that most people have the internet the Church of Satan has decided people do not need to join Grottoes to meet other Satanists If a group of Church of Satan members now wish to form a magic circle for something more than simple friendship and ritual and can keep it active for a year and a day the leader of the group can apply to have it called a Grotto and the leader called a Grotto Master A grotto is expected to be secret and only those they think are worthy are supposed to know about it If a Grotto stops being useful it will be closed as the Church of Satan has always done Grotto Masters and Grottos do not represent the Church of Satan unless they have other authority to do so

Members of the Priesthood have the titles PriestPriestess MagisterMagistra or MagusMaga The Council of Nine which is the ruling body of the Church of Satan and the Order of the Trapezoid who help in the administration of the Church of Satan are part of the priesthood The High Priest and Priestess act as administrative chiefs and the two main public representatives The current High Priest is Peter H Gilmore the current High Priestess Peggy Nadramia

The Church of Satan say they judge whether Active Members can join the Priesthood by their accomplishment in society and recognition within a profession rather than knowledge of the occult They are expected to be able to speak about the Satanic philosophy but do not have to represent the Church of Satan publically and might choose to keep their membership secret so they can do what they want in the world meet their own goals and those of the Church Membership in the Priesthood is by invitation only

Zeena Lavey Anton LaVeys daughter was not a High Priestess of the Church and has left it

Satanists within the Church of Satan follow these rules on how to live But Satanists do not view the Satanic sins statements and rules of the earth as things that someone has to try to do They think its human nature rather than a Jew or Christian who the Church of Satan think have to try hard to fit in with the rules of their religion

The Nine Satanic Statements outline what Satan represents in the Church of Satan

The idea of a flat Earth is that the surface of the Earth is flat

Belief in a flat Earth is found in mankinds oldest writings In early Mesopotamian thought the world was portrayed as a flat disk floating in the ocean This was a common belief until the Classical Greeks began to discuss the Earths shape about the 4th century BC

The large scale shape of the Earth is only relevant when considering large distances Consequently in antiquity only sailors astronomers philosophers and theologians would have been concerned about the Earths large scale shape

The following authors argued for a spherical earth King Alfred of the Anglo Saxons Hildegard von Bingen Thomas Aquinas Snorri Sturluson Marco Polo Dante Alighieri Christopher Columbus

Portuguese exploration of Africa and Asia Columbus voyage to the Americas and finally Ferdinand Magellans circumnavigation of the earth provided the final practical proofs for the global shape of the earth

During the 19th century the Romantic conception of a European Dark Age gave much more prominence to the Flat Earth model than it ever possessed historically 

The widely circulated woodcut of a man poking his head through the firmament of a flat Earth to view the mechanics of the spheres executed in the style of the 16th century cannot be traced to an earlier source than Camille Flammarions LAtmosphre Mtorologie Populaire The woodcut illustrates the statement in the text that a medieval missionary claimed that he reached the horizon where the Earth and the heavens met an anecdote that may be traced back to Voltaire but not to any known medieval source In its original form the woodcut included a decorative border that places it in the 19th century in later publications some claiming that the woodcut dated from the 16th century the border was removed According to anecdotal evidence Flammarion had commissioned the woodcut himself certainly no source of the image earlier than Flammarions book is known

An early mention in literature was Ludvig Holbergs comedy Erasmus Montanus Erasmus Montanus meets considerable opposition when he claims the Earth is round since all the peasants hold it to be flat He is not allowed to marry his fiance until he cries The earth is flat as a pancake In Rudyard Kiplings The Village that Voted the Earth was Flat the protagonists spread the rumor that a Parish Council meeting had voted in favor of a flat Earth

Fantasy fiction is particularly rich in references to the flat Earth In C S Lewis The Voyage of the Dawn Treader the fictional world of Narnia is round like a table not round like a ball and the characters sail toward the edge of this world Terry Pratchetts Strata and Discworld novels are set on a flat disc shaped world resting on the backs of four huge elephants which are in turn standing on the back of an enormous turtle

But as the number of robberies continued people became scared and wanted the government to do something In 1864 Gilbert killed a policeman Sergeant Edmund Parry during a robbery near Jugiong The police search for Gilbert became urgent

At Springfield near Goulburn Gilbert tried to rob four young brothers The boys fired their guns and kept the bushrangers back Gilbert tried to shoot one of the boys but his stolen race horse got in the way The horse died immediately and Gilbert was trapped under the dead horse People thought that this was very funny a dangerous bushranger being made to look like a fool by a group of boys

In 1865 another another policeman was killed by another member of the gang John Dunn Members of the gang were declared outlaws This meant they could be killed by anyone at anytime The police shot Ben Hall dead near Forbes on May 5 1865 On May 13 1865 Gilbert and Dunn went to hide at John Kellys house Kelly told the police at Binalong where the two bushrangers were hiding so he could get the reward money The police went to the house but Gilbert and Dunn climbed out a window and ran down to Billabong Creek to escape into the bush Constable King was shot in the foot and Dunn was shot in the arm Gilbert was shot dead when he stopped to shoot back at Constable John Bright After an inquest to record how he died he was buried at Binalong in the field where the police kept their horses Gilbert was a bad criminal He had been in 630 robberies Dunn escaped but was captured six months later He was hanged in Sydney in March 1866

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a kind of brain problem It affects how people think and act People with ADHD usually have problems with focusing and remembering what is important They may also have extra trouble sitting still or being quiet

An easy way to imagine what ADHD is like is to think of a shiny light or a constant noise in a room Imagine that you want to be able to turn your attention away to focus on other things like getting the mess cleaned up or doing your homework but that shiny light or that buzzing sound is constantly distracting you This is similar to why people with ADHD have trouble focusing They want to focus but they are constantly being distracted by a shiny thought in their head Sometimes that shiny thought gets stuck and the person with ADHD will stop paying attention to anything else This is called hyperfocus 

Because ADHD affects how peoples nerves develop it is called a neurological developmental disorder Almost everyone with ADHD gets it from their parents when they are born

Experts think that throughout the entire world about one in twenty children has ADHD Some countries have more ADHD than others and not everyone uses the same tests Psychologists have found more people with ADHD in North America than in Africa and the Middle East In the United States about one in every fourteen children has ADHD including one in every ten boys and one in every twenty five girls This could be because more boys get ADHD or because fewer girls take ADHD tests

ADHD is most common in children but many adults have ADHD too A little less than half of children with ADHD get better when they become adults The best way to help people with ADHD is usually to do several things go to a doctor for medicine go to a psychologist for therapy and practice ways to not get distracted Many adults with ADHD learn how to make up for their difficulties

The Pakistan Declaration of 1933 had envisioned the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir as one of the five Northern units of India that were to form the new nation of Pakistan on the basis of its Muslim majority according to the Pakistanis they had signed a standstill agreement with ruler at the time The Republic of India has a different perspective on this interpretation

The whole area of Pakistan administered Kashmir was administered as it was before independence

Additionally a part of Hunza Gilgit called Raskam and the Shaksgam Valley of Baltistan region ceded by Pakistan to the Peoples Republic of China in 1963 pending settlement of the dispute over Kashmir This ceded area is also known as the Trans Karakoram Tract

Pakistan administered Kashmir is administratively divided into two parts

Pakistan administered Kashmir does not include Aksai Chin the area of the former Princely state of Kashmir and Jammu that is under Chinese control since 1962The cease fire line that separates Jammu and Kashmir from the Aksai Chin is known as the Line of Actual Control

See Government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir

Elections were held to the 49 seat Legislative Assembly of Pakistan Administered Kashmir on July 11 to the eighth Legislative Assembly since 1970 Azad Kashmir is categorised as an autonomous region But critics claim titles such as Prime Minister and President for the regions elected political leadership are misleading as candidates are required to sign an affidavit of allegiance to Kashmirs accession to Pakistan

On September 14 1994 the Supreme Court of Pakistan administered Kashmir ruled that the Northern areas are a part of JK State but are not a part of Azad JK as defined in the Interim Constitution Act 1974 The Northern Areas presently has no officially named status in Pakistan Pakistan does not consider this area as a province of Pakistan or as a part of Azad Kashmir They are ruled directly from Islamabad through a Northern Areas Council A chief executive appointed by Islamabad is the local administrative head This area presently has no representatives in both the Azad Kashmir Assembly and in Pakistans parliament Northern Areas Legislative Council was created with a membership of 29 but its powers are restricted On May 11 2007 the NAs chief executive who also happens to be the Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Northern Areas Affairs declared that the region had a right to be represented in the National Assembly Others demand that it should be given the status of a province The changes made in 1994 in the local bodies ordinance gave more representation to women and delegated some administrative and financial powers to the local administration However the people of the region do not enjoy fundamental rights because it continues to be governed by the Legal Framework Order of 1994

The Districts of Pakistan are the third level of government in Pakistan and are subdivisions of the provinces of Pakistan Before August 2000 the provinces contained administrative units called divisions which contained districts as the fourth level of government In August 2000 the divisions were abolished and the provinces are now directly divided into districts

Kashmir and Jammu was a princely state within the Himalayas next to the territories of British India in the north It was ruled by a Hindu Maharaja who was put in place by the British and he was not a native of Kashmir The state was created in 1846 after the defeat of the Sikhs and the treaties of Lahore and Amritsar were signed After the British left India the princely state was divided between Pakistan and India as war took place between the neighbours 

The area of the state were set by the Treaty of Amritsar of 1846 situated to the eastward of the Indus and westward of the Ravi River it covered an area of 80900 km2 

Before the creation of the princely state Kashmir had been ruled by the Durrani Empire it was then taken over by the Sikhs under Ranjit Singh During Sikh rule Jammu had been a tributary of the Sikh Empire in the Punjab region after the death of Kishore Singh in 1822 his son Gulab Singh was recognised by the Sikhs as being his heir He then began expanding his kingdom

As Ruler Jammu Gulab Singh took over Bhadarwah then Kishtwar Taking over Kishtwar meant that Singh had now gained control of two of the roads which led into Ladakh which allowed him to take control of that territory Although there were huge difficulties due to the mountains and glaciers the Dogras under Gulab Singhs officer Zorawar Singh managed to conquered the whole of Ladakh 

A few years later in 1840 General Zorawar Singh invaded Baltistan and captured the Raja of Skardu who had sided with the Ladakhis and took over his country The following year Zorawar Singh tried to invade Tibet however due to the winter weather and by being attacked by the Tibetians He along with almost all of his army died 

In the winter of 1845 war broke out between the British and the Sikhs Gulab Singh remained neutral until the battle of Sobraon in 1846 when he became a trusted adviser of Sir Henry Lawrence This allowed him to gain land for himself  all the hilly or mountainous land to the east of the Indus and west of the Ravi River

Kashmir itself was not easy for the Maharaja to take over The Maharajas army had to fight Imam ud din  the Sikh governor Imam ud din was aided by the Bambas from the Jhelum valley They managed to defeat Gulab Singhs troops near to Srinagar killing Wazir Lakhpat However Imam ud din was later persuaded by Sir Henry Lawrence to stop fighting and Kashmir passed without further fighting to the new ruler

Not long afterwards the Hunza Raja attacked Gilgit territory Nathu Shah on behalf of Gulab Singh responded by leading a force to attack the Hunza valley he and his force were destroyed and Gilgit fort fell into the hands of the Hunza Raja along with Punial Yasin and Darel The Maharaja then sent two armies one from Astor and one from Baltistan and after some fighting Gilgit fort was taken back In 1852 the Dogra troops were defeated by Gaur Rahman of Yasin and for eight years the Indus formed the boundary of the Maharajas territories

Gulab Singh died in 1857 his successor Ranbir Singh sided with the British during the Indian Rebellion After the rebellion had been defeated by the British Ranbir decided to take back Gilgit In 1860 a force under Devi Singh crossed the Indus and moved towards Gaur Rahmans strong fort at Gilgit Gaur Rahman had died just before the arrival of the Dogras The fort was taken and held by the Maharajas until 1947

Although Ranbir Singh was tolerant of other religions his control over the country was weak between 1877 1879 a dreadful famine took place in Kashmir 

Jammu was the southern most part of the state and was next to the Punjab districts of Jhelum Gujrat Sialkot and Gurdaspur

There used to be a route from Kohala to Leh it was possible to travel from Rawalpindi via Kohala and over the Kohala Bridge into Kashmir The route from from Kohala to Srinagar was a cart road 132 miles in length from Kohala to Baramulla the road was close to the Jhelum River At Muzaffarabad the Kishenganga River joins the Jhelum and at this point the road from Abbottabad and Garhi Habibullah meet the Kashmir route The road carried heavy traffic and had to be repaired main times by the authorities

In 1893 very serious floods took place in the Jhelum because of rain that fell for 52 hours and much damage was done to Srinagar However the floods of 1903 was much more severe

In 1947 the Indian Independence Act was passed this meant that British India would become two independent states  Pakistan and India Also each of the princely states would be free to join India or Pakistan  or remain independent All of princely ended up becoming part of Pakistan or India

However the ruler of Kashmir wanted to remain independent neither joining Pakistan or India this lead to war between the two neighbouring countries in which Kashmir became divided between them Each considered that all of the former princely state belongs to them This has led to several wars The Kashmir conflict between the two nuclear neighbours remains one of the hardest and longest running disputes that the United Nations Security Council has been trying to solve

The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre also known as the Amritsar Massacre was a massacre that happened in Amritsar in 1919 It is named after the Jallianwala Bagh in the northern Indian city of Amritsar On April 13 1919 British Indian Army soldiers opened fire on an unarmed gathering of men women and children The person in charge was Brigadier General Reginald Dyer the military commander of Amritsar 

The shooting lasted about ten minutes According to official British Raj sources 379 people were killed According to other sources there were over 1000 deaths with more than 2000 wounded and Civil Surgeon Dr Smith indicated that there were 1526 casualties 

World War I began with huge support and goodwill towards the United Kingdom from the Indian political leadership This was not expected by the British who thought there may be a revolt India contributed massively to the British war effort by providing men and resources About 13 million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe Africa and the Middle East while both the Indian government and the princes sent large supplies of food money and ammunition

However Bengal and Punjab were areas where people still opposed the British Terrorist style attacks in Bengal became linked with the unrest in Punjab Also from the beginning of the war the overseas Indian population mainly from the United States Canada and Germany headed by the Berlin Committee and the Ghadar Party attempted to start a rebellion in India similar to the 1857 uprising with Irish Republican German and Turkish help in a massive conspiracy that has since come to be called the Hindu German conspiracy This conspiracy also attempted to rally Afghanistan against British India

After World War I the high number of dead and wounded inflation heavy taxation and other problems all greatly affected the people of India Indian soldiers smuggled arms into India to overthrow British rule Different groups settled their differences to demand independence from Britain In 1916 the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League signed the Lucknow Pact 

The worsening civil unrest throughout India especially amongst the Bombay millworkers led to the Rowlatt committee in 1919 The Rowlatt committee was named after Sydney Rowlatt an English judge The job of the committee was to understand German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India especially in Punjab and Bengal

The committee asked for an extension of the Defence of India act of 1915 The act gave the Viceroys government with great power that included silencing the press including detaining the political activists without trial arrest without warrant of any individual suspected of treason This act sparked huge anger within India

The events that followed the Rowlatt Act in 1919 were also influenced by the events linked to the Ghadar conspiracy At the time British Indian Army troops were returning from the battlefields of Europe and Mesopotamia to an economic depression in India There were attempts to mutiny in 1915 and the Lahore conspiracy trials were still in public attention News of young Mohajirs who fought on behalf of the Turkish Caliphate and later for the Red Army during the Russian Civil War was also beginning to reach India The Russian Revolution had also started to influence India It was at this time that Mahatma Gandhi until then relatively unknown on the Indian political scene began emerging as a mass leader 

Gandhis call for protest against the Rowlatt act got an expected response  of furious unrest and protests The situation especially in Punjab became bad very quickly Rail telegraph and communication systems were all disrupted A huge crowd of 20000 marched through Lahore 

In Amritsar over 5000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh Michael ODwyer is said to have believed that this was part of an attempt to rebel against the British James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tensed situation in Punjab and the British response that ended in the massacre

On April 10 1919 a protest was held at the residence of the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar a city in Punjab a large province in the northwestern part of what was then undivided India The demonstration was held to demand the release of two popular leaders of the Indian Independence Movement Satya Pal and Saifuddin Kitchlew who had been earlier arrested on account of their protests The crowd was shot at by British troops the shooting stated more violence Later in the day several banks and other government buildings including the Town Hall and the railway station were attacked and set on fire The violence continued to increase and resulted in the deaths of at least 5 Europeans including government employees and civilians 

For the next two days the city of Amritsar was quiet but violence continued in other parts of the Punjab Railway lines were cut telegraph posts destroyed government buildings burnt and three Europeans were killed By April 13 the British government had decided to place most of the Punjab under martial law The legislation placed restrictions on a number of civil liberties including freedom of assembly banning gatherings of more than four people 

The massacre  On April 13 1919 thousands of people gathered in the Jallianwala Bagh near the Golden Temple in Amritsar The date was for the Baisakhi festival which was also the Sikh new year For more than two hundred years this festival had drawn thousands from all over India People had travelled for days to get to Amritsar 

The Jallianwala Bagh was surrounded on all sides by houses and buildings and had few narrow entrances most of which were kept locked Unable to escape people tried to climb the walls of the park Many jumped into a well inside the compound to escape from the bullets A plaque in the monument says that 120 bodies were plucked out of the well

As a result of the shooting hundreds of people were killed and thousands were injured In a telegram sent to Dyer British Lieutenant Governor of Punjab Sir Michael ODwyer wrote Your action is correct Lieutenant Governor approves 

ODwyer asked for martial law to be imposed upon Amritsar and other areas this was allowed by the Viceroy Lord Chelmsford after the massacre

The British Indian Army officially called simply the Indian Army was the army in British India during British rule The Indian Army served as a security force in India itself and fought in battles particularly during the World Wars 

The term Indian Army was used to describe the presidency armies especially after the Indian Mutiny However the first army officially called the Indian Army was raised by the government of India in 1895 In 1903 the Indian Army absorbed the three presidency armies

Between 1903 and 1947 the Army of India consisted of two separate parts the Indian Army and the British Army in India The first consisted of Indian Army regiments from India while the second were British Army regiments from the United Kingdom which were sent to India

The Indian Army was formed after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 when the government of Britain took over rule from the British East India Company Before that the Company had their own army units paid for by their profits and these joined with British Army units 

The army of the British East India Company recruited mostly Muslims in the Bengal Presidency and high caste Hindus mainly from the rural plains of Oudh These troops had rebelled against the British in 1857 due to the way they were treated And had tried to make the Mughal king Bahadur Shah II the new ruler

After the rebellion the British started recruiting what the British called the martial races particularly Marathas Rajputs Sikhs Gurkhas Pashtuns Garhwalis Mohyals and Dogras 

After World War II the British formations and units that had been part of the British Army of India were divided between India and Pakistan 

Soon after the Partition of India both the newly formed armies fought each other in the First Kashmir War from 1947  48 which begun the bitter rivalry that has continued into the 21st century

The presidency armies were the armies of the three presidencies of British India The presidency armies like the presidencies themselves belonged to the East India Company until the Indian Mutiny when the British government took over all three presidencies Eventually all three presidency armies were merged into the Indian Army

The presidency armies were named after the presidencies these were

From the mid eighteenth century the East India Company began to keep armies at each of its three main stations or Presidencies in India at Calcutta Madras and Bombay The Bengal Army Madras Army and Bombay Army were quite different each with its own list of Regiments and European officers All three armies had both European regiments in which both the officers and men were Europeans and a larger number of Native regiments in which the officers were Europeans and the ordinary soldiers were Indians

Also from the mid eighteenth century the British government began to send regiments of the regular British Army to India to reinforce the Companys armies These troops are often referred to as HMs Regiments or Royal regiments 

Following the Indian rebellion of 1857 58 and the end of the East India Company its European regiments were joined in 1860 with the British Army but its Native regiments were not The three separate Presidency Armies continued to exist and their European officers continued to be listed as members of the Bengal Madras or Bombay Army rather than the British Army However the Presidency Armies began to be described as the Indian Army Also after the rebellion artillery was only to be used by the British Army and not by Indian troops

In the 1890s the separate Presidency Armies were joined together to form the Indian Army

The Bombay Presidency was a former province of British India It began in the 17th century as trading posts of the British East India Company but later grew to include much of western and central India as well as parts of Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula 

At its greatest extent the Bombay Presidency was made up of the present day state of Gujarat the western two thirds of Maharashtra state including the regions of Konkan Desh and Kandesh and northwestern Karnataka state of India It also included Pakistans Sindh province and the British territory of Aden in Yemen It consisted partly of districts which were directly under British rule and partly of native or princely states which were ruled by local rulers under the administration of a governor

The first British settlement in the Bombay Presidency was in 1618 when the East India Company established a factory at Surat The British were protected by a charter from the Mughal Emperor Jahangir Bombay at the time was under the control of Portugal In 1661 Bombay was given to the British government as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza when she married Charles II of England In 1668 Bombay was given to the East India Company for a yearly payment of 10 In 1687 Bombay became the capital of the Companys territories in India However in 1753 Calcutta was in charge of the Government of Bombay

During the 18th century the Maratha Empire grew quickly conquering Konkan and much of eastern Gujarat from the Mughal Empire In western Gujarat including Kathiawar and Kutch the weakening Mughal control allowed lots of local rulers to become independent The first battle between the British and the Marathas was the First Anglo Maratha War which began in 1774 and resulted in the 1782 treaty of Salbai The treaty meant that the island of Salsette next to Bombay island was given to the British The British took over Surat in 1800 British territory became bigger in the Second Anglo Maratha War which ended in 1803 

In 1803 the Bombay Presidency included only Salsette the islands of the harbour Surat and Bankot but 1803 and 1827 the presidency grew even more The Gujarat districts were taken over by the Bombay government in 1805 and made larger in 1818 The small states of Kathiawar and Mahikantha were organised into princely states under British control between 1807 and 1820 

After the Revolt of 1857 the British East India Company rule ceased and India came under the direct control of the British government In 1932 Aden was separated from Bombay and made a separate province and Sind became a separate province on April 1 1936

The Bombay Presidency had a large and diverse population The census of 1901 gave a total of 25468209 people By religion the population was 19916438 Hindu 4567295 Muslim 535950 Jain 78552 Zoroastrian and about 200000 Christian

In Sindh Islam had been the main religion since the Arab conquest in the 8th century In Gujarat the main religion is Hinduism although Muslim kingdoms have left their influence in many parts of the province The Deccan is the home of the Marathi who were 30 of the population The Konkan had various Christian castes because of the rule of the Portuguese 

The main languages of the Presidency were Sindhi in Sindh Kutchi in Kutch Gujarati and Hindustani in Gujarat Marathi in Thana and the central division Gujarati and Marathi in Khandesh and Marathi and Kannada in the southern division There were also Bhil and Gipsy dialects

In 1947 Bombay Province became part of newly independent India and Sindh Province became part of Pakistan In 1950 Bombay Province was reorganised into Bombay State which included the princely states

The word Mahrja is Sanskrit for great king or high king Many languages of India have borrowed the word maharaja there languages include Punjabi Bengali Hindi and Gujrati Its use is mainly for Hindu rulers A female ruler is known as Maharani or great queen She can be the wife of a Maharaja or a ruler herself

In 1971 the government of Indira Gandhi abolished the titles and money for all Indian rulers However some people still claim such titles

Before independence in 1947 India and Pakistan contained more than 600 princely states each with its own ruler Some called Raja or Thakur or Nawab there was many other titles as well

The viola damore is a string instrument which was popular in the 17th and 18th century It is a kind of viola The name is Italian and means viola of love It can have 6 or 7 strings It is held under the chin and bowed like a violin Sometimes it is used today to play music from the 17th and 18th centuries Occasionally some modern composers have also written music for it

The viola damore is about the same size as a modern viola However the shape is more like the shape of a viol Like viols it has a flat back a wide rib sloping shoulders and a carved head at the top of the peg box It does not have any frets like a viol or a guitar The sound holes are often in the shape of a flaming sword

The viola damore usually has six or seven playing strings which are played with the bow just as with a violin In addition it has the same number of sympathetic strings These are strings which vibrate when the other strings are played making the sound richer and sweeter 

The viola damore was often tuned to whatever notes were best for the piece it was to going to play This is a kind of scordatura Towards the end of the 18th century the usual tuning became A d a d f a d

The viola damore became very popular during the 17th century However after a time it became less popular because the instruments of the viol family were not used much while the instruments of the violin family took over The viola damore was too quiet and sweet to play with the modern violin family However in the 20th century some composers have written for the instrument again eg Paul Hindemith

The viola damore can regularly be heard today in groups who play Baroque music on period instruments It can be heard for example in Bachs St John Passion

Printmaking is making art by printing pictures normally on paper The advantage of printmaking is that lots of the same picture can be printed This is called a print Each print is not a copy but an original since it came from the same source

Pictures for prints can be cut into plates of metal usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching stone used for lithography blocks of wood for woodcuts linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen printing Prints may also be published in books by the artist

An old master print is a work of art made by a printing process Most of the old master prints were made by 1830 and no new ones came after The main techniques used to make an old master print are woodcut engraving and etching Sometimes old master prints are printed on paper but rarely

Many great European artists such as Albrecht Drer Rembrandt and Francisco Goya were printmakers

Web colors are colors used in designing webpages and the ways for describing and listing those colours

There are several ways to chose colors for parts of webpages Colors may be listed as an RGB triplet in hexadecimal format Many common colors can also be chosen by their common English names Often a color tool or other graphics software is used to create color values

The first versions of Mosaic and Netscape Navigator used the X11 color names as the base for their color lists This was because they both started as X Window System applications

Each web color has its own definition sRGB This relates to the chromaticities of a single phosphor set a given transfer curve adaptive whitepoint and viewing conditions These have been chosen to be similar to many real world monitors and viewing conditions Even without color management the colors created are fairly close to the given values However user agents can be different in the fidelity with which they show the colors Better user agents use color management to create better color fidelity This is important for Web to print applications

There were originally 16 colors but orange was added later to make a total of 17 The original 16 were part of something called the Windows VGA template meaning that they are the colors that can be used for actions like highlighting

The 2008 Atlantic hurricane season is when many of the tropical cyclones formed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2008 The season started on June 1 and ended on November 30 but Tropical Storm Arthur formed two days early on May 30 2008 During the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season there was a total of sixteen named storms 16 tropical storms 8 hurricanes and 5 major hurricanes

Tropical Storm Arthur formed near the Belize coast late on May 30 forming out of the interaction between a tropical wave and what was left of Tropical Storm Alma which was a tropical storm in the East Pacific Arthur made landfall in Belize on May 31 The system moved over Yucatn Peninsula slowly and dissipated on land early on June 2 When Arthur made landfall on Belize it caused an estimated 78 million USD worth of damage and killed 5 people 

Arthur is the first reported tropical storm to form in May since Tropical Storm Arlene in 1981 Other systems have formed but were subtropical Some forecasters question whether Arthurs very short lifespan would have been reported and named in the years prior to todays technology The formation of Arthur also marks the first time that a named storm formed in May for two consecutive years in and just the third time in over 150 years of record

Early on July 1 a strong and big tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa By early the next day a surface low developed and the wave became more organized The National Hurricane Center upgraded the system to Tropical Depression Two in the morning hours of July 3 after the system was able to keep convection over its center for at least 12 hours The depression organized further and developed two distinct bands of convection Six hours after becoming a depression it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bertha the second named storm of the season The National Hurricane Center said that this tropical cyclone was predicted by up to a week in advance by many global computer models

After some strengthening on July 6 Bertha was upgraded to a hurricane early on July 7 as satellite and microwave imagery indicated an eye feature had formed It continued to strengthen that morning Fast strengthening continued that afternoon and Bertha strengthened into a major hurricane with 125 mph winds and a well defined eye The strengthening trend stopped early on July 8 due to wind shear and Bertha quickly weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane that afternoon

Bertha again began to quickly strengthen on July 9 as a new eye had formed and the system became more symmetrical The NHC upgraded Bertha to a category two hurricane with winds of 105 mph and stated that Bertha could strengthen further to a major hurricane again but instead weakened into an 85 mph category 1 hurricane Bertha has become the longest lived pre August Atlantic tropical cyclone on record On July 12 Bertha slowed in movement and was close to becoming still and by July 13 this slow movement weakened the storm to tropical storm strength On July 18 Bertha strengthened back to a hurricane as its forward motion increased As it moved over cooler waters it weakened a bit to a tropical storm late on July 19 It finally became extratropical on July 20 southwest of Iceland

A disturbance off the Georgia coast slowly organized itself and became Tropical Depression Three late on July 18 It strengthened into Tropical Storm Cristobal the next day It continued to be near and parallel to the Carolina coast though never making landfall It became extratropical on July 23

Dolly formed on July 20 from a tropical wave which was located north of Honduras Since it became a tropical storm right away it never became a depression while forming Early on July 21 Dolly made landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula The day after that it became a hurricane Dolly moved northwest and for a little while it was a category 2 hurricane Dolly weakened a little back to a category 1 later that day Very shortly after weakening Dolly made landfall in South Padre Island Texas Dolly died over in a very northwestern area of Texas on July 27

Dolly killed a few people in Mexico and the United States but in Guatemala Dolly killed at least 17 people Damage was a little bit more than 1 billion

A shear line stalled in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in early August as troughing aloft dug into the northeast Gulf of Mexico This energy aloft helped to organize a surface low along the shearline early on August 2 which slowly organized over the following day It strengthened into Tropical Depression Five before gaining strength and being named Tropical Storm Edouard on August 3 The storm made landfall in Southeast Texas near Port Arthur on the morning of August 5 as a strong tropical storm As it moved inland the system weakened into a tropical depression by afternoon The depression weakened into a remnant low on August 7 while on land over Texas

A strong tropical wave moved into the northeastern Caribbean in mid August It caused heavy rain across the Leeward Islands and into Puerto Rico before tracking westward while unable to develop a low level circulation although it was producing tropical storm force winds On August 15 a closed circulation was found and the system was named Tropical Storm Fay Later that day Fay caused heavy rains on the island of Hispaniola causing a major flash flood threat Fay crossed Hispaniola Cuba and hit south Florida beginning late on August 18 slowly tracking northeastward across the peninsula High amounts of flooding happened in much of eastern Florida along with some wind damage After crossing into the Atlantic Fay turned westward again and crossed northern Florida on August 22 As it zigzagged from water to land it became the first storm in Florida recorded history to make landfall four times Fay weakened into a tropical depression along the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico Fay eventually weakened into a remnant low around noon on August 26 while located over Alabama

A disturbance formed in the deep tropical Atlantic in the fourth week of August It tracked westward into the Caribbean Sea where it encountered better conditions for cyclone development and became a tropical depression on the morning of August 25 west of the Windward Islands It quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Gustav early that afternoon and into Hurricane Gustav early on August 26 It then weakened into a tropical storm on the evening of August 27 It re organized further south into a strong tropical storm once again on August 28 before speeding up and hitting Jamaica Gustav has killed 78 people in Haiti the Dominican Republic and Jamaica while 7 are still missing in Haiti On August 29 it strengthened back into a hurricane On the morning of August 30 it was upgraded to a Category 3 major hurricane After strengthening slowed for a few hours another round of quick strengthening happened and Gustav was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane during a hurricane hunter flight around 1pm with 145 mph winds Continuing to intensify it became a 150 mph storm that afternoon near 5 PM EDT Soon after Gustav made landfall in Cuba firstly on the island of Isla de la Juventud and later on the mainland near Los Palacios in Pinar del Ro Province causing severe damage although it is difficult to predict how much damage it caused It then emerged into the Gulf of Mexico weakening into a minimal 115 mph It was expected to hit Louisiana so the mayor of New Orleans evacuated the city At 8 am CDT on the 2nd September it was reported to have weakened to category 2

Hurricane Gustav made landfall in Louisiana on September 1 and quickly weakened over land After weakening to a tropical depression September 4 Gustav was sucked into a cold front Gustav was responsible for 138 deaths and up to 18 billion in damage 

Tropical Depression Eight formed on August 28 from a low pressure area east northeast of the northern Leeward Islands It was upgraded to a tropical storm later that day and named Hanna On September 1 while Hanna was moving very near to the island of Mayaguana in the Bahamas it was upgraded to Category 1 hurricane status Hanna wandered around the southeastern Bahamas weakening to a tropical storm while also dumping heavy rain on already devastated Haiti Hanna moved rapidly northeastwards along the east coast of the United States as a tropical storm Hanna changed into an extratropical cyclone as it moved offshore from Massachusetts early on September 7 At least 537 deaths have been blamed on Hanna most in Haiti

A tropical disturbance formed off the coast of Africa near the end of August It moved south of Cape Verde and slowly strenthend On September 1 it became Tropical Depression Nine while west of the Cape Verde islands and strenthend into a tropical storm later that day when it was given the name Ike Ike developed an eye late on September 3 as it did explosive intensification as it strengthened from a tropical storm to a Category 4 hurricane in twelve hours with an guessed pressure drop of 43 mbars from 991 to 948 mbars and a 24 hour pressure drop of 61 mbar from 996 to 935 mbars Ike weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane before re intensifying back to Category 4 It ripped across Great Inagua Island and Grand Turk Island where 80 of the buildings on Grand Turk were seriously damaged or completely destroyed It weakened into a strong Category 3 late in the afternoon of September 7 as it headed for landfall on the northeastern coastline of Cuba that evening In addition the storm killed at least 74 people in Haiti and 1 person in the Dominican Republic 

As Ike crossed Cuba on September 8 it weakened to a Category 1 hurricane and emerged into the Caribbean Sea where it moved along or just off of the southern coast of Cuba Ike killed 7 people as it effected nearly the whole county of Cuba It made landfall on Galveston Island on September 13 as a strong category 2 hurricane but its big size brought storm surge of over 12 feet from Galveston Island eastward into southern Louisiana The Bolivar Peninsula was worst affected by the surge while Galveston Island and the Port Arthur areas also saw a lot of damage Power was knocked out to most of the Houston area and windows were blown out of skyscrapers in downtown Houston As Ike moved inland it brought moderate flooding and wind damage during the Midwest and as far north as Pennsylvania It became extratropical on September 14 At least 82 deaths have been blamed on Ike in the US with 44 of them caused directly

Damage from Ike is guessed at 315 billion the third most damaging hurricane in US history behind Katrina in 2005 and Andrew in 1992 At least 166 deaths have been blamed on Ike of which 82 were in the United States It was the most damaging hurricane in Texas history Ike was an extremely big and strong storm At one point the diameter of Ikes tropical storm and hurricane force winds were 550 and 240 miles making Ike one of the biggest Atlantic hurricane recorded Ike also had the second highest IKE of any Atlantic storm in the past 40 years Integrated Kinetic Energy is a measure of storm surge damaging potential similar to the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale though the IKE is more complex and in many ways more accurate On a scale that ranges from 1 to 6 with 6 being highest destructive potential Ike earned a 52

A tropical disturbance formed off the coast of Africa near the end of August It tracked south of Cape Verde and slowly developed On September 2 it became Tropical Depression Ten while south southeast of the southernmost Cape Verde islands The depression was upgraded to a tropical storm later the same day as it passed to the south of the Cape Verde islands A few days later it weakened back to a tropical depression On September 6 it dissipated in the open waters of the Atlantic 

A strong tropical disturbance tracked across the northeastern Caribbean Sea in the third week of September It meandered around Puerto Rico and Hispaniola dumping lots of rain across those islands causing a significant amount of damage despite never developing a closed circulation By September 24 it began to track northward away from the islands and into the open Atlantic water and became a tropical storm on September 25 Kyle was upgraded to a hurricane during the afternoon of September 27 It continued northward and maintained hurricane strength until landfall near Yarmouth Nova Scotia in Canada late on September 28 A few hours later Kyle became extratropical as the cold waters of the Bay of Fundy took effect In general Maritimers were spared of the expected damage 

In the last week of September a very large non tropical system over the north central Atlantic slowly moved westward away from the Azores As it entered warmer waters it slowly gained tropical characteristics and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura early on September 29 It became fully tropical the next day and was reclassified as Tropical Storm Laura On October 1 it became post tropical as it moved over cooler waters 

Tropical Depression Thirteen formed from a very small but well organized low in the Bay of Campeche on October 6 It quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Marco with 65 mph winds that afternoon Marco made landfall near Veracruz Mexico the next morning at the same intensity Marco dissipated that night as the small circulation moved inland At one point tropical storm force winds were estimated to extend only 10 miles from the center which makes it the smallest tropical cyclone on record beating Cyclone Tracy 

Tropical Storm Nana formed on October 12 from a disturbance which had been drifting toward the northwest over the previous couple days in the middle of the tropical Atlantic ocean roughly halfway between the west coast of Africa and the Lesser Antilles The storm weakened into a remnant low on October 14 This is the first use of the name Nana since 1990 

A tropical disturbance in the eastern Caribbean Sea was in an area not expecting any development in the second week of October While drifting across the region upper level winds calmed down enough for the tropical disturbance to strengthen and to develop into Tropical Depression Fifteen on October 13 It strengthened to Tropical Storm Omar the next day Omar quickly strengthened into a 70 mph storm that afternoon and became a hurricane that night It remained a hurricane through that night and it changed little in intensity through the next day but that evening Omar intensified quickly and became a 115 mph Category 3 storm and became a 125 mph storm the next morning Omar became a weak Category 4 early that morning However wind shear and dry air quickly weakened Omar to a minimal hurricane that afternoon as it raced towards the northeast at 26 mph After dropping to tropical storm strength it became a hurricane again on October 17 It degenerated to a remnant low on October 18 

Tropical Depression Sixteen slowly formed off the coast of Nicaragua It was not till October 14 that it was then called Tropical Depression Sixteen After hugging the northern coast of Honduras Tropical Depression Sixteen made landfall near midday on October 15 It dissipated inland that evening never becoming a tropical storm This storm caused up to 150 million in damage and may have caused at least 75 deaths

An area of low pressure stopped moving in the Caribbean Sea without showing tropical development for the first few days at the beginning of November On November 5 the low pressure system became Tropical Depression Seventeen while just east of Nicaragua The next day it became Tropical Storm Paloma It was the first tropical storm to receive this female name Paloma then made landfall in Cuba and moved slowly and quickly dissipated on November 9 The remains of Paloma were tracked till they came ashore of the Florida Panhandle Paloma caused up to 315 million in damage in the area Paloma affected

The table on the right shows the ACE for each storm in the season ACE is a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as strong hurricanes have high ACEs ACE is only officially released for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots or tropical storm strength Subtropical storms are not included in season totals

This is the list of names were used for named storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2008 The list is the same as the 2002 list except for Ike and Laura because Isidore and Lili were bad storms in 2002 and there names were retired 

On April 22 2009 World Meteorological Organization retired the names Gustav Ike and Paloma from its rotating name lists The names were replaced with Gonzalo Isaias and Paulette

The Solar Wind is not as the name suggests wind It is a stream of charged protons and electrons and plasma shot out of the Sun They are shot out at such speed that they can travel the whole length of the Solar System nearly 1 light year The particles are dangerous to people and spacecraft A solar storm in 1989 brought down the Quebec electric power grid putting the entire province in darkness If we were to have another solar storm as strong as the one in 1859 it is estimated it would cause up to 2 trillion dollars damage Earth has a magnetic field which absorbs or soaks up a lot of the solar wind causing the Northern lights and Southern lights 

Solar wind also causes the tail of a comet When the comet is close enough to the sun that the heat causes the ice of the comet to melt and evaporate the motion of the solar wind causes the resulting water vapor to stream away from the comet Because it is blown by the solar wind the comets tail does not trail behind it but always points directly away from the sun

Bharati Maqboza Kashmir is a disputed region to the north of the Republic of India It is under Indian administration but the government of Pakistan claims it The Government of India treats it as part of Jammu and Kashmir area 139000 SqKm population 6 million The occupied area is bounded to the west by Pakistan and the 1971 72 Line of Control which separates it from Azad Kashmir in the east by Ladakh Tibet and Aksai Chin The state is drained by numerous rivers including Indus Zanskar River Suru River Nubra River and Shyok River

Kashmir the last of the defiant states was the reverse of Hyderabad State It had a Hindu ruler Maharaja Hari Singh but his subjects were mostly Muslims accounting to 78 percent of the total population The Maharaja was reluctant to join either British India or newly created Pakistan But Lord Mountbatten urged him to take a decision to join either of the states before August 15 1947 The Maharaja asked for more time to consider his decision In the meantime he asked the Indian and the Pakistani government to sign a standstill agreement with him Pakistan consented but India refused 

The local population of Poonch began to press the Maharaja to accede to Pakistan In August 1947 they held a massive demonstration to protest against the Maharajas indecisiveness The Maharaja panicked He asked his Hindu paratroopers to open fire and within a matter of seconds several hundred Muslims were killed Rising up against this brutal action a local barrister called Sardar Muhammad Ibrahim immediately set up the Azad Kashmir government and began to wage guerrilla warfare against the Maharaja

By October 1947 the war of Kashmir had begun in earnest The Pathan tribesmen from the former sicNorth West Frontier Provincehidey wanting to avenge the deaths of their brothers invaded the valley On reaching the valley of Kashmir they defeated the Maharajas troops and reached the gates of Srinagar the capital The Maharaja sensing his defeat took refuge in Jammu whence he appealed to India to send troops to halt the onslaught of the tribesmen India agreed on the condition that Kashmir would accede to India On October 26 1947 the Maharaja acceded to India Lord Mountbatten accepted the accession on behalf of India 

On October 27 1947 India began to airlift her troops to Srinagar and launched a full scale attack on the tribesmen Pakistan was stunned Despite her scant military resources Pakistan was prepared to send in her troops but the British General Gracey Commander in Chief of the Pakistan Army was against it Jinnah proposed an immediate ceasefire and later on a fair and free plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir

In January 1948 India took the dispute to the UN Security Council There it accused Pakistan of aggression and demanded that Pakistan withdraw her tribesmen But Pakistan held that the accession of Kashmir had been brought about by force The government requested the Security Council to arrange a cease fire and asked both the tribesmen and the Indian troops to withdraw so that a free and impartial plebiscite could be held to ascertain the wishes of the people of Kashmir While the Kashmir issue was still on the table the Indian troops launched a full scale attack and drove the tribesmen right back to the Pakistani interim border 

Pakistan rushed her regular troops into Kashmir and a full scale war with India ensued She took control of the Azad Kashmir Army But the Security Council on August 13 1948 called for an immediate ceasefire the withdrawal of all Pakistani and Indian troops and holding of plebiscite under United Nations supervision Both the Indian and Pakistani governments accepted the resolution 

In January 1949 the resolution began to be implemented In July 1949 the ceasefire line was demarcated Pakistans side of Kashmir consisted of some parts of Jammu division Poonch District some areas of Western Kashmir Gilgit and a great chunk of Ladakh territory near the Chinese border in the North India kept the valley of Kashmir Jammu and the remainder of Ladakh territory near the Tibetan Chinese border The cease fire has remained in existence since 1949 No plebiscite has been held and thus the Kashmir issue still remains disputed and unresolved

The Megalodon Carcharodon megalodon was largest shark of all time It lived from the late Oligocene to early Pleistocene epochs 20 to 15 million years ago 

This giant of a shark was a huge version of the current great white shark The word megalodon is a Greek word and means big tooth Megalodon had teeth which are among the largest ever found over 18 cm long The are believed to be as long as 16 meters and weigh over 60 tons

Megalodon hunted large and medium sized whales attacking the bony areas such as chest or fins This would stop the whale or it could kill quickly with a fatal bite to the chest region Megalodon could bite with the one of the strongest bites in the animal kingdoms history

Mosasaurs were large predatory marine lizards of the Upper Cretaceous The first fossil Mosasaur Mosasaurus hoffmanni was found in the Netherlands in 1776p7 It was named in 1822 by WD Conybeare 

The type specimen was found in a chalk quarry in Maastricht Holland It was found by a German Army surgeon Johann Hoffmann who collected fossils for the Haarlem Museum In the course of a struggle for ownership the skeletal parts went to the museum whilst the skull stayed with the owner of the land who refused to let anyone see it 

The true identity of the monster was decided correctly by the French anatomist Georges Cuvier In 1795 French troops were outside Maastricht and Cuvier arranged for the large skull to be saved when they stormed the town The skull duly went to Cuvier in Paris fortunately because he was the leading comparative anatomist of the day He recognised the skull as that of a giant lizard from its teeth and skull bonesp10 though not until 1808 and by then the son of a Dutch professor Adriaan Camper had already had the same idea The discovery of the specimen was important in another way because it helped to convince Cuvier that extinction of some species was a fact Cuvier later came up with a catastrophism type theory

The type species was estimated to be 33 long Mosasaurus had four paddle like limbs on a long streamlined body and a long powerful tail The large head had huge jaws up to 4 ft with many teeth The jaws could open about 3 feet The lower jaw is loosely hinged to the skull with a moveable joint on each side This loose joint let it swallow huge prey They would have hunted fish turtles molluscs and shellfish Ammonites have been found bearing mosasaur teeth marks

An interesting fact is that Ichthyosaurs had died out by the middle of the Upper Cretaceous and also crocodiles and plesiosaurs were in decline It is this large marine predator niche which mosasaurs apparently occupied They gave birth to live young just as the Ichthyosaurs had done They flourished in the latest Cretaceous only to become extinct at the KT extinction event

Many other species of mosasaur have since been found some even larger than Mosasaurus for example Mosasaurus maximus found in Onion Creek Texas All have the same general body style and pattern of life though some like Prognathodon had crushing teeth for dealing with shellfish Present thought is that their closest living relatives are the monitor lizards

Cimabue was a painter from Florence in Italy who worked in the Late Medieval period His real name was Cenni di Peppi He painted large icons in the Byzantine style and was the first great painter in the city of Florence The only works of art that are known to be definitely by Cimabue are the mosaic of Christ in Majesty in Pisa Cathedral and two very large ruined frescos in the Church of St Francis in Assisi 

The most famous painting that is believed to be by Cimabue is the Madonna of Santa Trinita which is an altarpiece that was done for the Church of the Holy Trinity It is now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence He is also believed to have painted two large crucifixes which hung in the Church of St Domenic in Arezzo and the Church of the Holy Cross The crucifix of Santa Croce was ruined in a flood and is now in the churchs museum 

The biographer Giorgio Vasari wrote about Cimabues life 250 years after his death He wrote that one day Cimabue was walking in the country when he saw a little shepherd boy scratching a picture of a sheep onto a rock The drawing was so good that Cimabue went to the boys father and begged that he might take the boy as his apprentice and teach him to paint The boy was Giotto who became a very famous painter and who is thought of as the very first painter of the Italian Renaissance 

Pietro Cavallini was a painter who lived and worked in Rome in Italy in the Late Medieval period He may have also worked in Naples He is thought of as one of the greatest painters of his day but has never been as well known as Giotto from Florence who was alive at the same time This is probably because only two pictures by Cavallini still exist One of them is a mosaic in the Church of Santa Maria in Trastevere The other is a fresco in the nearby convent of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere 

The fresco at Santa Cecilias is a large picture of the Last Judgement with Jesus sitting between rows of saints Unfortunately the room which was quite tall had a new level added and the floor cut across the fresco It is in ruins but the parts that remain show that Cavallini was trying to make the figures that he painted look solid and three dimensional like the frescos of Ancient Rome Pietro Cavallini probably influenced the artists who travelled from Rome to work at the Basilica of St Francis of Assisi It is not known if he painted any of the frescos there

The Black Swallowtail has a wingspan of 67 to 10 cm The upper side of the males wings is black There are two rows of yellow spots along the edges of both wings There is a small area of blue on the bottom wing between the two rows of yellow spotsOn the bottom edge of the bottom wing there is a red spot with a small black dot in the center The upper side of the females wings is black There are two rows of light yellow spots along the edges of both wings These spots are smaller than the males There is a large area of blue on the bottom wing between these two rows The female also has the same red and black spot on the bottom wing as the male The female mimics the Pipevine Swallowtail The underside of the wings is the same in both sexes The top wing is black with two rows of yellow orange spots The bottom wing has two rows of orange spots with a blue area between them

The Ozark Swallowtail and the Black Swallowtail were once thought to be the same species Felix Sperling did an analysis of the Ozark Swallowtails DNA He suggested that even though the Ozark Swallowtail looks exactly like the Black Swallowtail it is actually more closely related to the Old World Swallowtail

In North Dakota and southern Manitoba the Black Swallowtail is thought to breed with the Old World Swallowtail These hybrids are called Kahli Swallowtails Kahli Swallowtails are either thought to be a separate species or a subspecies of the Black Swallowtail

The Desert Black Swallowtail is a subspecies of the Black Swallowtail It is found in southeastern California southern Nevada and western Arizona It is similar to the male Black Swallowtail but it has more yellow and the sexes look the same

There are many similar species in the Black Swallowtails range

The Pipevine Swallowtail is similar to the female Black Swallowtail On the upper side of its wings it does not have any yellow spots The bottom wing is a shiny dark blue It has one row of whitish spots in the middle of the bottom wing The underside of the bottom wing has only one row of orange spots

The Spicebush Swallowtail is similar to the female Black Swallowtail It is usually larger The upper side of its wings is black with one row of light greenish blue spots along the edges of both wings

The Ozark Swallowtail looks exactly like the Black Swallowtail It can only be separated by habitat and host plant choices It is found in woodlands The host plants are Meadow Parsnip and Yellow Pimpernal

The Old World Swallowtail has many different forms The form brucei is very similar to both sexes of the Black Swallowtail Form brucei is usually smaller The black dot in the red spot on the bottom wing is not centered

The Black Swallowtail ranges from southern Canada south to Florida and Costa Rica west to the Rocky Mountains and eastern Arizona south to Mexico and Peru

The Black Swallowtail likes open habitats It is found from sea level to high mountains It is found in fields meadows deserts marshes near lakes and streams farms lawns near cities near roads and gardens It is rarely found in forests or woodlands

Humans have greatly helped the Black Swallowtail They brought non native carrot species from Europe to North America The Black Swallowtail uses these plants as host plants Before humans cut down forests Black Swallowtail were rare They were only found in small prairies wetlands and openings in forests However in the northeast people are not farming as much as they used to This is making the Black Swallowtail become less common in this part of its range

The Black Swallowtail is seen from May to June in Canada It is seen from June to August in the Colorado Mountains In the eastern part of its range it is seen from April to October and from February to October in Florida In Arizona it is seen from February to November It has one brood in Canada and the Colorado Mountains It has 2 to 3 broods in the rest of its range

The Black Swallowtail flies very fast Its flight is much quicker than other swallowtails The Black Swallowtail flies closer to the ground than other swallowtails do In cold weather they will hold their abdomens above their wings This keeps them warm Usually Black Swallowtails live about 10 to 12 days Some however can live up to 35 to 40 days

Here is a list of food sources for the Black Swallowtail

Males will also come to damp soil and mud to feed on minerals and moisture This is called puddling

The Black Swallowtail goes through complete metamorphosis

The male forms a territory The territory is usually on the top of a hill The male will sit on high branches or other vegetation on the hill He will defend his territory from other male Black Swallowtails If other males come too close he will chase them away The female will fly to the top of the hill to look for a mate A successful courtship lasts for about 40 seconds An unsuccessful one lasts for about 100 seconds Mating lasts for about 45 minutes Females that do not want to mate will try to escape from males by flying high in the air and then quickly flying downward

Female Black Swallowtails fly close to the ground to look for host plants Females lay one egg per host plant The eggs are laid on the leaves and flowers The egg is yellow It later forms a red ring around the center It will also form a red top It will turn dark gray just before hatching It takes about 10 days to hatch In a lab test females laid a total of about 200 to 430 eggs They laid about 35 to 50 each day

The caterpillar will eat the leaves and flowers of the host plant It makes no nests The young caterpillar is black It has a white spot in the middle of its body This spot is called a saddle It mimics a bird dropping The older caterpillar is green It has black bands with orange spots in each of the bands The caterpillar has a special organ called an osmeterium It is an orange bad smelling organ It is shaped like a snakes tongue It is kept behind the inside of the head The caterpillar releases it to scare predators away The caterpillar will reach a length of 5 cm The Ozark Swallowtail caterpillar is similar to the Black Swallowtail caterpillar It is usually greener and the black bands are usually thinner

The chrysalis hangs upright There is a silk thread around the upper part of the chrysalis This thread is called a girdle The chrysalis is either brown or green The Black Swallowtail will hibernate as a chrysalis

In the 1960s Stephen Stills and Neil Young were members of another band called the Buffalo Springfield Crosby was a founding member of The Byrds and British born Graham Nash was a member of The Hollies Crosby was fired from the Byrds late in 1967 and the Buffalo Springfield disbanded the next year Nash went to California where the others lived and worked when the Hollies visited there in 1968 Nash and Crosby had met earlier in England and got back in touch in California Crosby and Stills had worked together on two songs called Wooden Ships and You Dont Have To Cry Performing You Dont Have To Cry for Nash he joined in on harmonies and the three noticed they had a special sound together Nash moved to California and the three formed a band They signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records

Stills and Crosby were free to work together and record for Atlantic but Nash still belonged to the Hollies who had a contract with Epic Records A trade was worked out between Atlantic and Epic In exchange for losing Nash Epic Records got to sign up another Atlantic band Poco formed by Richie Furay from the Buffalo Springfield

CSNs first album was released in the spring of 1969 and quickly became a hit The cover showed Crosby Stills and Nash sitting on a couch outside an abandoned house Stephen Stills had played most of the instruments on the album with Dallas Taylor playing drums This worked fine for recordings but not for live appearances More musicians were needed A keyboardist and bass guitarist were hired

Atlantic Records president Ahmet Ertegun suggested Neil Young who now had his own band called Crazy Horse as another guitarist for the group Stills wasnt sure if Young would work out but gave him a chance He fit in so well that CSN made him a full time member and added his name to theirs Young was able to both play with CSN and keep his own place with Crazy Horse Their second show as a broken wikt linkquartetquartet was at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969 They toured for the next several months and released a second album Dj Vu early the next year They made another performing tour to support the album which was also a huge hit

The group was very successful but its members had many different ideas and could not always work well together Tension grew between them and they nearly disbanded Young left to return to Crazy Horse and tour with them on his own Each of the four recorded a solo album during 1971 though and each album became a hit Nash and Crosby toured together and Stills formed another band called Manassas with Chris Hillman of the Byrds Another round of solo and duo albums was released during 1972 with Youngs Harvest and its single Heart Of Gold becoming the biggest hits Albums by the other members were not as successful though they still sold well Crosby and Nash got along very well and worked together as a broken wikt linkduoduo while Stills joined Young and Crazy Horse to record Youngs War Song Crosby also rejoined the Byrds but the album they recorded together Byrds was not a hit

The four tried to reunite in Hawaii during 1973 to make a new album Human Highway but things did not work out Finally the next year they reformed and started another tour with a compilation album So Far issued to give them something new to promote Their shows ran longer than three hours and there was sometimes trouble Stills was abusing cocaine and it made him hard to get along with The same old tensions also came back A new CSNY project was dashed when Stills and Young erased Crosby and Nashs vocals from the master tapes Crosby and Nash went off on their own Stills and Young formed The StillsYoung Band and released an album but even that did not work out

Stills and Young toured together during 1975 and 1976 In July 1976 Young left suddenly between shows sending Stills a telegram that expressed his unhappiness and told Stills to Eat a peach Stills and Young each had to complete tour dates separately Meanwhile Nash and Crosby kept recording and performing together They also sang background vocals for other artists including James Taylor and Joni Mitchell

During one of their shows Crosby and Nash were joined onstage by Stills to perform Teach Your Children The three worked things out and reformed their trio CSN was released in 1977 and Just A Song Before I Go became a new hit single

In the next years the trio worked together off and on and also as solo artists Youngs music had become very different from that of the other band members and he mostly worked with Crazy Horse but he did broken wikt linkcollaboratecollaborate now and then with CSN Crosby had his own cocaine problems during the 1980s and ended up serving a prison sentence He was able to stop abusing cocaine as Stills had earlier CSNs later songs included Wasted On The Way Nash rejoined the Hollies for a reunion album in 1984 and played shows with them but the reunion was not a success

CSN played in Berlin Germany at the time the Berlin Wall was torn down at the end of the 1980s They also played shows during the 1990s and early 2000s and their 2000 tour was called the CSNY2K tour They recorded other albums but they were not nearly the hits their early ones had been and they worked with outside writers instead of writing all their own songs Atlantic Records cancelled their contract

Crosby Stills and Nash still work together and apart with Crosby and Nash having the longest and strongest partnership Neil Young continues on as a solo artist with and without Crazy Horse exploring many different kinds of music

Cognate is a word derived from the same root as another word Cognates are words that have a common origin They may occur in a language or in a group of languages

Example One

In reading Churchills History of the English Speaking Peoples it would be well to keep in mind what George Bernard Shaw says England and America are two countries divided by a common language

Speakers of British English and American English face this problem of meeting false friends

As a rule cognates have the same meaning but when they do not they are called false friends

Example one Spanish actual and English actual are cognates because they have the same root but they are false friends because Spanish actual means of the present moment while English actual means real

Example two Spanish alias and English alias are cognates because they have the same root but they are false friends because Spanish alias means known also as while English alias means having the false name of

Example three German hell Norwegian hell and English hell In German hell means light and in Norwegian it means luck while in English it means hell

Sometimes two words look alike and it appears that they are cognates but they are not because they are not derived from the same root

Example one In the English language the word light is not a cognate of the word light because they are not derived from the same root

Example two The German word haben and the English word have mean the same thing and they appear to be cognates but they are not simply because they are not derived from the same root

There is a strict set of rules on how the forecast is written and it has a limit of 370 words It is always said in the same way and is around 9 minutes long The language of the forecast is hard to understand unless the listener understands how the rules work For example cquote2Dover Wight Portland Plymouth four or five increasing six soon rain or slight drizzle good People listening to the forecast who know the protocol can understand it as In the English Channel there are strong winds followed by a stronger wind in less than twelve hours time with some light rain but good visibility The numbers refer to the Beaufort Scale of wind strength Imminent means within 6 hours soon between 6 and 12 and later meaning after 12 hours There are lots of other jargon used in the Shipping Forecast

Polarization describes the direction of the electric field of light or any electromagnetic wave The electric field usually does not point in the direction the light is traveling so it is perpendicular to the direction the wave travels This is not always the case

Linear circular and elliptical polarizations are three specific types of TEM polarization They can not always be used For instance measuring the field very close to an antenna changes things The fields close to an antenna are not really TEM so the following polarizations are not really applicable Far away from an antenna the fields are TEM so these can be used They are easy to imagine if you look from where the wave is coming from or going towards

Dyer was born in Murree in British India now in Pakistan He spent his childhood in Shimla and received his early education at the Bishop Cotton School in Shimla He was born just six years after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 The rebellion was a war that had been fought by some Indians to end British rule It had been defeated by the British but had created segregation suspicion and fear between the British and the Indians Although he had been born after the rebellion had ended the effects had affected Dyers life

Dyer went to Midleton College County Cork between 1875 and 1881 In 1885 after his time at the Royal Military College Sandhurst he joined the Queens Royal Regiment as a Lieutenant and served in riot control duties in Belfast and the Third Burmese War He then joined the British Indian Army First joining the Bengal Staff Corps as a Lieutenant in 1887 and being part of the 39th Bengal Infantry and then joining the 29th Punjabis

During his time with the 29th Punjabis he fought in the Black Mountain campaign of 1888 the relief of Chitral in 1895 And was promoted to Captain in 1896 In 1901 he became Deputy Assistant Adjutant General and then fought in the Mahsud blockade between 1901 and 1902

Dyer then joined the 25th Punjabis where he served in the Zakha Khel Expedition He was in charge of the 25th Punjabis in India and Hong Kong and was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1910

In 1919 about a month after the Amritsar killings in the Third Anglo Afghan War his Brigade relieved the garrison of Thal He retired on 17 July 1920 having become a Colonel

In 1919 the British population of Punjab feared a plot by the Indians to overthrow British rule There was talk of mutiny and of death threats to Europeans Sir Michael ODwyer the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab decided to deport Indians from Punjab who were leading protests against the British

One person who was targeted was Dr Satyapal who was in the Army Medical Services during World War I He was in favour of non violent civil disobedience and was stopped from speaking in public Another person was Dr Kitchlew a Muslim barrister who wanted political change and was non violent The Deputy Commissioner Miles Irving did not know much about these two people Both men were arrested because Irving suspected them of trying to rebel against the British

Their arrest led to demonstrations by the people of Punjab Crowds gathered in all public places demanding a release of the two men Army troops panicked and opened fire on a bridge across a railway line causing several deaths This resulted in a mob which returned to the city centre More army troops arrived to stop more demonstrations

The mobs sought out Europeans in the city On April 9 1919 Miss Marcella Sherwood who worked at the Mission Day School for Girls was bicycling round the city to close her schools She was attacked by the mob in a narrow street and was beaten and left wounded She was rescued by local Indians who hid her from the mob and moved her to the fort This attack on a lady angered Dyer who was in command of troops in Jullundur

Brigadier Dyer is infamous for the orders which he gave on April 13 1919 in Amritsar It was under his command that 90 troops made up of 25 Gurkhas 25 Pathans and Baluch all armed with 303 Lee Enfield rifles and the Gurkhas who were also armed with khukris opened fire on a gathering of unarmed civilians including women and children gathered at the Jallianwalla Bagh in what came to be later known as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre

The civilians had arrived at Jallianwala Bagh to join the yearly Baisakhi celebrations which are both a religious as well as a cultural festival of the Punjabis The Bagh had an area of 67 acres and had walls all around The walls had ever small entrances which only a few people could go through

Dyer ordered the troops to fire directly at the crowd of people they kept shooting until they ran out of bullets The shooting lasted for about 10 minutes

During the ten minutes of shooting Dyer kept checking how the troops were shooting He ordered the soldiers to shoot where most of the people were He did this not because the crowd was slow to leave but because he wanted to punish them for being there 

Some of the soldiers at first fired in the air instead of at the people When they did this General Dyer shouted Fire low What have you been brought here for 

Later Dyers himself was to admit that the crowd was not given any warning to leave He said he did not feel sorry for ordering his troops to fire

The British army reported 379 dead say it over 1000 dead According to a Home Political Deposit report the number was over 1000 with more than 1200 wounded Dr Smith a British civil surgeon at Amritsar said there were over 1800 casualties Because of the large numbers of people killed and injured general Dyer became known as The Butcher of Amritsar in India 

Brigadier Dyer sent soldiers to the area where Miss Marcella Sherwood was beaten He ordered that any Indians wishing to travel through the street had to crawl on all fours This order also included the people who had rescued her

Because of this order the street was closed the houses had no back doors and the people could not go out without climbing down from their roofs No doctor or supplier was allowed in resulting in the sick being untended The order was enforced by a flogging booth set up in the middle of the street 

After the Amritsar massacre Dyers health failed and in 1921 he suffered paralysis He never recovered He died at Long Ashton near Bristol on July 23 1927

The Morning Post remembered him in articles titled The Man Who Saved India and He did his Duty The Westminster Gazette wrote a contrary opinion No British action during the whole course of our history in India has struck a severer blow to Indian faith in British justice than the massacre at Amritsar and the attitude of official Anglo India to it

Progressive Fighting Systems is an organization and a system of combat thought up by Paul Vunak who had been Dan Inosantos student who had been Bruce Lees main student Inside the techniques included in this system of combat are bitting striking with the head and fighting on the ground

The PFS is considered a system much efficient in street combats giving priority to the blows with head blows with knee blows with elbow to the trapping and to techniques as the Straight Blast These techniques form the base of that what is the RAT program the system of combat taught to the American special forces as the Navy Seal developped by Vunak to request of that units

Vunak has always claimed that the JKD doesnt teach better techniques but develops a combat efficient and better features The goal is flow from one technique to other and from one art to other till when the range or the situation doesnt change demanding an other technique or maybe of an other martial art A special quality of the PFS is also the usage of safety equipment because of the trainings which are called crash test with test of aggressions in full contact

Pilot whales are two types of oceanic dolphins whose scientific name is Globicephala The two types of pilot whales are the Long finned Pilot Whale and the Short finned Pilot Whale Their behaviour resembles that of the larger whales more than that of dolphins 

The two look similar at sea and are usually just known simply as Pilot Whales or Caldern in Spanish They and other large dolphins are also known as blackfish

The didgeridoo is an Australian Aboriginal wind musical instrument They were used by the Yolgnu people of Arnhem Land They are usually played sitting down as they can be quite long anywhere from convert1to3mft0abbron long Most are around convert12mft0abbron long The longer the instrument the lower the pitch or key of the instrument They are a hollow wooden tube which can be either cylindrical or conical in shape It is best described as being a wooden trumpet or drone Musicologists say it is a brass aerophone It shows a didgeridoo player and two singers playing in a ceremony

Didgeridoo is said to be an onomatopoetic word of Western invention not an Aboriginal word It has also been said that it may come from the Irish words ddaire or didire This means trumpeter constant smoker puffer long necked person eavesdropper hummer crooner and dubh meaning black However this theory is not widely accepted

The earliest examples of the word in print was in a 1919 issue of Smiths Weekly where it was called an infernal didjerry which produced but one sound  didjerry didjerry didjerry and so on ad infinitum It was also used the 1919 Australian National Dictionary The Bulletin in 1924 and the writings of Herbert Basedow in 1926 There are more than 45 names for this instrument among the Aboriginal people of northern Australia including Yirdaki Yirdaki also sometimes spelt yidaki is for the instrument made and used by the Yolngu people of north east Arnhem Land 

Aboriginal didgeridoos are made in the traditional communities in Northern Australia or by makers who travel to Central and Northern Australia to get the materials They are usually made from hardwoods usually eucalyptus species that are native to the area Sometimes a native bamboo such as Bambusa arnhemica or pandanus is used The main trunk of the tree is used though a big branch may be used instead Aboriginal makers spend a lot of time looking for a tree that has been hollowed out by termites If the hollow is too big or too small it will make a poor quality instrument

When a tree is found and cut down the part of trunk or branch that will be made into a didgeridoo is cut out The bark is taken off the ends are trimmed and there is some shaping of the outside It may be painted or left natural A rim of beeswax may be put on to the mouthpiece end Traditional instruments made by Aboriginals in Arnhem Land are sometimes fitted with a sugarbag mouthpiece This is black beeswax from wild bees and has a its own special smell

Didgeridoos can also be made from PVC pipes non native hard woods fiberglass metal agave clay hemp and even carbon fiber These didgeridoos usually have an upper inside diameter of around 125 down to a bell end of anywhere between two to eight inches and have a length made to the needed key The mouthpiece can be made of beeswax hardwood or simply sanded and sized by the craftsman In PVC rubber stopper with a hole cut into it can be used

Modern didgeridoo designs are different from the traditional Australian Aboriginal didgeridoo They are recognized as being a separate instrument Didgeridoo design changes started in the late 20th century using new materials and different shapes

The didgeridoo is played with continuously vibrating lips to make the drone while using a special way of breathing called circular breathing This means a player breathes in through the nose at the same time as pushing stored air out of the mouth using the tongue and cheeks A skilled player can refill the air in their lungs and with practice can keep a note playing for as long as desired There are recordings of modern didgeridoo players playing wihout stopping for more than 40 minutes Mark Atkins on Didgeridoo Concerto plays for over 50 minutes continuously 

The rhythm of the circular breathing gives the instrument its readily recognizable sound Other changes in the didgeridoos sound can be made by adding vocal sounds to the drone Most of the sounds are related to the sounds of Australian animals such as the dingo or the kookaburra To make these sounds the players simply have to use their voice to make the sounds of the animals whilst continuing to blow air through the instrument The results range from very high pitched sounds to very low sounds Adding vocal sounds increases the complexity of the playing

Anthony Baines wrote that the didgeridoo is like an aural kaleidoscope of timbres He also said that the virtuoso skills used by the best performers were unlike those needed on any other instrument

The didgeridoo was mainly played for ceremonial dancing and singing It was also common for didgeridoos to be played for entertainment outside of ceremonial life In northern Australia the didgeridoo is still a very important as it plays for singers and dancers in surviving cultural ceremonies Today most didgeridoo playing is for entertainment in both Indigenous Australian communities and elsewhere around the world

Pair sticks sometimes called clapsticks or bilma set the beat for the songs during ceremonies The rhythm of the didgeridoo and the beat of the clapsticks use patterns that have been handed down for many generations Traditionally only men play the didgeridoo and sing during ceremonies but both men and women may dance There were female didgeridoo players but they did not play in ceremonies and it was not encouraged Linda Barwick an ethnomusicologist says that traditionally women have not played the didgeridoo in ceremony but in informal situations there is no prohibition in the Dreaming Law On September 3 2008 the publisher Harper Collins issued a public apology for its book The Daring Book for Girls scheduled to be published in October which openly encouraged girls to play the instrument

The didgeridoo is now often used as an instrument in the experimental and avant garde music scene Industrial music bands like Test Department used sounds from this instrument in their performances linking ecology to industry influenced by ethnic music and culture

It has also been an instrument used for the fusion of tribal rhythms with a black metal sound A music project called Naakhum used the paganism of the Australian tribes and many others as an approach

Most didgeridoos made today are for souvenir purposes It is common to find didgeridoos made of non native timbers decorated incorrectly by non indigenous artists with colourful designs or copied dot patterns These decorations do not use traditional dreamtime stories or designs These didgeridoos also often vary widely in size and shape many being thinner and straighter As a result of the inadequate wood types shapes and lengths souvenir didgeridoos can rarely be used as musical instruments

Decoration of souvenir didgeridoos is often seen by Aboriginal communities as offensive inappropriate inadequate inaccurate and in many cases misleading The copying of traditional artwork is also used to sell these didgeridoos to unsuspecting tourists

A 2005 study in the British Medical Journal found that learning and playing the didgeridoo helped reduce snoring and sleep apnea It does this by making muscles in the upper airway stronger and this helps them stay open during sleep This strengthening happens after the player has learned the circular breathing technique

The Medes were an ancient Iranian people who lived in the northwestern portions of present day Iran This area was known in Greek as Media or Medea They entered this region with the first wave of Iranian tribes in the late second millennium BC

By the 6th century BC the Medes were able to make their own empire It stretched from southern shore of the Black Sea and Aran province to north and central Asia Afghanistan and Pakistan The Medes had many tributary states including the Persians who eventually took over the Median empire as part of the Achaemenid Persian Empire

The Medes are credited with the foundation of the first Iranian empire the largest of its day until Cyrus the Great established a unified Iranian empire of the Medes and Persians often referred to as the Achaemenid Empire

Modern scholars question whether a Median empire even existed It is argued that even if it existed it must have been just a political alliance among highland neighbors of the Assyrians The alliance might include Armenia in southeastern Anatolia Sagartians in modern northern Iraq and the actual Medians in the area between what is today Hamadan Kirmanshah in cental Zagros Neither cuneiform sources archaeological evidence or biblical accounts support Herodotus who claimed there really was a Median empire

Strabo mentions the affinity of Mede with other Iranian languages in his Geography

Words probably of Mede origin appear in various other Iranian dialects including Old Persian For example Herodotus mentions the word Spaka still found in some Iranic languages

Foreplay is the name for a number of things people do before they have sex These things do not need to be directly related to having sex Rather they are done to sexually arouse people to make them want each other more Not all of these acts are physical some can also be psychological Common things done in foreplay include kissing touching each other hugging and stimulating the others erogenous zones 

Foreplay has a well defined function  it lowers inhibitions and makes people feel better at ease

Foreplay has been mentioned in historic works The Ancient Indian work Kama Sutra mentions different types of embracing kissing and marking with nails and teeth It also mentions BDSM activities such as slapping and moaning as play

Based on age religious and political background what people do as foreplay can be quite different Many people think that women demand more foreplay and require more time to become aroused Recent scientific research has show that this is false though Scientists from McGill University Health Centre in Montreal Canada used the method of thermal imaging to record baseline temperature change in the genital area as the definition of the time necessary for sexual arousal Researchers studied the time required for an individual to reach the peak of sexual arousal and concluded that on average women and men spend almost the same time for sexual arousal around 10 minutes

And did those feet in ancient time is a short poem by William Blake  It comes in the introduction to a long poem called Milton a Poem Today it is best known as the hymn Jerusalem sung to music written by C Hubert H Parry in 1916 more than a century after Blake had written the poem 

There is a legend that the young Jesus went to England with his uncle Joseph of Arimathea to England and visited Glastonbury The poem connects this legend to an idea in the Book of Revelation describing a Second Coming in which Jesus builds a new Jerusalem Some Christians thought that a new Jerusalem would be like Heaven somewhere of love and peace The poem asks if Jesus visited England and if Heaven was created in England Blake lived in the time of the early Industrial Revolution when there was a lot of poverty and misery Many people think the dark Satanic mills were the factories where many people worked in horrible conditions This contrasts with the country with its beauty and clean air Englands green and pleasant Land The second half of Blakes poem says people should try to establish Jerusalem once more

Blakes poem was not very well known during the 19th century but in 1916 a collection of poems was published which included Jerusalem Britain was fighting a terrible war and so the people needed some strong patriotic music to give them courage Robert Bridges the Poet Laureate asked Parry to put it to music at a Fight for Right campaign meeting in Londons Queens Hall He wanted Parry to write a tune that the audience would be able to sing easily At first Parry wanted verse one to be sung by a solo female voice but the version sung nowadays is the arrangement for orchestra made in 1922 by Sir Edward Elgar When King George V heard it for the first time he said that he preferred Jerusalem to God Save the King the National Anthem 

England does not have an official anthem and so the British National Anthem God Save the Queen is used for national occasions for example before English international football matches or at the Last Night of the Proms The song is also the unofficial anthem of the British Womens Institute It is often sung as a hymn in churches although people in some churches think it is not a hymn It is also sung in many schools

Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry 1st Baronet was an English composer He was born at a time when England was not a very musical country He started to change this composing music which was to be a great influence other English composers such as Elgar and Vaughan Williams Parry wrote a great deal of music but by far the best known piece he wrote is the song Jerusalem Another piece which is often sung is the anthem I was glad written for the coronation of Edward VII

Parry was born into a wealthy family He went to school in Eton and got his music degree while he was still there He then went to Oxford to study He learned from the English born composer Henry Hugo Pierson in Stuttgart and with William Sterndale Bennett and the pianist Edward Dannreuther in London He started to compose a lot of chamber music which was first performed at Dannreuthers house He became famous in 1880 when Dannreuther played his piano concerto and his choral work Prometheus Unbound was performed at the Gloucester Festival Other choirs started to ask him to write music for them One of his best choral pieces was the ode Blest Pair of Sirens Other choral works include Ode on Saint Cecilias Day the oratorios Judith and Job Judith includes a tune which became a well loved hymn tune called Repton sung in churches to the words Dear Lord and Father of Mankind

His orchestral works from this period include four symphonies a set of Symphonic Variations in E minor the Overture to an Unwritten Tragedy and the Elegy for Brahms He also wrote for the Greek play The Birds by Aristophanes

As Parry became more famous he got many invitations to important jobs He started teaching at the Royal College of Music in 1884 and became its director in 1894 a post he held until his death In 1900 he succeeded John Stainer as professor of music at Oxford University  In 1908 his doctor advised him to resign from his Oxford job

During the last decade of his life he wrote some of his best works including the Symphonic Fantasia 1912 the Ode on the Nativity Jerusalem and the Songs of Farewell which includes the song My Soul there is a Country These were songs about the needless suffering in the war

Parry had a lot of influence on English music in the 20th century This was not just because of his compositions but also through his teaching and his writings about music The composers he liked best and who influenced his style were Bach and Brahms His music is firmly tonal and Elgar and Vaughan Williams learned a lot from studying his music

Parry was a man who always liked to help people and so he took on a great deal of work which did not do his health much good When he had free time he enjoyed driving fast cars and sailing

He was made a knight and the first Baronet of Highnam in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1902

The house in Richmond Hill Bournemouth where he was born is marked with a blue plaque

In 1904 finally the Brandt brothers died and the company came into the hands of their children In the following years Omega became a highly prestigious watch manufacturer In 1925 Omega started to work with Tissot another watch manufacturer

Today Omega belongs to the Swatch Group

Globi is one of the most famous cartoon figures in the Swiss German part of Switzerland It was created in 1932 by Globus in a promotion campaign It is a blue human like parrot with a black beret and trousers in black and red It was so much liked by the children in Switzerland that it got published independently in 1944 There are a lot of Globi cartoon books and tapes in Switzerland today Its appearance has changed several times since his development

Globi was created in 1932 by the Globusstore as a media vehicle for children They especially wanted to address Globi to children First the figure was named Kimbukku But because the habitants of the canton of Bale named the warehouse Globus Globi they thought that this name might be nicer than Kimbukku The figure was immediately liked by the young customers First Globi appeared as a comic strip in the magazine der Globi In 1935 the first book Globi the Childfriend appeared This book was sold over a million times But it was only really successful in Switzerland Until today 76 illustrated classic books have been published The Globi books were always successful but In the 70s they were criticised because of racism sexism and violence in books of the 40s and 50s Today Globi is seen as politically correct It started to be interested in ecology and animal protection and became more of a role model For example in a newer volume Globi accompanies the little rhino Najma to Africa The readerschildren learn about the problematic times of life in the savanne of Africa for rhinos There was also a film with Globi in the cinemas in 2005

Because of the big success of Globi the costs for the warehouse became too big Because of this the Globi Publisher AG was founded in 1944 Since 1 January 2007 the Globi Publisher AG has been owned by Orell Fssli Publisher The Publisher is actually active in the Swiss market Besides a lot of books they sell Globi dishes cutlery watches and alarm bells plushglobis drapery school and holiday utilities lamps card games and diverse food articles in the Globi Publisher Added to this different tourist attractions like a Globi Hotel a trail and a bus In December 2008 a Globi winterpark was built in Engelberg In addition to Globi Papa Moll and Glbeli exist Yearly over 80000 Globi Classic Books 40000 other Globi books between 25000 and 30000 Papa Moll books and 100000 cassettes have been sold

Hi I wish to make a note here that while I agree basically with the nomination of this article to Good Article Status there are some things which need changing on it or pages creating explaining what these things are Many users expecting simple English are going to have difficulty working out what an arondissement is without a page explaining it likewise with rgions and dpartements as has been already mentioned and the description of Corsica as a collectivit territoriale 

Some of the language requires simplification even though it is in English already Monarchy regime metropolitan moralists prolific varied and sovereignty are just some of those needing doing 

Also some of the words have more than one meaning and these need disambiguating Words like Suspended Executed and influenced

If these issues can be addressed I believe this article stands a good chance of making it to GA 

Iceflow 2245 10 November 2008

In addition to the language issues note above by Iceflow there are issues with referencing  I think we need to have more references which link to current data The section on religion for example has assertions with no citations and a reference to a 2005 poll leads to a dead link  Matilda 2319 10 November 2008

Thats all I found I think with a bit more touching up itll be pretty close to VGA Giggy 0658 31 August 2008

Im not sure hat happened to the PGA voting of this article I think it was voted up before but it is not a GA I would like to re vote this article seems god but a few red links so it cant be a VGA Minor Contributer 0957 11 August 2008 It was listed as a proposed good article but was then removed from it again based on the following

The sentence structure throught the article tends to be long and flowing rather than short and precise Too many of them need to be split into separate sentences Also what is a tropical storm the term is used in the first sentence but not linkeddefined Tropical Depression Eight is the same system as Tropical Storm Ingrid The name should be bolded  Creol 0747 6 November 2008

I put this up before but it got no votes and no interest so now im putting up again Did loads of work on it think its good enough for GA FSM Noodly 1743 5 October 2008

Premature birth is when a baby is born before the regular end of the pregnancy In humans a pregnancy normally lasts for 266 days Most of the time this is calculated from the last menstrual period This increases the normal length to 280 days Doctors see babies which are born before the 37th week as premature Such babies are called premies In the United States about 12 percent of the babies are born prematurely that is about 1 in 8 In 2003 there were over 490000 such births Worldwide rates of prematurity are more difficult to obtain In developing regions there is often no professional medical care for these babies This makes it difficult to tell how far along the pregnancy really was For this reason the World Health Organization tracks rates of low birth weight instead In 2000 this occurred in 165 percent of births in less developed regions It is estimated that one third of these low birth weight deliveries are due to premature delivery

The risk of having a problem is higher in shorter pregnancies Babies born prematurely die more often in their first year of life that others Most die in their first month of life which is called neonatal mortality Worldwide prematurity accounts for 10 of neonatal mortality or around 500000 deaths per year In the US where many infections and other causes of neonatal death have been markedly reduced prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal mortality at 25 Prematurely born infants are also at greater risk for developing serious health problems such as cerebral palsy chronic lung disease gastrointestinal problems mental retardation vision or hearing loss and are more susceptible to developing depression as teenagers

There are several known risk factors for prematurity but nearly half of all premature births have no known cause When conditions permit doctors may attempt to stop premature labor so that the pregnancy can have a chance to continue to full term This will increase the babys chances of health and survival However there is currently no reliable means to stop or prevent preterm labor in all cases In fact the rate of preterm births in the United States has increased 30 in the past two decades

In developed countries hospitals usually have special facilities for prematurely born infants These are usually called Neonatal Intensive Care Unit In the NICU premature babies are kept under radiant warmers or in incubators which are bassinets enclosed in plastic with climate control equipment designed to keep them warm and limit their exposure to germs Modern neonatal intensive care involves sophisticated measurement of temperature respiration heart function oxygen supply and brain activity Treatments may include fluids and nutrition through intravenous catheters oxygen supplementation breathing support and medications In developing countries where advanced equipment and even electricity may not be available or reliable simple measures such as kangaroo care encouraging breastfeeding and basic infection control measures can significantly reduce preterm morbidity and mortality

Ex premies is the term given to preterm infants born before the normal 37 weeks gestation

The earliest time in the pregnancy where the infant has at least a 50 chance of survival is called the limit of viability As NICU care has improved over the last 40 years viability has been reduced to approximately 24 weeks Rare survivors have been documented as early as 21 weeks but this date is controversial because in this case the pregnancy was measured from the date of conception rather than the date of her mothers last menstrual period This makes gestation appear 2 weeks less than if calculated by the more common method As risk of brain damage and developmental delay is significant at that threshold even if the infant survives there are ethical controversies over the aggressiveness of the care given to such infants The limit of viability has also become a factor in the abortion debate

The nicotine in cigarettes and other tobacco products makes people dependent When they quit they will get withdrawal symptoms Nicotine replacement therapy is there to reduce the dependency symptoms This is usually done by delivering nicotine in other ways Common methods include nicotine patches and chewing gums with nicotine in them

Cigarettes are responsible for the deaths of about 5 million people each year These people are not killed by the nicotine in the cigarette but by other substances in tobacco smoke such as carbon monoxide and tars 

NRT delivers nicotine to the smokers brain in a much slower way than cigarettes do It helps to damp down the urges to smoke that most smokers have in the early days and weeks after quitting rather than remove them totally It gives the smoker the chance to break smoking cues in their daily lives and might provide a more comfortable exit from the smoking habit NRT however is best used with some form of support ideally from someone who knows something about smoking cessation

In 2005 the Committee on the Safety of Medicines recommended that NRT be given to pregnant smokers and also to adolescent smokersFactdateApril 2009 

Findings from a recent Cochrane review of controlled trials testing NRT products indicated that smokers using NRT were 15 to 2 times more likely to be abstinent from smoking at followup than those in the placebo or control treatment condition 

Nicotine is the addictive drug in tobacco products so there is a chance when using NRT products to become addicted to those products in place of the tobacco habit Generally it is argued that NRT products are safer then smoking tobacco NRT products are generally expensive sometimes even more so then cigarettes so a minority of people may become addicted to the NRT product and turn back to tobacco products to save money

An electronic cigarette is an electronic item used instead of cigarettes It gives a little nicotine when you breathe through it

The electronic cigarette gives nicotine propylene glycol and sometimes flavours or smells It was invented in China

The electronic cigarette cannot be classed as an NRT as no recognized tests or studies have taken place Furthermore WHO has advised that any manufacturer or seller who is marketing the electronic cigarette as an NRT should halt unproven therapy claims Currently most sellers who adhere to this guideline are marketing the device as a tobacco alternative

Metadata is data about data that is information about other information This is often useful Libraries usually group books by subject In that context the metadata about the book is the subject it is classified under Digital cameras allow people to take pictures In that context the data is the picture taken and the metadata is information about the picture taken like when where or how it was taken For example the photographic exposure details are also metadata about a picture taken by a digital camera

Failure rate is the frequency with which an engineered system or component fails Usually it is expressed in a number of failures per time period like failures per hour It is often written as the Greek letter and is important in reliability theory In practice the closely related Mean Time Between Failures is more commonly expressed and used for high quality components or systems

Failure rate is usually time dependent and an intuitive corollary is that the rate changes over time versus the expected life cycle of a system For example as an automobile grows older the failure rate in its fifth year of service may be many times greater than its failure rate during its first year of serviceone simply does not expect to replace an exhaust pipe overhaul the brakes or have major transmission problems in a new vehicle  Mean Time Between Failures is closely related to failure rate In the special case when the likelihood of failure remains constant with respect to time and ignoring the time to recover from failure failure rate is simply the inverse of the Mean Time Between Failures MTBF is an important specification parameter in all aspects of high importance engineering designsuch as naval architecture aerospace engineering automotive design etcin short any task where failure in a key part or of the whole of a system needs be minimized and severely curtailed particularly where lives might be lost if such factors are not taken into account These factors account for many safety and maintenance practices in engineering and industry practices and government regulations such as how often certain inspections and overhauls are required on an aircraft

A similar ratio used in the transport industries especially in railways and trucking is Mean Distance Between Failure a variation which attempts to correlate actual loaded distances to similar reliability needs and practices 

Failure rates are important factors in insurance business and regulation practices as well as fundamental to design of safe systems throughout a national or international economy

The Daily Record is a Scottish newspaper printed in Glasgow For many years it had been the best selling daily paper in Scotland with average sales of 363411 as of April 2008 

The Daily Mirror is a British newspaper It was founded on 2 November 1903

The Daily Mirror was launched on 2 November 1903 by Alfred Harmsworth as a newspaper for women run by women Hence the name he said I intend it to be really a mirror of feminine life as well on its grave as on its lighter sidesto be entertaining without being frivolous and serious without being dull and also invited men to read it It cost one penny

It was not an immediate success In 1904 he decided to turn it into a pictore newspaper changing the masthead to The Daily Illustrated Mirror and made Hamilton Fyfe editor who then fired all the women journalists This name ran from 26 January to 27 April 1904 then reverted to The Daily Mirror The first issue did not have advertisements on the front page as previously but instead news text and engraved pictures with the promise of photographs inside Two days later the price was dropped to one halfpenny and to the masthead was added A paper for men and women This combination was more successful by issue 92 the guaranteed circulation was 120000 copies and by issue 269 it had grown to 200000

Harmsworth sold the newspaper to his brother Harold Harmsworth in 1913 In 1917 the price was increased to one penny Circulation continued to grow in 1919 some issues sold more than 1 million copies a day making it the largest daily picture paper

By the mid 1930s the Mirror was struggling it and the Mail were the main casualties of the early 1930s circulation war that saw the Daily Herald and the Daily Express establish circulations of more than two million and Rothermere decided to sell his shares in it 

In the late 1930s the paper moved from being a conservative middle class newspaper into a left wing paper for the working class The Mirror was the first UK paper to adopt the look of the New York tabloids By 1939 it was selling 14 million copies a day

It was threatened with closure in World War II because Churchill thought a cartoon made fun of the navy The cartoon showed a sailor clinging to a piece of wreckage It attacked the waste of petrol and other goods that sailors were trying to bring across the Atlantic and avoid being killed by German submarines

The Mirrors mass working class readership had made it the United Kingdoms best selling daily tabloid newspaper In 1960 it bought the Daily Herald when it bought Odhams in one of a series of takeovers which created the International Publishing Corporation The Mirror management did not want the Herald competing with the Mirror for readers and in 1964 relaunched it as a mid market paper now named the Sun When it failed to win readers the Sun was sold to Rupert Murdoch who immediately relaunched it as a more populist and sensationalist tabloid as a direct competitor to the Mirror In 1978 The Sun overtook the Mirror in circulation and in 1984 the Mirror was sold to Robert Maxwell 

After Maxwells death in 1991 the Mirror went through a protracted crisis before merging with the regional newspaper group Trinity to form Trinity Mirror in 1999 In recent years the papers circulation has also been overtaken by that of the Daily Mail

The Daily and Sunday Mirror are now printed at Watford and Oldham by Trinity Mirror

In 2002 the Mirror changed its masthead logo from red to black because the term red top is a name for a sensationalist mass market tabloid Sometimes it was blue On 6 April 2005 the red top came back 

Under then editor Piers Morgan it opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq and ran many front pages critical of the war It also gave financial support to the 15 February 2003 anti war protest paying for a large screen and providing thousands of placards

The Mirrors front page on 4 November 2004 after the re election of George W Bush as US President read How can 59054087 people be so DUMB It gave a list of states and their average IQ showing the Bush states all below average intelligence and all Kerry states at or above average intelligence The source for this table was The Economist though it was a hoax Richard Wallace became editor in 2004

Modern database systems are governed by things about transactions called the ACID principle In that context several operations can be grouped into what is called a transaction From the outside there are two points in time before the transaction and after the transaction If one operation of this transaction fails the whole transaction will In other words Either all the operations are done or none is 

Reed Solomon error correction is an error correcting code It works by oversampling a polynomial constructed from the data The polynomial is evaluated at several points and these values are sent or recorded Sampling the polynomial more often than is necessary makes the polynomial over determined As long as it receives many of the points correctly the receiver can recover the original polynomial even in the presence of a few bad points 

Reed Solomon codes are used in many different kinds of commercial applications for example in CDs DVDs and Blu ray Discs in data transmission technologies such as DSL WiMAX and broadcast systems such as DVB and ATSC

Reed Solomon codes are block codes This means that a fixed block of input data is processed into a fixed block of output data In the case of the most commonly used R S code 223 Reed Solomon input symbols are encoded into 255 output symbols

The Reed Solomon code like the convolutional code is a transparent code This means that if the channel symbols have been inverted somewhere along the line the decoders will still operate The result will be the complement of the original data However the Reed Solomon code loses its transparency if virtual zero fill is used For this reason it is mandatory that the sense of the data be resolved before Reed Solomon decoding

In the case of the Voyager program R S codes reach near optimal performance when concatenated with the convolutional inner code Since two check symbols are required for each error to be corrected this results in a total of 32 check symbols and 223 information symbols per codeword

In addition the Reed Solomon codewords can be interleaved on a symbol basis before being convolutionally encoded Since this separates the symbols in a codeword it becomes less likely that a burst from the Viterbi decoder disturbs more than one Reed Solomon symbol in any one codeword

In the same sense that one can correct a curve by interpolating past a gap a Reed Solomon code can bridge a series of errors in a block of data to recover the coefficients of the polynomial that drew the original curve

The code was invented in 1960 by Irving S Reed and Gustave Solomon who were then members of MIT Lincoln Laboratory Their seminal article was entitled Polynomial Codes over Certain Finite Fields When it was written digital technology was not advanced enough to implement the concept The first application in 1982 of RS codes in mass produced products was the compact disc where two interleaved RS codes are used An efficient decoding algorithm for large distance RS codes was developed by Elwyn Berlekamp and James Massey in 1969 Today RS codes are used in hard disk drive DVD telecommunication and digital broadcast protocols

Sleeping Beauty is a classic fairy tale An early variant by the Italian was published in 1634 but the most famous version was first written by Charles Perrault under the title of La Belle au bois dormant This story was later retold by the Brothers Grimm under the title of Dornrschen

A king and a queen have a baby girl They invite fairies to her christening Unfortunately they forgot to invite an old fairy and so the old fairy places a curse on the princess She says that she will one day prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and will die Fortunately one of the good fairies changes the curse so that instead the princess shall sleep for a hundred years and be discovered by the prince of her dreams The king also bans spinning wheels but nonetheless his daughter finds a spinning wheel when she is sixteen and falls into the deep sleep The good fairy also puts everyone in the castle to sleep and covers the castle with a thorny forest A hundred years later a prince discovers the castle and the princess He kisses the sleeping princess and she wakes up They fall in love so they live happily ever afters

Most versions of the story that are told today end when the princess wakes up but Perrault writes about something scary that happened to the princess and her new children The prince goes off to fight in a war and his wife and children stay with his stepmother who is an ogress The queen wants to eat the princess and her three children but her servants helps save the two children He gives the ogress some normal meat and tells her that they are the princess and her children The ogress believes this but she finds out that she has been tricked She plans to push her daughter in law and grandchildren into a pit of nasty snakes But the prince arrives just in time and the queen does not kill his wife and children She throws herself into the pit instead and dies

A Russian ballet with music by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was first performed in 1890 The music for the ballet has become very famous At the end of the ballet characters from other fairy tales by Charles Perrault attend the wedding of the prince and princess

In 1959 Walt Disney made an animated movie based on the fairy tale The movie and the original story have differences In this version the princess is called Aurora the prince is called Philip and the evil fairy is called Maleficant The princess only sleeps for a little while before she is kissed by the prince and the pair meet in the forest beforehand The good fairies also provide comic moments throughout the film The music from Tchaikovskys ballet is used in the film

Transformers are make believe robots that are made by a toy company named Hasbro In the story they come from a planet called Cybertron There are two main types of Transformers These are the Autobots the good guys and the Decepticons the bad guys The leader of the Autobots is named Optimus Prime and the leader of the Decepticons is named Megatron Transformers can transform into different things like cars planes guns and animals Transformers were first made in 1984 There have been many different Transformers toys and stories since then

Some people call the first Transformers toys shows and comics G1 which is short for Generation One The first Transformers toys came from Japan In Japan the toys were from different toy lines called Microman and Diaclone Hasbro took some of the same toys gave some of them different colors and called them Transformers They asked a comic book writer named Bob Budiansky to make up new names for the robots Bob Budiansky also decided what the robots liked what they did not like and how they felt about things In Japan the robots originally did not have names and were not alive They were just machines that were driven by people Bob Budiansky also wrote the Transformers comic book that was made by Marvel Comics Spider Man was even in one of the early Transformers comics

There was also a Transformers cartoon on TV The TV show told a different story than the comic book In the cartoon the Autobots were looking for energy and the Decepticons chased them to Earth In the comic book the Autobots had to stop an asteroid from crashing into Cybertron Another difference is that the story behind each character is different in the cartoon for a lot of robots like the Dinobots Jetfire the Constructicons and Omega Supreme Even the way new robots were created was different In the comic book Optimus Prime uses the Creation Matrix to make new Transformers In the cartoon there is a computer called Vector Sigma that can make new robots

In 1986 a Transformers movie was made It was called The Transformers the Movie and was a story about the future In the story it is the year 2005 Optimus Prime is killed by Megatron and a new Autobot called Ultra Magnus becomes the new Autobot leader The Autobots have to stop a planet eating monster called Unicron who can also transform into a giant robot Unicron also meets Megatron and gives him a new body and a new name and he becomes Galvatron At the end of the movie Unicron is destroyed

The TV show also told the story of the year 2005 We learn that the Transformers were once robot slaves who had to work for aliens called Quintessons The Autobots did not like being slaves so they chased the Quintessons away from Cybertron Kids liked Optimus Prime and were sad that he died so the writers made a story in which he came back to life In Japan the TV show continued with new cartoons that were not seen in America 

The comic book was still being made after the TV show ended Many robots who were not seen in the cartoon were in the comic book like Darkwing and Skids There was even a story about how the Transformers met GI Joe another Hasbro toy line

Beast Wars was about Transformers who could turn into animals They looked like real animals but they were robots in disguise The good guys were called Maximals and their leader was Optimus Primal The bad guys were called Predacons and their leaders name was Megatron In the story the Maximals and Predacons crashed on Earth a very long time ago but they did not know where they were Also there was too much energy on the planet and it hurt their bodies They turned into animals to protect themselves from the energy They could only turn into robots for a short time before the energy started to hurt them 

Later in the story many of the robots turn into Transmetals which means they looked like robot animals instead of real animals The Predacons find out they are on Earth and Megatron tries to find the Autobots and Decepticons who are on a space ship called the Ark Megatron tries to kill Optimus Prime who is still sleeping so that he can change the future 

There was another show called Beast Machines that continues the story that started in Beast Wars At the end of Beast Wars the Maximals tried to catch Megatron At the beginning of Beast Machines he escapes and takes control over Cybertron There are only four Maximals left and Megatron tries to stop them Megatron creates new robots called Vehicons who try to catch the Maximals Later we learn that the Vehicons are really Maximals or Predacons that Megatron caught and tried to control In the story we also learn that even though Cybertron is a dead metal planet it used to be a living planet like Earth

The Hoatzin is a bird considered a relic from the age of the dinosaurs They represent the only living member of the family Opisthocomidae and its close relatives probably died out long ago When young hoatzins have claws on their wings This feature is a remnant from what is considered the first species of bird Archaeopteryx which lived about 150 million years ago Some of them live in the Amazon Rainforest

Hoatzin chicks are born with hooks on their wings They use the hooks to climb around in the trees before they are large enough to fly Hoatzins can fly only short distances even when they are fully grown so they usually climb They build their nests over water If danger threatens the birds dive into the water They climb back up the tree after the danger has past Hoatzins communicate through unusual sounds that resemble wheezing grunting growls and hisses The hoatzin is the only bird that digests plants like a cow Their odor has been compared to fresh cow feces It is believed that their odor is caused by their digestive system

Tasman Peninsula is 75 km by road south east of Hobart at the south east corner of Tasmania Australia

Tasman Peninsula is south and west of Forestier Peninsula It is connected by a very narrow piece of land called Eaglehawk Neck The Forestier Peninsula is joined to the rest of Tasmania by an isthmus called East Bay Neck near the town of Dunalley about 60 km from Hobart

There are a lot of things for visitors to see including the Conservation Park on the main highway at Taranna the Port Arthur Historic Site and a number of beaches

The first people to live here were the Australian aborigines They were part of a group known as the Ostyer Bay tribe This large group lived on the east coast of Tasmania The Tasman Peninsula is named after Dutch explorer Abel Tasman 

The first European settlement of the Peninsula was Port Arthur in the 1830s It was selected as a penal colony because it was isolated from the rest of Tasmania It could be easily got to by sea The other prison colony at Macquarie Harbour on the west coast was too difficult to get to by sea The prisoners there were moved to a new prison at Port Arthur The peninsula also had a lot of trees that could be used for ship building and building houses It had a deep sheltered harbour where visiting British warships could be repaired Eaglehawk Neck was lined with guards and guard dogs to prevent the escape of any convicts Some did escape including the bushranger Martin Cash

The Saltwater River Tasmania historic site is near the north west tip of the peninsula It was originally the site of a coal mine Prisoners dug for coal during the day and lived in underground cells at night

The prison at Port Arthur is now a tourist attraction Tourism is a major business in most of Tasmania Bushwalking is also popular in the remote parts of the peninsula Popular places to walk to include Cape Raoul and Cape Pillar at the south west and south east ends of the Peninsula on either side of the entrance to Port Arthur

It is now the main area in the battle to save the Tasmanian Devil from extinction The devils have been getting a new type of cancer called Devil Facial Tumour Disease It has spread quickly through the devil population The disease has already killed more than half of the Tasmanian devils

The peninsulas isolation from the Tasmanian mainland is ideal for keeping a healthy wild Tasmanian devil population This project involves the local Tasmanian Devil Conservation Park at Taranna and government and university scientists

The rocky coastline has been the site of a number of shipwrecks Two large steam ships have sunk after hitting the Hyppolyte Rocks off the east coast  the Tasman in 1883 and the Nord in 1915 Munroe Bight to the north of Cape Pillar is named after the American ship James Munroe wrecked there in 1850

In the years between convict settlement and the start of the modern tourist industry the area most people worked in the timber industry and fishing The area was not suitable for big farms There are some fruit orchards and some small mixed farms The area was isolated until a regular river steamer began sailing from Port Arthur to Hobart in the 1880s From 1900 to the 1930s the main shipping company was the Huon Channel Peninsula Steamship Company They owned several ships including the MV Cartela

Many smaller towns are also on the Tasman Peninsula The largest are Nubeena and Koonya Smaller villages are Premaydena Highcroft and Stormlea

The local government area is the Tasman Council The major road to Hobart is called the Arthur Highway The current population is around 2000 In summer the area gets many visitors and the population rises to around 6000

The Tasman Peninsula is well known for its rocky eastern coastline Much of it is now in the Tasman National Park At Eaglehawk Neck the rocks have made many strange shapes and patterns These include Remarkable Caves Tasmans Arch and the Tessellated Pavement On the south of the peninsula are the highest sea cliffs in the southern hemisphere rising 300 m above the Tasman Sea at Cape Hauy The peninsula is claimed as one of Australias best surfing spots at Cape Roaul and Roaring Beach

The book is told from Jacobs perspective He receives news of Edward and Bellas return and that Carlisle has told Charlie that Bella is quarantined because she has contracted a rare disease in South America Jacob assumes that Bella has been bitten and transformed He is upset when Sam Uley acting Alpha of the pack declares that the pack will not retaliate Jacob full of anger decides that if the pack will not retaliate collectively he will act alone Formulating strategies of attack he runs to the Cullen house When he arrives however he discovers that things arent as he expected Bella as opposed to being a newborn vampire is already heavily pregnant with Edwards and her child It is clear that the childs rapid growth is starving and hurting Bella

When Jacob returns to his wolf state his thoughts inadvertently inform the pack of Bellas state This causes fear and anger among the werewolves they dont know how the child might act since the child is an offspring of a vampire Sam commands the pack in the double timbre of the Alpha to obey his decision to destroy Bella and her unborn child Jacob who still loves Bella disagrees revolts assumes his inherited Alpha position and leaves Sams pack Seth then Leah Clearwater soon join Jacob and the threesome form a pack with Jacob as Alpha Jacob Leah and Seth patrol the Cullen territory to forewarn the family of any impending werewolf attack

The book returns to Bellas perspective She has just given birth to her daughter and is now experiencing the painful transformation from human to vampire After two days she opens her eyes The Cullens are wary of Bella as newborn vampires are volatile Yet Bella manages to exhibit some self control unseen in normal newborns She wishes to see her daughter Renesmee but since Renesmee is part human the family believes Bella will be unable to control her newborn thirst if she sees the child so soon without first hunting Edward takes Bella on her first hunt to ease her thirst Before they leave Alice shows Bella her reflection She has transformed into a stunningly beautiful woman with flawless skin and newborn vampire red eyes Bella does not recognize her reflection at first due to her volatile looking red eyes 

Upon returning Bella is allowed to see her daughter because of her demonstration of self control in the woods when she smelled humans approaching Because Renesmee is growing at an astonishing rate she looks older than her calendar age Bella learns of Renesmees gift  the ability to communicate by sending images to peoples minds through touch Bella is infuriated when she learns that Jacob has imprinted on Renesmee and says it is his fault that he has imprinted on her child She loses her self control and she tries to attack Jacob She breaks Seths collarbone and shoulder when he steps between the two She then manages to calm down Renesmee leads to a truce between the Quilleutes and the Cullens because of Jacobs imprinting Differences between Sam and Jacobs packs are soon settled as well and they become co existent Alphas

Unfortunately for the Cullen family Irina a vampire from the Denali clan sees Renesmee and mistakenly informs the Volturi that Renesmee is a forbidden immortal child The Cullen family understands that Irina is mistaken and decides the only way to enlighten the Volturi and prevent an attack is to present Renesmee with a large group of credible witnesses

After leaving a note with Sam Uley from the copyright page of Shakespeares The Merchant of Venice Alice and Jasper suddenly leave the Cullens Since the couple does not provide a warning or reason the Cullen family does not know why the couple has fled and assumes that Alice has foreseen there is no hope for the situation Since it was her copy of the book Bella perceives this as a sign from Alice She returns to the cottage and she finds that Alice has written a name and address on another page of the book When Bella goes to the address she finds that it leads to the office of a lawyer who can forge documents Bella requests documents for Jacob and Renesmee should they need to escape if a fight ensues with the Volturi Meanwhile nomadic vegetarian and clans of vampires arrive at the Cullen estate after the family begins to seek their friends assistance with the Volturi Most of them are enthralled by Renesemee and almost all agree to bear witness to the Volturi that she is not an immortal child 

Bella also discovers that her power of mind privacy has a shielding effect and she wonders if she can extend this protection to others During the month of preparation for the Volturi several of the vampires with quantifiable supernatural talents teach Bella how to expand the barrier When the Volturi and Irina finally arrive all of the vampires and the werewolves meet in a clearing in the forest The Volturi discover that they have been misinformed and immediately execute Irina for her mistake However the Volturi are not satisfied to leave because the Volturi leaders want the exceptionally gifted vampires to join them Those on Bellas side are protected when Bellas shield disables the Volturis offensive fighters Alec and Jane Aro Caius and Marcus decide to vote on whether or not Renesmee will be a danger to the vampire world when she attains maturity Just before Aro can cast his deciding vote Alice and Jasper return with another half human half vampire from South America who is about one hundred fifty years old He and his three half sisters are the children of a vampire who is creating a super race They have never caused any danger to the vampire world Facing no other choice Aro chooses to give up the fight and the Volturi flee 

After leaving the Cullen estate for their cottage Bella and Edward tuck Renesmee into her bed and proceed to their bedroom arm in arm Bella tells Edward she wants to try something with him She has been secretly practicing for this moment Bella places her hands on his cheeks and tries to push away her shield She conjures her special memories that she wants to share with Edward He is finally able to see for the first time just how deeply she has always loved him She wants to remove the barrier for Edward so he can access her mind She says that they have only forever for her to perfect it The Twilight series closes with And then we continued blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever

The cover of Breaking Dawn is a metaphor for Bellas changes during the entire story She began as the weakest player on the board the pawn She ended as the strongest the queen 

The title Breaking Dawn is a reference to the beginning of Bellas vampire life

The Fowler Ridge Wind Farm is a wind farm in Benton County Indiana near the city of Fowler IN about convert90mikm northwest of Indianapolis Fowler Ridge was constructed in two phases and has a generating capacity of 600 MW 

Approval has been given for the 303 turbine Shepherds Flat Wind Farm near Arlington Oregon The wind farm will be able to generate 909 megawatts at its peak which is enough electricity to power some 225000 homes The wind farm should employ up to 300 people during construction and about 25 when operational

When completed this will be the worlds largest wind farm Currently the largest operating wind farm in the US is the 736 MW Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center in Texas Billionaire oilman T Boone Pickens plans to build a 4000 MW Pampa Wind Project by 2014 also in Texas

T Boone Pickens a former Texas oilman is planning to build the worlds largest wind farm called the Pampa Wind Project as part of the Pickens Plan It will be developed by Pickens company Mesa Power The proposed 4000 MW facility will be located near Pampa Texas which is on the Texas Panhandle and will stretch to the east spanning 400000 acres in five counties This will provide enough power for 15 million average homes 

When it was planned it would have been the largest wind farm in the United States As of May 2008 the largest US wind plant is the Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center with a capacity of 736 MW

Electric transmission lines must connect wind farms to the places where the electricity is used People fought over whether wind farm owners or electricity users should pay to build these lines On July 17 2008 the Texas Public Utilities Commission ruled that ratepayers should pay 493 billion to build the lines to connect wind farms in the Texas Panhandle to the Texas electric grid This implements a 2005 Texas law designed to promote new wind energy projects

On March 2 2009 Mesa Power announced that it was working on the first phase of the project But had put off work on the later phases It canceled 120 of 197 wind leases In July 2009 Mesa Power delayed the project Mesa Power said the project must wait because it did not have transmission capacity to the site and poor credit market Mesa Power will restart the Pampa Wind Farm project in 2013 when transmission lines are due to be completed in the area In the meantime Mesa Power will use the 667 turbines it purchased to build several smaller wind farms

In 2007 New Line Cinema and Castle Rock Entertainment collaborated on Fracture their first joint venture since the mid 1990s before both companies were bought by Turner

Outside the US New Line does not distribute its own films Rather it contracts other studios such as Alliance in Canada Entertainment Film Distributors in the UK Warner Bros in German speaking areas Singapore Poland and the Czech Republic Village Roadshow Pictures in Australia and New Zealand from 1967 2008 then sold to 20th Century Fox and Playarte in Brazil to distribute its product overseas International distribution of New Line films will revert to Warner Bros after third party distribution contracts expire

Van Diemens Land was the name used by Europeans for the island of Tasmania Tasmania is now a state of Australia The Dutch explorer Abel Tasman was the first European to explore Tasmania He named the island Anthoonij van Diemenslandt after Anthony van Diemen the Governor General of the Dutch East Indies Van Diemen had sent Tasman to explore the area in 1642

In 1803 the island was settled by the British as a penal colony It was called Van Diemens Land and became part of the British colony of New South Wales In 1824 Van Diemens Land became an independent colony with George Arthur as the first Governor In 1856 Britain gave the colony the right to govern itself It had its own parliament The name of the island was changed to Tasmania

From the 1830s to 1853 Van Diemens Land was the main penal colony in Australia When Britain stopped sending prisoners to New South Wales all convicts were sent to Van Diemens Land About 75000 convicts were sent to Van Diemens Land This is about 40 of all convicts sent to Australia

Male convicts worked as servants or farm workers to free settlers or in work groups on public works Only the most difficult convicts were sent to the Tasman Peninsula prison known as Port Arthur Convicts who did more crimes were also sent there Female convicts worked as servants in free settlers houses or were sent to a female factory There were 5 female factories in Van Diemens Land

Convicts who had finished their time in prison or had been well behaved and given a ticket of leave often left Van Diemens Land Many went to the new free colony of Victoria The free settlers in towns such as Melbourne did not like the ex convicts coming to their town During the Victorian gold rush a lot of settlers from Van Diemens Land went to the Victorian gold fields such as Ballarat or Bendigo 

Britain stopped sending convicts to Tasmania in 1853

Anthony Trollope used the word Vandemonian   They are united in their declaration that the cessation of the coming of convicts has been their ruin

Because the name Van Diemens Land was seen to be tied up with convicts and it sounded like the word demon Van Diemens Land was renamed in 1856 It was called Tasmania after Abel Tasman The last penal settlement in Tasmania at Port Arthur finally closed in 1877

The Baseball Hall of Fame is a museum in Cooperstown New York that shows the history of baseball and some of the most famous baseball players and other people especially in North America 

The Hall of Fame opened in 1939 It was started by the Clark Foundation The Hall of Fame was started to help bring visitors to Cooperstown which had been poor for a long time Some people tell a story that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown but the story is not true But the baseball leagues and teams decided that it did not matter and helped make the Hall of Fame popular

The museum has a lot of information on the history of baseball and a lot of old baseball things like bats balls and uniforms of famous baseball players or important baseball games It also has a baseball art collection and a library 

Next to the museum is Doubleday Field where a baseball game is played every year as part of a party about adding new people to the museums stories

When someone is in the Hall of Fame it means they have a story of their life in baseball shown in the museum Every year new people are chosen to be added to the Hall of Fame These people can be baseball players baseball team managers and other people who work with the game of baseball Awards are also given for baseball sports reporters In 2005 there are a total of 260 people in the Hall of Fame 

Two groups pick people to add to the Hall of Fame One group is the Baseball Writers Association of America This group can pick people who have stopped having a job in pro baseball for five years and were in baseball for at least 10 years Each member of the group writes down their 10 top choices and anyone who is on more than three fourths of the members lists is added to the Hall of Fame

The other group that chooses people to add to the Hall of Fame is called the Veterans Committee which is made of people who are in the Hall of Fame themselves This group can vote for anyone who has stopped working in baseball for 20 years They vote every two years for baseball players and every four years for other baseball people

Some people do not like how the Veterans Committee picks people for the Hall of Fame For a while it seemed like the Committee liked to only pick people who they had worked with before This meant some people who might have been good enough for the Hall of Fame were missed because they never worked with the people on the Committee Since then the Veterans Committee has been changed but so far this new committee has not picked anyone

In 1982 some of the museums collection of baseball items were loaned to the head of the American baseball leagues and one of his workers sold them for money Even though the money was paid back it made the Hall of Fame look bad

There are some players who are not allowed to work in baseball anymore because they broke some very important rules but were still very good players The Hall of Fame does not allow people who were kicked out of baseball to be in its museum but some people do not agree with keeping some of these people out

DSL has built in scripts to download and install Advanced Packaging Tool Once APT is enabled the user can install packages from Debians Woody repository Additionally DSL hosts software ranging from large applications like OpenOfficeorg and GCC to smaller ones such as aMSN by means of the MyDSL system which allows convenient one click download and installation of software Files hosted on MyDSL are called extensions As of June 2008 the MyDSL servers were hosting over 900 applications plugins and other extensions

MyDSL is handled and maintained mostly by Robert Shingledecker and hosted by many organizations such as ibiblio and Belgiums BELNET There are 2 areas of MyDSL  regular and testing The regular area contains extensions that have been proven stable enough for everyday use and is broken down into different areas such as apps net system and uci The testing area is for newly submitted extensions that theoretically work as advertised but may have any number of bugs

The standard flavour of DSL is the Live CD There are also other versions available

Hello everyone Ive been editing actively here for around two and a half months and have increasingly found that Id have a good use for the tools I was recently told I passed 1000 edits of which the majority have been to the mainspace Ive written one VGA Powderfinger with another currently up for PVGA Ive also contributed to a lot of other articles about music generally cleaning stuff up and creating stubs to compliment the articles Ive worked on directly

Happy Tree Friends is a show created by Rhode Montijo Kenn Navarro Warren Graff and Aubrey Ankrum It is a flash cartoon a cartoon made using Adobe Flash Since its debut the show has become a popular internet phenomenon and has many fans

Despite the child like form of the series and having cute characters the show is violent and not for small children

While the violence of these deaths is comparable to that of The Itchy Scratchy Show the portrayal of death in Happy Tree Friends is usually more graphic and anatomically correct depicting bloodshed and dismemberment in more vivid and often exaggerated detail

The show is nearly free of dialogue however when the characters do speak their words are severely garbled Though it is obvious what each characters reaction is their words can hardly be understood at all According to the website the idea for Happy Tree Friends was created by Rhode Montijo when he drew a yellow rabbit slightly resembling the character Cuddles on a piece of paper and wrote Resistance Is Futile underneath it

A Happy Tree Friends spin off called Ka Pow premiered on September 2 2008

So in order to remove white space which was really more appropriate called blue space for this design I asked Krimpet to tweak the code In Monobook it looks great However in all other skins it removes the white background putting all text for the intro and TFA on blue Personally I think it looks fine but other opinions are requested 

The issue in greater detail for any who may not know what Im talking about is that the section on the left that tells about Simple English Wikipedia is a certain height The TFA section varies in height depending on the article being featured That difference in height causes the shorter one to have blank space under it In my original code that space was blue In the current code on Monobook the space is now white which looks very good In all other skins however the entire box is now blue and Im not sure if others agree that it looks fine Jennavecia 0425 19 August 2008

Why has this user been blocked indefinetly when they have only made three edits As far as I can tell none of them were vandalism so an indefinite ban seems a bit harsh Is there another reason The Flying Spaghetti Monster 1907 20 August 2008

Really Perhaps like an editor with 16000 edits to English Wikipedia having his votes struck on Simple Wikipedias RFA because of not enough edits If youre going to claim that English Wikipedia is relevant you dont get to cherry pick which parts are ok and which parts are not SWATJester Son of the Defender 1046 24 August 2008

I believe that just because a user is banned over at some place like ENwiki doesnt mean we should ban them here We should judge by their behavior here and only by their behavior her enUserYegoyan is a banned users sockpuppet on the English Wikipedia and links to an interwiki as UserYegoyan here who is an admin So please dont be judgmental with an ENwiki user banned with a sensitive or dubious matter Vandals like Grawp should be blocked wiki wide however this is not always the case with all banned users on other wikis 

As for Da Punks proposal itself I agree completely We should assume good faith and not act like enforcers for the English Wikipedia This is not English Wikipedia Jonas Rand 0023 25 August 2008

In telecommunications Forward error correction is a special code The sender adds parts of the data again This is called redundancy The receiver is then able to detect certain errors that came from the sending the data In certain cases the receiver can correct the error without the need for a retransmission

FEC adds redundancy to the transmitted information with a known algorithm Each redundant bit is a function of many original information bits The original information may or may not appear in the encoded output codes that include the unmodified input in the output are systematic while those that do not are nonsystematic

An extremely simple example would be an analog to digital converter that samples three bits of signal strength data for every bit of transmitted data If the three samples are mostly all zero the transmitted bit was probably a zero and if three samples are mostly all one the transmitted bit was probably a one The simplest example of error correction is for the receiver to assume the correct output is given by the most frequently occurring value in each group of three

This allows an error in any one of the three samples to be corrected by democratic voting but is a very inefficient FEC But in practice would not work very well but it does illustrate the principle In practice FEC codes typically examine the last several dozen or even the last several hundred previously received bits to determine how to decode the current small handful of bits

Such triple modular redundancy the simplest form of forward error correction is widely used

This famous method of fighting with the uncovered hands and with the uncovered feet came in the 3rd century when the monks had wanted to be trained and to defended themselves It is a boxing called martial that borrows from the Burmese warriors all their array of particular plans for gaining success in the combat It had come popular beginning of the 11th century under the king Anawratha with combats among tribes with no rules and with a violence without common measure The way of facing is special very much much often taking a certain animal behaviour and is alike only of much distant to other Eastern methods 

In the way received from ancestors the combat is judged by two referees and is done in a circle where every form of the blow and of the throw is permitted The present time brought the rules as if the Eastern boxing especially the gloves the things that keep safe the rounds and the ring The technical part of the person who fights is much wide and the behaviours are produced by other methods of the combat de Burma Many unusually interesting actions are happened especially the flying techniques and techniques in walking of stairs In the past a traditional Burmese Boxing was quite different from Thaing for its brutal and rough side Today is not so because is having good organization under the modern conditions can be agradable see 

Nine traditional techniques are the parts of the method of the Burmese boxing The technical description of the lethwei include three main parts the weapons which are used the goals which are aims and the distances of the combat We meet 

From a point of view of particular plan for gaining succes in the combat and in order to learn and remember a part of laws is established For example we meet the following laws 

According to a customary way the combat is performed in a circle In the Burmese villages still in 21st century this fight has kept in existence its character received from ancestors Only the appearance of an Eastern ring and of the divisions seems to be mark of the present times 

The match is judged by two referees in order to can better separate the men who take part in it and six referees give a points to these men All the techniques are permitted a man can be hit in the ground The boxers fight during the rounds much long The rounds are changed by complete half times during the other matches are performed 

The set of needed things is poor the competitor uses certain pants of boxing wrapped hands coconut as a something that keeps the genitals safe leather strap among the teeth Till the present times many Burmese boxers have the tattooed trunk and the leg In a certain you can see his victories in other  the representations of animals suggesting force and being brave

Warrior dance performed in the beginning of the combat in order to show ability and being brave In the end of the dance the crossed arms are hit each one of its shoulders with the opposite hand in order to announce that the boxer is hostile A dance of victory is performed also after the decision of the referees

Act of providing to see de the weapons used during the combat de lethwei by the boxer himself He hits the opposite arm with his open hand The act of providing to see is performed from the top towards down at the beginning with the fists and the elbows then with the knee and in the end with the feet 

The word kickboxing represents a sport of combat of striking which is practised on ring In the years 1960 in the United States the sharp interest for the karate and for the other martial arts and the desire of several mass media does developping the things 

Various styles of martial practices developped with the various forms of contact Many champions wanting to know the special end easy recognized qualities of their techniques helped in causing their gradual change Competitions were arranged in lot of different styles of combat like Jhoon Rhees United States National Karate Championship the Ed Parkers Battle of Atlanta and from the 1963 they opens on ring of Bando kickboxing Other important competitions like Mas Oyamas All Worth America Championship has changed the traditional competitions of karate from yet arranged without contact 

Also the Bruce Lees and Jhoon Rhees idea of fighting with protections and gloves has opened a new way for all the persons who like real combat At the beginning American kickboxing is rules of competition Such rules allow the competitors of the various martial practices to compete in a certain kind of fighting If is so much the main opinion that is become one of the forms of sport of combat produced by the martial arts more practised in the world

Louis Pierre Althusser was a Marxist philosopher He was born in Algeria and studied at the cole Normale Suprieure in Paris Eventually he became Professor of Philosophy there 

Althusser was a lifelong member of the French Communist Party Sometimes he criticised the party strongly His arguments and theses were set against the threats that he saw attacking the theoretical foundations of Marxism These included both the influence of empiricism on Marxist theory and humanist and reformist socialist orientations which could be seen as divisions in the European Communist Parties as well as the problem of the cult of personality and of ideology itself 

Althusser is commonly referred to as a Structural Marxist although his relationship to other schools of French structuralism is not a simple affiliation and he is critical of many aspects of structuralism

The Free Software Foundation is a non profit corporation founded by Richard Stallman on 4 October 1985 to support the free software movement a copyleft based movement which tries to promote the universal freedom to distribute and modify computer software without restriction The FSF was started in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts United States of America

From its founding until the 1990s FSFs funds were mostly used to employ software developers to write free software for the GNU Project Since the mid 1990s the FSFs employees and volunteers have mostly worked on legal and structural issues for the free software movement and the free software community

The FSF holds the copyrights on many important pieces of the GNU system such as the GCC As a copyright holder it has the power to enforce the GNU General Public License when copyright infringement occurs on that software While other copyright holders of other software systems used the GPL as their license FSF was the only organization to regularly assert its copyright interests on software licensed under the GPL until Harald Welte created gpl violationsorg in 2004

In late 2001 Bradley M Kuhn with the help of Moglen David Turner and Peter T Brown turned these efforts into FSFs GPL Compliance Labs From 2002 2004 high profile GPL enforcement cases such as those against Linksys and OpenTV became frequent GPL enforcement and educational campaigns on GPL compliance was a major focus of the FSFs efforts during this period

In March 2003 SCO filed suit against IBM alleging that IBMs contributions to some free software including FSFs GNU violated SCOs rights While FSF was never a party to the lawsuit FSF was subpoenaed on November 5 2003 During 2003 and 2004 FSF put a lot of advocacy effort into responding to the lawsuit and removing its negative impact on the adoption and promotion of free software

The ITS 90 is the international temperature scale published in the year 1990 It mainly is a set of fixed temperatures and instructions how to realise a practical temperature scale being as close to the thermodynamical temperature scale as current knowledge allows

The first international temperature scale was established in 1927 An improved version came in 1948 In 1968 the IPTS 68 was issued Note the letter P which stands for practical In 1975 the very low side of the scale was added Since 1990 the ITS 90 is in use

A list of fixed temperatures is given This list has been produced by national laboratories from all over the world It has been approved by the BIPM in Paris Temperatures between the fixed points can be measured using a platinum resistance thermometer This thermometer however has to be calibrated first This is being done at a number of fixed temperatures covering the desired range Procedures and formulae for defining an interpolating thermometer are given as well

Say we need a calibrated thermometer in the range from room temperature to 400 C A triple point of water is to be realised for 001 C For 231928 C there is the freezing point of tin At 419527 C it is the freezing point of zinc which serves the goal

After having measured the electrical resistance of this thermometer at the given temperatures the data is being fed into a prescribed formula giving the deviation coefficients for the range from 0 to 420 C So from now on we have a thermometer with which we can perform accurate measurements according to the ITS 90

This type of calibration is called primary calibration With the thermometer we just calibrated we can perform a secondary calibration Then another thermometer is to be calibrated against ours This derived calibration of course is a little less accurate but can take place at any suitable temperature within the range since our thermometer interpolates between the fixed temperatures

Nude photography is a style of art photography which wants to show the naked human body as a form of art This is different form erotic photography which has an erotic component and totally different from pornography which only focuses on sexual arousal For many photographers nude photography is a study of the human body much like some paintings did Photographing a person to be recognised is called portrait Nude photography focuses on showing the human body often the face is not visible

Erotic photography is a style of photography between nude photography and pornography Erotic photography wants to show the more or less naked human body in a sexual context It can be difficult to make a difference between erotic photography and pornography  in general erotic photography wants to arouse or stimulate the viewer

This stimulation is generally not done by explicitly showing people having sex Instead the models in the photographs will try to create a sexual impression For example female models may try to appear alluring Male models will try to convey sexual arousal though not through a full erection In general erotic photography only suggests and has a higher artistic value than pornography

Interference is something that happens when two or more waves are in the same space There are two kinds of interference and these are constructive interference and destructive interference When the waves have the same wavelength they will always experience either constructive or destructive interference but if the waves have different wavelengths they will experience sometimes constructive interference and sometimes destructive interference

Constructive Interference happens when two or more waves are in the same space and in phase When this happens the waves amplitudes add together and the total is greater than the amplitude of any of the waves by themselves This causes the waves to appear more intense

Destructive Interference happens when two or more waves are in the same place and out of phase When this happens the waves amplitudes add together and the total is less than the amplitude of any of the waves by themselves This causes the waves to appear less intense

The Lachlan River is an important river in central New South Wales Australia

The river starts in the central mountains of New South Wales near Gunning Other rivers that join the Lachlan River are the Carcoar River the Belubula River and the Abercrombie River They join the Lachlan near the town of Cowra 

Wyangala Dam was built near Cowra to control the amount of water in the river The Lachlan does not gets its water from melting snow like the Murrumbidgee River or the Murray River It does not have a regular amount of water flowing down it In 1944 the flow was less than 1000 megalitres Six years later there was a flow of 10900000 megalitres In dry years for example April 1944 to April 1945 the Lachlan may have no water flowing in it at all Other rivers like the Murray and Murrumbidgee have never stopped flowing The Lachlan has flooded every 7 years since 1887 at Forbes

The Lachlan River flows west and then south finishes in the Great Cumbung swamp This swamp is near Oxley between Hay and Balranald Water from this big swamp finally goes into the Murrumbidgee River Water from the Lachlan is used for farming

The Lachlan river is in the area where the aboriginal people called the Wiradjuri lived The Wiradjuri land has been called the land of the three rivers the Wambool the Kalare and the Murrumbidjeri The Murray River was the south side of Wiradjuri land The change from forest to open grassland was the east side

The European who found the Lachlan River in 1815 was Acting Surveyor George William Evans He named the river after Lachlan Macquarie the Governor of New South Wales The Lachlan River was explored by John Oxley in 1817

In the early days of New South Wales the south part of the Lachlan was known as Fish River With more exploration it was realized that two rivers were the same river and the name Fish River was dropped

In 1870 the river flooded The top of the flood water was measured at 159 metres at Cowra Since 1887 the highest flood level at Forbes was in June 1952 The river got to 108m at the Forbes Iron Bridge  More than 900 families had to move away Many were saved from roof tops by boat and helicopter During the flood in August 1990 132 houses in Forbes were flooded The water covered their floors Floods in 1992 were smaller than 1990 but Lachlan Valley farmers lost about 30 percent of their lucerne crops just before harvest At least 500 sheep were drowned on farms in the EugowraTrundle area Most of Eugowras 400 residents were moved for safety Other big floods were in 1891 1916 1951 1956 1961 1974 1976 1993 1998

More than 100000 people live in the Lachlan area 14 of NSW farm goods come from the area which is about 10 of NSW 24 local governments look after the Lachlan area

Lambing Flat was the name of a gold field in New South Wales Australia People were digging for gold at Lambing Flat in the 1860s It was part of the Burrangong goldfields which also included Spring Creek Stoney Creek Back Creek Wombat Blackguard Gully and Tipperary Gully Burrangong is now the town of Young New South Wales Frank Gardiner a bushranger had a butcher shop at Lambing Flat Ben Hall who also became a bushranger sold cattle to Gardiner for his shop 

Lambing Flat is most famous for an anti Chinese riot This was just one of a number of riots on the Burrangong goldfields between November 1860 and September 1861 Several place names are sometimes used when talking about these events Lambing Flat the name which is name used most often was a grass area where sheep were kept It was where one of the more violent riots took place

There were many things that made the European miners dislike the Chinese miners on the gold fields in the 1850s Most of the trouble was the way Chinese miners looked for gold The gold was alluvial gold small pieces of gold mixed in with soil and clay close to the surface It was found in very old river beds called leads which had been buried for thousands of years Getting the gold did not need much skill but it was hard work European miners worked alone or in small groups They often left one area of ground to dig in another where others had said there was more gold Many gold miners did not make enough money to buy food and clothing Only a few miners became rich

The government began to tax the miners by making them pay for Miners Licence They had to pay to be allowed to dig rather than pay for the gold they had found The miners did not like this tax There were several angry and violent protests in Victoria and New South Wales The most famous was at the Eureka Stockade in Ballarat Victoria where over 30 miners were killed

The Chinese usually worked in large groups of 30  100 men They were able to share the small amounts of gold they found They looked for gold on land that other miners had searched before The European miners thought that the land was still their land The Chinese miners lived and worked together Most of them had been farmers in China They were used to long hours of hard work They were used to basic food and houses It has been said that they rarely paid for the mining leases They were happy to find a lot of small pieces of gold instead of looking for one big piece that would make them rich

The first public display of anti Chinese feelings took place in Bendigo in July 1854 Some these displays were attempts to keep the Chinese from working on the goldfields There were fights between European and Chinese miners at Daylesford and Castlemaine A group of Chinese on their way to the Victorian goldfields found gold at Ararat They were forced off the new goldfield by European miners The same things were also taking place in New South Wales European miners forced the Chinese off the diggings at Rocky River in New England in 1856 Serious fights took place Adelong in 1857 and Tambaroora in 1858 There was a big riot at the Buckland River goldfield near Beechworth in July 1857

There were not many Chinese miners in New South Wales Victoria had cut the number of Chinese arriving by making them pay a tax of 10 to enter Victoria The Chinese were now starting to arrive in NSW instead The government tried to stop the Chinese coming in 1858 but the parliament would not pass the new laws In 1860 the Chinese and British governments signed the Convention of Peking This meant that Chinese and British people would have the same rights in each country Australia was a British colony so could New South Wales keep out people from China A new law the Chinese Immigration Regulation Bill was being talked about in Parliament when the first gold miners were getting to Burrangong

Trouble began in 1860 with the starting of the Miners Protective League The European miners held big meetings called roll ups to force the Chinese to leave the goldfields They would put up signs telling the Chinese to leave At first there was not a lot of trouble Most of the Chinese moved to another part of the goldfield with some going back soon after This happened a few times over the next eight months As long as the Chinese stayed in certain places on the goldfield at Burrangong the European miners would put up with them

The most well known riot took place on the night of 30 June 1861 A group of about 3000 miners marched to Lambing Flat led by a brass band and two men carrying the roll up banner They forced the Chinese to leave Lambing Flat Tents were set on fire and items belonging to the Chinese were smashed or stolen They then went to the Back Creek diggings and set fire to more tents Many of the Chinese were cruelly beaten but no one was killed About 1200 Chinese left the area and set up camp near Roberts farm at Currowang 20km away Two things started the riot In Sydney the parliament did not pass the anti Chinese laws Also an untrue story went around the goldfields The story said that a new group of 1500 Chinese were on the road to Burrangong The police got to Burrangong in the next few days They arrested three of the leaders of the riot The miners were angry and on the night of July 14 1000 miners attacked the police camp The police fired their guns and rode their horses into the miners One miner was killed and many were hurt

The police were forced to leave A group of 280 soldiers sailors and extra police came from Sydney and stayed on the goldfields for a year The Chinese came back and lived in a separate part of the diggings The leaders of the riots were arrested and two were sent to gaol At the end of the year Burrangong was quiet and the Chinese were still there

Lens can mean different things

The lentil or daal or pulse is a bushy annual plant of the legume family It is a kind of vegetable grown for its lens shaped seeds It is about 15 inches tall and the seeds grow in pods usually with two seeds in each

The plant originated in the Middle East and was one of the first crops domesticated in the world Humans started eating lentils before they invented ceramics 

Consisting of 26 protein lentils have the highest level of protein of any plant after soybeans and hemp Because of this fact and due to their high iron content lentils are a very important part of the diet in many parts of the world especially in India which has a large vegetarian population

Different kinds of lentils exist including a variety of large and small lentils Lentils come in colors that range from yellow to red orange to green brown and black

Lentils are sold in many forms with or without the skins whole or split Red white and yellow lentils are decorticated ie they have their skins removed

One variety of yellow lentils Chana is in fact not a lentil but are actually made from the kernels of chickpeas Split Pigeon peas  that are actually considered pulses which include peas and beans  are also sometimes erroneously referred to and sold as lentils The urad bean is also referred to as a black lentil

The seeds only need very little cooking This time is especially short for kinds of lentils with their husk removed such as the common red lentil Lentils have a distinctive earthy flavor They can be used to prepare an inexpensive and nutritious soup all over Europe and North and South America Sometimes they are combined with some form of chicken or pork They are frequently combined with rice which has a similar cooking time In the Middle East such a dish of lentils and rice is called mujaddara or mejadra Rice and lentils are also cooked together in khichdi a popular Indian dish Lentils are used throughout India the Mediterranean regions and the Middle East In rare cases the lentils are mixed with dairy cheese

Many people in India are vegetarian and lentils have long been part of the indigenous diet as a common source of protein Usually lentils are boiled to a stew like consistency with vegetables and then seasoned with a mixture of spices to make many side dishes such as sambar rasam and dal which are usually served over rice and roti

When lentils are prepared they are first inspected for damaged lentils stones and other foreign matter Then they are rinsed until the water runs through and comes out clear Some prefer to soak the lentils for an longer time and discard the water This removes substances that may cause indigestion The lentils are then boiled in water or broth They may be cooked on the stovetop or in a slow cooker Pressure cookers are not recommended since the small lentils may clog the pressure relief valve and their quick cooking time means there is little benefit from pressure cooking Cooked lentils often require thinning adding more hot water or broth to the cooked legumes until the desired final consistency is reached

Apart from a high level of proteins lentils also contain dietary fiber vitamin B1 and minerals Red lentils contain a lower concentration of fiber than green lentils Health magazine has selected lentils as one of the five healthiest foods Lentils are often mixed with grains such as rice which results in a complete protein dish

In addition to providing slow burning complex carbohydrates lentils are one of the best vegetable sources of iron This makes them an important part of a vegetarian diet and useful for preventing iron deficiency Iron is particularly important for adolescents and menstruating or pregnant women whose requirements for it are increased

Lentils are relatively tolerant to drought and are grown throughout the world About half of the worldwide production of lentils is from India most of which is consumed in the domestic market Canada is the largest export producer of lentils in the world and Saskatchewan is the most important producing region in Canada The Palouse Region of Eastern Washington and the Idaho Panhandle with its commercial center at Moscow Idaho constitutes the most important producing region in the United States The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that world production of lentils totalled 32 million metric tons in 2003 Canada produced 520000 MT and according to the market analysis company STAT Communications will likely export 400000 MT during the 2003 04 marketing year which runs from August to July The FAO estimates world trade in lentils totalled 12 million MT in 2002 with Canada exporting 382000 MT during the calendar year

Lentils are mentioned many times in the Old Testament In Jewish tradition they are considered as food for mourners together with boiled eggs The reason is that their round shape symbolizes the life cycle from birth to death

People traveled on the Oregon Trail in wagons in order to settle new parts of the United States of America during the 19th century The Oregon Trail started in Missouri near the area where Kansas City Missouri is today and ended in the Willamette Valley in Oregon 

People went to Oregon for many reasons Some people wanted land Some thought Oregon would be a great place to live Most of them went because they wanted a new life

Most wagons were pulled by oxen Some were pulled by mules and a few were pulled by horses

The Oregon Trail was first traveled around 1841 Once a railroad was built across the United States in 1869 people could take trains to the western United States so fewer people began to travel west in wagons

In the 1970s three student teachers in Minnesota made an educational computer game based on the Oregon Trail The goal of the game was to successfully travel the trail from Independence Missouri to Oregon City Oregon Dangers of the trail included river crossings illnesses sick oxen and hunger Over the next two decades new versions of the game were made that added more options and included better graphics

The Emancipation Proclamation was an order by US President Abraham Lincoln It ordered the freedom of all slaves in the states still in rebellion during the American Civil War It did not actually immediately free all those slaves because those areas were still controlled by the Confederacy It did however free at least 20000 slaves immediately and nearly all 4 million slaves as the Union army advanced into Confederate states Until the US Constitution was amended in 1865 only the states had power to end slavery within their own borders so Lincoln issued the proclamation as a war measure in his role as commander in chief Slave states that had remained loyal to the Union were not at war with the federal government and so Lincoln did not have the power to free the slaves in those states The Proclamation also did not apply to areas within Virginia and Louisiana which Union forces already controlled The Proclamation made emancipation a goal of the Civil War

The Proclamation was issued in two parts On September 22 1862 Lincoln said that in 100 days he would free all slaves in areas not then under Union control On January 1 1863 he named the areas to which the proclamation would then apply The five border states where slavery was still legal were exempt because they had remained loyal to the Union and were not in rebellion Tennessee and the vicinity of New Orleans were exempt because Union forces had already regained control there

Only a small number of slaves already behind Union lines were immediately freed As Union forces advanced nearly all four million slaves were effectively freed Some former slaves joined the Union army

Before the war was over some of the exempted border states ended slavery within their own borders While the Proclamation had freed slaves it had not made slavery illegal Thus Lincoln sponsored a constitutional amendment to ban slavery The Thirteenth Amendment making slavery illegal everywhere in the United States was passed late in 1865 eight months after Lincoln was assassinated

The Brooklyn Bridge one of the oldest suspension bridges in the United States stretches 5989 feet over the East River connecting the New York City boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn It is one of the leading landmarks of New York City

It was built from 1869 until 1883 The bridge was designed by John Roebling and the construction was directed by his son Washington Roebling and Washingtons wife Emily  When it was finished it was the tallest structure in North America

Shelf life is how long food can be kept safely Food cannot be kept forever After a certain time it will go bad After this time it is no longer safe to eat it Shelf life also used for drugs drinks and other things that can go bad

In some countries a best before use by or freshness date must be put on packaged foods

Shelf life is the length of time that food can be stored During this time the quality of the food does not change if it is kept under normal conditions Frozen food that is not stored in the fridge or freezer will go bad earlier for example Most of these labels do not guarantee the safety of food They should only be used as a guide

Shelf life is different from expiration date Shelf life is linked to food quality expiration date to food safety A product that has passed its shelf life might still be safe but quality is no longer guaranteed In most food stores shelf life is controlled by using stock rotation This means moving products with the earliest sell by date to the front of the shelf so that most shoppers will pick them up first and so getting them out of the store This is important as stores can be fined for selling out of date products Most shops if not all will have to mark such products down as wasted leading to a loss of profit 

Shelf life is can be changed by many things exposure to light and heat transmission of gases mechanical stresses and contamination by things such as micro organisms

Mathematically product quality is often modelled using only one parameter for example the concetration of a chemical substance a microbiological index or a physical parameter Sometimes the parameter picked is irrelevant

The shelf life is an important factor to health Bacteria are everywhere and foods left unused too long will often get large amounts of bacterial living in them It may be dangerous to eat them and lead to food poisoning The shelf life itself cannot always be trusted to tell how safe it is to eat a certain item of food For example pasteurized milk can remain fresh for five days after its sell by date if it is refrigerated properly In contrast if milk already has harmful bacteria the use by dates do not matter

For drugs the situation is different If drugs are used within the expiration date the manufacturer guarantees that they work as expected After that date they may still work but only to a lesser extent A rare exception is a case of renal tubular damage said to have been caused by out of date tetracycline A study done by the US Food and Drug Administration covered over 100 drugs prescription and over the counter The results showed that about 90 of them were safe and effective as far as 15 years past their expiration date Joel Davis a former FDA expiration date compliance chief said that with a handful of exceptions  notably nitroglycerin insulin and some liquid antibiotics  most expired drugs are probably effective

Preservatives and antioxidants may be put into some food and drug products to make their shelf life longer Some companies use induction sealing and vacuum pouches to add to the shelf life of their products

Some degradation factors can be controlled by provisions in the ed packaging For example the amber bottle used for many beers blocks damaging wavelengths of light Transparent beer bottles do not Packaging with barrier materials eg extends the shelf life of some foods and pharmaceuticals

Nearly all chemical reactions will occur at common temperatures Examples are the breakdown of many chemical explosives into more unstable compounds Nitroglycerine is notorious Old explosives are thus more dangerous than more recently manufactured explosives Rubber products also degrade as sulphur bonds induced during vulcanization revert this is why old rubber bands and other rubber products soften and get sticky as they age

These breakdown processes usually happen more quickly at higher temperatures The usually quoted rule of thumb is that chemical reactions double their rate for each temperature increase of 10 Celsius degrees because of activation energy barriers become more easily surmounted at higher temperatures However as with all rules of thumb there are many caveats and assumptions This particular one is most applicable to reactions with activation energy values around 50 kJmole many of these are important at the usual temperatures we encounter It is often applied in shelf life estimation sometimes wrongly There is a widespread impression for instance in industry that triple time can be simulated in practice by increasing the temperature by 15 C eg storing a product for one month at 35 C simulates three months at 20 C There is enough variation that this practical rule cannot be routinely relied upon 

The same is true to a point of the chemical reactions of life They are usually enzymatically catalyzed which changes reaction rates but with constant catalytic action the rule of thumb is still mostly applicable In the particular case of bacteria and fungi the reactions needed to feed and reproduce increase at higher temperatures up to the point that the proteins and other compounds in their cells themselves begin to breakdown or denature so quickly that they cannot be replaced This is the reason high temperatures kill bacteria and other micro organisms tissue breakdown reactions reach such rates that they cannot be compensated for and the cell dies On the other hand elevated temperatures short of these result in increased growth and reproduction if the organism is harmful perhaps to dangerous levels

Just as temperature increase speeds up reactions temperature decreases reduce them Therefore to make explosives stable for longer periods or to keep rubber bands springy or to force bacteria to slow down their growth they can be cooled This is the reason shelf life is generally extended by temperature control and the reason some medicines and foods must be refrigerated

Best before is sometimes put on food and drink wrappers followed by a date It shows the date before which the supplier intended the food should be consumed The term best before is also used to show the date by which the item will have outlived its shelf life and is intended to ensure that customers will not unwittingly purchase or eat stale food Sometimes the packaging process involves using pre printed labels making it impractical to write the best before date in a clearly visible location In this case a term like best before see bottom or best before see lid might be printed on the label and the date marked in a different location as indicated

Best Before is usually advisory and refers to the quality of the product in contrast with Use By which indicates that the product is no longer safe to eat after the specified date

Generally foods that have a use by date written on the packaging must not be eaten after it has expired This is because such foods usually go bad quickly and may be dangerous to eat It is also important to follow storage instructions carefully for these foods

Foods that have a best before date are usually safe to eat after the date has passed although they are likely to have deteriorated either in flavour texture appearance or nutrition

Bathroom productstoiletries usually state a time in months by which once the product is opened they should be used This is often indicated by a graphic of an open tub with the number of months written inside

Open Dating is the use of a date or code stamped on the package of a food product to help determine how long to display the product for sale It is also helpful to the customer and ensures that the product is at its best quality when bought An Open Date does not supersede a Use by date which should still be followed 

These dates are meant to help keep track of the stock in stores Food that has passed its sell by or display until date but is still within its use by best before can still be eaten if it has been stored correctly It is common practice in large stores to throw away such food as it makes the stock control process easier It also reduces the risk of customers buying food without looking at the date only to find out the next day that they cannot use it Changing the posted date is illegal in many countries

Most stores will rotate stock by moving the products with the earliest dates to the front of shelving units which allows them to be sold first and saving them from having to be either marked down or thrown away both of which contribute to a loss of profit

It is also common for food approaching the use by date to be marked down for quick sale with greater reductions the closer to the use by date it gets

In a metaphorical sense much software also has a shelf life Most software products are released to market with defects xecurity vulnerabilities and design flaws Over time some of these are discovered and patches issued by the vendor which fix bugs and add functionality The result is that after some time the software application is rather different than it was at first release even with the same version level Since correct inclusion of patches at end user sites is spotty the actual population of that software application in the field is quite varied some will have patches 1 and 2 others 1 2 and 3 some others none in all possible variations This increases support difficulty There have been a few attempts to address this One commercial attempt is from Preemptive

The Food Drug Administration which controls packaged foods and drugs only requires a use by or expiration date on infant formula and some baby foods Thats because formula must contain a certain quantity of each nutrient that is described on the label And if formula is stored too long it loses its nutritional quality It also separates or form lumps that will clog the bottle nipple Except for infant formula and some baby foods product dating is not required by federal regulations

The Agriculture Dept which controls fresh produce and meats only requires labeling of the date when poultry is packed at the farm However many manufacturers are allowed to also add sell by or use by dates 

A freshness date is the date used in the American brewing industry to indicate either the date the beer was bottled or the date before which the beer should be consumed 

Beer is does not keep forever It can be affected by light air or the action of bacteria Although beer in the USA does not have to have a shelf life freshness dates serve much the same purpose and are a marketing tool

The Boston Beer Company maker of Samuel Adams was among the first to start adding freshness dates to their product line in 1985 For ten years there was a slow growth in brewers adding freshness dates to their beer The practice rapidly grew in popularity after the Anheuser Busch companys heavily marketed Born On dates starting in 1996 Many other brewers have started adding freshness dates to their products but there is no standard for what the date means For some companies the date on the bottle or can will be the date that the beer was bottled others have the date by which the beer should be consumed

Before a beer is bottled it is processed to make its its shelf life longer This can change the beers freshness date It may be done in several ways not all of which will be used by a particular brewery

A Red card in sport is a punishment to a player It is usually given to a player who has broken the rules of the game

In football rules a red card means that the player is sent off the field and is not allowed to play in the rest of the match A player with a red card is automatically banned from his teams next game

The World Wrestling Entertainment Womens Championship was an official championship in World Wrestling Entertainment fought for by divas The title was unified with the WWE Divas Championship

The WWE Womens Championship has descended from the National Wrestling Alliance World Womens Championship when The Fabulous Moolah became champion and held the title close to 30 years The Title became inactive in 1990 when Rockin Robin Vacated the Title after departing from the WWF In 1993 Alundra Blayze won the Title after Winning a Tournament However the Title became Inactive after Alundra Blayze dropped the Title into a Garbage Can live on WCW Monday Nitro this incident forced her to give up the title The WWE Womens Championship was then reactivated in September 1998 when Jacqueline Moore won a match against Sable

Currently Michelle McCool Mickie James Melina Perez and Beth Phoenix are the only divas in the history of the WWE to hold both the WWE Womens Championship and WWE Divas Championship

The final champion was Layla El who defeated Beth Phoenix in a two on one handicap match with Michelle McCool on Smackdown and McCool self proclaimed herself as the co Womens Champion The title was unified with the WWE Divas Championship on September 19 2010 and retired

KWord is a free word processor a part of the KOffice project and of the K Desktop Environment

The text layout scheme in KWord is based on frames making it look like Adobe FrameMaker These can be placed anywhere on the page and can include text graphics and embedded objects Each new page is a new frame but the text is able to flow through KWords ability to link frames together The use of frames means that complex graphical layouts can be achieved easily in KWord

KWord was created as part of the KOffice project in 1998 using some ideas from FrameMaker such as the frames approach The first author said that the application and its code were not the best since it was his first object oriented application

In 2000 the KWord application was created in a way that made it very hard to fix problems and nobody was working on the problems anymore There had not been any official release of the application in all this time In the same year a new maintainer started working on the application and over the duration of 2000 and the beginning of 2001 they worked to fix any problems in the code of the application FactdateApril 2008

The World Tag Team Championship is a professional wrestling tag team championship in World Wrestling Entertainment It is the original world tag team title of WWE Currently it is exclusive to the Raw brand and is unified with the WWE Tag Team Championship to make up the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship

The championship was first introduced into the then World Wide Wrestling Federation in 1971 Following its introduction into the WWF Luke Graham and Tarzan Tyler became the first WWWF Tag Team Champions on June 3 In 1979 the title became known as the World Wrestling Federation Tag Team Championship when the promotion renamed itself World Wrestling Federation

In 2001 at the Survivor Series Pay per view during the Invasion Storyline The Hardy Boyz Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy who were the current World Tag Team Champions and were competing for the World Wrestling Federation took on The Dudley Boys Bubba Ray Dudley and D Von Dudley who were the current WCW World Tag Team Champions and were competing for The Alliance in a title unification match inside a Steel Cage The Dudley Boys defeated The Hardy Boyz and were named the last WCW Tag Team Champions while also becoming the WWF Tag Team Champions

After the WWFWWE name change in 2002 the championship was referred to as the World Wrestling Entertainment Tag Team Championship After a period where the championship was to be freely defended on either WWE Monday Night Raw or WWE Thursday Night Smackdown the championship became exclusive to the Raw Brand The current General Manager at this time Stephanie McMahon created new WWE Tag Team Titles which were to be exclusive to the Smackdown Brand

WrestleMania III was the third yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling pay per view event made by the World Wrestling Federation The event was held on March 29 1987 at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac Michigan

The event is particularly notable for the record attendance of 93173 the largest recorded attendance for a live indoor sporting event in North America Though differing numbers have been argued the event is considered to be the pinnacle of the 1980s wrestling boom Almost one million fans watched the event at 160 closed circuit locations in North America The number of people watching via pay per view was estimated at several million and pay per view revenues were estimated at 10 million

Lucille Frances Ryan is a New Zealand actress When she was twenty years old she got her first acting job in the TV program Funny Business In 1995 she starred in her first television series Xena Warrior Princess becoming in an international star in this role

Lawless is also known for her role as Danna Biers in the TV series Battlestar Galactica between 2005 and 2008 During a break in 1997 between filming seasons on Xena Lawless made her onstage debut singing songs on Broadway as Rizzo in the remake of the musical play Grease

Since her role as Xena Lawless has pursued a new career in singing after being a contestant on Celebrity Duets She sang at the Roxy in Hollywood in 2007 and has since performed regularly in concerts and released several CDs

She was born in Auckland on 29 March 1968 Lawless mother Julie was teacher and her father Frank was mayor She has 6 brothers She had bulimia and Depression 

Lawless began acting in secondary school attending Marist College New Zealand in Mount Albert She studied foreign languages at Auckland University for a year before dropping out and leaving for Europe with her boyfriend Garth Lawless to travel to Germany and Switzerland The couple then moved to Australia where she worked briefly as a gold miner

Lawless wanted to act since she was five She took her first acting class at the school Lawless starred various national television commercials when she was a child One of these was for McDonalds She played an Amazon in the TV movie Hercules and the Amazon Women in 1994 and Lisya in his Spin off the TV series Hercules The Legendary Journeys em 1995 In the same year she plays Xena in three episodes returning later 

In September Xena won her own series Xena Warrior Princess Lawless was the star in the program during 6 years Lawless first appeared on Broadway in September 1997 in the Grease play remake as the bad girl Rizzo character She applied to play the squeaky clean naive blond girl Sandra Dee but she claimed the producers after Xena had typed her to playing only bad girls She said the Sandy character was very similar to her sheltered childhood growing up in New Zealand with many protective older brothers 

Lawless has since appeared onstage in the Vagina Monologues and as a television guest star in episodes of The Simpsons The X Files Just Shoot Me Veronica Mars Burn Notice and Curb Your Enthusiasm She was also featured in the short lived television series Tarzan Lawless has made cameo appearances in the movies EuroTrip Spider Man and Boogeyman She returned to television in the TV movie Locusts and its sequel Vampire Bats

From 2005 to 2008 Lawless has had a recurring role in the television series Battlestar Galactica She portrays DAnna Biers a reporter with the Fleet News Service who works on a critical documentary about the crew of the Galactica and is later revealed to be a Cylon

In 1997 Lawless was named one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the World by People magazine Days earlier on 6 May 1997 Lawless inadvertently exposed a breast as she concluded a performance of the US national anthem at an NHL hockey game in Anaheim California between the Mighty Ducks and Detroit Red Wings Lawless was quoted in Newsweek as saying

Lawless has enjoyed a particular cult status in the lesbian community Some of the lesbian fan base sees Lawless as a lesbian icon A group called The Marching Xenas has participated in many gay and lesbian pride parades

Some fans felt that the sexual nature of Xena and the character Gabrielles relationship was cemented by an interview given by Lucy Lawless to Lesbian News magazine in 2003 Lawless stated that after the series finale where Gabrielle revives Xena with a mouth to mouth water transfer filmed to look like a full kiss she had come to believe that Xena and Gabrielles relationship was definitely gay there was always a well she might be or she might not be but when there was that drip of water passing between their lips in the very final scene that cemented it for me

In 2006 Lucy Lawless donated her personal Xena costume to the Museum of American History In an interview the same year with Smithsonian magazine she was asked the question Was the Warrior Princess outfit comfortable and she responded

At the age of nineteen Lawless became pregnant with Garths child In 1988 they married in Kalgoorlie Australia They returned to New Zealand and had a daughter Daisy Lawless who also attended Marist College New Zealand The couple divorced in 1995 Lawless married Xena executive producer Robert Tapert on 28 March 1998 Lawless and Tapert have two sons Julius Robert Bay Tapert and Judah Miro Tapert both born in Auckland

The following table shows all the movies she has been in the role she played and when the movie was released

The Red Army Faction or RAF was one of postwar West Germanys most active and prominent militant left wing groups 

It described itself as a communist urban guerrilla group engaged in armed resistance while it was described by the West German government as a terrorist group

The RAF was formally founded in 1970 by Andreas Baader Gudrun Ensslin Horst Mahler Ulrike Meinhof Irmgard Mller and others The Red Army Faction operated from the 1970s to 1993 committing numerous crimes especially in the autumn of 1977 which led to a national crisis that became known as German Autumn

It was responsible for 34 deaths including many secondary targets such as chauffeurs and bodyguardsand many injuries in its almost 30 years of existence It began in 1960s and ended around 1998 when the last members were killed and or died

The Large Hadron Collider is the worlds biggest and most powerful particle accelerator It cost 104 billion Swiss francs to build Its a machine used to shoot very small particles into each other at high speed When the particles hit each other their energy is converted into many different particles and sensitive detectors keep track of the pieces that are created By looking carefully at the detector data scientists can study what the particles are made of and how the particles interact This is the only way to see some particles because very high energy is needed to create them The LHCs particle collisions have the energy needed

The LHC starts with hydrogen atoms and ionizes the atoms electrons so that protons are left Protons are parts of atoms with a positive charge The LHC accelerates these protons through a giant super conducted circular tunnel 17 miles long The protons are moved around the Large Hadron Collider at very high speeds by giant supercooled electromagnets These magnets have to be very cold to work and they are cooled by a liquid helium The protons hit one another at close to the speed of light and convert to energy using EMC2 It then reverses and creates mass 

The Large Hadron Collider is built underground at CERN which is in Switzerland but the LHC is so big that part of it goes underneath France It is between 50 and 175 metres below the ground Scientists hope that it will find the Higgs Boson the only particle predicted to exist by the Standard Model that has not been seen yet If scientists can find this it will help show that the Standard Model is right and show what the universe is made of

Some people think the LHC would create a black hole which would be very dangerous There are two reasons not to be worried The first is that the LHC wont do anything that the cosmic rays that hit the earth every day dont do and these rays do not create black holes The second reason is that even if the LHC did make black holes they would be very tiny The smaller a black hole is the shorter its life Very tiny black holes would die and turn into energy before they could hurt people

The LHC was first used on September 10 2008 but it did not work because a cooling system broke which was important for the magnets that help to move the charged particles This caused part of the facility to collapse The winter shutdown meant that it was not used again until November 2009 While it was being repaired scientists used the Tevatron to try and find the Higgs Boson When the LHC was restarted in November 2009 it set a new speed record by accelerating protons to 118 TeV On March 30 2010 the LHC created a collison at 35 TeV

Self Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology or SMART is a system to watch computer hard disks to help stop the risk of failures It does this by watching broken wikt linkreliabilityreliability of the hard disks to try and see when a failure might happen and where

Hard drive failures fall into two categories

Predictable failures can be detected by certain monitoring devices This is like a thermometer in a vehicle that can alert the driver to do something before serious damage occurs for example because the engine is too hot

About 60 of all drive failures are caused by failing mechanics Most mechanical failures result from gradual wear An eventual failure may be catastrophic Before complete failure occurs there are usually certain signs that failure is imminent These may include increased heat output a more noisy drive problems with reading or writing data and a big increase in the number of damaged disk sectors

The purpose of SMART is to warn a user or system administrator that a drive is about to fail At the time of the warning there is usually still time to do certain things to prevent data loss for example copying the data to a different drive Approximately 30 of failures can be predicted by SMART Work at Google on over 100000 drives has shown little overall predictive value of SMART status as a whole The study suggests that certain sub categories of information which some SMART implementations track do correlate with actual failure rates In the 60 days after the first scan error on a drive the drive is 39 times more likely to fail on average than it would have been had no such error occurred Also first errors in reallocations offline reallocations and probational counts are strongly correlated to higher probabilities of failure

PCTechGuides page on SMART commented in 2003 that the technology had gone through three phases 

The industrys first hard disk monitoring technology was introduced by IBM in 1992 in their IBM 9337 Disk Arrays for AS400 servers using IBM 0662 SCSI 2 disk drives Later it was named Predictive Failure Analysis technology It was measuring several key device health parameters and evaluating them within the drive firmware Communications between the physical unit and the monitoring software were limited to a binary result namely either device is OK or drive is likely to fail soon

Later another variant which was named IntelliSafe was created by computer manufacturer Compaq and disk drive manufacturers Seagate Quantum and Conner The disk drives would measure the disks health parameters and the values would be transferred to the operating system and user space monitoring software Each disk drive vendor was free to decide which parameters were to be included for monitoring and what their thresholds should be The unification was at the protocol level with the host

Compaq submitted their implementation to Small Form Committee for standardization in early 1995 It was supported by IBM by Compaqs development partners Seagate Quantum and Conner and by Western Digital who did not have a failure prediction system at the time The Committee chose IntelliSafes approach as it provided more flexibility The resulting jointly developed standard was named SMART

The technical documentation for SMART is in the AT Attachment standard

The most basic information that SMART provides is the SMART status It provides only two values threshold not exceeded and threshold exceeded Often these are represented as drive OK or drive fail respectively A threshold exceeded value is intended to indicate that there is a relatively high probability that the drive will not be able to honour its specification in the future that is the drive is about to fail The predicted failure may be catastrophic or may be something as subtle as the inability to write to certain sectors or perhaps slower performance than the manufacturers declared minimum

The SMART status does not necessarily indicate the drives past or present reliability If a drive has already failed catastrophically the SMART status may be inaccessible Alternatively if a drive has experienced problems in the past but the sensors no longer detect such problems the SMART status may depending on the manufacturers programming suggest that the drive is now sound

The inability to read some sectors is not always an indication that a drive is about to fail One way that unreadable sectors may be created even when the drive is functioning within specification is through a sudden power failure while the drive is writing In order to prevent this problem modern hard drives will always finish writing at least the current sector immediately after the power fails Also even if the physical disk is damaged at one location such that a certain sector is unreadable the disk may be able to use spare space to replace the bad area so that the sector can be overwritten

More detail on the health of the drive may be obtained by examining the SMART Attributes SMART Attributes were included in some drafts of the ATA standard but were removed before the standard became final The meaning and interpretation of the attributes varies between manufacturers and are sometimes considered a trade secret for one manufacturer or another Attributes are further discussed below

Drives with SMART may optionally support a number of logs The error log records information about the most recent errors that the drive has reported back to the host computer Examining this log may help one to determine whether computer problems are disk related or caused by something else

A drive supporting SMART may optionally support a number of self test or maintenance routines and the results of the tests are kept in the self test log The self test routines may be used to detect any unreadable sectors on the disk so that they may be restored from back up sources This helps to reduce the risk of incurring permanent loss of data

Many motherboards will display a warning message when a disk drive is approaching failure Although an industry standard among most major hard drive manufacturers there are some remaining issues and much proprietary secret knowledge held by individual manufacturers as to their specific approach As a result SMART is not always implemented correctly on many computer platforms due to the absence of industry wide software hardware standards for SMART data interchangeFactdateJanuary 2007

From a legal perspective the term SMART refers only to a signalling method between internal disk drive electromechanical sensors and the host computer Hence a drive may be claimed by its manufacturers to include SMART support even if it does not include say a temperature sensor which the customer might reasonably expect to be present Moreover in the most extreme case a disk manufacturer could in theory produce a drive which includes a sensor for just one physical attribute and then legally advertise the product as SMART compatible 

Depending on the type of interface being used some SMART enabled motherboards and related software may not communicate with certain SMART capable drives For example few external drives connected via USB and Firewire correctly send SMART data over those interfaces With so many ways to connect a hard drive it is difficult to predict whether SMART reports will function correctly in a given system

Even on hard drives and interfaces that support it SMART information may not be reported correctly to the computers operating system Some disk controllers can duplicate all write operations on a secondary back up drive in real time This feature is known as RAID mirroring However many programs which are designed to analyze changes in drive behaviour and relay SMART alerts to the operator do not function properly when a computer system is configured for RAID support Generally this is because under normal RAID operational conditions the computer is not permitted by the RAID subsystem to see individual physical drives but may access only logical volumes instead

On the Windows platform many programs designed to monitor and report SMART information will function only under an administrator account At present SMART is implemented individually by manufacturers and while some aspects are standardized for compatibility others are not

Each drive manufacturer defines a set of attributes and sets threshold values beyond which attributes should not pass under normal operation Each attribute has a raw value whose meaning is entirely up to the drive manufacturer and a normalized value which ranges from 1 to 253 Depending on the manufacturer a value of 100 or 200 will often be chosen as the normal value

Manufacturers that have supported at least one SMART attribute in various products include Samsung Seagate IBM Fujitsu Maxtor Toshiba Western Digital and ExcelStor Technology 

Threshold Exceeds Condition is a supposed date when a critical drive statistic attribute will reach its threshold value When Drive Health software reports a Nearest TEC it should be regarded as a Failure date

Prognosis of this date is based on the factor Speed of attribute change how many points each month the value is decreasingincreasing This factor is calculated automatically at any change of SMART attributes for each attribute individually Note that TEC dates are not guarantees hard drives can and will either last much longer or fail much sooner than the date given by a TEC

Predicive failure analysis is a technology developed by IBM to monitor the likelihood of a hard disk failure Today it is part of SMART

The Advanced Technology Attachment with Packet Interface is a way to connect storage devices such as Hard disks solid state drives and CD ROM drives inside personal computers The standard is maintained by X3INCITS committee T13 

ATAATAPI is the result of a long history of development ATAATAPI is an evolution of the AT Attachment Interface which was itself evolved in several stages from Western Digitals original Integrated Drive Electronics interface As a result many near synonyms for ATAATAPI and its previous incarnations exist including abbreviations such as IDE which are still in common informal use With the market introduction of Serial ATA in 2003 the original ATA was retroactively renamed Parallel ATA

Parallel ATA standards allow cable lengths up to only 18 inches Because of this length limit the technology normally appears as an internal computer storage interface For many years ATA provided the most common and the least expensive interface for this application As of 2007 it has largely been replaced by Serial ATA in new systems

Serial Attached SCSI is a technology designed to move data to and from computer storage devices such as hard drives and tape drives It is a point to point serial protocol that replaces the parallel SCSI SCSI first appeared in the mid 1980s in corporate data centers SAS uses the standard SCSI command set At present it is slightly slower than the final parallel SCSI implementation but in 2009 it will double its present speed to 6 Gbits This will permit much higher speed data transfers The protocol is downwards compatible with second generation SATA drives These drives may be connected to SAS backplanes but SAS drives can not be connected to SATA backplanes  

The SAS protocol is developed and maintained by the T10 technical committee of the International Committee for Information Technology Standards and promoted by the SCSI Trade Association

The SAS connector is much smaller than traditional parallel SCSI connectors allowing for the small convert25inmmsingon drives SAS supports point data transfer speeds up to 3 Gbits but is expected to reach 12 Gbits by the year 2012 

The physical SAS connector is available in several different variants

Tagged Command Queueing is a technology that allows to send multiple read and write requests to a hard drive simultaneously ATA TCQ is not identical in function to the more efficient Native Command Queuing used by SATA drives SCSI TCQ does not suffer from the same limitations as ATA TCQ

Before TCQ an operating system was only able to send one request at a time In order to boost performance it had to decide the order of the requests based on its own possibly incorrect idea of what the hard drive was doing With TCQ the drive can make its own decisions about how to order the requests The result is that TCQ can improve the overall performance of a hard drive if it is implemented correctly

For efficiency the sectors should be serviced in order of proximity to the current head position rather than in the order received The queue is constantly receiving new requests and fulfilling and removing existing requests and re ordering the queue according to the current pending readwrite requests and the changing position of the head The exact reordering algorithm may depend upon the controller and the drive itself but the host computer simply makes requests as needed leaving the controller to handle the details

This queuing mechanism is sometimes referred to as elevator seeking as the image of a modern elevator in a building servicing multiple calls and processing them to minimise travel illustrates the idea well

If the buttons for floors 5 2 and 4 are pressed in that order with the elevator starting on floor 1 an old elevator would go to the floors in the order requested A modern elevator processes the requests to stop at floors in the logical order 2 4 and 5 without unnecessary travel Non queueing disk drives service the requests in the order received like an old elevator queueing drives service requests in the most efficient order This may improve performance slightly in a system used by a single user but really comes into its own in a system with many users making requests all over the disk surface

Native Command Queuing is a technology designed to increase performance of SATA hard disks on computers It can do this under certain situations by allowing the individual hard disk to internally optimize the order in which it executes the read and write requests it received This can reduce the amount of unnecessary drive head movement and resulting in better performance for workloads where multiple readwrite requests are outstanding at the same time This situation most often occurs in server type applications However the current technology actually slows down HD access in certain applications like games and sequential reads and writes because of the added latency induced by NCQ logicfix linkTALKPAGENAMEobsolete textobsolete fact date

Native Command Queuing was preceded by Parallel ATAs version of Tagged Command Queuing ATAs attempt at integrating TCQ was constrained by the requirement that ATA host bus adapters use ISA bus device protocols to interact with the operating system The resulting high CPU overhead and negligible performance gain contributed to a lack of market acceptance for TCQ 

NCQ differs from PATA TCQ in that the command re ordering is performed by the drive rather than the operating system and each command is equal in importance This is preferable since the drive has the most knowledge of its performance characteristics and is able to take rotational position into account NCQ and PATA TCQ have a maximum queue length of 32 in flight commands while SCSI TCQ has a maximum queue length of 264 in flight commands

For NCQ to be enabled it must be supported and enabled in the SATA host bus adapter and in the hard drive itself The appropriate device driver must be loaded into the operating system to enable NCQ on the host bus adapter Many newer chipsets support the Advanced Host Controller Interface which should allow a generic driver supplied by the operating system to control them and enable NCQ In fact newer mainstream Linux kernels support AHCI natively Unfortunately Windows XP requires the installation of a vendor specific driver even if AHCI is present on the host bus adapter Windows Vista corrects this situation by including a generic AHCI driver

Serial Storage Architecture is a technology used to attach hard disks to Servers It was developed by IBM in the 1990s IBM produced a number of drives with this standard but today it has been largely replaced by the Fibre Channel architecture

Fibre Channel or FC is an architecture and a set of protocols to attach disk drives to computers like in a Storage Area Network Networks today are done with 4 GBits and 8 GBits over fiberglass cables This is enough to support data transfer rates of up to 800 MBits Fibrechannel permits connecting the same disk subsystem to several computers

Francis Michael Whitey Wistert was an American football and baseball player He played college football for the University of Michigan Wolverines He was added into the College Football Hall of Fame after he was elected to it in 1967 He and his two brothers are three of the seven players who have had their uniform numbers retired by Michigan Wolverines football While at college Wistert helped Michigan win the Big Ten Conference football championship in 1931 1932 and 1933 He was also Big Ten Most Valuable Player in college baseball He later played for the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball

Wistert graduated from Chicagos Schurz High School in 1929 He attended the University of Michigan where he was an athlete in both football and baseball in 1931 1932 and 1933

Wistert played for the Michigan Wolverines before his two brothers Al Wistert and Alvin Wistert did All three Wistert brothers wore the number 11 for the Wolverines football team and all three were members of the College Football All America team which is the best players through all of the United States When interviewed by the Detroit News in 2004 brother Alvin Wistert said And if Im not mistaken I think this is unprecedented in the broken wikt linkannalannals of college football that three brothers all would go to the same school all played football All played tackle all wore the same number 11 all made All American Two of us played on four national championship teams They all made it into the College Football Hall of Fame 

The Wistert brothers grew up on the northwest side of Chicago and were the sons of a Lithuanian family Their father was a Spanish American War veteran who later died while working for the Chicago Police Department Brother Alvin Wistert said that their father was born Casmir Vistertus and he Anglicized it when he came to America to Wistert 

The story of the Wistert brothers at Michigan began when Whiteys Carl Schurz High School school mate John Kowalik was invited to visit the University of Michigan At the time Whitey Wistert was working in a factory building Majestic radios Kowalik took Whitey with him on his visit Ann Arbor Michigan and Alvin Wistert later said thats how it started the Wisterts of Michigan

As a football player Wistert played for National Championship teams that never lost a game in 1932 and 1933 and was a chosen All American in 1933 The 1934 University of Michigan yearbook the Michiganensian had this to say by Grantland Rice Wistert was unanimously selected as the best tackle in the Middle West this year He was an important part of Michigans defensive line play He was a very good tackler and it was nearly impossible to fool him on trick plays He was keen quick and accurate in finding out how a play would happen Wistert and Chuck Bernard were the leaders of the 1933 offensive line when the team went 7 0 1 with a tie to the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers

One of Wisterts teammates on the 1932 and 1933 Michigan football teams was Gerald Ford who later became the US President In an interview in the February 1974 copy of Michigan Alumnus Wistert said about Ford He was a real good competitora real bulldog type Even during a losing year he was voted team Most Valuable Player by his teammates because they believed he was someone who could stay and fight even when they lose In 1936 he was a member Michigan football coaching staff of Coach Harry Kipke

Wistert earned varsity letters in baseball three years He was chosen as the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten Conference in 1934 The 1934 Michiganensian yearbook wrote that the final game of the baseball season was a 40 shutout by Wistert against the University of Chicago Maroon It wrote Wistert for the Wolves allowed only five well broken wikt linkscatterscattered hits during the game Although Whitey Wistert walked four men he more than off set this by striking out nine of the Maroons to face him Wistert also allowed as the pitcher Ohio State four hits in a game

Wistert still being a minor league baseball player played for a short while in Major League Baseball playing in three games for the Cincinnati Reds between September 11 1934 and September 25 1934 In two times he pitched Wistert let only one run in eight innings for a career earned run average of 113 Though in the three times he batted he went did not hit the ball so he struck out twice Although he only played for a short while in Major League Baseball Wistert played five years of professional baseball Fellow 1933 Michigan Wolverines football All American Ted Petoskey also debuted for the Reds in September 1934

Wistert became part of the College Football Hall of Fame in 1967 one year before his brother Albert did so In 1981 he was named to the University of Michigan Hall of Honor in the fourth class of Hall of Fame joiners with his brothers Only five other Michigan football players earned this honor before him

Wistert became a New York lawyer after he retired from sports He went on to become a vice president of an industrial relations in city stateToledoOhio He was United States Navy lieutenant in World War II

What is known as Virgin birth of Jesus is a belief held by Christians and Muslims It says that Mary remained a virgin when Jesus was conceived This belief was widespread Christian church by the second century and the doctrine was included in the two most widely used Christian creeds which state that Jesus was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and was born of the Virgin Mary The belief was not challenged except by some sects which did not have much importance before the Enlightenment theology of the eighteenth century

The gospels of Matthew and Luke say that Mary was a virgin and that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit These gospels set going the current belief that Jesus conception was a miracle and he had natural father no sexual intercourse and no male seed was involved in conceiving him The Gospel of Matthew also says that the virgin birth of Jesus fulfils a prophecy from the Book of Isaiah

Most people believe the virginity of Mary is a reference to his conception not his birth But in Roman Catholic and Orthodox usage the term Virgin Birth means not only that Mary was a virgin when she conceived but also that she gave birth as a virgin This has been believed since the second century See Perpetual virginity of Mary

Marys virginity at the conception of Jesus is also part of Islam The Quran often refers to Jesus with the matronymic Jesus son of Mary

According to Uta Ranke Heinemann the virgin birth of Jesus was not meant to be taken literally It should be understood as an allegory of a special initiative of God It could be compared to the creation of Adam in the sense that both creations were by God

Jesus may have been an illegitimate child This claim can be traced back to about 177 180 AD when Celsus using Jewish sources wrote cquoteIt was Jesus himself who fabricated the story that he had been born of a virgin In fact however his mother was a poor country woman who earned her money by spinning She had been driven out by her carpenter husband when she was convicted of adultery with a soldier named Panthera She then wandered about and secretly gave birth to Jesus Later because he was poor Jesus hired himself out in Egypt where he became adept in magical powers Puffed up by these he claimed for himself the title of God8080Raymond E Brown According to this view the accounts in Matthew and Mark were intended as a response to this charge

The letters of Paul of Tarsus are considered to be the earliest texts in the New Testament They do not state that Jesus mother was a virgin

In Galatians 44 Paul wrote 

But when the fullness of time had come God sent his Son born of a woman born under the law 

This phrase speaks of Jesus as born of a woman not of a virgin This is sometimes seen as evidence that Paul did not know about the virgin birth of Jesus However the phrase born of a woman born under the law could imply that Jesus had no human father This is because it was common for Hebrews to list only the father or otherwise both parents The fact that the father is totally missing suggests that was no father

Some people think that this to do with the curse upon Jeconiah as evidence of Gods miraculous working saying that only by a virgin birth could Jesus have Joseph as a legal father but avoid the curse through Jechoniah that none of his descendants would prosper and sit on the throne of David 

The Epistle to the Romans opens with the words 

Whether descended from David according to the flesh implies physical descent through Joseph is disputed

While some see in the likeness of sinful flesh as meaning merely that Jesus was externally like any other human being others suggest that there is a contradiction between the notion of being in the likeness of sinful flesh and having been born of a virgin

As has been remarked by students of the New Testament the order of writing of the books shows that the oldest Christian preaching about Jesus concerned his death and resurrection They turned their attention also to the deeds and words that came to them from the traditions of Jesus ministry which were formed into collections arranged in logical rather than chronological order and which formed a basis for the four canonical Gospels of which Mark is the earliest bibleverseActs1037 41 gives an outline similar to Marks beginning with the baptism and ending with the resurrection with no mention of the birth Only later for reasons not only of curiosity but also of apologetics and theology attention was given to the birth and infancy as in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke

The fact that Paul did not write about the infancy and even the ministry of Jesus may be seen as fitting this pattern

A food coloring is any substance that is added to food or drink to change its color Food coloring is used both in commercial food production and in cooking at home

People associate certain colors with certain flavors The color of the food can therefore influence its perceived flavor in anything from candy to wine For this reason food manufacturers add dyes to their products One of the reasons this is done is to simulate the colour the customer expects as natural An example would be to add red coloring to glac cherries Without coloring the cherries would be beige Food coloring can also be done for effect such as a green ketchup

Most people are aware that food with bright or unnatural colors such as the green ketchup mentioned contains food coloring Far fewer people know that natural foods such as oranges and salmon may also be dyed to hide natural variations in color The color of foods varies through the seasons Processing food and storing it may change its color For these reasons it may give a commercial advantage to add colors to food so that it has the color expected or preferred by the customers Some of the main reasons are

Food colorings need to be tested before they can be used These tests are done to make sure the coloring is not poisonous and has no unwanted side effects Sometimes different testing bodies have different opinions on the safety of a certain coloring In the United States FDC numbers are given to approved synthetic food dyes that do not exist in nature In the European Union E numbers are used for all additives both synthetic and natural that are approved in food applications

Most other countries have their own regulations and list of food colors which can be used in various applications including maximum daily intake limits

Natural colors are not required to be tested by a number of regulatory bodies throughout the world including the United States FDA The FDA lists color additives exempt from certification for food

A growing number of natural food dyes are being commercially produced partly due to consumer concerns surrounding synthetic dyes Some examples include

To make it easy to get the exact color these color components are often available in very pure form They can also be used with suitable carrier materials

In the United States certifiable color additives are available for use in food as either dyes or lakes

Dyes dissolve in water but are not soluble in oil Dyes are manufactured as powders granules liquids or other special purpose forms They can be used in drinks dry mixes baked goods confections dairy products pet foods and many other products Dyes also have side effects which lakes do not including the fact that large amounts of dyes ingested can color stools

Lakes are the combination of dyes and insoluble material Lakes tint by dispersion Lakes are not oil soluble but are oil dispersible Lakes are more stable than dyes and are ideal for coloring products containing fats and oils or items lacking sufficient moisture to dissolve dyes Typical uses include coated tablets cake and donut mixes hard candies and chewing gums lipsticks soaps shampoos talc etc

Because food dyes are generally safer to use than normal artistic dyes and pigments some artists have used food coloring as a means of making pictures especially in forms such as body painting Food colorings can be used to dye fabric but are usually not wash fast when used on cotton hemp and other plant fibres Some food dyes can be fixed on Nylon and animal fibers

In the past research has not shown any link between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and food dyes Newer studies show that synthetic preservatives and artificial coloring agents can make the syptoms of ADD and ADHD worse The older studies were inclonclusive on this point perhaps because the clinical methods of measuring this behavior were inappropriate Parents reports of food additives proved to be better indicators whether additives were present than clinical tests Several major studies show academic performance increased and disciplinary problems decreased in large non ADD student populations when artificial ingredients and artificial coloring were eliminated from school food programs

The word Eugowra comes from an Australian aboriginal word meaning the place where the sand washes down the hill The first people to live in the Eugowra area were the Wiradjuri people Europeans first began exploring the area in 1815 John Oxley went through the area on his trip to explore the inland of NSW in 1817 Farming began at Eugowra station in 1834

The town was started in the 1860s on the site of the farm This was where the track for people going to the Lachlan gold fields crossed the Mandagery Creek A bridge was built over the creek and then the John Bull Hotel was built next to it In 1881 the town was laid out and a police station courthouse and school were built The creek has flooded many times in 2005 it had a flood peak of convert9mft0lkonabbron This cut the town in two and water flowed through many buildings and houses

Australias biggest gold robbery took place near Eugowra The bushrangers Frank Gardiner Ben Hall and their gang robbed the Forbes to Orange Ford and Company coach on 15 June 1862 The bushrangers stole convert77kglb0lkonabbron of gold and 3700 in cash The value in 2008 money is about A4 million The site of the robbery was a gully convert5kmmi0lkonabbron north of Eugowra known as Eugowra Rocks Coaches and wagons had to slow down to get around a steep gully which went down to Mandagery Creek They also had to get past many large granite rocks One of these rocks was called Coonbong by the Wiradjuri people Gardiners gang stopped two bullock wagons and left them in the middle of the road When the gold escort coach arrived it had to slow right down and try to get past the wagons The bushrangers hidden behind the rocks fired their guns at the coach The coach driver and two policemen were wounded One policeman had been shot in the testicles The horses reared up and the coach was tipped on its side One policemen assisted the wounded and they escaped into the bush They went towards the Eugowra homestead for help The other policeman went back down the road to a small hotel Lyells Shanty

The bushrangers took the gold and money They put it onto the back of one of the coach horses They went back to their horses which had been hidden up the hill They escaped into the bush and stopped at the southern end of Nobles Lagoon to share out the bags of gold They went to Mount Wheogo north of the Weddin Mountains where Gardiner had his camp

A local farmer Hanbury Clements heard the gun shots and went to find out what was going on He found the wounded men and helped them back to the farm house He got on to his horse and rode the convert27mikm0lkonabbron to Forbes in the dark in less than three hours to report the robbery The police arrived quickly and with the help of an aboriginal tracker Jimmy Dargan they were soon following the bushrangers Gardiners camp at Wheogo had a good view of the country John the Warrigal Walsh warned the bushrangers that the police were coming and the gang got away

Most of the gold was still loaded on the back of the very tired coach horse The bushrangers finally had to leave the horse in the foothills of the Weddin Mountains They only took the money with them The police got most of the gold back Only Ben Hall and Frank Gardiners share of the gold was not found

Today the town has a supermarket two hotels a newsagent a butcher and golf and bowling clubs There is also farm supplies a lucerne plant and a sawmill Eugowra is famous for its granite More than 2000 slabs of granite were used in the new Parliament House Canberra in Canberra

In 1864 Dan Kellys family moved north to a farm at Avenel Red Kelly stole a calf and was sent to gaol for six monthsrp75 Dan was in trouble with the police when he was five years old because they believed he had stolen a horserp75 Dans father died in 1866 and in 1867 his mother Ellen Kelly moved the family to a small farm near Greta in north east Victoriarp30 Ellen Kellys two sisters Catherine and Jane Lloyd were living at Greta and her two brothers John and James Quinn had moved to the area in 1864rp30 The Quinn family were well known to the police Dan Kelly was again in trouble with the law when he was only 10 years old He and his brother Jim aged 12 were arrested by Constable Flood for riding a horse that did not belong to them Jim was working for a local farmer and had taken the horse to ride home on Flood did not believe them and the boys were forced to spend two nights in a prison cellrp82 In 1875 like many other young men in north east Victoria Dan Kelly and his cousins the Lloyds went to New South Wales to look for seasonal farm work in the Riverina area and on the Monaro High Plainsrp59 His group of friends were known as the Greta mobrp59 They went out together to hotels dances and horse races By 1876 they were well known for their visits to nearby towns such as Wangaratta Beechworth and Benallarp59 

On one visit to Benalla in 1876 Dan was arrested for stealing a saddle The police let him go when they could not get enough evidencerp59 Dan and his cousins got into trouble with the police in October 1877 They had gone to a shop to pick up food and other supplies but the shop was shut When the owner refused to open the shop Dan Kelly broke down the doorrp52 They were charged with violent assault damage to property breaking into houses and stealing things worth 113 The boys went into hiding and the police spent three weeks looking for them Constable Alexander Fitzpatrick told Ned Kelly to get them to give themselves uprp52 In court the police were not able to prove most of the charges but Dan went to prison for one month for damaging property worth 10

On 15 April 1878 Constable Fitzpatrick went to the Kellys house to arrest Dan Kelly for stealing horses Dan had been seen in Chiltern riding a stolen horserp52 What happened at the house is now called the Fitzpatrick incident There was a fight with Fitzpatrick and he said the Kelly family had tried to kill him Dan and Ned went into the bush to hide Ellen Kelly was sent to gaol for three years for attempted murder Maggies husband William Skillion and a neighbour William Williamson were sent to gaol for six yearsrp63

Ned and Dan Kelly went into the bush to a place in the Wombat Ranges Dan Kelly had built a small hut some time earlier on Bullock Creek where he had cleared an area of about convert20acreha0lkonabbron to keep horses He had also built a small still for making alcoholrp89 The brothers spent their time searching for gold in the creek 

During the months they were hiding at Bullock Creek they were often visited by their friends including Steve Hart Joe Byrne Aaron Sherritt and the Lloydsrp78 The police took the charge of attempted murder very seriously A reward of 100 was offered for the capture of the two Kelly boys The police thought the brothers were hiding in the Wombat Ranges In October 1878 they sent two search groups out to find them One group travelled south from Greta and the other started from Mansfield and travelled northrp90

Stringybark Creek 

The Mansfield group was led by Sergeant Michael Kennedy with three policemen Constables Thomas McIntyre Thomas Lonigan and Michael Scanlon They set up a camp at Stringybark Creek in a thick forest area Kennedy and Scanlon went searching for the Kellys while Lonigan and McIntyre remained at the camprp95 The Kellys were living in a hut close by at Bullock Creek They heard noises and discovered the police camp They decided to capture the policemen and take their guns and horses Ned and Dan and friends Joe Byrne and Steve Hart went to the police camp and told them to surrenderrp96 

Constable McIntyre put his arms up but Lonigan got out his gun Ned Kelly shot him deadrp96 When the other two police came back to camp McIntyre told them to surrender Scanlon went for his gun but Ned shot him deadrp97 Kennedy ran shooting from tree to tree with Ned chasing him During the shooting Kennedy was shot and was badly wounded Ned shot him in the chest to end his sufferingrp97 McIntyre was able to escape during the confusion It was later reported in the newspapers that it was Dan who had shot Kennedyrp98 Dan was wounded during the shootingrp100

The Victorian government passed a law on 30 October 1878 making the Kelly Gang outlaws they no longer had any legal rights They could be shot by anyone at any time without warningrp103 Anyone who could capture one of the Gang alive or dead would be paid a reward of 500 or 2000 for the four menrp103 The bushrangers were seen at several places around north east Victoria They had tried to cross the Murray River into New South Wales but the water was too deep The police had several large groups hunting for them On 10 December the Kelly Gang robbed the bank at Euroarp110 In February 1879 they went to Jerilderie New South Wales They locked the towns policemen in the police station cells and kept many people prisoner in the Royal Mail Hotel for three days Dan Kelly and Steve Hart kept the people in the hotel while Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne robbed the bankrp121 After the bank robberies the reward was increased to 2000 for each man or the larger amount of 8000 for the Gangrp128 

Over the next 18 months many policemen were sent to north east Victoria to search for the Kelly Gangrp140 The police could not find the bushrangers because they were badly led and they did not know how to live in the bush However the Kellys were experts in living in the bush and they had the support of the local peoplerp151

In June 1880 the Kelly Gang came out of hiding They knew that Joe Byrnes friend Aaron Sherritt had been giving information to the police Four policemen were living at Sherritts house near Beechworth to protect him Dan Kelly and Byrne went to Sherritts house late at night and knocked on the door When Sherritt opened the door Byrne shot him deadrp155 The policemen were hiding under the bed Kelly and Byrne rode quickly back to Glenrowan where Ned Kelly and Hart had forced many of the town people into a hotel the Glenrowan Inn They also had forced railway workers to pull up the train tracks They knew that more police would be sent by train to Beechworth to find them They wanted the train to crash when it reached the place where tracks had been removed near Glenrowan The bushrangers wearing homemade armour would then capture any of the policemen that were alive after the crashrp153 With the police out of the way the Kelly Gang would then go into Benalla and rob the bankrp153 The captured police would be released when Ellen Kelly William Williamson and William Skillion were let out of gaolrp153

The plan did not work because the four policemen did not come out of Sherritts house until the next morningrp156 This meant that the news of the murder did not reach Melbourne as quickly as the Kelly Gang had hoped The people held prisoner in the hotel became restless Ned organised music and Dan joined in dancing to keep the people in the hotel entertained Dan also organised some sporting games including long jump and hop step and jumprp160 Dan wanted to leave Glenrowan when they knew the plan was not going to work because the train was late Ned Kelly let Thomas Curnow the school teacher go home to his wife Dan told his brother not to trust Curnow and to keep him at the hotel Instead of going home Curnow went to the railway and about 300am he was able to stop the train before it reached the broken railsrp158 The police quickly left the train and placed themselves around the hotel so that the Kelly Gang was trapped inside

When the bushrangers heard the train pull into the station they knew their plan to destroy the train had failed They put on their suits of armour and went on to the verandah of the hotel to wait for the policerp159 In the first few shots police Superintendent Hare Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne were wounded and Jack Jones son of the hotel owner was killed Ned Kelly who was dressed in his armour was able to leave the hotel and kept shooting at the police The police fired their guns into the hotel building for seven hours It is estimated that 15000 bullets were fired during the shooting Byrne died after being shot in the groin Ned Kelly went back to hotel but could not find Dan or Steve Hart who were hiding in a back room He again left and tried to find his horse Ned Kelly was shot in the legs as he searched outside for his brotherrp162 The police were then easily able to capture him

At 1000am there was a large crowd of people watching the action Police Inspector Sadleir was forced to stop the shooting to allow many of the hostages to escape He would not let Dans sister Maggie or a Catholic priest Father Gibney go into the hotel to tell the men to give themselves up Instead he ordered that a cannon be sent from Melbourne so that they could destroy the hotelrp162

At 230pm the police set fire to the building to try and make the rest of the Kelly Gang leave the buildingrp189 Father Gibney ignored the police and went into the burning buildingrp162 He found Dan Kelly and Steve Hart dead in a back room of the hotel He said their bodies were lying side by side their heads resting on blanketsrp162 Byrnes body was dragged out of the hotel but the bodies of Hart and Kelly were badly burned during the fire People who saw the burned and blackened bodies were unable to tell which was Dan Kelly and which was Steve Hartrp30 They were placed on sheets of bark from a tree and photographed Three Glenrowan people held prisoner inside the hotel died during the siegerp159 163

Family members including his sisters Kate and Maggie and friends took the bodies back to Gretarp195 The police tried to get the bodies back and sent a group of 16 policemen to Greta but they became worried that this would start another fight and they went back to Benallarp208 Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were buried in unmarked graves at Greta on 30 June 1880rp164 About 100 people were at the funeral with Dans cousin Tom Lloyd as the undertaker and a Greta farmer Daniel OKeefe acting as a preacher After the graves were filled in the whole area was ploughed over to keep the site of the graves hiddenrp206 The family was worried that the police would still try to get the bodies

After Glenrowan Dan Kelly and Steve Harts armour was taken by the police and kept at Benalla Ned Kellys armour was sent to Melbourne to be used at his trial Joe Byrnes armour was sent to the police depot in Richmond At the end of 1880 all the pieces were in Melbourne One set of armour was given to Sir William Clarke Over the years the pieces became mixed up In 2002 the State Library of Victoria and the police exchanged some pieces to try and get the sets complete The State Library has Neds armour Joes is still owned by the Clarke family and the police have Dan and Steves armour which can be seen at the Victoria Police Museum in Melbourne

Because it was not possible to prove how they died or that the bodies were really Dan and Steve there have been many stories about what might have happened It is possible they may have killed themselves This was the story that was used in the first Kelly film The Story of the Kelly Gang in 1906 and in the 2003 Ned Kelly movie There have also been stories that both survived the fire There is little evidence to support these claims One man James Ryan said he was Dan Kelly In 1934 he went on stage at the Brisbane Exhibition and told stories about the Kelly Gang He died on 29 July 1948 after being struck by a train The Ipswich City Council have put a memorial on his grave In 2001 scientists took a small piece of bone from the grave of Charles Devine Tindall at Toowoomba Queensland to see if they could find DNA to prove he was Dan Kelly Devine who had burn scars on his body told his family he was really Dan He said he had hidden under the floor of the Glenrowan hotel and escaped after the fire In October 1902 a Melbourne newspaper printed a story that Dan Kelly and Steve Hart were living in South Africa The men had fought in the Boer War Another man Jim Davis from Darra said in 1938 that he was Dan Kelly He claimed that he Steve Hart and Joe Byrne had escaped from the hotel He also said he was born at the Eureka Stockade in 1854 which makes him too old to have really been Dan

The story of Dan and Ned Kelly has been told many times There have been more books written about the Kelly Gang than any other event in Australian historyrp9 The very first full length movie in the world made in 1906 was The Story of the Kelly Gang In the 2003 Ned Kelly movie starring Heath Ledger as Ned Kelly the part of Dan Kelly was played by Laurence Kinlan Orlando Bloom played the part of Joe Byrne

One Hot Minute is the sixth studio album by American alternative rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers It was released on September 12 1995 by record label Warner Bros Records John Frusciante had left the band after their previous album Blood Sugar Sex Magik so Dave Navarro joined as the new guitarist

Red Hot Chili Peppers music was very different because of Navarro One Hot Minute is less about sex and love than the bands previous work but is instead about themes like drugs and depression It also had some heavy metal guitar riffs Anthony Kiedis had become addicted to cocaine and heroin in 1994 so some of the lyrics he wrote were about the effects of drugs

One Hot Minute did not sell many copies even though it reached number four on the Billboard 200 chart Blood Sugar Sex Magik sold twice as many copies as One Hot Minute In 1998 Navarro was asked to leave the band Red Hot Chili Peppers told the media it was because they and Navarro liked to make different kinds of music Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that One Hot Minute is as musically ambitious as Blood Sugar Sex Magik but is even more unfocused which means it provides the fewest thrills of any of the groups albums

Greta is a small town in Victoria Australia It is east of the city of Benalla The local government that looks after Greta is the Rural City of Wangaratta At the 2006 census there were 231 people living in and around Greta

The open block is a problem first described in Po Beyond Yes and No by Edward de Bono published in 1973

The problem is that in some cases people ignore certain things that may solve a problem because the already have an idea how the problem should be solved The may therefore not recognise certain solutions to the problem For example if a persons car breaks down the open block of being used to being in a car may cause them to wait for a taxi ignoring buses passing by without even reading the destinations

In this book de Bono suggested a number of techniques for overcoming the open block including going back and challenging assumptions as well as generating new ideas for addressing problems

The open block can be overcome by Lateral Thinking

Lateral thinking is a term invented by Edward de Bono a Maltese psychologist physician and writer It first appeared in the title of his book The Use of Lateral Thinking published in 1967 De Bono explains lateral thinking as methods of thinking about changing concepts and perception Lateral thinking is about reasoning that is not immediately obvious and about ideas that may not be obtainable by using only traditional step by step logic 

A period T is the time required for one complete cycle of vibration to pass a given point As the frequency of a wave increases the period of the wave decreases Frequency and Period are in reciprocal relationships and can be expressed mathematically as Period equals the Total time divided by the Number of cycles

Edward de Bono is a British physician author inventor and consultant He is best known because he invented the term lateral thinking He is also very much in favor to explicitly teach thinking in schools

Megalania is the largest terrestrial lizard known to have existed Judging from its size Megalania would have fed mostly upon medium to large sized animals including any of the giant marsupials like Diprotodon 

Ralph Molnar in 2004 determined a range of potential sizes for Megalania If it had a long thin tail like the Lace monitor then it would have reached a length of convert79mft while if its tail to body proportions were more similar to that of the Komodo dragon then a length of around convert7mft is more likely Taking the maximal 7 m length he estimated a weight of convert1940kglb with a leaner convert320kglb being average

This is twice the length of their closest living relative the Komodo dragon of eastern Indonesia

Alfred Lothar Wegener was a German scientist and meteorologist He was born in Berlin and in 1904 he earned his PhD in Astronomy at the University of Berlin In 1914 he was put into the German army but released from battle after he was severely wounded He is most notable for his theory of continental drift proposed in 1912 which hypothesized that the continents were slowly drifting around the Earth However at the time he was unable to demonstrate a mechanism for this movement this combined with not enough solid evidence meant that his hypothesis was not accepted until the 1950s when numerous discoveries provided evidence of continental drift

Wegener used geologic fossil and glacial evidence from opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean to support his theory of continental drift For example he said that there were geological similarities between the Appalachian Mountains in North America and the Scottish Highlands Also he said that the rock strata in South Africa and Brazil were similar

He believed these similarities could be explained only if these geologic features were once part of the same continent Wegener said that because they are less dense continents float on top of the denser rock of the ocean floor Although continental drift explained many of Wegeners observations he could not find scientific evidence to make a complete explanation of how continents move

Most scientists did not believe Wegeners theory and thought it was foolish Some critics thought the old theories of giant land bridges could explain the similarities among fossils in South America and Africa Others argued that Wegeners theory did not explain the forces that would have been needed to move continents to such great distances Wegener thought that the forces that moved the continents could be the same forces that made earthquakes and volcanic eruptions

During the 1950s discoveries of sea floor spreading and magnetic reversal proved that Wegeners theory was real and led to the theory of plate tectonics Today geologists say that continents are actually parts of moving tectonic plates that float on the asthenosphere a layer of partly molten rock

A Motte and bailey is a kind of castle or fortification Many of them were built in the 11th and 12th century around Europe These structures were made on a hill On this hill a keep of wood or stone was built This was easy to build and the materials were readily available and cheap However this meant they were easy to burn down Also wood rots when it gets wet so the structure doesnt often last long and need lots of repairing

The most famous story in which Orpheus figures is that of his wife Eurydice While fleeing from Aristaeus Eurydice ran into a nest of snakes which bit her fatally on her heel Distraught Orpheus played such sad songs and sang so mournfully that all the nymphs and gods wept On their advice Orpheus traveled to the underworld and by his music softened the hearts of Hades and Persephone who agreed to allow Eurydice to return with him to earth on one condition he should walk in front of her and not look back until they both had reached the upper world In his anxiety he forgot that both needed to be in the upper world and he turned to look at her and she vanished for the second time but now forever The story in this form belongs to the time of Virgil who first introduces the name of Aristaeus Other ancient writers however speak of Orpheus visit to the underworld according to Phaedrus in Platos Symposium the infernal gods only presented an apparition of Eurydice to him Ovid says that Eurydices death was not caused by fleeing from Aristaeus but by dancing with naiads on her wedding day

The story of Eurydice may actually be a late addition to the Orpheus myths In particular the name Eurudike recalls cult titles attached to Persephone The myth may have been mistakenly derived from another Orpheus legend in which he travels to Tartarus and charms the goddess Hecate

A gynoecium is the female reproductive part of a flower The male counterpart is called an androecium A gynoecium is composed of one or more pistils A pistil may consist of a single free carpel or be formed from a number of carpels that are fused The pistil itself is formed from the stigma style and ovary

A plant ovary is the part of the pistil which contains ovules The style is generally referred to as stalklike without ovules located between the ovary and the stigma In some plant species styles are not found in the pistils The stigma is the pollen receptor within the pistil at the top of the pistil Stigmas may be discretely defined structures or they may be within a region referred to as the stigmatic region 

Pistils or ovaries can be either simple meaning only one carpel or compound meaning two or more carpels

A carpel is the basic unit of the female reproductive organ of a flower the gynoecium A flower may have zero one or more carpels Multiple carpels may combine into a single pistil or into multiple pistils

The parts of the carpel are

A pistil is made up of a carpel or carpels A gynoecium that consists of a single free carpel is termed monocarpous That with two or more fused carpels is termed syncarpous However if the gynoecium consists of one or more free simple and distinct carpels each carpel makes an individual pistil and the gynoecium is termed apocarpous Fertilization of the ovule or ovules results in development of the carpel into a fruit

When two or more carpels are fused or joined together its called syncarpy In a compound pistil the carpels are fused together in one of two basic ways

A complicating factor in all of this is the fact that in some species syncarpy is present only at the base of the carpels the pistil being apocarpous in the upper part The manner of fusing of the carpels can also vary from one part of the pistil to another

The gynoecium the collective term for all the carpels is the innermost whorl of the parts of a flower and in many flowers the other parts are attached to the receptacle beneath the gynoecium In such cases where the ovary lies above the attachments of the other distinct floral parts the flower is described as hypogynous or as having a superior ovary In some species the other floral parts are fused to form a cup called a floral tube or hypanthium In these flowers the ovary lies physically lower than the lobes of the sepals and petals and below the point of attachment of the stamen filaments the ovary is still considered to be superior but the flower is termed perigynous

In those flowers in which the floral tube is fused with the ovary the sepals petals and stamens appear to grow out from the top of the ovary and the flower is said to be epigynous and have an inferior ovary Examples of plant families with inferior ovaries include orchid sunflower and cactus The position of the ovary is an important consideration in the identification and classification of plant species as well as the kind of fruit that develops after fertilization

The ovule which represents the megasporangium when mature consists of one or two coats surrounding the central nucellus except at the apex where an opening the micropyle is left The nucellus is a cellular tissue enveloping one large cell the embryo sac or megaspore The germination of the megaspore consists in the repeated division of its nucleus to form two groups of four one group at each end of the embryo sac One nucleus from each group the polar nucleus passes to the centre of the sac where the two fuse to form the so called definitive nucleus Of the three cells at the micropylar end of the sac all naked cells one is the egg cell or oosphere the other two which may be regarded as representing abortive egg cells are known as synergidae The three cells at the opposite end are known as antipodal cells and become invested with a cell wall

The carpel of a simple apocarpous gynoecium appears as a folded structure differentiated into a basal fertile part and an upper sterile part Various interpretations of the origin from a leaf like structure have been made but the important anatomical description is that of a variously folded tissue surrounding a cavity within which projects one or more ovules attached by or along a placenta Typically a carpel has two placentae An example of a simple carpel is that of a pea bean or Arabidopsis the fruit develops from the single carpel consisting of two rows of ovules aligned beside one another along the placental margin

In biology the cell is the basic structure of organisms All cells are made by other cells

The environment outside of the cell and the inside of the cell are separated by the cell membrane Inside some cells some parts of the cell stay separate from other parts by plasma membranes These separate parts are called organelles They each do different things in the cell Two examples are the nucleus and mitochondria

There are two basic kinds of cells prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells Prokaryotes bacteria and archaea are simple cells with no organelles but with bacterial microcompartments instead 

Eukaryotes are complex cells with many organelles and other structures in the cell Eukaryotes store their genetic information in the cell nucleus In a prokaryotic cell the DNA is not separated from the rest of the cell In general all living things that are made up of multiple cells are eukaryotes

The only kinds of prokaryotic organisms that survived to the present are bacteria and archaea Prokaryotic organisms evolved before eukaryotic organisms so at one point the world consisted of nothing but prokaryotic organisms

Unicellular organisms are made up of one cell Examples of unicellular organisms are

Unicellular organisms live without other cells to help them Many of these organisms need to

All organisms must

Some may

Multicellular organisms are made from many cells They are complex organisms This can be a small number of cells or millions of cells All plants and animals are multicellular organisms The cells of a multicellular organism are not all the same They have different shapes and sizes and do different work in the organism The cells are specialized This means they do only some kinds of work By themselves they cannot do everything that the organism needs to live They need other cells to do other work They live together but cannot live alone

Cells were discovered by Robert Hooke He used a compound microscope with two lenses to look at the structure of cork and to look at leaves and some insects He did this from about 1660 and reported it in his book Micrographica in 1665 He named cells after the Latin word cella meaning room He did this because he thought cells looked like small rooms

Many other naturalists and philosophers tried out the new instrument The structure of plants was investigated by Nehemiah Grew and Marcello Malpighi Grews major work was The anatomy of plants It is not clear who first saw animal cells Malpighi Jan Swammerdam or Antonie van Leeuwenhoek There is no doubt Swammerdam was looking at red blood cells by 1682 and probably earlier Malpighis observations of blood were earlier but are less clear p17

Leeuwenhoeks discoveries and drawings of little animalules opened up a whole new world for naturalists Protozoa and microorganisms generally were discovered and the discoveries about them are still going on today Christian Gottfried Ehrenbergs book Die Infusionsthierchen summarised what was known in 1838 Lorenz Oken in 1805 wrote that infusoria were the basis of all life 

The work of the Czech Jan Purkyn and his student and collaborator Gabriel Valentin was unjustly denigrated by the nationalistic Germans They have a claim to some priority in the cell theoryChapter 9 Johannes Mller also made great contributions It was however his student Theodor Schwann and Matthias Schleiden who got the credit for the cell theory despite the fact that some of their observations were not correct and their credits to previous workers were a travestyp97 As understood now the cell theory includes these important ideas

Their key works were published in 1838 and 1839 These ideas still are the basic ideas of cell theory

The body cells of metazoans divide by simple mitotic cell division Sexual reproduction is ancestral in eukaryotes and in metazoa it is carried out by specialised sex cells in a process called meiosis 

Prokaryotic cells reproduce using binary fission where the cell simply splits in half For both mitosis and binary fission the cell must replicate all of its genetic information so that each new cell will have a copy

The Masoretic Text is a copy of the Hebrew Bible that was written by the Masoretes between the 6th and 10th centuries

The Masoretic Text is an authority because it is the source for most translations of the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament

Before the first century CE there were some small differences between copies of the Hebrew Bible During first century CE Jewish Bible specialists agreed on the same words a process called standardisation

Between about 100 and 300 CE a group of Jewish Bible specialists called the Tannaim copied this Hebrew Bible Then between about 300 and 500 CE another group of Jewish Bible specialists called the Amoraim continued the work of the Tannaim The Masoretes then continued the Amoraims work for the next 500 years 

The Masoretes were very careful when they copied the Bible When they thought there was a mistake in the work of the Amoraim or the other specialists they wrote a note in the side of the book rather than change the book After they copied a book they counted the verses words and letters in each book to make sure there were no mistakes 

The Masoretes also added vowel points to make the Bible easier to read because the Hebrew writing does not show vowels

There were two main places where Masoretes worked Babylon and Israel The Masoretes also wrote book about the Bible called the Masorah

Golant is a small village in Cornwall United Kingdom It is in the parish of St Sampson on the banks of the Fowey estuary and between St Austell and Polperro The church in the villiage is dedicated to St Sampson

Golant railway station was at one time by the river to the south of the village It was served by trains on the Great Western Railways Fowey branch line from 1 July 1896 until 4 January 1965 The station has since been removed The space is now used for a car park

Annie Vernon the Olympic rower first learned her sport at Golants Castle Dore Rowing Club

Until very recently Golant has been almost unknown except to the people who live there and pilgrims and other walkers of the Saints Way Nearby there is a little used ford across the Fowey estuary In late summer 1644 during the first English Civil War war came to Golant and the area around the village A large group of about 10000 Parliamentary soldiers fought against the forces of King Charles on the peninsula between Lostwithiel St Blazey and Fowey King Charles was in the area at the time

The Saints Way is a long distance footpath in Cornwall in the United Kingdom

The Big Mac Index is an economic index It compares the purchasing power of two currencies It looks at how expensive a Big Mac is in different countries 

The Big Mac Index was first written about in The Economist magazine in September 1986 They have published the index each year since then The McDonalds Big Mac was chosen because it is made in a similar way with similar ingredients in many countries around the world

The exchange rate between two countries can be compared by dividing the price of a Big Mac in one country by the price of a Big Mac in another country This value is then compared with the actual exchange rate If the rate is lower then the first currency is under valued compared with the second currency Conversely if the rate is higher then the first currency is over valued

For example using figures in July 2008

Fellatio is oral sex on the penis of a man The opposite of this is cunnilingus Cunnilingus is oral sex on a woman Fellatio is often called a blow job Fellatio can continue until a man ejaculates or as part of foreplay before actual sexual intercourse 

There is no risk of getting pregnant by performing a fellatio because there is no connection from the mouth to the womb and the fallopian tubes There is however a large risk of transmitting diseases if the mouth comes in contact with semen on the penis If the person drinks alcoholic drinks it can make this risk higher HIV can also enter through open sores or bleeding gums 

Very few people are allergic to semen Some claim that swallowing ejaculate is an intimate act 

Diseases such as Chlamydia human papillomavirus gonorrhea herpes hepatitis and other sexually transmitted diseases as well as viruses such as HIV can be transmitted through oral sex The risk of transmitting HIV through fellatio is unknown but it is thought to be low Any kind of direct contact with body fluids of a person infected with HIV the virus that causes AIDS poses a risk of infection The risk from most of these types of infection however is generally considered far lower than that associated with vaginal or anal sex

If the receiving partner has wounds on their genitals or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in their mouth or bleeding gums this poses an increased risk of STD transmission Brushing the teeth flossing undergoing dental work or eating crunchy foods such as potato crisps relatively soon before or after giving fellatio can also increase the risk of transmission because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth These wounds even when they are microscopic increase the chances of contracting STDs that can be transmitted orally under these conditions Such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common bacteria and viruses found in around and secreted from the genital regions Because of this some medical professionals advise the use of condoms when performing or receiving fellatio with a partner whose STD status is unknown Flavoured condoms may be used for this purpose

Many people accuse someone of performing fellatio as an insult For example cock sucker or suck my dick Many cultures see fellatio as showing control over ones partner as often the giver is on their knees In ancient Greece it was called playing the flute The Moche people of ancient Peru practiced it regularlyfactdateJuly 2010 and made vases showing it

Halo 3 is a first person shooter video game made by Bungie Studios for the Xbox 360 published by Microsoft The game brings an end to the story started in the two previous video games of the Halo series Halo Combat Evolved and Halo 2 The game came out on September 25 2007 all over the world except Europe and Japan where it was released on September 26 Microsoft made 42 million copies of Halo 3 for the first day of sales to make sure there were enough copies

Sales of the game added up to over 900 billion USD in its first week More than a million people played the game on Xbox Live in the first 24 hours of its releaseBy January 1 2008 it had sold over 8 million copies making it the best selling video game of 2007The game was mostly well reviewed in the press It received a 94 out of 100 rating on Metacritic a website that puts many reviews together and gives an average score

The gameplay in Halo 3 is similar to the gameplay in Halo Combat Evolved and Halo 2 but with added features It is a first person shooter that takes place mostly on foot but with sections that have vehicles the player can drive A player can carry a range of weapons including sniper rifles rocket launchers grenades and alien weapons such as beam rifles and needlers Unlike the old games during multiplayer all weapons a player is carrying can be seen on the player This includes side holsters for pistols and larger weapons that can be slung across the players back Halo 3 also introduces support weapons large two handed weapons that slow the players movement but do a lot of damage Two examples include the flamethrower and a heavy machine gun which are new to Halo 3 The game also included a map editor called forge where players can create their own arenas and battlegrounds to fight in Almost all weapons and objects in a level can be moved or deleted in forge mode The game also has theater mode which lets players record some of their best kills or plays from multiplayer mode The last 20 games played are automatically saved although this feature needs an Xbox 360 hard drive to work These films can be uploaded to Bungies website where other people can download them and watch them on their PC

Halo 3s story mode contains nine levels It finishes the story of the Halo trilogy The story can be played alone with a friend on the same console or with four players over Xbox Live The first player takes control of Master Chief the second player plays as the leader of the Elites Arbiter and the last two as elites themselves There are skulls hidden through the levels If they are found by any of the players the gameplay changes in some way For example one skull makes confetti and balloons appear when a player gets a headshot and another makes all enemies stronger and tougher

A multiplayer game can have up to four people on one console or up to sixteen players over Xbox Live There are many different types of multiplayer games There is a death match where the goal is to kill all the players There are capture the flag games with two teams In capture the flag each team has their own flag The goal of the game is to steal the enemy flag and take it back to base to score a point Aside from these there are also team games These games can have two six or eight players on each team

There is a ranking system in Halo 3 that matches players with other players of the same ability to make sure it is a fair game The ranks are based on real life military ranks The lowest is corporal but players can progress all the way up to general Because multiplayer Halo is often played online there is a mute option which lets any one player blank out the voice of any other player if they are being insulting or annoying

The game is set in the same fictional world as the rest of the Halo series Most of the game takes place in the future year 2553 over 500 years from now In the storyline humans have developed faster than light travel and now live on many planets and moons of the Solar System When humanity started to build another settlement on a planet around another star they met the alien Covenant The Covenant declared religious war on humanity During Halo 2 the Covenant discovered Earth At the start of Halo 3 the Covenant are launching a full scale invasion of Earth 

The Halo of the games title is the name of a series of space super weapons built by a mysterious race called the Forerunners a long time before the game The Halos are the last defence against another alien race known as the Flood The Flood want to use every living thing in the galaxy for food The Halos are actually giant super weapons that when activated will kill all life in the galaxy This is the only way to stop the Floodto starve them by killing all their food The Covenant do not know this and are attempting to fire Halos as part of a wrong religious prophecy In the first Halo game Halo Combat Evolved the humans and Master Chief manage to stop the Covenant from firing one of the Halos They also destroy one of them in the process The destruction of one of the Halos starts an emergency The Halos can now all be fired from one place using a device called the Ark The Covenant still not understanding the truth launch an invasion of Earth where they believe the Ark is buried This is where the Halo 3 story starts

The main character of Halo 3 as in all the Halo games is Master Chief Master Chief is a super soldier the last surviving member of the Spartan Project The Spartan Project was started by humans to genetically using genes make soldiers who were stronger faster and tougher than any normal human Another character from Halo 1 and 2 controlled by the second player in a co op game is Arbiter the leader of the alien Elites In Halo 2 he is an enemy but in Halo 3 he joins forces with the humans Other returning characters include the veteran human soldier sagent Avery Johnson the AI Cortana the robot 343 Guilty Spark and the Gravemind dangerous leader of the Flood 

Halo 3 begins where Halo 2 left off The player once again plays as Master Chief as he falls towards Earth He crashes in Kenya near the city of Mombasa He is found by a squad of marines led by sergeant Avery Johnson the commander from Halo and Halo 2 The player and the marines fight their way through invading Covenant force to a human outpost Here they find human forces making a last attempt to stop the Covenant from activating a broken wikt linkportalportal they found buried in the Kenyan desert They are unsuccessful however and the Covenant open the portal to the Ark where they will be able to fire the Halos and destroy the galaxy Just after the Covenant fleet of spacecraft leave the portal a big ship crashes into the city of Mombasa This ship has been taken over by the Flood The player as Master Chief must fight their way into the ruined spacecraft and recover the robot Cortana who can tell them the way to re open the portal and follow the Covenant Once the player is successful the humans re open the portal and head after the Covenant to stop them firing the Halos Joining them is 343 Guilty Spark one of the robots who helped build the destroyed Halo from the first game Once through the portal the player and his allies discover the huge planet sized structure known as the Ark where all the Halos can be fired from Led by 343 Guilty Spark the player makes their way to the centre of the Ark where the Covenant leader the Prophet of Truth is preparing to fire 

Just as the player arrives to stop the Prophet of Truth the Flood infested ship High Charity arrives in an attempt to take over the Ark The player Arbiter and Johnson now take out all the Flood in the area before Arbiter kills the Prophet of Truth and prevents the Halos from being fired There is no time for the player to rest however as he must now head to the nuclear reactor at the center of the Flood infested spacecraft High Charity in an effort to kill the Flood Once this is complete the player and Arbiter must go and activate one Halo ring This will destroy the Ark and kill all the Flood in this area of the Milky Way Galaxy whilst saving the rest The player and the Arbiter head off to activate the single Halo and save the Galaxy When they arrive 343 Guilty Spark warns them that activating this Halo will destroy the whole Ark and the Halo itself The player ignores the warning This angers 343 Guilty Spark He kills Sergent Johnson and attempts to kill Master Chief to keephis Halo from being destroyed This is in effect the final boss battle of the game The player defeats the robot and activates the Halo A countdown starts but it too late for the player as Master Chief and the AI Cortana They manage to board a spacecraft to take them away but it is caught in the explosion and is split in two Master Chief is assumed dead 

If the player completes the game on any difficulty after the credits you see that the Master Chief and Cortana survived If you finish the game on the Legendary difficulty you can see an alternate ending after the credits

Eratosthenes of Cyrene 276BC194BC was a third century BC Greek mathematician geographer and astronomer He was head of the Library of Alexandria from 240BC until his death this was the most important library of the ancient world 

According to the Suda his contemporaries nicknamed him Beta because he was the second best in the world in almost any field Eratosthenes was a friend of Archimedes who also lived and worked in Alexandria Archimedes was the greatest mathematician and inventor of the age so perhaps the Beta nickname was not unjust

The works Eratosthenes wrote are known to us only indirectly the great Library was destroyed and no copies survived Strabo wrote about geography in antiquity He tells us that the works of Eratosthenes were On the measurement of the Earth and Geographica

Eratosthenes made several remarkable discoveries and inventions He was the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth and he invented a system of latitude and longitude He calculated the tilt of the earths axis he may also have accurately calculated the distance from the earth to the sun and invented the leap day He created a map of the world based on the available geographical knowledge of the era Eratosthenes was also the founder of scientific chronology he wanted to fix the dates of the chief literary and political events from the conquest of Troy

Eratosthenes measured the circumference of the earth without leaving Egypt He knew that on the summer solstice at local noon at the city now called Aswan on the Tropic of Cancer the sun would appear at the zenith directly overhead He also knew from measurement that in Alexandria the angle of elevation of the sun would be 150 of a full circle south of the zenith at the same time Assuming that Alexandria was due north of Syene he concluded that the distance from Alexandria to Syene must be 150 of the total circumference of the earth His estimated distance between the cities was 5000 stadia by estimating the time that he had taken to travel from Syene to Alexandria by camel He rounded the result to a final value of 700 stadia per degree which implies a circumference of 252000 stadia The exact size of the stadion he used is frequently argued The common Attic stadium was about 185 m which would imply a circumference of 46620 km which is 163 too large However if we assume that Eratosthenes used the Egyptian stadium of about 1575 m his measurement turns out to be 39375 km an error of less than 1 The method is an early application of trigonometry in the measurement science of geodesy

In mathematics the Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer It works efficiently for the smaller primes The sieve was described and attributed to Eratosthenes in the Introduction to Arithmetic by NicomachusrefNicomachus Introduction to arithmetic I 13 ref

Eratosthenes went further and computed the tilt of the Earths axis to within a degree This is the tilt which is the main cause of the annual climate cycle of spring summer autumn winter He also deduced the length of the year as 365 days He suggested that calendars should have a leap day every fourth year an idea taken up two centuries later by Julius Caesar

A tubule is a very small tube or fistular structure

A system of surface connected membranes in muscle that enables a nerve impulse to travel to the interior of the muscle fibre
