The Late 2000s financial crisis is an ongoing economic crisis Many economists say that it is the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression during the 1930s Many important businesses have shut down because of it which has caused many people to lose their jobs This means that people have been buying less which is very bad for the economy

There are many reasons economists think this happened Most economists believe that it started in the United States From 1997 to 2006 people bought very expensive houses even though they did not have enough money But because of the money coming in to the US from other countries it was easy to have good credit People used this credit for expensive home loans This created a housing bubble which made the price of houses rise more Because they had a lot of money the loaning companies made it easier to get a loan even if the borrower didnt have a good credit history These loans are called subprime loans

During this time many broken wikt linkhomeownerhomeowners refinanced their homes This means that their mortgage was changed so that they had lower interest After they refinanced homeowners could take out another mortgage to use as spending money The loaning companies changed their loans so that they had low interest at first which would increase later This is called adjustable rate mortgage The companies did this to try to convince more people to take loans Many people with subprime loans also took these adjustable rate mortgages hoping that the good price of housing would help them refinance later

While the housing prices were still high many American and European companies including banks invested in subprime loans These investments gave more money to the loaning companies who used it to give out more subprime loans These investments would make a lot of money as long as the prices of housing was high 

However the housing companies built too many houses This caused the price of housing to decrease beginning in the summer of 2006 When this happened many people were paying more money than their homes were worth This is called negative equity About 88 million homeowners in the US had 0 or negative equity by March 2008 This caused the number of foreclosures on homes to increase meaning that many people lost their homes During 2007 almost 13 million US homes could be foreclosed on The number of houses for sale continued to increase which made the prices decrease The homeowners with subprime loans left their houses with less value than they had when they were bought which meant that the loans were worth more money than the house This meant that the loaning companies were not able to make money from these houses

The collapse of the housing bubble caused the value of investments to fall The companies that had invested in subprime loans lost a total of about 512 billion Citigroup and Merrill Lynch were two of the companies which lost the most money More than half of the money lost 260 billion was lost by American firms

The HersheyChase experiments were a series of experiments started in 1952 by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase 

These experiments were to make sure that DNA was the genetic material which had been discovered by the Swiss physician Friedrich Miescher in his experiments on white blood cells or leukocytes between 1868 and 1869 Hershey shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries concerning the genetic structure of viruses

Hershey and Chase used T2 phage a bacteriophage for their experiments The phage infects a bacterium by attaching to it and injecting its genetic material into it

They put labels on phage DNA with radioactive Phosphorus 32 They then followed the phages while they infected E coli They found that the radioactive element was only in the bacteria and not in the phage

In a second experiment they put labels on the phage protein with radioactive Sulfur 35 After the phage was attached to the bacterium the radioactive element was found in the phage but not in the bacteria This showed them that genetic material which infects the bacteria is DNA

The word accent has more than one meaning Accent could mean any of the following

A diacritic is a mark put above below through or on a letter The word comes from the Greek diakritikos distinguishing

Usually it affects the way the word is said Most diacritics concern pronunciation because alphabets do not describe the sounds of words exactly Diacritics are rare in English but common in many other languages

Letter e common are the acute accent grave accent lve has acute grave and silent e The cedilla denotes a soft c 

A different principle is illustrated by the circumflex This denotes loss of letter eg maistre matre Thus its function is historical

In Spanish the acute accent simply signals stress eg educacin There the stress is on the last vowel not on the second to last Second to last vowel is the usual position for stress in spoken Spanish It is usually not signalled by an accent 

The tilde is pronounced like ny and counts as a letter in their dictionaries coming after n

The umlaut in German is pronounced ue and is less used in modern German Historical name spellings should always keep the umlaut if it was used for that name

The Scandinavian languages treat the characters with diacritics  and as new and separate letters of the alphabet and sort them after z Usually is sorted as equal to and is sorted as equal to Also aa when used as an alternative spelling to is sorted as such Other letters modified by diacritics are treated as variants of the underlying letter with the exception that is frequently sorted as y

Scripts such are the semitic languages Arabic and Hebrew have a wide variety of diacritics This is partly because the semitic languages were originally formed without separate letters for vowels and partly because some of the languages is spoken in a number of dialects 

The diacritics in Hebrew and Arabic are not always used however

The hermit crab is a type of crab that does not have a very hard shell Not a true crab they uses other animals old shells for protection they especially like old whelk shells As the hermit crab grows in size it must find a larger shell

The hermit crab is a crustacean but it is very different from other crustaceans While most crustaceans are covered from head to tail with a hard exoskeleton the hermit crab is missing part of its exoskeleton The back part where its abdomen is located is soft and squishy Thus the minute a hermit crab molts into an adult it sets out to find a shell in which to live

To get into the shell the hermit crab squeezes in backwards securing itself with its four back legs The back legs have hooks that anchor the hermit crab into the shell without difficulty The next four legs are used for walking while the front two are its chelipeds The chelipeds are not equal in size one is big and other is small The larger one is used for grabbing prey and guarding the entrance to its shell All together hermit crabs have a total of ten legs including the chelipeds and the rear legs used to anchor to the shell

There are about 500 different species of hermit crabs around the world and they have different colors often with patterns like stripes and dots on their bodies Most hermit crab species live on the ocean floor but many live on land Female terrestrial hermit crabs must return to the sea to breed

Hermit crabs are omnivores and scavengers They eat worms plankton and organic debris

Hermit crabs first appeared in the Cretaceous period before the Dinosaurs became extinct Fossils have been found where they have used Ammonite shells

The reproductive organs of hermit crabs are located near and just below the animals heart and open to the outside at the base of the last pair of walking legs in the male In the female they are located at the base of the middle pair of walking legs Female hermit crabs usually lay their eggs shortly after copulating but they can also store sperm for many months The eggs are fertilised as they are laid by passing through the chamber holding the sperm The eggs are carried and hatched in a mass attached to the abdomen inside the shell The number of eggs is usually large but depends on the animals size

Waves are composed of frequency amplitude and wave form It is equal to voices High frequency wave has high pitched tone Also wave that has big amplitude has loud sound By using microphone voices are converted to electronic signals And transmit tower transmit the electrocic signals to air The electronic signal is catched by a receiving set By using a speaker the electronic signal is changed to voice When the signal is transmitted telecaster amplify and alter the signals By altering the signal is changed to high frequency wave So we can not hear radio signals by using radio signal we can communicate with other people in a long distance because radio signal has high speed and because of high frequency radio signal do not damp easily when modulate voice to radio signal there are two way the amplitude modulation and frequency modulation Amplitude modulation do not change frequency It change amplitude like a voices wave form The using circuit is simple and the length that radio signal can reach is long but it has a weak point the radio wave can easily damaged by another waves frequency modulation means frequency is changed like voices wave form it is contrast to Amplitude modulation Amplitude modulations weak point would be a strong point of frequency modulation also Amplitude modulations strong point would be a weak point of frequency modulation

The radio signals are used to radio Television cell phone radio international broad casting aeronautical radio and vision of television use amplitude modulation to deliver in contrast voice of television and stereo broad casting use frequency modulation to deliver

South Thailand Insurgency is a violence that has happened in the 3 provinces of Thailand There are Naratiwat Pattanee and Yala There are many severe attacks There are ambush commit arson bomb terrorize and disturbance It has started on 7 November 2004 until now Its one of the biggest problems in Thailand The people are all interested about this and all pray that one day this problem will fade away from Thailand Its started from the conflict of Thai Muslim and disagreeable people That are effected to Thai Muslim for long time Since it has happened some families had to move out from the site because those bad people changed their life They were also scare of what would happen with them and their familys members Some families lose their fathers while the fathers were working However not only the people who have been related in this situation but even the adults Adults are used to be the equipment of these criminals Some schools have to close because the criminals always bomb the schools Thailand have wasted many brave soldiers by this situation Children cannot stay away from the houses Everything is changing In the pastThailand was a very peaceful country

A triode is a type of vacuum tube It differs from a vacuum tube diode which has only two electrodes by having a third electrode called the grid between the cathode and anode 

When the cathode is heated it gives out electrons Then the anode absorbs electrons This process makes an electric current which is controlled by the grid The addition of the grid allows the triode to be used as an amplifier

Lee De Forest invented this device in 1908 from his original two electrode Audion of 1906 The triode incorporates the key principle of amplification The name triode emerged because people needed to distinguish it from other similar vacuum tubes

The triode can not only do amplification but also work as part of an oscillator and detecting waves It is used in radios but the transistor has mostly replaced it starting in the 1960s It is an ancestor of the transistor It is still used in vacuum tube amplifiers

Baltistan also known as in the Balti language is a region in northern Pakistan It borders Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China It lies in the Karakoram mountains just to the south of K2 the worlds second highest mountain It is an extremely mountainous region with an average altitude of over 3350 m It is inhabited principally by Balti Shia Muslims of Tibetan broken wikt linkdescentdescent who converted from Tibetan Buddhism before the 16th century

Baltistan was an independent state but was occupied by the Raja of Kashmir in the nineteenth century In 1947 when India and Pakistan gained independence it was still part of Kashmir Now the region is divided between Pakistan and India 

All people of different races living in Baltistan are called Balti Greeks used the word Byaltae instead of sBal ti which in Tibetan means water gorge The historian Ptolemy who was also a general in the army of Alexander the Great had named the region in his book Baltistan is the Persian translation of Baltiyul The Homeland of Balti The people belonging to Balti nationality are settled on both banks of the river Indus from Kargil to Haramosh and from Karakoram range to Deosai plains In this nationality the majority comes from Tibetan origin However people migrated to this area in different periods of ancient times on account of different reasons and after merging in the prevailing Tibetan society gave birth to a new civilisation All these multi racial groups speak Balti language which is a branch of the ancient Tibetan language However in some rural areas the Sheen people still speak Shina language

The Balti are a very forbearing cheerful and hospitable people But during the Rmakpon reign they invaded Ladakh and Tibet many times

There are several Balti communities in Pakistans urban areas farther south that is in Lahore Islamabad in Karachi and other places

A Hydrogen car is a vehicle that uses hydrogen as its fuel for motive power A Hydrogen car does not have to be a car it can be any transportation vehicle that uses hydrogen in a similar way like an aircraft

Hydrogen Energy

Hydrogen is the simplest and the most abundant element in the universe Even though its simple and theres so much of it hydrogen does not occur naturally as a gas on the earth its always combined with other things Hydrogen is high in energy yet an engine that burns pure hydrogen produces almost no pollution Advantages of hydrogen energy

 We can get hydrogen from water by splitting it into oxygen and hydrogen so supplies are almost limitless

 As hydrogen is a diatomic molecule the product of combustion is only water Therefore it does not produce the harmful gasses that gasoline and diesel cars produce such as carbon dioxide

 Hydrogen itself is not poisonous Therefore in case of outflow hydrogen is safer than any other gas Disadvantages of hydrogen energy

 Its hard to store the large amount that is required to fuel a car

 Hydrogen is often taken from unrenewable resources like fossil fuels

The principles of Hydrogen Car What is a Fuel Cell

In principle fuel cells are electrochemical devices like batteries that convert the chemical energy of a fuel directly and very efficiently into electricity and heat thus doing away with combustion Unlike a battery a fuel cell does not run down or require recharging It will produce energy in the form of electricity and heat as long as fuel is supplied What is the Principle

A fuel cell consists of two electrodes sandwiched around an electrolyte Oxygen passes over one electrode and hydrogen over the other generating electricity water and heat Layers of materials with distinct electrochemical properties are sandwiched together to form a single galvanic cell At the heart lies a membrane that can only be crossed by charged molecules Gas permeable electrodes coated with a catalyst adhere to this membrane adding a layer on either side There electrodes are in turn connected to a device that can utilize electricity Hydrogen gas flows into channels on one face of the cell and migrates through that electrode while the same occurs with oxygen gas along the opposite electrode Spurred by a catalyst favorable chemistry causes the hydrogen to oxidize into hydrogen protons and give up its electrons to the neighboring electrode which thereby becomes the anode this buildup of negative charge then follows the path of least resistance via the external circuit to the other electrode It is this flow of electrons through a circuit that creates elecricity

Problem to solve for the practical use of hydrogen car

Most important problem involved in the practical use of hydrogen car is hydrogen storage materials If it uses a fuel cell that generates electricity through reaction between hydrogen and oxygen it does not matter However if method is that hydrogen is sprayed to internal combustion engine it does matter Now hydrogen storage tank with highest possibility is method using metal hydride Metal hydride is that reversible reaction between metal and hydrogen make new form of compound Now Hydrogen storing technology using Hydrogen storage compound metal comes to practical use step in the side of technical however hydrogen storing capacity per weight is no match for demand of user so this technology does not wide use yet Therefore that problem should be solved

Standard Definition Television is a kind of television system that provides lower resolution than HDTV and higher resolution than analog TV does The word SDTV is generally used at the digital television broadcasting system that has a similar or litle bit higher state of resolution to the analog television system Digital broadcasting system uses digital signals when they receive sound and movie It is compared to analog TV that uses analog signals

According to a ATSC standard SDTV broadcasts in three ways First at ratio of length and width 169 and resolution 704x480 Second at ratio 43 and resolution 704x480 Lastly at ratio 43 and resolution 640x480 The first one has best quality second one is next and the last one is the worst The Screens frame can be 24 30 60 per second These are similar level with DVD As I mentioned at the Definition tab it has a better resolution than analog TV system and has lower resolution than HDTV Because it is kind of digital boadcasting system it can broadcast not only analog TV program but also HDTV program It is compared to anlog TV that cant broadcast HDTV program

SDTV has a similar state of resolution compared to analog TV But SDTV is more vivid than analog TV because it has less noise And it has better sound The point that SDTV uses a digital broadcasting system makes SDTV have many accompaning functions For example multitasking electronic program guide and so on This functions are imposible at analog TV Compared to HDTV it has lower resolution But in fact HDTV programs are not spread widely yet and the cheaper price of SDTV makes consumers to use SDTV

Generally there are three types of TV They are analog TV SDTV and HDTV Price AnalogTV SDTV HDTV Quality AnalogTV SDTV HDTV AnalogTV only can be compatible with analog signals but both SDTV and HDTV can be compatible with not only analog but also digital signals

Thermocouple TC for short is a device that converts heat directly into electricity A thermocouple can also work in reverse  using an electric current to transform into heat as well as cold

Imagine that two wires made of different types of metal are connected at one end If the junction of the two wires is heated electricity will flow through the wire 

Electrons when heated will begin to cross the junction on their own Because of the different properties of the different metals the electrons will lose potential energy and gain kinetic energy just like a ball rolling over a hill to a lower area Although the voltage created by a thermocouple is very small many thermocouples can be hooked together to make a larger voltage This is called a thermopile

Thermocouples do not only generate electricity from heat They can also generate heat from electricity and even cold from electricity If two different wires are connected at both ends and some voltage source makes current flow through the loop one junction will get hot and the other junction will become cold The electrons at the hot junction are gaining kinetic energy as they cross the junction This is why they make the metal hot The electrons at the cold junction are losing kinetic energy as they cross the junction This is why they make the junction cold

Interestingly it is difficult to measure the precise voltage that a thermocouple is producing when heat is applied to its junction This is because any voltmeter wires that are connected to the thermocouple will probably be made of a different material than the wires of a thermocouple This means that the connection between the voltmeter and the thermoucouple is itself another thermocouple Engineers designing microchips face the problem that virtually every electrical connection on a microchip is a thermocouple whether they want it to be or not

Gas heaters with pilot flames are one of the most famous examples for the use of thermocouples Thermocouples are stacked to make a thermopile which can generate enough voltage from the heat of the pilot flame to keep the gas valve open which in turn supplies the gas for the pilot flame If the gas runs out the flame extinguishes and the voltage across the thermopile decreases which causes the electric gas valve to close Thermocouples are also used in other ways For instance they monitor temperatures in air conditioning and refrigerators and of CPUs in computers which could be destroyed by overheating

There are hundreds of thermocouples but only 8 of them are standardized internationally Type E type J type N type T and type K are base metals Types B R and S thermocouples use platinum or a platinumrhodium

Control engineering is the engineering field that focuses on mathematical modeling of systems of a various nature analyzing their dynamic behavior and using control theory to create a controller that will cause the systems to behave in a desired manner Modern control engineering is closely related to electrical electronic and computer engineering as electronic circuits can often be easily explained using control theory techniques And also it is related to biological unitControl engineering needs Electrical circuits antenaa and very small control unit And as engineering is developing control engineering is often desired For example there are automobile biologcal engineering wireless communication and etc

In most of the cases control engineers make use of feedback when designing control systems For example in an automobile with sail control the machines speed is continuously checked and fed back to the system which adjusts the motors spin power accordingly Also resently control system is used in nano technology And the field of control within chemical engineering is known as process control For example we can change chemical process fast and easily Many developments were invoked by this process control Like this Control engineering has a lot if fields that include science finance management and even human action 

So What is the important thing of control engineering The answer is feedback But control engineers may also work on the control of systems without feedback This is known as open loop control An open loop controller also called a non feedback controller is a type of controller which count its input into a system using only the current condition and its model of the system A classic example of open loop control is a washing machine that works through a scheduled cycle without the use of units

Electric vehicle is a vehicle that uses mainly the power of battery to AC or DC motor for driving It was invented first by British R Davidson in 1873 before gasoline vehicle being appeared But after the 1st World War it was hidden because of gasoline cars rapid progress 

Set in 80s While a pollution issue by cars exhaust gas comes to the front electric vehicle was presented to the solution But lack of Storage battery technology commercialization has been delayed However new storage battery technology was proceeded rapidly around the United States while possibility of new technology was created coming to the early 90s Specially in case of the United States in spite of companys strong opposition California governments legislated the ZEV regulation that oblige to use EV since 1998 Due to ZEV regulation development of electric vehicle has been regularized

There are 2 kinds of electric vehicle in recent The first kind is a vehicle that use fuel cell or solar cell which generate electricity directly from chemical reaction or heat The second kind is a vehicle that drive by storage batterys energy This vehicle use electric motor so there are no sound no vibration and no atmospheric contamination by exhaust gases from automobiles 

However batterys storage of electricity capability has limit and due to storage battery is so heavy and large energy efficiency is decreased Also It takes much time to recharge battery and mileage of a vehicle per 1 time recharge is short compared recharging time

Digital Multimedia Broadcasting or DMB is a technology that allows to send digital signals to mobile devices such as mobile phones This makes it possible to listen to radio or watch television on such devices

This technology was developed to replace earthly analog radio broadcasting But the technology can include more data in limited electric waves It can transmit not only sound data that original object but also DVD level movie data

DMB is based on Eureka 147 DAB standard which is the European standard and similar competing technologies is the mobile TV standard DVB H The earthly DMB is decided to the ETSI standard Now Republic of Korea can exercise for source of the DMB technology the satellite DMB broadcast first began in Japan than in the Republic of Korea In the March 13 2004 TU Media playing a leading role in business and satellite DMB insert the worlds first satellite for with Japans partner MBCo DMB hanbyeol However In Republic of Korea selection process for operators was long and put off service the MBCo in Japan became first DMB broadcasting country to start the full service all 40 of the channel from 19 October 2004

Now the digital multimedia broadcasting is divided by transmitting and receiving method the earthly DMB and satellite DMB earthly DMB is provided free of charge like current earthly radio broadcasting and the satellite DMB broadcast is provided in the form of the monthly fee In the Republic of Korea TU media obtain permission for satellite DMB broadcasting and is broadcasting

DMB can be received when attach DMB receiver to the vehicle or buy mobile phone has the ability to receive DMB personal portable receiver or receiver which type of output to the monitor when connect personal computer But there was a problem that the satellite DMB and earthly DMB is not compatible with each other so user should purchased each terminal separately However the Samsung throw open the door to watch satellite DMB and earthly DMB one of the terminals by come out with SPH B4100 But TU Media sidethe satellite DMB service provider rejected the plan the possibility of the activation of these two way receiving terminal is currently unclear

Compareing with terrestrial digital television and digital satellite broadcasting terrestrial digital television is clear screen even though you are on the high speed vehicles but it is limited with range and lack of channels is disadvantages

The rheas are flightless birds of the genus Rhea native to South America 

The Greater or American Rhea is a large flightless bird from forests of South America This ratite is the largest bird in the Americas It is a fast runner and when it runs its neck is almost horizontal to the ground Rheas congregate in flocks of 20 to 30 birds The Lesser or Darwins Rhea Rhea pennata is mostly found in the southern part of South America

Rheas eat mostly plants fruits seeds and nuts but also will also eat insects and other small animals

The female rhea lays 12 30 yellow cream eggs in a clutch The male digs the nest incubates the eggs and raises the chicks Rheas are mature at 2 years of age

It was once thought that ratites were all one monophyletic group which evolved together in Gondwana in the Upper Cretaceous Then they evolved in their separate ways as Gondwana split up and the parts drifted apart The parts became the modern southern continents plus Africa and the Indian subcontinent

However modern gene analysis conflicts with this DNA analysis shows that the ratites diverged from one another too recently to share a common Gondwanian ancestor However all analyses show that Rheas and the living AustralasianOceanian ratites are monophyletic

Kakapos are most active at night and like to be alone To keep other kakapos out of their territory they make a skraaarking sound The Kakapo can live for about 60 years

Kakapos are herbivores or animals who only eat plants They eat roots seeds leaves buds small pine cones fruit and flowers

Unlike other parrots male kakapos gather together to compete with the other males and to call females with a deep booming sound There are 2 to 3 eggs in each set of eggs laid The eggs are laid in a hollow part of a tree The female incubates the eggs for 10 weeks She only leaves the eggs when she leaves to find food

Kakapos had no natural enemies on the islands of New Zealand were they live and lost the ability to fly At one time there were many kakapos Now fewer than 100 kakapos still live in New Zealand It is a critically endangered species The decrease in the number of kakapos is mostly from predatory animals that settlers brought with them to New Zealand The kakapo was also eaten by Maori and European settlers 

At one point kakapos were almost wiped out Conservation efforts began in the 1890s but they were not very successful until the Kakapo Recovery Plan in the 1980s As of January 2009 surviving Kakapos are kept on two predator free islands Codfish and Anchor islands where they are closely monitored Two large Fiordland islands Resolution and Secretary have been prepared as self sustaining ecosystems for the Kakapo

Two of the most significant documentaries both made by NHNZ are Kakapo  Night Parrot and To Save the Kakapo The BBCs Natural History Unit also featured the Kakapo including a sequence with Sir David Attenborough in The Life of Birds It was also one of the endangered animals that Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine set out to find for the radio series and book Last Chance to See An updated version of the series has been produced for BBC TV in which Stephen Fry and Carwardine revisit the animals to see how they are getting on almost 20 years later and in January 2009 they spent time filming the Kakapo on Codfish Island

Stud poker is a variation of poker where players are typically dealt a total of five or seven cards with the best five card poker hand winning

Stud poker has neither community cards nor blinds Instead each player at the table must ante first and then is dealt two cards face down and one card face up In typical stud games the player with the lowest card showing must pay the bring in an amount relative to the limits which starts off the action

The bring in is typically a fraction of the limits with play then continuing clockwise around the table where players have the choice of folding calling the bring in or making the bet complete Once a bring in has been completed it can be raised by a subsequent player doubling the amount to twice the completed bet

Each player remaining in the hand is then dealt another card face up with the betting beginning with the player showing the highest two cards and proceeding clockwise around the table Again players can fold call or raise the bet In a five card stud game players are dealt two hole cards facedown then two cards face up with the fifth card being dealt facedown In a seven card stud game players are dealt two hole cards facedown then four cards face up with the seventh card being dealt facedown

Betting takes place between each dealt card and generally becomes a higher amount after the fourth card dealt  Each round of betting is typically referred to by the amount of cards a player has in front of them After the initial deal players are considered to be betting on third street represented by having three cards in front of them After the fourth card is dealt players would then be on fourth street and so on Stud poker is generally played as a limit game

The Id ego and super ego are ideas created by Sigmund Freud They are three concepts to explain the way the human mind works

Freud describes the human mind as interaction of id ego super ego The ego and to some extent the super ego is conscious or on the surface The id remains unconscious Together they make up the personality 

According to this model of the psyche the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends the ego is the organised realistic part and the super ego plays the critical and moralising role

The id ego and super ego are functions of the mind not parts of the brain They do not correspond one to one with actual structures of the kind dealt with by neuroscience

The id represents a constant in the personality as it is always present The id is governed by the pleasure principle 

Early in the development of his theory Freud saw sexual energy as the only source of energy for the id After the tragedy of World War I however Freud felt it necessary to add another instinct to the id So he proposed thanatos the death instinct Thanatos accounts for the instinctual violent urges of humankind Obviously the rest of the personality would have somehow to deal with these two instincts By adding thanatos he could describe more mental phenomena His idea of id affected a variety of fields

The id is unconscious by definition 

The ego is the surface of the personality the part you usually show the world The ego is governed by the reality principle or a practical approach to the world It seeks to turn the ids drive to behaviour which benefits in the long term rather than brings grief 

Conscious awareness resides in the ego although not all of the operations of the ego are conscious

The ego separates out what is real It helps us to organise our thoughts and make sense of them and the world around us 

But the ego serves three severe mastersthe external world the super ego and the id110 Its task is to find a balance between primitive drives and reality while satisfying the id and super ego Thus the ego driven by the id confined by the super ego repulsed by reality strugglesin bringing about harmony among the forces and influences working in and upon it and readily breaks out in anxiety1101

The Super ego aims for perfection It comprises that part of the personality mainly unconscious which includes the individuals ego ideals spiritual goals and the psychic agency that criticises and prohibits his or her drives fantasies feelings and actions 

The superego consists of two parts the conscience and the ego ideal The conscience is the familiar metaphor of angel and devil on each shoulder The conscience decides what course of action one should take The ego ideal is an idealized view of ones self Comparisons are made between the ego ideal and ones actual behavior Both parts of the super ego develop through experience with others or via social interactions According to Freud a strong super ego serves to inhibit the biological instincts of the id while a weak super ego gives in to the ids urgings Further the levels of guilt in the two cases above will be high and low respectively

The offices of Governor of West Punjab and Chief Minister of West Punjab lasted from August 15 1947 until 14th October 1955 The first Governor was Sir Francis Mudie with Iftikhar Hussain Khan as the first Chief Minister Both offices were abolished in 1955 when the province of West Pakistan was created The last Governor of West Punjab Mushtaq Ahmad Gurmani became the first Governor of West Pakistan

Although the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season was below average Hurricane Andrew was the exception to that This hurricane blasted the Bahamas southeast Florida and south central Louisiana taking a path extremely similar to Hurricane Betsy which also struck southern Florida and Louisiana However unlike Betsy Andrew did not make flooding in New Orleans Contrary to typical damage from Hurricane Andrew was caused almost entirely by high winds rather than storm surge in Florida and Louisiana This storm caused between 23 30 billion in damage and between 56 and 68 fatalities making Andrew the costliest Atlantic hurricane to hit the United States However Hurricane Katrina would later surpass Andrew in official damage amounts

Andrews devastating damage spawned many rumors including claims that hundreds or even thousands of migrant farm workers in south Dade County were killed and their deaths were not reported in official accounts An investigation by the Miami Herald found no basis for such rumors These rumors were probably based on the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane when the deaths of migrant workers initially went uncounted and were still debated at the time of Andrew

The slow response of federal aid to storm victims in southern Florida led Dade County emergency management director Kate Hale to famously exclaim at a nationally televised news conference Where in the hell is the cavalry on this one They keep saying were going to get supplies For Gods sake where are they Almost immediately President George H W Bush promised Help is on the way and mobile kitchens and tents along with units from the 82nd Airborne Division began pouring in

Insurance claims in the wake of the extreme damage caused by Andrew led to the bankruptcy and closure of 11 insurance agencies and drained an excessive amount of equity from 30 more Nearly one million residences were no longer eligible for coverage by any insurance agency This led the Florida Legislature to create new agencies to restore important insurance coverage

Homeowners and officials criticized developers and contractors for poor building practices and poor building codes An inquiry after the storm concluded that there were probably construction flaws in some buildings and that the state of Florida did enforce some strict building codes since 1986 but they were either overlooked or ignored However the evidence was not sufficient enough to issue criminal charges for neglect

The effects of Hurricane Andrew on Florida wetlands were considerable In the Florida Everglades 25 70000 acres of trees were knocked down by the storm It took 20 days for new trees and vegetation to grow following the storms passing Damage to marine life was moderate as the storm lowered the oxygen level in the water threatening many fish and other marine wildlife In addition the storm killed 182 million fish in the basin causing 160 million in lost value In the decade after the storm Hurricane Andrew may have contributed to the massive and sudden housing boom in Broward County Florida Located just north of Miami Dade County residents who had lost their homes moved to western sections of the county that were just starting to be developed The result was record growth in places like Miramar Pembroke Pines and WestonFactdateSeptember 2008

In Louisiana the hurricane knocked down 80 of the trees in part of the Atchafalaya River Basin near the coast Offshore the storm killed 94 million fish causing 78 million in lost value and damaged large areas of marshland along the Louisiana coast

About 6200 people had to be housed in 36 shelters according to the American Red Cross The Salvation Army sent in 37 mobile food storages that served 40000 meals to help those who could get little or no food

Federal aid from the Pentagon sent in four 750 kilowatt generators 2500 cots and 30000 MREs or prepackaged meals to Louisiana About 1279 National Guard were deployed to Louisiana to do various duties from cooking to patrolling

Sheriffs along the coast of Louisiana proposed a curfew from 6 pm to 6 am local time Alcohol sales were also stopped immediately after the storm

Because of exceptional and widespread damage in Florida and Louisiana the name Andrew was retired in the Spring of 1993 and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane The name was replaced by Alex for the 1998 season

Hurricane Gordon was a very damaging tropical storm for the Caribbean Florida and parts of North Carolina The storm was very slow moving on its path over the Caribbean This storm killed over 1100 people The storms strange motion was making Hurricane Gordon hard to forecast where it would actually go and where it would reach land Hurricane Gordon was the last storm of the inactive 1994 Season and the second most costly of the 1994 season even though the storm was a hurricane for only a few hours

On November 8 a tropical wave near Costa Rica became Tropical Depression Twelve On November 10th in made landfall near Puerto Cabezas Nicaragua The same day it became Tropical Storm Gordon after moving back into the Caribbean It made its first landfall near Kingston Jamaica on November 13 it soon made its second landfall in Guantanamo Bay Cuba on the same day The storm brushed the northern coast of Cuba and the southern islands of the Bahamas It made its third landfall in Key West Florida on November 15 Gordon turned northeast and made it fourth landfall in Fort Myers Florida the next day When Gordon crossed Florida it took about nine hours and it went into the Atlantic Ocean on a northeastward track Gordon stayed on that track until November 17 when it became Hurricane Gordon while it was about 245 miles southeast of Cape Fear North Carolina Shortly after becoming a hurricane it reached top winds of 85 mph and then brushed the coast of North Carolina Gordon weakened back to a tropical storm and started on a U shaped track Gordon weakened further into a tropical depression and on November 19 it made its fifth and last landfall near Vero Beach Florida and on November 21 Gordon died out while over South Carolina 

The damage in Haiti is unknown But in Haiti Hurricane Gordon killed about 1122 people The number is high likely because of mudslides and because of the deforestation of the forests in Haiti

Florida was where most of the damage was Damage in Florida was at about 400 million Gordon also crossed the state three times which is likely why the damage is that high 

In the spring of 1995 Gordon was not retired even though it caused lots of deaths in Haiti Since Gordon was not retired in 1994 the name Gordon was used again in 2000 and 2006 and will be again used in the 2012 hurricane season

Hurricane Diana was a category 4 tropical cyclone that hit the US east coast in 1984 Diana was a very unusual storm forecasters had many problems saying when and where it would strike 

In September of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season Diana became an intense tropical cyclone She had highest winds of convert136mphkmhlkon during its peak The storm made landfall in southeast North Carolina with winds between 88 to 100 mph The storm itself did not kill anyone but three deaths were caused by it Hurricane Diana was the first major hurricane in eastern North Carolina in almost three decades Although it was a category 4 hurricane it caused only 65 million in damage

White migr is a political term used to describe Russian people who left Russia because of the Russian Revolution or Civil War The term is used in France the United States and the United Kingdom Sometimes the term is used to describe everyone who left the country because of changes in the government

The words White migr had a very negative meaning in the Soviet Union between 1920 and 1980 After 1980 those people who left during that time are called first wave migrs

Many White migrs thought the White movement was something good Some of them the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries did not like the Bolsheviks but did not like the White movement either Others were just not interested in politics Many of those who left are still part of the Eastern Orthodox Church

Most White migrs left Russia between 1917 and 1920 Between 900000 and two million people left Many different classes of people left These classes included military soldiers and officers Cossacks intellectuals businessmen and landowners Officials of the Russian Imperial Government and anti Bolshevik governments of the Russian Civil War also left

Most migrs left Southern Russia and Ukraine and went to Turkey They then moved to eastern European Slavic countries for example the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Bulgaria Czechoslovakia and Poland A large number also went to Estonia Latvia Lithuania Finland Germany and France Berlin and Paris had large migr communities 

Many civilians and military officers in Siberia and the Far East moved to Shanghai and other surrounding areas of China Central Asia and Eastern Turkestan Some moved to Japan 

During and after World War II many Russian migrs moved to the United Kingdom the United States Canada Peru Brazil Argentina and Australia

White migrs often did not like Communism They did not believe the Soviet Union was properly Russian They believed the period of time from 1917 until 1991 was a time of occupation by the Soviet government which was internationalist and anti Christian

Many White migrs believed that Russia should be governed by a monarch Others thought that the government should be chosen by popular plebiscite

Many White migrs believed that their mission was to keep the culture and way of life from the time before the revolution while living in other countries They believe that by doing this they could return Russia to this culture when the Soviet Union was no longer in control of the country

A religious mission to the outside world was another idea used by the migrs Bishop John of Shanghai and San Francisco said at the 1938 All Diaspora Council

Many White migrs also believed that they should still fight against the Soviet dictatorship They hoped this would help free Russia This idea was largely inspired by General Pyotr Wrangel When the White army was defeated he said The battle for Russia has not ceased it has merely taken on new forms

White army veteran Captain Vasili Orekhov publisher of the Sentry journal wrote about this idea of responsibility with the following words

The migrs formed different organisations which had the purpose of fighting against the Soviet regime Examples of such organisations are the Russian All Military Union the Brotherhood of Russian Truth and the NTS This made the White migrs a target for infiltration by the Soviet secret police Seventy five White army veterans served as volunteers supporting Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War

Some White migrs adopted pro Soviet sympathies for which they were labelled Soviet patriots These people formed organizations such as the Mladorossi the Evraziitsi and the Smenovekhovtsi

During World War II many White migrs took part in the Russian Liberation Movement On the other hand a significant number participated in anti Nazi movements such as the French Resistance During the war the White migrs came into contact with former Soviet citizens from German occupied territories who used the German retreat as an opportunity to flee from the Soviet Union or were in Germany and Austria as POWs and forced labourers and preferred to stay in the West often referred to as the second wave of migrs This smaller second wave fairly quickly began to assimilate into the White migr community

After the war active anti Soviet combat was almost exclusively continued by NTS other organizations either dissolved or began concentrating exclusively on self preservation andor educating the youth Various youth organizations such as the Russian scouts in exile became functional in raising children with a background in pre Soviet Russian culture and heritage

The White migrs acting to preserve their church from Soviet influence formed the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad in 1924 The church continues its existence to this day acting as both the spiritual and cultural center of the Russian Orthodox community abroad On May 17 2007 the Act of Canonical Communion with the Moscow Patriarchate reestablished canonical ties between the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad and the Russian Church of the Moscow Patriarchate after more than eighty years of separation

Instrumentation includes finding the most appropriate measurement method designing and producing of the machine getting the required information and result of what has been measured by the calculation and take appropriate measures for that result Instrumentation means a lot more than measurement For example setting up the sulphur dioxide density measuring machine and getting the reading is measurement But how to use this machine which machine is to set up how many places to set up what to calculate with the reading in what situation it should sent the sign for alarm are problems handled by the instrumentation

An instrument is a tool used to measure and manage the variables in a process Instrumentation can be used to measure various variables like 

Examples of instruments are valves transmitters flame detectors and analyzers Valve is a device that helps with the flow of materials Transmitter is a electronic device or tool which sends or receives a signal through electromagnetic radiation Flame detector is a device which detects the flame by analyzing the color

Instrumentation is also studying about the control Control is like how valve is managing the amount of contents flowing through it and break controlling over the speed Control can change the parameter of the field or the variable

Sir Francis Forbes was the first Chief Justice of New South Wales Before he set up the court system in Australia people were tried by legal tribunals The town of Forbes New South Wales was named after him

Forbes was born in Bermuda in 1784 His grandfather Dr George Forbes had moved to the Bermudas after the Battle of Culloden He went to London at the age of 19 to study law He passed the exams and became a lawyer in 1812 He returned to Bermuda but went to back to England 3 years later In 1816 he was made the first Chief Justice of Newfoundland He lived in Canada until 1822 The government asked for his advice about setting up a proper legal system in Australia He was asked to be the first Chief Justice of New South Wales in June 1823 Forbes was officially given the job in October 1823

Forbes was Chief Justice from 13th October 1823 to 1st July 1837 He arrived in Sydney in March 1824 He lived with the Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane while his house was being got ready for him Forbes and Brisbane became great friends He officially opened the new Supreme Court on May 17 1824 He was also a member of the Legislative Council and was made President in August 1824 In December he was made a member of the Executive Council as well These two extra positions were political jobs and put him into conflict with his job as a judge As Chief Justice he had to be sure that new laws were in agreement with the laws of England This gave him the power to veto any new law in Australia This was not a problem while Brisbane was the Governor but Forbes soon had problems with the new Governor Sir Ralph Darling

Eraclea is a town in the province of Venice Veneto Italy SP42 goes through it Eraclea Mare is the Lido of Eraclea 

It is located on the Adriatic Sea near the coast between the rivers Piave and Livenza and between two famous touristic towns Caorle and Jesolo

Eracleamare one of the destinations of summer tourism on the Adriatic riviera is together with Jesolo and Caorle one of the best known seaside resort on the Venetian coast Within the last year a steady growth of foreign tourists especially from Germany has been recorded Also in 2010 Eracleamare has received the Blu Flag from the FEE 

Eraclea Mare is famous cause of its pinewood and Mort lagoon

The Mort Lagoon an extremely evocative naturalistic site between Eraclea and Jesolo was originated by the overflowing of the Piave river in 1936 whose bed was modified in its last stretch after a big flood The Mort stretches between Eraclea Mare and the mouth of the Piave river and it is a sea lagoon being supplied with water only by the flood tides Still uncontaminated the Mort is characterized by shallow and calm waters with a sandy and muddy seabed rich in phytoplankton

This is really a part of Faradays law expressions giving the magnitude of the induced emf have been stated but nothing has been said about the direction of  

The induced emf and the resulting induced current are counterclockwise when B is directed out from the page and the area of the circuit is decreasing The flux through this circuit is decreasing in the outward direction Now the induced current I produces its own magnetic field and we may use the right hand fist rule to compute the direction of this field The result is that the magnetic field due to the induced current is also directed outward within the circuit It is as though nature through this induced field tried to compensate for the reduction in the flux due to the applied field B This turns out experimentally to be a general rule so that we may say that

the direction of the induced emf is always such as to result in opposition to the change producing it

This is Lenzs law

As another example of the application of Lenzs law consider a coil of wire to which a battery is suddenly connected Suppose that the battery starts a current flowing clockwise as viewed by the observer This current will give rise to a magnetic field whose lines will thread the coil and circle back outside it Thus as the current due to the battery builds up there is a changing magnetic flux through the coil and this must result in an induced emf in the coil what is the direction of this induced emf Lenzs law tells us immediately that it must be counterclockwise so as to oppose the building up of the current Similarly when the current in a circuit is broken the induced emf seeks to keep the current from dying out and this accounts for the sparking observed when switches are opened slowly the induced emf in a circuit whose current is changing is called the back emf since it always opposes the alteration in the current It arises from the change in the currents own magnetic field and effect referred to as self inductance

Were Lenzs law not true an increase in current in a coil would result in an emf that aided the applied battery thus increasing the current further inducing more emf and further increases in the current ad infinitum This would be an unstable situation and one in which the conservation of energy principle would be disobeyed

This sort of reasoning may be extended to other situations in which a system in equilibrium is displaced and the principle arrived at is the following

when a system in equilibrium is disturbed the equilibrium is displaced in the direction which tends to undo the effects of the disturbance

This generalization of Lenzs law is called the principle of the Le Chatelier sometimes referred to as the law of the cussedness of nature It is however fortunate that it exists or we would live in a very strange and unstable world indeed

ABC Kids is a television programing block which broadcasts several different children series on the ABC television network These series are all owned by Disney which owns ABC Most of them are also shown on Disneys own network Disney Channel ABC Kids used to be called Disneys One Saturday Morning

On September 13 1997 Disneys One Saturday Morning started out as a two hour block on the ABC Saturday Morning lineup and aired some of the shows that aired on it In 1999 it was extended to 5 hours On September 6 1999 a spin off Disneys One Too aired on UPN and in syndication every weekday in the morning or afternoon and Sunday morning One Saturday Morning last aired on September 7 2002

On September 14 2002 Disney re named One Saturday Morning to ABC Kids

During the introduction to ABC Kids as well as other introductions on the block a tiny lightbulb icon would appear in a bottom corner of the screen and an announcer would say Illuminating Television stating the programming blocks educational programming The lightbulbs chain would be pulled by a hand and the lightbulb would have an animation etc

In the beginning of 2010 ABC Kids had a brand new extended schedule airing from Saturday through Sunday at 7 AM  12 PM ET and weekdays at 3 PM  7 PM that looks similar to the one used as of today Plus the ABC Kids Rock Stage was replaced by the wacky colorful 3D ABC Kids Studios Backlot This 3D Backlot and 3D animated ABC Kids logo was designed by John Lasseter was character rotoing by Blur Studios was animated at Pixar Animation Studios Disneys sibling company and creator of Toy Story and was music composed by Richard Band

Jackstones is a traditional Korean game It is usually played by girls The game is similar to the game Jacks Jackstones is played by girls in rural villages of Andhra Pradesh by the name of Achenagandlu or Achamgilla or Chintapikkala aata using small stones or Tamarind seeds 

The game is played with five stones Each stone is about the size of an almond Players can only use one hand to play the game The game has five parts or stages

In the first stage the player throws the stones on the ground They pick up one stone and throw it upward Before the stone falls onto the ground they need to pick up another stone from the ground and then catch the one that was thrown This is done again until there are no stones on the ground 

The second stage is the same with the first stage except that the player needs to pick up two stones at once before the stone which was thrown falls down The third and the fourth stages are the same 

In the fifth stage players can get points All of the stones are thrown upward The player must catch as many of the stones as they can with the back of their hand Then the stones they caught are thown into the air again and the player must catch all of them The player gets points for how many stones they catch If they caught 3 stones they get 3 points If they caught 4 stones they get four points After that the next player does the same When all players have done this the game is finished The person who has a higher point wins

Also there are several rules

If a player is out the next person gets the turn

Lorentzs law is a law discovered by the Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz Lorentzs law defines force that acts on moving charged particles in an electromagnetic field Force consists of magnetic force and electric force

F qE

If the charge is positive the direction of the electric force equal to direction of electric field

F qvB

The direction of the magnetic force is given by the right hand rule

If charged particles move with velocity v in an electric field E and a magnetic field B

F qE qvB

F force

q charge

E electric field

v velocity of particle

B magnetic field

Using this law JJ Thomson measured mass to charge ratio

Snells law is the scientific law of the refraction of light In optical science Snells law is about the relationship between each refractive index of light that passes the guard of two materials which are contacted When light with the isotropic medium advances different type of isotropic mediumthe ratio of sines of the incidence angle and the reflection angle does not change if a medium is fixed n2n1 sin1sin2 v1v2 n1n2 is each refractive index 12 is an incidence angle and an reflection angle v1 v2 is each velocity of different type of isotropic medium The velocity of light is fixed in vacuum and it comes to be slower while passing the specified substance Index of refraction of vacuum is 10 and the velocity of light in vacuum is C When the wave motion passes the material where the index of refraction is n the velocity of wave motion becomes the 10n C The Snells can be proved with principle of Fermats principle Fermats principle is The refraction occurs because light tends to advance with the direction that takes least time We can understand Fermats principle easy through the example when we run to the water from sands to save drawning person In this case Our speeds change the boundary of sands and water

Piet Mondrian was a Dutch modern artist of the De stijl group His early paintings show abstract landscapes in post impressionist and cubist style 

He painted in an increasingly abstract style until he finally achieved the style which made him famous By 1920 he adopts a totally abstract motif with an irregular checkerboard drawn with black lines and with the spaces paints mostly white or sometimes in the primary colors of blue red and yellow This style is geometric abstraction with primary color

Mondrian painted about 250 of these geometric abstracts from 1917 to 1944 Mondrian called his style neoplasticism

Escaping in 1940 from a Europe at war Mondrian spent the last four years of his life in New York City His paintings of that time express exuberance at city life In his final painting Broadway Boogie Woogie the checkerboard lines previously black are now painted blue gray red and yellow The yellow was apparently inspired by New Yorks Yellow cabs 

The 2004 Pacific hurricane season officially started May 15 2004 in the eastern Pacific and June 1 2004 in the central Pacific and lasted until November 30 2004 These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean 

Tropical Depression Five E formed south of Mexico on July 26 Later that day it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Darby and only four hours later at 2 am on July 27 is upgraded to Hurricane Darby It moved due west at this point aiming directly for the big island of Hawaii It reached Category 3 strength on July 29 the first major hurricane in the northeastern Pacific basin since 2002 However long before it reached Hawaii it lost strength and dissipated on the evening of July 31 

Tropical Depression ElevenE formed from a tropical wave about 400 mi southwest of Acapulco Mexico and headed northwest steadily strengthening as it did so Howard peaked briefly as a Category 4 and then started to weaken By the time Howard reached a point off the coast of the Baja peninsula it was only a tropical storm Howard weakened further becoming a tropical depression on September 5 and degenerated into a remnant low later that day The low hooked around and headed southwest Howard dissipated on September 10 without making landfall 

Tropical Depression Thirteen E formed out of an area of low pressure south southeast of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September 10 It slowly moved northwest being designated Tropical Storm Javier on the morning of September 11 It was upgraded to a hurricane on the afternoon of September 12 and peaked at Category 4 strength on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale after rapidly strengthening on September 13 

Warnings began to be issued on September 15 for Baja California While Javier peaked at Category 4 with windspeeds of 150 mph it weakened dramatically before striking land south of San Ignacio in Baja Sur as only a tropical depression Its remnants continued over Baja and inland 

An area of tropical disturbance centered about 90 miles south southwest of Puerto Angel Mexico developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen E on the afternoon of October 11 Due to its proximity attention was immediately paid to it and Mexico began issuing watches early the next day With the 2 pm PDT update on October 12 it was upgraded to a tropical storm and named Lester

It sat mainly stationary just off the coast of Mexico spending most of October 13 only 25 miles west of Acapulco In the afternoon it became clear that Lester was falling apart and with the 2 pm update even though it was still close to shore it was downgraded to a tropical depression and advisories ended as it rapidly disintegrated

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs premiered at the Carthay Circle Theater on December 21 1937 and was released to theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on February 4 1938 The story was adapted by storyboard artists Dorothy Ann Blank Richard Creedon Merrill De Maris Otto Englander Earl Hurd Dick Rickard Ted Sears and Webb Smith David Dodd Hand who later went on to direct the also beloved Bambi was the supervising director while William Cottrell Wilfred Jackson Larry Morey Perce Pearce and Ben Sharpsteen directed the movies different sequences

This was one of only two animated movies to rank in the American Film Institutes list of the 100 greatest American movies of all time in 1997 ranking number 49 It ranked higher in the lists 2007 update this time being the only traditionally animated movie on the list The following year AFI would name the movie as the greatest animated movie of all time

In 1989 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was added to the United States National Film Registry as being significant in culture history or aesthetics

An evil queen has a mirror and asks Mirror mirror on the wall whos the fairest of them all The mirror answers Snow White Snow White is lost in the woods and comes across the home of seven little men or dwarves She cleans their home and they allow her to stay with them The queen eventually finds out that the heart in the box is of a pig so she goes and changes herself onto an old hag She goes to the dwarfs cottage the next day while theyre out and gets Snow White to bite into an apple with makes her fall dead Suddenly the dwarfs chase the old hag up a cliff and trap her She tries to roll a boulder over them but lightening strikes and she dies Snow White is awakened by the kiss of a handsome prince

Development on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs began in early 1934 and in June 1934 Walt Disney announced the production of his first feature to the New York Times Before Snow White the Disney studio had been mainly involved in the production of highly successful animated shorts in the Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies series Disney hoped to enlarge his studios reputation and money by moving into features and estimated that Snow White could be produced for a budget of 250000  ten times the budget of an average Silly Symphony

Walt Disney had to fight to get the movie produced Both his brother Roy Disney and his wife Lillian attempted to talk him out of it and the Hollywood movie industry mockingly referred to the movie as Disneys Folly while it was in production He even had to mortgage his house to help finance the movies production which eventually ran up a total cost of just over 15 million a huge sum for a movie in 1937 

Unvoiced characters include Snow Whites animal friends the Queens raven and the vultures who follow the Witch However although the animals did not have human speaking voices their natural calls were very lifelike and were all voiced by champion whistler and animal mimic A Purves Pullen who would provide bird and animal calls for Disney movies for several decades Pullen also produced the bird calls for the Enchanted Tiki Room attractions at Disney theme parks During the 1940s and 1950s he performed as Dr Horatio Q Birdbath with the comedy band Spike Jones His City Slickers

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was first re released in 1944 in order to raise revenue for the Disney studio during the World War II period This re release set a tradition of re releasing Disney animated features every seven to ten years and Snow White was re released to theaters in 1952 1958 1967 1975 1983 1987 and 1993



Disneys wife Lillian told him that no one will go pay anything to see a dwarf picture Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs premiered at the Carthay Circle Theater on December 21 1937 to a very impressed audience many of the same people who called the movie Disneys Folly The movie received a prasie from many child actors audience that included Charlie Chaplin and Paulette Goddard Shirley Temple Mary Pickford Douglas Fairbanks Jr Judy Garland Ginger Rogers Jack Benny Fred MacMurray Clark Gable and Carole Lombard Burns and Allen Ed Sullivan Milton Berle John Barrymore and Marlene Dietrich Six days later Walt Disney and the seven dwarfs appeared on the cover of Time magazine The New York Times said Thank you very much Mr Disney RKO Radio Pictures put the movie into general release on February 4 1938 and it went on to become a huge box office success making more money than any other movie in 1938 In fact for a short time Snow White was the highest grossing movie in American cinema history until it was beat by Gone with the Wind in 1939 When taking inflation into account and including rereleases the movie still remains one of the top ten American movie moneymakers of all time

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was the first full length animated feature movie made in English and Technicolor and won an Academy Award for Walt Disney as a huge movie which has charmed millions and started a great new form of entertainment Disney won a full size Oscar statuette and seven small ones given to him by 10 year old child actress Shirley Temple

The movie was also nominated for Best Musical Score Some Day My Prince Will Come has become a jazz standard that has been performed by numerous artists including Buddy Rich Lee Wiley Oscar Peterson and Miles Davis

Noted moviemakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin praised the movie as a huge achievement in cinema The movie inspired Metro Goldwyn Mayer to produce its own fantasy movie The Wizard of Oz in 1939 The 1943 Merrie Melodies short Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs directed by Bob Clampett parodies Snow White by presenting the story with an all black cast singing a jazz score

In June 2008 the American Film Institute revealed its Ten top Tenthe best ten movies in ten classic American movie genres After polling over 1500 people from the creative community Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was acknowledged as the best movie in the animation genre

The character is described as both lethally charming good looking and utterly captivating as well as flirtatious cunning clever and a bit of an action man Within Doctor Who Jacks personality is light hearted although this changes in Torchwoods first series where he becomes a darker character In Torchwood Series 1 Jack has been shaped by his ongoing search for the Doctor and also by his role as a leader in which he is predominantly more aloof During The second series of Torchwood Jack became a much more light hearted character once again after appearances in Doctor Who where he was reunited with the Doctor 

From the Torchwood onwards Harkness wears period military clothes from the second World War including braces and an officers wool greatcoat in every appearance Costume designer Ray Holman comments that We always wanted to keep the World War Two hero look for him so all his outfits have a 1940s flavor We knew hed be running around a lot so I redesigned his RAF Group Captains greatcoat from Doctor Who to make it more fluid because the real things are very weighty The rest of Jacks costumes are loosely wartime based so he has big wartime trousers which are getting more and more styled to suit his figure There are actually five Captain Jack coats used on the show  one hero version which is used for most scenes one wetcoat made with a pre shrunk fabric a running coat which is slightly shorter so Johns heels do not catch when he runs and two stunt coats  which were hero coats back in Series 1

Discussing whether his character could ever find a soulmate John Barrowman refutes that Jack likes everybody and his love for each person is different He believes that Jack does harbour romantic feelings toward the Doctor but would never take that beyond infatuation and would never let the Doctor know Barrowman describes Jacks love for Ianto as lustful and if he ever were to settle down with him he would let Ianto know that he Jack has to play around on the side John Barrowman and Gareth David Lloyd have also opined that Jacks relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jacks empathy and helped to ground him In contrast if he settled down with Gwen hed have to commit completely to her this is why he does not act on his feelings for her because even though she would let him flirt with other people he could never afford to do anything more Eve Myles who portrays Gwen describes theirs as a palpable love and opines that with Jack and Gwen its the real thing and theyre going to make you wait for that Torchwood Series Two sees Jack promise both Gwen and Ianto that they were the reason he returned to Cardiff Barrowman claims that Jack also fancies fellow companion Martha Jones admiring her tenacity and willingness to spat with him and describes Jacks love for Toshiko and Owen as fatherly stating He was guiding them Thats why it was so devastating for him to lose them Offering reasons why Jack could never find The One Barrowman brings up the characters immortality He always loses them He outlives them They die He watches them get old That bothered him in Series One of Torchwood but now hes come to terms with that I think so now he just sleeps around

In several instances in Torchwood Jack displays no problems with killing a person of any species which within Doctor Who allows Jacks character to act in ways the lead character cannot When reuniting with the Doctor in the 2007 series he is verbally warned dont you dare when pointing a gun Witnessing the murder of his colleague Owen Jack shoots his killer in the forehead killing him in an act of quick revenge Whilst the Doctor tells Jack off for joining the Torchwood Institute Jack maintains that he reformed the Institute in the Doctors image Jack himself had initially been critical of the moral failings of a 19th century Torchwood

Hurricane Fico of the 1978 Pacific hurricane season was a tropical cyclone that caused damage in Hawaii

The hurricanes strength fluctuated but Fico stayed a major hurricane until July 17 when it entered the central Pacific as a Category 1 It slowly intensified and became a major hurricane yet again on the 21st At this point Fico turned to the northwest and slowly lost strength The storm dropped to a tropical storm early on July 28 and went extratropical later that day At a later date the remnants were enmeshed in a frontal system which headed towards the Aleutian Islands

Fico was a tropical cyclone for 20 days and travelled a distance of roughly 5500 mi both of which were records It was also a hurricane for 17 consecutive days Both of Ficos records have been broken Hurricane Tina and then Hurricane John outlasted Fico John also outran its distance record

Fico never made landfall Despite this it pounded the Big Island with 15 30 foot waves doing considerable damage to roads and buildings along the coast Smaller waves also broke on the southern shores of Maui with minimal effects Six people aboard a sloop were washed overboard and rescued while a tugboat was driven aground on a reef at Kukuiula A weakening Fico also caused a sharp wind gradient producing gusty gale force winds that blew across the islands knocking over trees and causing power outages Ficos extratropical remnants caused heavy rains and gales south of Cold Bay in the Aleutians

The name Fico was retired after this storm and replaced with Fabio in the 1982 season

Bayinnaungs made the Shan States part of the Burmese kingdoms This removed the threat of Shan raids into Upper Burma This had been a concern to Upper Burma since the late 13th century The kink took control of the Shan States in 1557 He put in an administrative system that took away much of the power of the Shan saophas The also made changes to some of their customs to make them similar to other customs in the kingdoms His policy for dealing with the Shan was used by all Burmese kings until the kingdom was taken control of by the British in 1885

He could not use this policy everywhere in his very large empire His empire was a group of former sovereign kingdoms The kings of each of the kingdoms were loyal to him He was the Cakravartin They were not loyal to the kingdom itself Siam left the kingdom three years after of his death in 1584 By 1599 all the sub kingdoms had left Bayinnaungs empire had ended

Tropical Storm Ana was the only tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean that began in the month of April Ana was the first tropical storm of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season Tropical Storm Ana was two kinds of storms a subtropical cyclone and a tropical cyclone It formed as a subtropical cyclone on April 20 while it was to the west of Bermuda It moved towards the east southeast and began to get better organized On April 21 the subtropical cyclone became a tropical cyclone Tropical Storm Ana then turned towards the east northeast It quickly lost strength because of wind shear and a close cold front On April 24 Ana became an extratropical cyclone 

The storm moved near Bermuda while causing light rainfall The remnants of the storm also dropped rain in the Azores and the United Kingdom Stormy sea waters caused by the storm capsized a boat near Florida coastline The incident killed two people

A low pressure area formed to the south and southwest of Bermuda on April 18 A trough which is a type of weather system brought an area of clouds into the low pressure system The low pressure system moved towards the north After turning towards the northwest the weather system looped southeastward Thunderstorm activity became stronger near the center of the cyclone The storm was named Subtropical Storm Ana on April 20 while located about 250 miles west of Bermuda

The subtropical storm moved to the east southeastward and it continued to get stronger It is estimated that Ana became a tropical storm by 0000 UTC on April 21 When it became a tropical cyclone Ana reached its highest winds of 60 mph Shortly after Ana came close to Bermuda Strong wind shear began to remove a lot of the thunderstorm activity from Ana Ana continued to move eastward and early on April 22 the wind shear again removed the thunderstorms from the center of the storm After turning towards the northeast the core of Ana merged with a cold front on April 24 Because of t his Tropical Storm Ana turned into an extratropical cyclone The remnants of the cyclone sped towards the east northeastward before it died out on April 27

Before Ana was formed the government of Bermuda declared a gale warning for the island When Ana formed a tropical storm warning was also issued for Bermuda The storm moved close to Bermuda and dropped 263 inches of rainfall the Bermuda International Airport The winds on the island were light 

Stormy seas from the storm reached the coast of Florida in the United States A couple of factors which included the stormy seas caused a boat to capsize in Jupiter Inlet Two people on the ship drowned and the others were rescued The remnants of Ana dropped 087 inches of rainfall in the city of Ponta Delgada in the Azores Clouds from the remnants of Ana also caused rain in the United Kingdom Two ships experienced tropical storm force winds because of Ana

Ana was the second subtropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin in the month of April When the storm became a tropical cyclone it was also the first Atlantic tropical storm in the month of April Because the damage from Ana was not bad the name Ana was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization The name Ana was used again in 2009

The Hymenoptera is one of the larger orders of insect It includes the wasps bees ants and sawflies There are over 130000 recognised species with many more remaining to be described The name is derived from the Greek words hymen meaning membrane and ptera meaning wings The hindwings are connected to the forewings by a series of hooks called hamuli

Females typically have a special ovipositor for inserting eggs into hosts or otherwise inaccessible places The ovipositor is often modified into a stinger The young develop through complete metamorphosis that is they have a worm like larval stage and an inactive pupal stage before they mature

These are the sawflies the most primitive Hymenoptera Their adults do not have a narrow waist between the thorax and abdomen The females ovipositor is adapted to burrowing or sawing into the substrate usually plant tissue 

These the bees wasps and ants have a waist between the thorax and abdomen They are by far the most numerous Hymenoptera and include the famous groups of colonial insects In fact the group with the most species is not colonial it is the vast number of parasitoid wasps such as the Ichneumons

Hymenoptera originated in the Triassic the oldest fossils belong to the Sawfly family Xyelidae Social hymenopterans appeared during the Cretaceous

Syrian Americans are citizens of the United States of Syrian ancestry or nationality This ethnic group includes Americans of Syrian ancestry Syrian first generation immigrants or descendants of Syrians who immigrated to the United States It is believed that Syrians first arrived in the United States in large numberwas in 1880 Many of the earliest Syrian Americans settled in New York Boston and Detroit Immigration from Syria to the United States was stopped for a long time after the United States Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1924 which made it very had to immigrate 

More than forty years later the Immigration Act of 1965 removed the quotas and immigration from Syria to the United States increased very much It is estimated that 64600 Syrians immigrated to the United States between 1961 and 2000

Most of the Syrian immigrants to the US from 1880 to 1960 were Christian a small minority were Jewish Muslim Syrians arrived in the United States mostly after 1965 According to the United States 2000 Census there were 142897 Americans of Syrian ancestry about 12 of the Arab population in the United States

It is believed that the first Syrian immigrants arrived in the United States from Greater Syria in the 1880s and worked as peddlers selling linen and other similar types of goods Before 1920 the area now known as Syria was actually part of Greater Syria an area which included the four modern countries of Lebanon Jordan Palestine and Syria itself Most immigrants from the region were classified as Syrian even though they were not ethnic Syrian some were even registered as Syrian Turks as Syria was under Ottoman rule for 400 years Because of this there is some when trying to work out how many Syrians arrived in the early years

Most of the early Syrian immigrants came from Christian villages around Mount Lebanon According to historian Philip Hitti approximately 90000 Syrians arrived in the United States between 1899 and 1919 An estimated 1000 official entries per year came from the governorates of Damascus and Aleppo which are governorates in modern day Syria in the period between 1900 and 1916 Early immigrants settled mainly in Eastern United States in the cities of New York City Boston and Detroit and the Paterson NJ area

According to the United States 2000 Census there are 142897 Americans of Syrian ancestry living in the United States New York City has the biggest concentration of Syrian Americans in the United States Other urban areas including Boston Dearborn New Orleans Toledo Cedar Rapids and Houston have large Syrian populations Syrian Americans are also numerous in Southern California and Arizona

The first Syrian immigrants to the United States wore traditional clothing this along with the fact that they tended to work as peddlers led to some xenophobia Dr A J McLaughlin the United States health officer at Marine Hospital described Syrians as parasites in their peddling habits US authorities claimed that Syrians had no right to become naturalized because they were Asian and did not belong to the white race However Syrians reacted quickly to assimilate fully into their new culture Immigrants Anglicized their names adopted the English language and common Christian denominations

Syrians did not stay together in urban areas many of the immigrants who had worked as peddlers were in contact with Americans on a daily basis This helped them to absorb and learn the language and customs of their new homeland Also military service during World War I and World War II helped assimilation Assimilation of early Syrian immigrants was so successful that it has become difficult to recognize the ancestors of many families which have become completely Americanized

After 1965 Immigration was mostly Muslim and unlike their Christian counterparts they found it a bit harder assimilating because of their Islamic faith and the anti assimilationist trend in America of the 1960s and 1970s Also they are fond of their identity as Arabs which might be a result of the bloom in multiculturalism to respect their Islamic religious customs and traditions in the United States 

Syrians are mainly Arabic speakers While some may speak the formal literary Arabic many Syrians speak Syrian Arabic a dialect which belongs to the Levantine Arabic family of dialects There are also sub dialects in Syrian Arabic for example people from Aleppo have a distinct accent one that differs considerably from that of people from Homs or Al Hasakah Syrians can usually understand the dialects of most Arabs especially those who speak any form of Levantine Arabic 

Many old Syrian American families no longer speak Arabic because many parents do not teach their children Arabic Newer immigrants however maintain their language traditions The 2000 census shows that 799 of Syrian Americans speak English very well Throughout the United States there are schools which offer Arabic language classes there are also some Eastern Orthodox churches which hold Arabic services Also to note Syria and Lebanon were briefly under French rule between 1918 and 1943 when they obtained independence so many Syrian Americans are familiar with the French language

The dipole antenna is one of the most important and commonly used type of radio antenna It is widely used on its own It is also used in many other radio antenna designs where it forms the radiating or driven element for the antenna

The dipole antenna is made of two poles into which radio frequency current flows This current and the voltage causes an electromagnetic or radio signal to be radiated Being more specific a dipole is usually an antenna that uses a resonant length of conductor This conductor is cut so it can be connected to the what is sending the signal For resonance the length of the conductor is an odd number of half wavelengths long In most cases a single half wavelength is used

The length of a dipole is very important for selecting the frequency that the antenna will work at The antenna is an electrical half wavelength or multiple of half wavelengths This is not the same length as the wavelength for a signal travelling through air There are a number of reasons for this This means that an antenna will be a small amount shorter than the length calculated for a wave moving in air

For a half wave dipole the length for a wave moving in air is calculated This number is multiplied by a factor A A is normally between 096 and 098 It is affected by the ratio of the length of the antenna to the thickness of the wire or tube used poles

Dipole antennas are used for many different things These include television antennas shortwave radio antennas and whip antennas

Analog signal processors are used for quickly manipulating signals that can be very complex to handle any other way A Comparator is used to offer level triggers correct down to microvolts with reaction times in the picoseconds Analog filters offer anti aliasing in sampled value systems as inputs and outputs and can be as pre filters in audio and communications Analog multipliers and dividers are used to offer brief gain control radiometric function or continuous energy measurement with surprising accuracy Over voltage protection applications can protect the front end of analog transmissionreceiver systems multiplexers Amplification and filtering for noise removal are the main feature of analog signal processing

In 1845 German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff described two laws In electromagnetic fields these laws are generalizations of Ohms law These Kirchhoffs circuit law are very useful in solving circuit problems

The first law is Kirchhoffs current law Kirchhoffs current law is also known as Kirchhoffs first law and Kirchhoffs junction law This law states that The sum of current into a junction equals the sum of current out of the junction This is the same as Kirchhoffs junction law In a junction the electric charges sum preservation law is applied If the entering value of the current is i2 and i3 this current splits into the current of i1 and i4 Then the equation is satisfied The right picture gives an example This Kirchhoffs first law is that charge is not destroyed or created in a junction point This is based by an electric charge preservation law 

Another is Kirchhoffs voltage law Kirchhoffs voltage law is also known as Kirchhoffs second law a closed circuit law and Kirchhoffs loop law The algebraic sum of the voltage differences in any loop must equal zero Any complex circuit can be divided into many closed circuits This law means that in the circuit there is an electric cell and electric resistance The electric cell gives the charge a electromotive force and then the electric resistance dissipates this force But in electric resistance if the direction is opposite of the currents direction this electric resistance adds to the electromotive force This Kirchhoffs second law is based on potential energy preservation law

Peter Henlein was a locksmith and watchmaker from Nuremberg He is often said to be the inventor of the watch This is disputed Henlein was certainly one of the first makers of the watch Although many say that Henlein invented the mainspring there are descriptions and two surviving examples show that spring driven clocks had already been made by the early 1400s He did make improvements to the balance spring which made it possible to make the watches smaller

Around 1504 to 1508 Henlein did make a watch a small drum shaped Taschenuhr It could run for forty hours before it needed rewinding They were small enough to be worn around the neck or carried in a bag or pocket His watch only had an hour hand

Microfabrication is made up of the words micro and fabrication 

Micro is a prefix meaning that it is a millionth of the size of the original amount For example a micrometre is one millionth the size of a metre and a microgram is one millionth the size of a gram So it means very small 

Fabrication means making or producing goods or equipment from various different materials

So microfabrication means making things which are very small

Historically the earliest micromanufacturing was used to make the different parts of a computer circuit board

The cavity magnetron is a high powered vacuum tube that makes microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field The resonant cavity magnetron type of the earlier magnetron tube was invented by John Randall and Harry Boot in 1940 The high power of pulses from the cavity magnetron made centimetre band radar practical Shorter wavelength radars allowed the finding of smaller objects The small cavity magnetron tube made the size of radar sets much smaller so that they could be put into in aircraft and ships used to find submarines At present cavity magnetrons are commonly used in microwave ovens and in various radar applications

The Politics of Pakistan has seen many changes over the years The military have sometimes been running the country Recently however the country has returned to democratic rule

Pakistan is a federal republic at the moment the President of Pakistan is the head of state and the Prime Minister is head of government

The President of Pakistan is the head of state of Pakistan Pakistan has a parliamentary form of government According to the Constitution the President is chosen by the Electoral College to serve a five year term The electoral college is made up of the Senate National Assembly and the provincial assemblies

The position of president in Pakistan has usually been one of a figurehead That is with real power being given to the Prime Minister However the power of the president has changed over the years due to the military changing the role

In 1947 Pakistan became a dominion and part of the British Commonwealth with the British Monarch as head of state represented by the Governor General of Pakistan In 1956 Pakistan established its first constitution and became a Republic and the Queen and Governor General were replaced by the president

Pakistans first president was Iskander Mirza who was also the last Governor General In 1958 he removed the constitution and declared martial law A few weeks later he was overthrown by General Ayub Khan who then declared himself president The constitution was changed and the president became the ruler of Pakistan The constitution also said that the president be elected by the people Elections were held in 1963 and Khan defeated Fatima Jinnah sister of founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah

Empedocles was a Greek pre Socratic philosopher and a person who lived in Agrigentum a Greek colony in Sicily 

Empedocles philosophy is best known for being the origin of the cosmogenic theory of the four classical elements He also proposed powers called Love and Strife which would act as forces to bring about the mixture and separation of the elements These physical speculations were part of a history of the universe which also dealt with the origin and development of life 

Influenced by the Pythagoreans he supported the doctrine of reincarnation Empedocles is generally considered the last Greek philosopher to record his ideas in verse Some of his work still survives today more so than in the case of any other Presocratic philosopher Empedocles death was mythologized by ancient writers and has been the subject of a number of literary treatments

Forensic psychology is a branch of psychology that focuses on how psychology is related to the law The main part of forensic psychology is working with the criminal justice system in order to better study the human mind and crime Most of a forensic psychologists time is spent in a courtroom working as a witness for the court answering questions based on the interviews and discussions with people suspected of a crime The job of the forensic psychologist is to decide on the suspects ability to stand trial and his or her thoughts about the crime A forensic psychologist acts as an expert who uses psychology to study a suspect to see if they were capable of doing the crime in question

Forensic psychology has some major roles in a court that bring psychology into a legal arena The first is malingering a defendant is pretending to have a mental illness or is lying to the court about his state of mind A forensic psychologist keeps in mind that a defendant may have a mental disorder but also keeps in mind to watch for signs of deception or errors in the defendants story Another job of a forensic psychologist is to investigate the state of mind of the defendant at the time he or she committed the crime Another is to see whether or not the defendant is able to be charged with the crimes due to his or her mental condition Another job is to evaluate the defendant to see if he or she are able to be rehabilitated or if they might commit the crime again These are a few of the jobs that forensic psychologists do Their work in and out of courtrooms and with police and criminals extends to all different directions in the world of criminal justice and evidence

Opportunity cost is the value of the next best thing after making a decision The idea of an opportunity cost was first begun by John Stuart Mill The utility has to be more than the opportunity cost for it to be a good choice in economics

In other words opportunity cost is how much leisure time we give up to work Because leisure and income are both valued we have to decide whether to work or do what we want Going to work implies more income but less leisure Staying at home is more leisure yet less income

Different types of underwater diving include 

Static electricity means the increase of electric charge on the surface of objects This electric charge remains on an object until it either flows into the ground or loses its charge quickly by a discharge Charge exchange can happen in conditions like when different objects are rubbed and separated A static charge will only remain when one of the surfaces has a high resistance to electrical flow The effects of static electricity are familiar to most people because they can see feel and even hear the spark This spark happens when the excess charge is neutralized This neutralization occurs when excess charge flows into an electrical conductor Other charge flow occurs when a charged object is near a region with an excess charge of the opposite polarity The familiar phenomenon of a static shock is caused by the neutralization of charge

In Greek age Thales found static electricity when he was cleaning his amber But at that time they did not pay attention to this and research it They just knew that rubbing something made a pulling force Earnest research into static electricity was started in the 17th century when Otto von Guericke made the first friction generator And in the 18th century Coulomb started research into a fixed quantity of static electricity Benjamin Franklin associated static electricity with storms In 1832 Michael Faraday published the results of his experiment on the identity of electricities This report proved that the electricity made by using a magnet voltaic electricity produced by a battery and static electricity are all the same Since Faradays result the history of static electricity can be thought as the study of electricity in general

Many situations can cause static electricity

1 Contact makes charge separation

Most materials have a unique chemical attraction for electrons Because of this rubbing different materials can cause charge separation The material will have a positive charge if it has a lower attraction for electrons than the other material

2 Pressure makes charge separation 

Strong enough pressure make a separation of charge in certain types of materials like crystals and ceramics molecules 

3 Heat makes charge separation

Heating certain materials can give electrons power By this power electrons break free from atoms The atoms losing electrons become a positive charge

4 Charge makes charge separation 

A charged object can make a neutral object have charge separation Charges of the same sign repel each other and charges of the opposite sign attract each other This force makes the part of the neutral object that is near the charged object have opposite charge of the charged object This force rapidly weakens if the two objects move away from each other The effect occurs most when the neutral object has a charge which can move freely

Static discharge is excess charge that is neutralized by a flow of charges from or to the surroundings Positive charges get electrons from the surroundings and negative charges lose their electrons to the surroundings

The feeling of a static electric shock is caused by the stimulation of nerves as the neutralizing current flows through the human body Due to the presence of much water in the body the charge is generally not enough to cause a dangerously high current Lightning is also an example of static discharge A cloud gets a very huge charge by clashing with other clouds It gives off the excess charge to the ground But this huge charge never occurs in the humans surroundings naturally unless he is struck by the lightning

Despite the apparently harmless nature of static electricity there can be significant risks in research because a large charge can break down the equipment

Modular arithmetic is a way doing arithmetic with integers Much like a clock once the numbers reach a certain value called modulus they go back to zero The first person to talk about modular arithmetic was Carl Friedrich Gau

In modular arithmetic a particular base is used This base is the modulus With a clock the base is 12 and the numbers that can be used are 0 through 11 The base can be any number greater Zero

Modulo is sometimes said to be the remainder of the integer division of two integers It is the remainder of the number divided by the base For example 19 modulo 12 is the remainder when 19 is divided by 12 The answer to that question is 7 19 divided by 12 is 1 with a remainder of 7 The formula to find a numbers value is written as number mod base value The value is the remainder after the division of number base

Numbers in modular arithmetic are shown as numberbase or number mod base

or as

Examples of modular arithmetic

Modular arithmetic can be also be used to show the idea of congruence Two numbers a and b are congruent modulo n if they have the same remainder when they are divided by n For example the numbers 22 and 34 are congruent because if they are divided by 12 they both have a remainder of 10 

Modular arithmetic is useful in many fields of science Most notably is is useful in cryptography computer science chemistry music

I know Im not the only user who is sick and tired of the bot like IP Pakistan editor He is a regular contributor but he has never created any account to my knowledge he creates POV articles full of red links to non notable topics and worst of all hes started adding dead images Hes never commented on a talk page despite having numerous blocks and numerous editors trying to communicate Eptalon has unlike me assumed that the editor will get better with time I strongly disagree anything will change If this was one logged in user hed have a block log a mile long and we should really be considering a ban and revertremove any edits this user makes Frankly well be much better off without his biased badly formatted articles on non notable Pakistan related topics Majorly talk 1730 25 November 2008

edit conflict Yes the IPs she edits from in the 92xxxxxxx range are in Manchester I dont think the user deserves a block For one thing much of the material on Wikipedia about Pakistan is contributed by this editor and I think that this is of high value to the Encyclopedia Although some of the behavior exhibited by the user is not very favorable I think that blocking him will be ineffective and wrong POV material should not be deleted but kept and maybe an Indian point of view or something should be added I think an encyclopedia cannot be completely without point of view and that it should cover many sides Minority viewpoints should have a brief mention as well if they have been published As for the dead images they were probably in articles copied from Enwiki and can be removed

The image inclusion is probably the insertion of an image he saw at enwiki and he is probably learning how to include images Give this editor some time Poorly formatted does not mean that the content is useless It just gives you something to do As for non notable not all his topics are non notable

Matilda We should take the educational approach trying to get this editor to communicate with us Since you clearly do not advocate that practice and instead want to go on about petty nonsense like NPOV that has no basis in reality you should not involve yourself in this sensitive case You do not take an approach that negotiates with the editor and you seem to think that if he doesnt respond to the warnings then he should be blocked This is just another reason that I would not trust you as an administrator knowing that you want this editor blocked The editor clearly has trouble with something either the language being used to communicate with him is too complex or someone told him not to chat or talk to anybody but just to complete the assignment or he works for some organization and doesnt know anything about Wikipedia He might just learn differently No matter what the last thing we should do is block

If the material was copied from Enwiki but it happened not to have belonged here either then it should be deleted That still doesnt make the Pak editor a plagiarist To consider copies from enwiki of perfectly legitimate material plagiarism is unnecessary rules following in my opinion I do however think material should be simplified if it was copied from Enwiki That is our job

Our focus should not be following the rules no matter what If the rules get in the way of our primary objective which is to get him to communicate with us and to learn then we are not obligated to follow them unless they are law For instance the NPOV thing Your focus on rules and rules only is the going on about petty nonsense thing 

We should not template warn him That is the issue that I have with AErn fatsoen All he does is template warn and consider everything that doesnt fit the typical Wikipedia mold to be vandalism The educational approach is not to warn with templates

I refer to this edit by Gwib with the edit summary ENWP template of the same name has it Accepted by some as anatomically correct so should have a link Disagree I thought so Simple Talk which reinserts the article Grfenberg spot into the templateReproductive system and thereby claims that the concept is an anatomical fact Per our article a fact is something that is true or real 

We provide three reliable references to support the fact that Doctors who specialise in the anatomy of women say there is no anatomical evidence for the spot The authors of the book who popularised the concept were psychologists a nurse and a sex counsellor  not experts in the field of anatomy 

As per our policy at WikipediaNeutral point of view many things most people believe are wrong  agreeing is not truth Facts must be checked Popular belief does not make something true Some people believe in a Flat Earth Others believe in Creationism We have articles on the topic but we do not put forward the idea that they are true I do not believe we should inaccurately promulgate the modern gynecologic myth by claiming something as anatomy when it is yet to be proven to the satisfaction of medical science

Simple English wikipedia is not only for people learning English I know it says that it is for children too but it seems like it is more geared toward foreigners from my reading of the summary I think you should think again about your summary of this wiki I am sure others will agree that most people learning English read in their own language as most of my foreign friends do To say they cannot read in their own language is nonsense there are so many languages covered here bar one or two853113711 0944 2 December 2008

Hello everyone I thought I would let you all know that I will be less active from next week I have a new job which will be taking up more of my time Right now I work at a reception desk so when there is no customers I have no work to do so I browse wikipedia Unfortunately my new job has a lot more responsibilty I will be a housing officer getting tenants to pay their rent and evicting those who dont So I will not be able to browse here much after next week as I will be out on home visits and in interviews I will still try to be active at the weekends though and will occasionally pop in when it is quiet too Regards Kennedy 0958 2 December 2008

Lol couldnt resist the title

Anyway just to update you all

Ive recently been inactive due to exams and personal reasons so DYK has not been too active

I am now back and I completed an update yesterday Ive also now worked through all current noms and added some to the next I aim to get an update about every three days although sometimes this may mean that I self nom self approve or slightly relax the criteria

Im also looking for more people to help out both with noms and the actual reviewing and updating If you want to help add your name to WikipediaDid you know and if youre unsure of what to do drop me a line Im also going to refresh that list periodically so that only those active are listed

Finally a question there has been talk of protecting everything that is Main Paged As it is DYK is run by mainly non admins and indeed I would struggle with doing it if it was protected So a should it be protected and b if it is would anyone be opposed to be requesting sysop early for the sole purpose of DYK and Main Page updating I would then re apply when I felt I was ready for the rest 

So that should bring you up to speed 

Thanks

Looking at the ShockingHawk unblockmentor section a major problem cropped up Did You Know is a part of our main page This is a part of the public face we present to all of our readers and speaks heavily for us This page should be something to be proud of and it is a page we should well protect There in lies an issue 

DYK hooks are included on the page They should be properly inspected and verified well before being accepted

Total time 1 hour and 12 minutes

This hook went from nomination to being archived and queued up for inclusion on the Main Page in a total of 74 minutes In less than an hour and a half we are making changes to the main page with only the input of a single voice There was practically no chance for anyone to have any opinion against this being made a part of our main page 

The quality of any one hook is not the issue This may be a great hook and it may deserve it place on the Main Page but the fact it only one person had a chance to decide if this was the case before this nomination got swept under the rug and archived Ample time needs to be provided to give anyone reasonable time to voice their opinion No one should be prevented from discussing a matter as important as our main page just because it was brought up and archived while they were running out to grab a bite to eat Time frames need to be set Two to three days is not forever when it comes to thing like this We take a week to decide to delete a non blatant page and yet it take an hour to decide to alter the main page and archive the discussion I do not see this as a good thing  Creol 0832 10 December 2008 Yes I have a suggestion As per the comments laid above two editors should endorse before they are archived Any editor listed at WPDYK may archive at that time after a 48 hour gap This isnt about you at all this is about DYK and the process PeterSymonds 1123 10 December 2008

The Gentoo Penguin is a species of penguin easily recognized by the white stripe similar to a bonnet across its head They are the largest penguins of the stiff tailed family which also makes them the largest penguin outside of the two giant penguins the Emperor Penguin and the King Penguin

The Gentoo penguin is on average 5 kilograms in weight and 80 centimeters in height but can range from 85 kg to 45 kg and 51 to 91 cm They have very large male reproductive organs and are also the fastest at swimming underwater among the penguins reaching speeds of 36 kilometers per hour

Gentoo penguins generally live on Antarctic islands with their largest colony on the Falkland Islands There are approximately 320000 breeding pairs of Gentoo penguins

These penguins nest on the ground making nests of stones sticks grass feathers and various other materials They usually lay two eggs by mid October which hatch in about 34 days and put equal care into caring for either chick Young chicks remain in the nest for 3 to 4 weeks until their second down feathers grow in during which their parents hunt for food in order to feed them Afterward they leave the nest but remain in the colony in groups of chicks called creches that free their parents to hunt for food for them

Gentoo penguin pairs often stay together for a long period of time

Gentoo penguins usually eat crustaceans such as krill but are known to eat what is easiest to obtain At sea they may be under attack from sea lions leopard seals and orcas While on land they have no natural predators but skua gulls and other birds of prey have been known to attack and eat young chicks and eggs

Fruit bats are flying mammals that live in dense forests in Africa Europe Australia and Asia There are about 166 species of fruit bats Fruit bats are sometimes known as flying foxes These bats live in huge colonies known as camps These nocturnal animals rest during the day while hanging upside down from their feet

As fruit bats fly from plant to plant getting food they also pollinate the plants they visit In addition they disperse the plants seeds as they eat Many plants including some avocados dates mangos and peaches are dependent on these bats for either pollination or seed dispersal

Fruit bats mostly eat fruit juice and flower nectar They chew the fruit then spit out the seeds peel and pulp Fruit bats like other Megachiropteran bats use the sense of smell to find their food fruit andor nectar Although they have large eyes and can see well fruit bats do not use sight as their primary sense

The first recorded human outbreak of Ebola virus was in 1976 but the source of the virus is still unknown However recent tests have shown that some species of fruit bats collected during Ebola outbreaks show the bats have the virus but do not show any signs of it Further studies also show that Ebola can reproduce in fruit bats and other bats in the Tadarida genus This could mean that the bats are the source of the virus The Marburg virus which is related to Ebola has also been found in fruit bats in Uganda

Another explanation is that fruit bats could be an intermediate host because of the uncertainty that fruit bats are the index case for Ebola It is also important to note that certain species of fruit bats in Africa are immune to the Ebola virus and that their DNA or RNA are similar to the Zaire Ebola virus This could explain the spread to humans since people in that region tend to eat fruit bats

Foundation means a starting point The verb to found means to create to bring into existence We speak of The founder of a college

A tall building must have a strong foundation if it is to stand for a long time If a castle is built on rock it has all the foundation it needs But if it is built on sand it will soon fall

To make a foundation we normally dig a trench in the ground digging deeper and deeper until we come to subsoil which is more solid than the topsoil that we use to grow plants and crops When the trench is deep enough we fill it with any strong hard material we can find Sometimes we pour in concrete into the trench which we strengthen even more by first putting long thin round pieces of steel into the trench When the concrete dries the steel acts like the bones in our bodies to tie the foundation together We call this reinforced concrete

Once the foundation has been packed down tightly or dried hard we can begin to build

FileNSFsvgthumbleft160pxNational Science FoundationA foundation can also be a kind of company set up to carry out charity or research work A foundation is usually endowed which means it is given a large sum of money to do its work An example is the Rockefeller Foundation The Rockefeller family made their money from banking and oil and their family foundation is endowed with a very great sum of money The people running the foundation think of ways to use the money to help charities the arts or whatever they like

Another example is the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation Bill Gates made a fortune from Microsoft the computer company He and his wife now spend nearly all their time giving away the money he has made to projects like education in the United States and treating AIDS in Third World countries

The Gray Whale is a baleen whale that has a layer of blubber up to 10 inches thick Because a mother gray whale would defend her calf so broken wikt linkfiercefiercely it would actually attack whalers and overturn their boats whalers often called the gray whale a devilfish 

The gray whale migrates from cold waters to the tropics each year in pods Gray whales are very agile swimmers They can dive for up to 30 minutes and go 500 feet deep Gray whales make grunts clicks and whistling sounds which may be used to communicate with other gray whales

This giant cetacean eats small fish crustaceans squid and other tiny organisms that it finds on the sea floor It sieves its food through its comb like plates of baleen

Compared to most baleen whales gray whales are rather small growing to be only about 45 feet long They are easy to see with their gray broken wikt linkmottledmottled color which is actually more charcoal black than it is gray Gray whales have lots of barnacles and lice on their skin However scientists say the lice and barnacles do not harm the whale and it is possible they may actually help the whale by feeding off of dead skin which the whale needs to get rid of

Whales prefer one fin over the other just like humans are right handed or left handed It is possible to see whether a gray whale is left fineed or right finned The fin that has least barnacles is the fin it uses most This is because the whale likes to dive down to the ocean floor to broken wikt linkscoopscoop up huge amounts of sand from the bottom broken wikt linkfilterfiltering out small broken wikt linkcreaturecreatures that live in it When the whale does this many of the barnacles on the side that rubbed along the bottom are scraped off So whichever side has least barnacles is the side the whale prefers to use when it digs up sand

Gray whales make a really long migration from the Arctic Ocean to the coast of Mexico and back each year They travel about 20000 km each year staying near the coast They feed in the cold Arctic waters and calve and mate in the warm protected tropical lagoons of the Pacific Ocean off Mexico

Basking sharks are filter feeders that sieve small animals from the water As a basking shark swims with its mouth open masses of water filled with prey flow through its mouth The prey includes plankton baby fish and fish eggs After closing its mouth the shark uses gill rakers that filter the nourishment from the water Basking sharks have hundreds of teeth but they are tiny and are of little use

Chamber Taluka is an administrative subdivision of Tando Allahyar District in the Sindh province of Pakistan The city of Chambar is the capital 

A fortress is a building designed to be defended which means it was very hard for enemies to get inside It kept the people inside safe There is little difference between a fortress and a castle Fortresses normally have very high thick stone walls There were very small windows without glass so that soldiers inside could fire out through them As time passed the weapons they used changed from bow and arrow crossbow gun or cannon Because these windows were so small it was very hard for the soldiers outside to fire in The people defending the fortress were also able to drop things like rock and boiling oil on the heads of those below

Fortresses were not designed to be comfortable houses They were dark and often damp The Tower of London is an example of a fortress

Hurricane Nora was the first hurricane to a significant danger to the Continental United States since Kathleen in 1976 

Part of a tropical wave that contributed to the formation of Hurricane Erika in the Atlantic moved into the Pacific and organized into Tropical Depression 16 E on September 16 and Tropical Storm Nora that same day Nora became a hurricane in a favourable environment September 18 while moving northwest Its motion then stalled over an upwelling of cooler water that weakened itrefNHCNoraErika

On September 20 Nora again started moving It reached its peak intensity of 115 knots and 950 mb On September 21 and 22 it moved over the wake of Hurricane Linda This weakened the storm pack down to a Category 1refNHCNoraIntensity

During this time a trough developed that turned Nora to the northeast This carried Nora over a favourable environment and towards Baja California After restrengthening slightly Nora made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane near Punta Eugenia and again south of San Fernando both times as a hurricanerefNHCNoraLandfalls

Nora stayed a tropical storm as it moved into the United States Yuma reported sustained gale force winds Rains were heavy sometimes exceeding the annual rainfall for the area Nora weakened to a depression while over California and it dissipated September 26refNHCNoraRainfall

Nora killed two people in Mexico One was killed by a downed power line in Mexicali and the other was a scuba diving in underwater currents No one in the United States was directly killed by Nora However the California Highway Patrol attributed several traffic accident deaths to the weatherrefNHCNoraUSADeaths

There was extensive damage to areas hit by Nora Waves ruined dozens of homes Roughly 350 to 400 people were left homeless in San Felipe and winds uprooted trees and peeled roofs from homes in Puerto PeascorefNHCNoraDamageToPuertoPenasco

In the United States thousands were left without power in California and Arizona and 16 telephone poles were downed in Seeley Streets flooded in San Diego Indio El Centro and Palm Springs A remnant circulation continued aloft and damaged trees and three homes in Utah Total damages were several hundred million dollars as well as 40 million dollars to lemon treesrefNHCNoraTotalCost

Nora crossed an area of abnormally warm water near the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula It restrengthened slightly before making its first landfall near Baha Tortugas Baja California Sur When Nora was inland the area of the storm located in the Gulf of California began to reintensify Hurricane Nora then made a second landfall about 60 miles south southeast of San Fernando Baja California

At landfall a trough was accelerating Nora northwards causing it to reach a forward speed of 30 mph Late on September 25 still a tropical storm it entered the continental United States at the California Arizona state line Nora began to weaken rapidly and was downgraded to a tropical depression three hours later while located between Blythe and Needles California Nora reached Arizona while still tropical becoming the third known system to do so Nora degenerated over land and the low level center moved towards the north northeast A remnant circulation aloft persisted however and was likely responsible for a period of near hurricane force winds observed at the NWS Cedar City Utah Doppler weather radar The remnants gradually became more diffuse over the following two days while moving generally northeastward through portions of Utah Colorado Idaho and Wyoming

On September 24 Arizona Governor Jane Dee Hull activated an emergency response center to prepare the states response to the flash flooding the storm would cause on the dry desert floor and Yuma residents began to fill approximately 55000 sandbags to contain the possible flooding Hull also activated the states National Guard and sent drinking water and electric generators to Yuma Farther inland the National Weather Service issued flash flood watches for western Arizona southeastern California southwestern Colorado southern Nevada and southern Utah on September 26

In the United States there were no direct deaths blamed on the hurricane However the California Highway Patrol attributed three or four traffic fatalities in southern California to the weather

Guity Novin is a Persian Canadian painter and sculptor She has started a movement in painting that she has named Transpressionism She was born in Kermanshah Iran in 1944 She now lives and works in Vancouver and Toronto Guity Novin was graduated from the Faculty of Fine Arts in Tehran in 1970 After leaving Iran she moved to The Hague Netherlands in 1975 and then to Manchester UK where she completed her studies

She moved to Canada in 1980 and lived and exhibited in Kingston Montreal and Ottawa and finally settled in Vancouver British Columbia

She has introduced the Transpressionism style in 1994 By using this style she tries to convey her passionate philosophical ideas The work of Guity Novin is full of inspiration and revelation The viewer can feel the feeling of a universe that is not completely unfamiliar This is an ideal universe As an artist Guity Novin knows how to interpret the myths and legends These are produced by our common human experiences They remind us that the true art is at the service of humanity Her work is a search in our collective human memories to find out what is it that connect us and forces us to live in peace and harmony Such memories unite us in our experiences of our pains and joys The Transpressionist works are made to open up to us this ideal world and finally to extend the areas of unexplored possibilities ImageGuity2jpgDream III by Guity Novin ImageGuityjpgNude with Horse 

Transpressionism is an artistic movement that was introduced by Guity Novin in Ottawa in the late 20th century 

Around World War II many artists had accepted the main argument of Post Modernism philosphy which claimed that art is dead and that the end of the painting had arrived Based on this philosophy postmodern art did not always try to be beautiful or very well made 

Guity Novin disagreed with this nihilism She called these statements a death trap because according to her art is a creative act Transpressionism was created to show that art is a creative act that celebrates a continued process of renewal and rebirth 

Tanspressionnism is searching for a sense of beauty in reality The Transpressionist artist redefines this reality with the help of mystical insights Such insights are presented to the viewers by the help of art The masterpieces of Transpressionism are often based on poetic visions These visions are presented as mysterious and wonderful forms The paintings often use narrative scenes which are influenced by the expression of hope in mythological stories The aim is to restore the human hope 

 Origin  The first declaration of Transpressionnism appeared in 1994 in an Ottawa exhibition of Guity Novin under the name of Clytie a Greek nymph who loves the sun god Apollo She is transformed into sunflower so that she can follow her love  the sun  across the sky The art critic Paula Pieault Stein in 1997 was the first who has written about Transpressionnism in the introduction to the exhibition According to her Transpressionism is a movement that goes beyond the paradigms of the impressionism and the expressionism and awakens us a shrewd insight about the inner world of representation

Artists identifying with Transpressionism include

George Butterworth was an English composer He showed great talent as a young man and might have become one of Englands greatest composers if he had lived longer  He was killed while fighting in World War I He is best known for a group of songs which are settings of poems by A E Housman

Butterworth was born in London His father was a solicitor who later became the general manager of the North Eastern Railway The family moved to Yorkshire soon after Georges birth He had his first music lessons from his mother who was a singer He soon started to compose music His father wanted him to be a solicitor and so he sent his son to Eton College From there he went to Trinity College Oxford At Oxford he became more and more involved with music especially after he met the folk song collector Cecil Sharp and composer and folk song enthusiast Ralph Vaughan Williams Butterworth and Vaughan Williams made several trips into the English countryside to collect folk songs Both of them were influenced by English folk songs when they were composing  Butterworth was also a very good folk dancer He was particularly fond of Morris dancing

Vaughan Williams and Butterworth became close friends It was Butterworth who said to Vaughan Williams that it would be a good idea to turn the symphonic poem he was working on into his London Symphony When the manuscript for that piece was lost in the post Butterworth and two other musicians helped Vaughan Williams to write it out again  Vaughan Williams dedicated the piece to Butterworths memory after his death When he left Oxford Butterworth became a music critic for The Times as well as composing and teaching at Radley College Oxfordshire He also studied at the Royal College of Music for a short time working with people such as Hubert Parry and Charles Villiers Stanford 

Although Butterworth had lots of work he often felt that his life had no purpose When World War I broke out Butterworth felt that he could be useful so he joined the British Army He was killed by a sniper in 1916 at Pozires leading a raid during the Battle of the Somme His body was not found and his name appears on the Thiepval memorial near the site of the Somme He was awarded the Military Cross and a trench was named after him

Butterworth did not write a great deal of music and during the war he destroyed many of his compositions that he thought were not good enough Of those that survive his works based on A E Housmans collection of poems A Shropshire Lad are the best known Many English composers of Butterworths time set Housmans poetry including Ralph Vaughan Williams

Butterworth wrote two song cycles on Housmans poems They include some of the best loved English songs of the 20th century especially Is My Team Ploughing and Loveliest of Trees He used this last song as the basis for his 1912 orchestral rhapsody also called A Shropshire Lad It is full of soft tender music as well as passion

Sir Charles Villiers Stanford was an Irish composer who lived in England for most of his life 

Stanford was born in Dublin His father was a very successful lawyer who was also interested in music He played the cello and sang Stanfords mother played the piano The young boy heard a lot of music at his home as there were often visitors who came to make music Charles studied the piano organ and composition and was composing and performing at concerts when he was still very young

His parents had wanted their son to be a lawyer but it was obvious that music was to be his profession He won a scholarship to Queens College Cambridge in 1870 where he was a choral scholar He learned very quickly and in 1873 while he was still a student he was made organist of Trinity College and conductor of two choirs While he had these jobs he was given time to make visits to Germany where he studied with Carl Reinecke and Friedrich Kiel He met several famous composers including Brahms and Offenbach He went to the opening of the Bayreuth Festival Theatre where the music of Richard Wagner was performed

Stanford took his BA degree in 1874 and MA in 1878 and was given the honorary degree of DMus at Oxford in 1883 and at Cambridge in 1888 He had a lot of energy and was known for working very hard When the Royal College of Music opened in London in 1883 Stanford was made professor there He became conductor of the Bach Choir and then he was made professor of music at Cambridge He was still only 35 years old He kept these two professorships until his death Although he gave up his job as organist at Trinity he became conductor of the Leeds Triennial Festival and appeared with nearly every important British music festival In 1902 he was knighted

Stanford married in 1878 and the couple had two children

Stanford died in London and was buried in Westminster Abbey

Stanford is best known today for the choral music he wrote for the Anglican church These includes some very fine anthems and motets as well as service settings  His music was much better than most of the church music that had been composed during the 19th century so he helped to make British music better He composed many pieces for music festivals these include oratorios and cantatas as well as partsongs and solo songs He also wrote a lot of orchestral and instrumental works These often show the influence of Brahms and Schumann

As a teacher of composition Stanford had a great deal of influence on many British composers He sometimes had a bad temper but he was also very good at showing students how they could improve their music Composers such as Charles Wood Constant Lambert Vaughan Williams Holst Samuel Coleridge Taylor Rutland Boughton John Ireland Frank Bridge George Butterworth Arthur Bliss Herbert Howells Arthur Benjamin and Ernest J Moeran all learned a great deal from him and continued to admire him

Queens College is one of the colleges that make up the University of Cambridge It was first founded in 1448 by Margaret of Anjou and refounded in 1465 by Elizabeth Woodville This is why the name of the college is spelt Queens and not Queens it was founded by two queens 

The Presidents Lodge of Queens is the oldest building on the river at Cambridge dating from about 1460

The college is on both sides of the river A bridge joins the two parts This bridge is always called the Mathematical Bridge The students call the older part of the college The Dark Side and the newer part The Light Side

Many people take photographs of the college There is a story that the bridge was designed and built by Sir Isaac Newton without the use of nuts or bolts The story says that once some students tried to take the bridge apart and put it back together again but were unable to do so That is why they had to put nuts and bolts in which can be seen today The story is not true The bridge was built in 1749 after Newton had died It was never taken apart although it was rebuilt twice

A scholarship is financial help given to someone who wants to study Scholarships can be given by schools or by universities or colleges or any other institution where people can study or where research needs to be done It is similar to a bursary

There are very many kinds of scholarships Some scholarships will cover all the tuition fees others may just help towards the tuition fees Some scholarships may include money for other things such as food and accommodation

Sometimes the students are expected to do something in return for having a scholarship They may for example be expected to do some particular work after they finish their studies or they may need to help the institution in some way Quite often the amount of money a student gets will depend on how much money the family has

The Leeds Triennial Festival was a festival of music held in the town of Leeds Yorkshire in England The festival started in the 19th century at a time when very large choirs were in fashion Although there is now no festival called the Leeds Triennial Festival the town of Leeds continues to put on music festivals

On 7th September 1858 Queen Victoria opened the new Town Hall in Leeds It was a very large building big enough for an audience of 4000 and a choir of 400 singers The composer Sterndale Bennett conducted an orchestra and choir at the opening performance

Although triennial means something that happens every three years the next festival did not happen until 1874 In 1880 the first festival called the Leeds Triennial Festival was conducted by Arthur Sullivan These festivals were very famous internationally because a lot of famous composers were asked to write new works for choir and to come and conduct them Composers such as Raff Dvorak Massenet Humperdinck Parry Stanford Elgar and Sullivan himself all wrote new works for the festival

Later in the 20th century many famous musicians continued to be associated with the festival including Benjamin Britten and Aaron Copland

Although the last Leeds Triennial Festival took place in 1985 both the Festival Chorus and the Leeds Philharmonic Chorus continue to perform at the Leeds International Concert Season in the Town Hall

Ernest Moeran was an English composer

Moeran was born in Heston to the west of London His father was an Irish clergyman Ernest spent most of his childhood living on the coast of Norfolk He learned to play the violin and the piano At first he was taught at home by a governess When he was ten he went to school In 1908 he went to Uppingham School where he spent five years When he left school in 1913 he started to study piano and composition at the Royal College of Music with Charles Villiers Stanford

Moerans studies at the Royal College of Music were interrupted after 18 months because of the start of World War I He joined the army as a despatch rider but he was soon badly injured in the head and could no longer fight in the army  After the war he did some music teaching but then he started to study music again His teacher this time was John Ireland who had been a pupil of Moerans earlier teacher Stanford

After these studies his music started to be performed a lot His First Rhapsody for orchestra was performed several times including in 1924 by the Hall Orchestra conducted by Hamilton Harty He was asked to compose a symphony for the Hall Orchestra but he preferred to write shorter pieces especially chamber music and piano music  In 1931 he wrote a String Trio which is one of his best works  

Moeran became interested in folk music He liked to go to country pubs and listen to the people singing there He collected about 150 folk songs in Norfolk and Suffolk and made many arrangements of them

By the mid 1920s Moeran had become close friends with Peter Warlock They lived together and often went out drinking together Moeran gradually became an alcoholic

In 1945 after Warlock had died Moeran married the cellist Peers Coetmore The marriage was not very happy although it helped Moeran to compose some of his best pieces the Cello Concerto and Cello Sonata

Moeran was found drowned in the River Kenmare At first people thought he had committed suicide but then it was found that he had had a heart attack and died before he fell into the water

Moerans music is influenced by folk song His harmonies are often like those of Delius He was also influenced by Vaughan Williams Holst Bax John Ireland and Peter Warlock For many years he concentrated on piano music songs and chamber music but in his later years he wrote larger works such as the Symphony in G minor and his Concertos for the Violin and the Cello

A despatch rider is someone in the army who delivers messages A despatch rider either rides a horse or a motorcycle

Despatch riders were used by armies to send messages between headquarters and the fighting soldiers They might be delivering reports but sometimes they took urgent messages which were often secret It was a very dangerous job Travelling between the lines of fighting armies the despatch rider could easily be blown up by a mine shot by gunfire or captured by the enemy

Despatch riders always used to ride on horseback In the 20th century they usually rode motorcycles They were used a lot in World War I and even in World War II although by the end of World War II electronic communications had improved so that despatch riders were not needed

Holography is a method that uses the wave character of light which depicts an exact description that goes beyond the options of the classic photography

In contrast to photography holography not only records the intensity of light but also its difference of phase All pieces of information reflected by the object are recorded

At holography you basically work with two waves the so called reference wave and the exposure wave With the reference wave it is possible to save the phase information in the form of a light dark model on a film The object wave and reference wave must have the same wave length

The most famous person linked to the history of holography is the physician Dennis Gbor the inventor of the hologram In fact his discovery in 1947 which demonstrated the highlight of a long development was not supposed to display three dimensional objects but to improve the resolving capacity of microscopes

For a hologram you need a laser beam that gets enlarged by a dispersing lens and goes through a semi penetrable mirror Only a piece of this laser beam goes through the mirror Then this beam becomes the reference wave which is recorded on the film The other piece of the laser beam will be reflected on the mirror and runs as the so called exposure wave at the objectThe object reflects this wave on the film

The process of creating a hologram is nearly identical to photography through diverse chemicals To look at a hologram just recorded you have to light the film with the reference wave These waves are reflected on the film and create a virtual picture of the recorded object

Nowadays industries use holograms more often to measure In the automotive engineering the autobody is measured by holography techniques for bulges and vibration characteristics An example of this method is the phase shift method First you take a hologram from the ground level state of the object then overload the object through heat or mechanical pressure By covering the original hologram and the modified hologram interference fringes occur These interference fringes can be evaluated quantitatively and give information about the deformation So you can measure tiny terminal expansions or vibrations in mechanical systems Therefore you need two reference waves that are shifted to each other

There are holographic storages for analog pictures and digital data Digital information will be affiliated by a two dimensional bit pattern

In telecommunications dirty paper coding is a good way to send digital data through a channel that is subject to some interference that is known to the sender The sender does precoding of the data so as to cancel the effect of the interference

Costa asked the following question 

When Costa asked his question the ShannonHartley theorem was well known The ShannonHartley theorem tells us that all else being equal a paper sent along a path that picks up less dirt can reliably deliver more information than another paper sent along a path that picks up more dirt People have also thought up many ways of dealing with such dirt added after the message is written  see error detection and correction for details

Most people expected that the same thing would happen when dirt is added to the paper before the message was written  the more dirt the less information can be reliably sent

In 1983 Costa showed the surprising result that we can send just as much information on such a dirty piece of paper as we can when writing on a clean sheet of paper and gave a way to get that capacity

 Tomlinson Harashima precoding  and the vector perturbation technique of Hochwald et al 

A similar problem called writing on dirty tape is more complicated As of 2005 the capacity computation problem and the capacity achieving problem for writing on dirty tape are unsolved 

Writing on wet paper is a related problem in steganography 

In a wireless network often a transmitter has many different messages and each one needs to be sent to a different person

The sum rate capacity of a system that transmits all the messages at the same time  and uses dirty paper codes to reduce the interference between messages  can be many times the sum rate capacity of a similar system that only sends one message at a time

Any one receiver is only concerned with the messages for that receiver  all the other messages the transmitter is simultaneously sending to everyone else are  to that receiver  irrelevant noise that only interferes with the desired message

The dirty paper story can be seen as a parable for wireless communication

Recently there has been interest in DPC as a possible solution to optimize the efficiency of wireless networks in particular multiuser MIMO networks and into an interference aware coding technique for dynamic wireless networks 

People doing informed digital watermarking use dirty paper codes using this analogy

Plumbing is the job of working with pipes tubing and plumbing fixtures for drinking water systems and getting rid of waste A plumber is someone who fixes or puts in piping systems plumbing fixtures and equipment such as water heaters The plumbing industry is an important part of every developed economy because people need clean water and safe ways to move and store waste

Plumbing also refers to a system of pipes and fixtures put in a building to move water and the get rid of waste that is in water Plumbing is different from water and sewage systems because plumbing system serves one building while water and sewage systems serve a group of buildings or a city

Plumbing was very rare until modern cities grew in the 19th century At about the same time public health leaders began wanting better systems to get rid of waste Before this people got rid of waste by collecting it and dumping it onto the ground or into rivers However there were some plumbing pipes in the city settlements of the Indus Valley Civilization by 2700 BC Plumbing was also used during the ancient civilizations such as the Greek Roman Persian Indian and Chinese civilizations as they built public baths and needed drinking water and somewhere to drain waste The Romans used lead pipe inscriptions to stop people from stealing water These systems did not improve much over the years There were almost no improvements from the time of the Roman system of aqueducts and lead pipes until the 19th century Eventually the development of separate underground water and sewage systems got rid of open sewage ditches and cesspools Most large cities today send solid wastes to treatment plants through pipes This separates water from waste and makes the water more pure before it goes into streams or other bodies of water Most places stopped using lead for drinking water after World War II because of the dangers of lead poisoning At this time copper piping was started because it was safer than using lead pipes

Water systems in ancient times used gravity to move water They used pipes or channels usually made of clay lead bamboo or stoneToday water supply systems use a network of high pressure pumps and pipes are now made of copper brass plastic or other nontoxic material Drain and vent lines are made of plastic steel cast iron and lead Lead is not used in pipes today because it can be poisonous

The straight sections of plumbing systems are of pipe or tube A pipe is usually made from casting or welding where a tube is made through extrusion Pipe usually has thicker walls and may be threaded or welded where tubes have thinner walls and needsspecial joining techniques such as brazing compression fitting crimping or for plastics solvent welding

As well as the straight pipe or tubing many fittings are required in plumbing systems such as valves elbows tees and unions 

Plumbing fixtures are designed for the people who use the water Some examples of fixtures include water closets urinals bidets showers bathtubs utility and kitchen sinks drinking fountains ice makers humidifiers air washers fountains and eye wash stations

Much of the plumbing work in places where many people live is done under government rules Putting in plumbing and fixing plumbnig generally must be done according to plumbing and building codes to protect the the people who live or work in the buildings

Ammunition often called ammo comes from the French word la munition At first it meant all items used for war This was from the Latin word munire It now is used only for gunpowder and artillery The group word for all types of ammunition is munitions This means anything that can be used in combat and includes bombs missiles warheads and mines These are made in munitions factories 

Ammunition is mainly used to attack a target Ammunition can also include flares and incendaries  chemicals that start fires Since the making of the cartridge ammunition has come to mean the putting of a projectile  the item that is sent to hit the target and its propellant  the chemical that creates the force into a single package 

Ammmunition is a complex subject It covers use of fire to a hit target use of weapons by people explosives and propellants cartridges high explosive projectiles warheads special shells to attack armour and aircraft carrier projectiles fuses mortar ammunition small arms ammunition grenades mines flares improved conventional munitions and computer guided munition

An emirate is a political territory that is ruled by an emir a dynastic Arab Monarch

A governess was not a servant but she was not treated like a member of the family either This meant that they were often quite lonely and they usually ate their meals alone For girls from a middle class background who were not married it was one of the only ways of earning a living When the children she taught grew up she would have to find a new job

The Christmas 1994 noreaster was a strong cyclone along the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada It developed from an area of low pressure in the southeast Gulf of Mexico near the Florida Keys and moved across the state of Florida

A weather system moved towards the southeast from the central Great Plains into the Deep South of the United States After entering the Gulf of Mexico the weather system became a cyclone An approaching trough pushed the system across Florida A forecaster at the National Hurricane Center Jack Beven said that as it the storm moved out into the Bahamas it appeared to take on the characteristics of a tropical storm He also noted that because of the uncertainty the National Hurricane Center did not call the weather system a tropical cyclone

The cyclone was said to be a hybrid storm The cyclone quickly gained strength in warm waters from the Gulf Stream and because of cold air over the United States The system continued to become stronger while moving within the Gulf Stream The storm developed central atmospheric convection which is unusual for a storm of its type Extratropical cyclone Also the system developed an eye which is usually seen in tropical cyclones Even though the cyclone showed signs of a tropical storm forecaster Jack Beven stated There was no front associated with it the storm and it had a warm core but the radius of maximum winds was more than 150 nautical miles 175 mi 280 km so under the standard NHC criteria it didnt qualify as a tropical storm On December 23 and 24 the noreaster intensified to attain a barometric pressure of 970mb Another low pressure system that developed behind the storm became stronger and grew to be larger in size than the original storm Due to the Fujiwhara effect the large circulation of the secondary low moved the original noreaster towards the northwest The noreaster passed along the south shore of Long Island and it made landfall near New York City on December 24 Later it moved over southeastern New York State On December 25 which is Christmas Day the system began to lose strength as it moved towards Nova Scotia before the pair of low pressure systems moved out to sea early on December 26

 Rutland Boughton was an English composer He was well known in the early 20th century as a composer of opera and choral music 

Boughton studied with Charles Villiers Stanford and Walford Davies He wrote many different kinds of music including symphonies concertos part songs songs chamber music and opera His best known work was the opera The Immortal Hour His carol Bethlehem became very popular in England and in many other countries

He was a great admirer of the composer Richard Wagner who had built his own theatre the Bayreuth Festspielhaus in the German town of Bayreuth Boughton wanted to create an English Bayreuth at Glastonbury so he started the series of Glastonbury Festivals that took place from 1914 until 1926 From 1927 until his death in 1960 he lived at Kilcot near Newent Gloucestershire 

The Bayreuth Festspielhaus is an opera house in the town of Bayreuth Germany The German opera composer Richard Wagner got the opera house built so that his own music could be performed properly He had lots of ideas about how opera should be performed and he thought that there was no opera house in Germany that was good enough for performances of his operas Today it is still the place where every year there is a festival the Bayreuth Festival which is dedicated only to the operas of Richard Wagner

King Ludwig II of Bavaria was a great admirer of Richard Wagner and he gave a lot of money for the opera house to be built Wagner watched the construction all the time and made sure that everything was built in the way he wanted Work on the building started on 22 May 1872 and it was ready four years later when for the first time all four operas which make up the cycle called Der Ring des Nibelungen were performed

The opera house is big enough for an audience of 1925 One unusual thing is the orchestra pit which is right under the stage covered by a hood so that the orchestra cannot be seen at all by the audience Wagner wanted the audience to be able to concentrate properly on the action on the stage instead of being distracted by watching the orchestra It makes it very difficult for the orchestra and the singers to be together and conductors have to get used to the problem

The Festspielhaus also has a double proscenium which makes it look as if the stage is farther away than it actually is

Carcoar was once one of the most important government centres in Western New South Wales The town has been classified by the National Trust This is because it has a lot of buildings from the 1800s Carcoar is a Aboriginal word from the Gundungura people meaning either frog or kookaburra

Nearby towns are Blayney Millthorpe Mandurama Neville Lyndhurst and Barry

The first people to live in the area were the Gundungura people The first European to travel through the area was surveyor George Evans He came from Bathurst in 1815 and set up his camp on Coombing Creek

The first settlers arrived in 1821 The first official land grant 560 acres was given to Thomas Icely on 26 May 1829 He named his farm Coombing Park In 1838 Thomas Icely asked that a village be started to supply items for his big farm On 29 September 1839 Carcoar became the third town west of the Blue Mountains

The first land for houses in the town were sold in 1840 By 1850 Carcoar was the second biggest town west of the mountains It was second in size to Bathurst It became a banking and government centre for the area In 1857 the towns public school opened It is one of the oldest schools in Australia 

When gold was found in the west in the 1860s Carcoar became less important The government began building a number of important buildings in the late 1870s At this time Coombing Park was supplying iron ore to the Lithgow steelworks

Because the town is at the bottom of a steep valley it wasnt suitable for the railway The railway line went to Blayney convert13kmmi0lkonabbron north west in 1874 By the early 1880s many people had left the town Carcoar was joined to the railway line in 1888 when the Blayney Demondrille Line 

In the 1980s train services were stopped between Cowra and Blayney This included included Carcoar This section was re opened by the Lachlan Valley Railway The LVR run tourist trains mainly from Cowra to Blayney and Canowindra They have now moved into general freight haulage

Carcoars was often visited by escaped convicts and bushrangers They came into the town and robbed many times 

In one robbery German Charley tried to stop Mickey Bourke from stealing a racehorse from the Coombing Park stables He was shot dead by Bourke Another bushranger Curran was captured by the local police The government sent extra police and a magistrate to the town Frank Gardiner was working in the area after six years gaol for stealing horses He gave up farm work and started stealing cattle

The Bach Choir is a world famous amateur choir based in London They sing the music of many composers not just Johann Sebastian Bach

The Bach Choir gave its first concert on 26 April 1876 with a performance of Bachs Mass in B minor  At this time more and more people in England were becoming interested in the music of Bach but the Mass in B minor had never been performed in England The conductor Otto Goldschmidt conducted the concert and afterwards the Choirs committee decided to make The Bach Choir a permanent choir Otto Goldschmidt was appointed as the Musical Director

In those days all choir members came from rich families New members had to pass an audition but they also had to be proposed by existing members and accepted by the committee Queen Victoria became Patron of the choir in 1879  The Choir sang music by lots of different composers as well as Bachs motets church music and the Mass in B minor 

Goldschmidt resigned in 1885 and Charles Villiers Stanford became conductor Stanford had already become well known as organist of Trinity College Cambridge and conductor of the Cambridge University Musical Society He widened the repertoire of the Choir and the concerts also included works for orchestra Hubert Parry composed his popular anthem Blest Pair of Sirens for the choir to sing at the Golden Jubilee of the Queen in 1887 The Jubilee concert also included the first London performance of Berliozs Te Deum a work dedicated to the late Prince Consort 

Towards the end of the nineteenth century changes were made including regular auditions for existing choir members and stopping the requirement for new members to be proposed  Henry Walford Davies became the conductor He improved the choir which was then taken over by Hugh Allen in 1908 

Hugh Allen found himself conducting a choir which included the young Ralph Vaughan Williams who had joined in 1903 and Adrian Boult who joined around 1914 Allen was strict but good and during his time as conductor the Choir gave many important first London performances including Vaughan Williams Toward the Unknown Region and A Sea Symphony and Parrys Songs of Farewell 

When Allen resigned in 1921 his place was taken by Ralph Vaughan Williams who had by then become a famous composer He had a gentler approach than Allen He stayed until 1928 when he left to be able to work more on composition In his place the Choir appointed Gustav Holst but he became ill and was never able to take up his post Instead Adrian Boult took over for three years During his time it became tradition to perform Bachs St Matthew Passion every year This tradition continues today

Boult was replaced by Reginald Jacques who had been a pupil of Hugh Allen at Oxford Jacques stayed until 1960 He managed to keep the Choir going through World War II and the annual Carol Concerts became part of their tradition They made a recording of the St Matthew Passion which filled 42 sides of the old 78 rpm gramophone records

Jacques was followed by David Willcocks who led the Choir almost to the end of the century He broadened the Choirs repertoire and they gave the first London concert hall performance of Brittens War Requiem conducted by Britten himself with Galina Vishnevskaya Peter Pears and Tom Krause as soloists The Choir then recorded the work and this recording sold more than 200000 copies in the first five months Willcocks took the Choir on tours to many parts of the world His last performance was in 1998

Today the Choir is conducted by David Hill As well as spending much of his time with The Bach Choir he is also conductor of the BBC Singers The choir continues to do new things such as giving world premieres of new music as well as keeping up the tradition of performing the St Matthew Passion every spring at the Royal Festival Hall

The African Wildcats are small fierce cats that live in forests grasslands and brush lands in Africa and the Middle East

African Wildcats are generally nocturnal in warm weather but are diurnal during very cold weather They are very good climbers African Wildcats live for 12 to 15 years They are about 50 percent larger than domesticated cats

African Wildcats are carnivores These fast solitary hunters eat small to medium sized mammals birds reptiles frogs invertebrates and eggs

A gale is a very strong wind The Beaufort scale is a way to measure weather conditions based on observations The first level of the scale that uses the word gale is 7 beaufort There are other definitions as well The US Governments National Weather Service defines a gale as 34 to 47 knots of sustained surface winds Forecasters typically issue gale warnings when winds of this strength are expected

Other sources use minima as low as convert28knkmh and maxima as high as convert90knkmh The convert90knkmhsingon definition is very non standard A common alternative definition of the maximum is convert55knkmh

Marin Marais was a French composer and viol player He studied composition with Jean Baptiste Lully Marais often conducted the operas Lully had written He also studied with Monsieur de Sainte Colombe for 6 months De Sainte Colombe was a master at playing the bass viol Marais was hired as a musician in 1676 to play at the royal court of Versailles He did quite well as court musician In 1679 he was appointed ordinaire de la chambre du roy pour la viole a title he kept until 1725

He was a master of the basse de viol He wrote a lot of music for that instrument he was the most important French composer for it He wrote five books of Pices de viole Most of the pieces in the book are suites with basso continuo These were quite popular in the court and for these he was remembered in later years as he who founded and firmly established the empire of the viol His other works include a book of Pices en trio and four operas Alcyone is well known for its storm scene

Titon du Tillet wrote about Marais in his book Le Parnasse franois He describes a piece from Marais fourth book called The Labyrinth which he says goes through lots of keys He says that the notes which are often dissonant sometimes fast sometimes slow describe a man caught in a labyrinth Eventually the man comes out of it happily and the music finishes with a gracious and natural chaconne Another piece called La Gamme The Scale very gradually goes up the steps of the octave and then down again

As with Sainte Colombe little of Marin Marais personal life is known after he reached adulthood Marin Marais married a Parisian Catherine dAmicourt on September 21 1676 They had 19 children together

Facsimiles of all five books of Marais Pices de viole are published by ditions JM Fuzeau A complete critical edition of his instrumental works in seven volumes edited by John Hsu is published by Broude Brothers

Marais and his music were featured in the movie Tous les matins du monde The movie shows a detailed imagined life of Monsieur de Sainte Colombe Marais music is heard a lot including his longer work Sonnerie de Ste Genevive du Mont de Paris A recording of the Sonnerie performed on a Fairlight synthesizer was used in the cult classic film Liquid Sky

Burgess Hill is a town in West Sussex England UK It is not far from the border with East Sussex Located 38 miles south of London 10 miles north of Brighton and Hove and 29 miles east northeast of the county town of Chichester it had a population of 28803 at the time of the 2001 Census Other nearby towns include Haywards Heath to the north and Lewes the county town of East Sussex to the east

Burgess Hill is mainly situated just on the West Sussex side of the border dividing the two counties although parts of the town are across the county boundary in East Sussex 

Although a Roman road was built joining London to the South coast and passing through what is now Burgess Hill there is no evidence that the Romans settled in the area

From the fourteenth century or earlier the annual Midsummer Fair was held on this common land on 24th June and the last such sheep and lamb fair was held in 1913

With the development of the London to Brighton mainline railway however those in the business soon realised that taking sheep by train was much cheaper and easier than using the old roadways Most of the animal trading business began to centre around rail side markets such as those at Hassocks Haywards Heath and Lewes train stations By the start of the 20th century the animal trading business had all but left the Burgess Hill area

By the early seventeenth century there was a lot of small brick and tile making companies and during this time pieces of common land were given for house building and small businesses By the early eighteenth century brick making had been extended and four shops and one or two drinking houses were established on the common Brickmaking by hand still happened until very recently by Keymer Tiles whose tiles can be found in buildings such as St James Church Piccadilly and Manchester Central Station

The growth of Brighton in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries brought in professional people looking for places to live Between 1850 and 1880 the area changed from a small rural settlement to a town of 4500 residents

In 1897 the Victoria Pleasure Gardens were opened by local household name Edwin Street a well known farmer and butcher The gardens were opened in honour of Queen Victorias Diamond Jubilee and contained a large lake and what can only be described as a small early version of a roller coaster known as a switchback The lake was used for boating in the summer and skating in the winter The frozen lake was always tested by Mr Street a man of 23 stone before being used in the winter This area is now the Victoria Business Park

The town gradually grew bigger having its largest population increase between the years of 1951 and 1961 when the population of about 7000 residents almost doubled This earned Burgess Hill the title of fastest growing town in the south east By 1956 the Victoria Industrial Estate was completed and has since expanded It now contains the local headquarters of two large international companies In 1986 a smaller industrial estate to in the north of the town developed known as Sheddingdean Industrial Estate Both Sheddingdean and Victoria have now been renamed as business parks

Housing estates played their part in building up the population of Burgess Hill throughout the second half of the 20th century in the west of the town they provided a wide mix of new residents many of them young families and the Folders Lane estate more families settled along with some richer residents 

The next substantial development was Priory Village in the south west of Burgess Hill sometimes known as the Tesco estate due to its proximity to the supermarket Again this brought in a mix of incomes again many of them young families

It must be noted that as well as the aforementioned developments there have been two council estates built in the town  one close to Cants Lane in the towns north east and the area around Denham Road in the west both of course adding to the ever rising population of the town

Although now part of the town Worlds End to the north of the town was originally a separate community It still retains its own shops and community association and is served by Wivelsfield railway station

Burgess Hill has a Conservative member of parliament 

There are ten schools for children aged up to 11 years and four schools for children aged 11 1618

There are a total of 9 churches and a Christian centre in Burgess Hill

Burgess Hill is also home to the Mid Sussex Christian Centre

In the town centre there is a large park and many other smaller recreation grounds around the town There is a substantial leisure centre on the northern edge of Burgess Hill named the Triangle 

Burgess Hill Town Football Club plays footballand plays its home games at Leylands Park Burgess Hill Rugby Football Club or The Sussex All Blacks are the local Rugby Football club

There is also a Squash Club that plays at the Triangle Leisure Centre every Saturday and Monday and has a team that plays in the East Sussex County League

There is also a Running Club that meet at the Burgess Hill School for Girls every Wednesday evening Members compete in local and national charity and fun races

The Skate Park in the centre of town provides sporting opportunities and holds an annual competition

The Triangle is one of the venues in the South East supporting the London 2012 Olympic Games and will serve as a base and training centre for teams from around the globe

John Ireland studied piano and organ at the Royal College of Music Later he also had composition lessons from Charles Villiers Stanford He later became a teacher at the College himself His pupils included the composers Alan Bush andGeoffrey Bush Ernest Moeran and Benjamin Britten Geoffrey Bush later helped to prepare a lot of Irelands works for publication  Ireland mostly made his living as an organist and choirmaster

Ireland enjoyed going to the Channel Islands He liked the landscapes there He was evacuated from them just before the German invasion during World War II 

John Ireland married once but his marriage only lasted a few months

On 10 September 1949 his 70th birthday was celebrated in a special Prom concert The soloist in the Piano Concerto was the pianist Eileen Joyce who later made the first gramophone recording of the concerto

He died aged 82 in Washington Sussex of heart failure

John Ireland was never much influenced by folksong like many other English composers of his time His music is more related to Impressionism He liked the music of French composers such as Debussy and Ravel as well as Igor Stravinsky and Bartk His Piano Concerto is one of his best works It shows that he developed his own personal style of harmony Most of his other good works are short pieces including many for piano solo His best known piece is the song The Holy Boy It is heard in many different arrangements His songs to poems by A E Housman Thomas Hardy Christina Rossetti John Masefield Rupert Brooke and others are among some of the best English art songs He also wrote hymns carols and other sacred choral music among choirs he is probably best known for the anthem Greater love hath no man often sung in services that remember the victims of war Another choral work These things shall be expresses his deepest hopes for mankind although in his last years he said that he hated the work

Frank Bridge was an English composer violist and conductor His music often sounded quite modern to the people of his day He wrote many excellent works including chamber music as well as orchestral music One of his composition pupils was Benjamin Britten Later Britten remembered his teacher by using one of Bridges tunes and making them into a piece of music called Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge

Bridge was born in Brighton and studied at the Royal College of Music in London from 1899 to 1903 One of his teachers was Charles Villiers Stanford He played the viola in several string quartets and conducted many orchestras He learned difficult music very quickly and sometimes Henry Wood asked him to take his place when he was not well enough to conduct himself After a while he spent most of his time composing He privately taught several pupils including Benjamin Britten who later helped to make his teachers music better known and honoured him in his Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge for string orchestra based on a theme from the second of Bridges Three Idylls for String Quartet 

Bridge died in Eastbourne

Bridges early works show the influence of Brahms and Stanford He wrote some excellent chamber music and songs The Phantasie Quartet and the String Quartet no 1 show his talent His later pieces such as the third and fourth string quartets have quite complicated harmonies and show his interest in the music of Schoenberg as well as the harmonies of Maurice Ravel and Alexander Scriabin His most important orchestral works include The Sea and Summer He wrote some lovely chamber music for the cello as well as many songs In his later years his harmonies become quite advanced for example a favourite chord of his can be found by playing a C minor chord and a D major chord together In his longer pieces the speed of the music often changes and he avoids repeating himself exactly 

For a long time after his death his music was hardly ever played but more recently musicians have discovered the greatness of his compositions Pianists like to play the popular piano piece called Rosemary

Kenneth Poppi Freeman was a street vendor from Philadelphia Pennsylvania who sold newspapers along with Billy Cook He is known for being an important suspect in the Mumia Abu Jamal case Cynthia White a key witness said that Freeman was present but did not name him At the time of the crime Freeman was a front passenger in Billy Cooks Volkswagen In two different lineups done to determine the killer Cynthia White picked him Billy Cook the brother of Abu Jamal claimed later that Freeman personally confessed to him as being armed and shooting Faulkner Arnold Beverly in an affidavit where he confessed to the murder named another guy as a shooter Some witnesses testified that they saw a man with a green army jacket going away from the crime scene Billy Cook said that Kenneth Freeman was wearing a green army jacket

Freeman was reportedly in Germany in the Army and usually wore the jacket

One important contradiction is the fact that Cynthia White picked Freeman out of a lineup as the killer but later changed her testimony to fit the prosecutions story This can be explained by her admission that police bribed her to do so so that she could legally work as a prostitute That leads to another important inconsistency which is that Yvette Williams someone who White knew personally said that White told her that she did not see the actual killer which means she couldnt have knowingly pointed out Freeman as the killer unless he confessed to her personally 

On May 13 1985 Kenneth Freeman was found dead in an empty area handcuffed bound and naked his death listed as natural causes J Patrick OConnor in his book The Framing of Mumia Abu Jamal says that his body was found bound gagged and naked in a vacant lot 

Scientists make hypotheses and theories about their fields of study At the start they hope their hypothesis or theory is true but they and other scientists will use the scientific method to try and prove it false Falsifiability means that an example can be found through an experiment or an observation where the hypothesis is wrong 

This can mean one of the following

Put another way if a scientist comes up with a rule or law they have to also be able to imagine a way to show that it is wrong

Karl Popper had the opinion that only theories that are falsifiable are scientific

Crow is a generic term for about 40 different kinds of birds It would be possible to make a theory All crows are white The sentence All crows are white can also be written as There are no crows that are non white If someone observes a black crow he could say There are black crows This is a contradiction to All crows are white and falsifies the theory

There are some problems with the system of falsification

A tape drive or streamer is a component that is often attached to a computer It is used to write data to magnetic tape or to read data from it Usually people use it to do backups Tape drives are different from hard drives in that the access to the data is sequential This means to read a certain part of data all the data before it needs to be read as well Also tape drives are slow compared to hard drives Current capacities range from tens of gigabytes to almost a terabyte per cartridge

A Cache algorithm is an algorithm used to manage a cache or group of data When the cache is full it decides which item should be deleted from the cache The word hit rate describes how often a request can be served from the cache The term latency describes for how long a cached item can be obtained Cache alorithms are a trade off between hit rate and latency

Other things to consider

Various algorithms also exist to maintain cache coherency This applies only to situation where multiple independent caches are used for the same data

Thermodynamic entropy is a measure of how organized or disorganized energy is present in a system of atoms or molecules It is measured in Joules of energy per unit Kelvin Entropy is an important part of the third law of thermodynamics

Imagine that a group of molecules has ten units of energy If the energy in those molecules is perfectly organized then the molecules can do ten units of work However if the energy were to become less organized the molecules might only be able to do six units of work even though they still have ten units of energy in them

When total entropy is reached there is no more energy to spend A good example of this is a cup of tea Now suppose your cup of tea is hot The tea has a lot of energy compared to the room the tea is in Over time the heat in the tea will spread into the room The tea will become colder This is because the energy in the tea escapes into the surrounding area Once the tea has gone cold there is no more heat that can be spread The tea has thus reached total entropy

There are two types of rooms we recognize when we are talking about entropy An open system and a closed system The former means that energy can freely flow into and out of the room A closed system means that the room is closed off from the outside no energy can go in or out

In the case of the tea the room was a closed system it had no means for energy to enter But we can also make it an open system by placing a stove in the room If we turn on the stove we can use the heat from the stove to reheat the cup of tea New usable energy has been brought into the environment The entropy has thus decreased The heat that went from the stove into the tea can then again escape into the room again until total entropy has been reached This is what the Second Law of Thermodynamics describes

A real life example of an open system is the earth We get a lot of energy from the sun every day This allows plants to grow and water to stay liquid If we would take away the sun plants would die and water would freeze up because there is nothing that adds energy to our planet

The university has seven undergraduate colleges and seven graduate divisions at its main Ithaca campus with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy The university also administers two satellite medical campuses one in New York City and one in Education City Qatar Cornell is one of two private land grant universities and its seven undergraduate colleges include three state supported statutory or contract colleges As a land grant college it also operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county of New York

Rag alla bolognese or Bolognese sauce is a meat based sauce for pasta The sauce came from Bologna Italy Bolognese sauce is sometimes taken to be a tomato sauce but authentic recipes have only a small amount of tomato

The people of Bologna traditionally serve their famous rag with freshly made tagliatelle and their traditionally green lasagne Less traditionally the sauce is served with maccheroni or other durum wheat short pasta

In 1982 the Bolognese delegation of Accademia Italiana della Cucina said that the recipe may only contain beef pancetta onions carrots celery tomato paste meat broth red wine and milk or cream There are different recipes some traditional ones also contain chopped pork or pork sausage For special occasions chicken or goose liver along with veal Today both butter and olive oil are used for cooking the Soffritto of small amounts of celery carrot and onion When they are available Prosciutto mortadella or porcini fresh mushrooms may be added as well Milk may be used especially when starting to cook the meat This will make the taste better It is not unsual to cook the Rag for a long time 5 to 6 hours are common

Spaghetti alla Bolognese Spaghetti Bolognese or Spaghetti Bolognaise in a form popular outside of Italy consists of a meat sauce served on a bed of spaghetti with a good sprinkling of grated Parmigiano cheese Although Spaghetti alla Bolognese are very popular outside of Italy it never existed in Bologna where rag is served always with the local egg pastas tagliatelle or lasagne Spaghetti is a durum wheat pasta from Naples and the Naples Rag of a meat flavoured thick tomato sauce clings much better to slippery spaghetti than Bolognas ground beef rag 

In recent decades the dish has become very popular in Sweden and Denmark as spagetti och kttfrsss in Swedish and spaghetti og kdsovs in Danish especially among children It is also popular in the United Kingdom and has become a staple of the British dinner table In the United States as well the term bolognese is often applied to a tomato and ground beef sauce that bears little resemblance to rag served in Bologna

Chinese people often use the term Western zhajiang mian to refer to spaghetti bolognese alluding to its superficial similarities with the traditional Chinese noodle dish of zhajiang mian as both are dry noodles covered with a thick rag mainly made of minced meat This provides an interesting symmetrical perspective to Westerners referring to zhajiang mian as Chinese spaghetti

The pug is a type of dog with a wrinkly face It also has a curled tail and pug puppies are called puglets The pug has a square muscular body with a large head big eyes and small ears They have often been described as multum in parvo which means much in little referring to the pugs character and size Pugs came originally from China but they became popular in England Ireland and Scotland They can get sick easily

Pugs are often liked most for their curly tails compact body a deep chest and strong muscles There are two different types of a Pugs ears rose and button Rose ears are smaller than the button ears and are folded up instead of on the side of the head Most people prefer button style Pugs Pugs have strong straight legs and laid back shoulders Their feet are not as large as a hares foot but they are not as round as that of a cat either They have toes that are split up perfectly and their nails are all black The lower teeth normally grow farther out than the upper teeth so they meet in an under bite

Pugs can be a lot of different colors including fawn the color of an apricot silver or black A very rare pug is white The fur color may be white due to albinism A silver pug has a very dark head and dark forelegs The tail usually curls at the hip

Different coat types shed differently but they all shed year round The pug who has a fawn color sheds the most Grooming their fur helps prevent too much shedding

The pug is very strong willed but does not act aggressively unless provoked to a high degree Pugs are well kept for families with children They can be quiet and nice but also funny according to the owners mood They are also good at guarding the house

Pugs came from China as most high people of China kept them as pets during the Shang Dynasty

In East China they were known as the Lo Chiang Sze or Foo In the early 551 BCE Confucius described the pug as a short mouthed dog After that pugs became popular in Tibet especially for monks Then pugs became known toward Japan and then Europe The pugs origin is unknown because the first Emperor of China destroyed everything related to the pug in his reign 

Chinese Fu Dogs also called Lion Dogs or Fo Dogs were thought of as brave dogs who were skilled at guarding so statues of them were placed outside the temples

The Dutch East India Company imported the pug first in the late 16th and 17th centuries Later in 1572 a pug named Pompey saved the Prince of Orange by warning him when the Spaniards came William III and Mary II also took a pug with them when they were going from Netherlands to England for the seat of the throne in 1688

The pug was also becoming famous in other European countries as well The Spanish painter Goya painted pugs in Spain and Italy sitting beside the coachmen of the rich They were used as guard dogs and to find animals or people

After that pugs began to become popular in France A pug named Fortune was a messenger between Josphine de Beauharnais and her family while she was in prison In Italy the pug was becoming famous also A Mrs Piozzi wrote in her journal that every carriage I meet here has a pug in it

In 19th century England Queen Victoria was a very sincere lover of pugs She had many pet pugs such as Olga Pedro Minka Fatima and Venus

The pug finally arrived in the United States during the 19th century and soon became popular there as well Many pugs won dog shows and soon the Pug Dog Club was founded in 1931

Because pugs do not have long snouts they can get eye diseases They also cannot breathe well because passages for oxygen are very small and they cannot regulate their temperature with their tongue well A pugs normal body temperature is between convert101FC and convert102FC If the temperature rises to convert105FC they need to cool down immediately because they cannot cool themselves enough Should the temperature reach convert108FC their insides begin to break down possibly leading to serious health issues or even death

Pugs that live by themselves can have the problem of overweight although this can be helped by exercising and eating healthy food

Pugs can also be hurt by necrotizing meningoencephalitis NME is an inflammation of the brain and meninges It is also known as pug dog encephalitis There is no known cure or explanation for NME although most people believe it is a disease that dogs may inherit from their mother or father All dogs usually die within a few months after this disease which usually happens from 6 months to 7 years of age

Pugs can also get a serious disease in their spine

Because pugs have wrinkles on their faces owners must clean the folded part of their skin Hip dysplasia is another major problem for pugs About 638 of pugs were caught with hip dysplasia 

When pugs get excited they begin to reverse sneeze in which they will breathe in short quick breaths Reverse sneezing is usually not harmful to the pug It can be helped by massaging the dogs throat or covering its nose to make it breathe instead with its mouth

Pugs have come out in television and film such as Frank the Pug in the film Men in Black and the follow up series Other films that have pugs include 12 Rounds Marie Antoinette and Disneys film about Pocahontas They have also appeared on television in shows like the The West Wing

Pugs have also appeared in many fictional books like Lady Bertrams pug in Mansfield Park and in the book Pugs Gods Little Weirdos

Famous people who own pugs include broadcaster Jonathan Ross and actress Jessica Alba

A command economy or a planned economy is when the main decision maker is the government No person may independently decide to open and run a business The government decides what goods and services are to be produced and owns the places where the production takes place The government sells these goods and services and decides how the talents and skills of its workers are to be used 

Communism is a type of government system that would use a command economy

Charles Edward Ives was an American composer  He experimented with new ways of composing which many people did not understand at the time These became more widely used later in the century He used dissonant sounding intervals and techniques such as polytonality polyrhythms and polytextures Very few people listened to his music at the time he was writing it Only much later did musicians start to realize the importance of his work  Ives earned his living as an insurance agent He composed in his spare time

Charles Ives was born in Danbury Connecticut His father George Ives was a US Army bandleader in the American Civil War His mother was a singer His father taught him a great deal about the music and encouraged him to experiment with new sounds As well as teaching him counterpoint and introducing him to the music of JSBach he trained his sons musical ear by getting him to sing a tune in one key while he played the accompaniment in another In this way the young Charles became used to modern sounds that were quite different from traditional Romantic music Charles also listened in Danbury town square to his fathers marching band and other bands that were playing on other sides of the square so that he heard a mixture of several pieces of music at the same time His father also taught him the music of Stephen Foster 

Ives became a church organist at the age of 14 and wrote various hymns and songs for church services including his Variations on America  At the same time he also enjoyed sport and was good at baseball football and tennis

Ives spent four years at Yale University His teacher Horatio Parker was very good and taught him important basic techniques of composing but he could not understand some of things that Ives was writing in his music Ives got annoyed when his teacher told him he could not finish a section of music on a dissonant chord but Ives liked it like that  The choirmaster at the Centre Church where Ives played the organ was John Griggs He had more understanding of what Ives was trying to do It was a terrible blow to Charles when his father died on 4 November 1894 He always had a huge admiration for his father who had encouraged him in his musical experiments Charles kept busy composing He did not do any sport at Yale because his father had forbidden him to take part in sport so that he would spend his time on studying By the time Charles graduated he had composed more than 40 songs several marches overtures anthems and organ pieces a string quartet and a symphony However most people thought of him as the composer of a simple waltz tune called The Bells of Yale 

After his studies at Yale Ives continued to work as a church organist while working for an insurance firm  He was very good at his job and became very well known in the insurance business Some of his business friends were often surprised to find out that he was also a composer 

In 1907 Ives had his first heart attack These attacks may have been more to do with his imagination When he was better he composed more than ever before He married in 1908 After several heart attacks in 1918 he composed very little He stopped composing altogether in 1926 His health problems continued and he retired from the insurance business in 1930 He spent some time revising works he had written early but never wrote any more new pieces

Ives died in 1954 in New York City

Ives published more than 100 of his songs He was a very good pianist and the piano parts are often quite difficult They include bitonality and pantonality Although he is now best known for his orchestral music he composed two string quartets and other chamber music His organ piece Variations on America takes the tune My Country Tis of Thee and changes it in several amusing variations using a march a ragtime and bitonality it was not published until 1949 The variations differ sharply a running line a set of close harmonies a march a polonaise and a ragtime allegro the interludes are one of the first uses of bitonalityyeahh yeahh yeaahhh whooooo

His Symphony Number 1 was fairly traditional but Symphony Number 2 is much more modern sounding even ending with a dissonant chord with 11 notes

In 1902 he gave up his organ job He left all his best anthems and organ music in the church library and these were thrown out in 1915 when the church moved so most of them are lost

Central Park in the Dark is a piece for orchestra which describes the mysterious quiet park and then sounds of music coming from nearby nightclubs in Manhattan 

Perhaps the piece which is most often heard today is the short fanfare The Unanswered Question written for the very unusual combination of trumpet four flutes and string orchestra The strings playing from behind the stage play very slow chorale like music throughout the piece while several times the trumpet plays a short group of notes that Ives described as the eternal question of existence Each time the trumpet is answered with harsh outbursts from the flutes apart from the last one That is the question that is left unanswered Musicians often have discussions about what the real meaning of the piece is

Another well known orchestral work is Three Places in New England  His best known piano work is his Concord Sonata Ives often liked to quote bits of other pieces and in this piano sonata he quotes the famous opening of Beethovens Fifth Symphony It also has an interesting example of one of Ives experiments in the second movement he tells the pianist to use a 14 in piece of wood to make a thick but soft cluster chord The sonata is one of the best piano works of the 20th century 

One of his most interesting works is the his Fourth Symphony written for a huge orchestra The last movement is like a fight between discord and traditional tonal music The piece ends quietly with just the percussion playing at a distance This symphony seems to say everything that Ives had been trying to do in music It was not until 1965 that a complete performance of the symphony was given 

Ives music only gradually began to get well known during the 1930s and into the 1940s Schoenberg recognized his importance In 1951 Leonard Bernstein conducted the first performance of Ives Second Symphony in a broadcast concert by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra He recorded a lot of his music and even played some in a television programme for young people

A flageolet is an old woodwind instrument It belongs to the end blown flute family It started to be used in the 16th century for folk music Soon there were two kinds the French kind and the English  The French flageolet had four holes in the front and two in the back The English flageolet had six holes in the front

The flageolet is quite similar to the recorder In the 18th century it changed because a narrow mouthpiece made of ivory or bone was added at the top This led into another section which bulged out There was a soft sponge at the end of this Sometimes this instrument was called the flautino The piccolodeveloped from it Another instrument that developed from it was the tin whistle

Henry Purcell and George Frideric Handel both wrote pieces for it 

Small versions of this instrument called bird flageolets were also made and were used for teaching birds to sing

Opra National de Paris is the most important opera company of France It stages performances at the Opra Bastille and Opra Garnier in Paris

Other opera houses in Paris are the Thtre du Chtelet Opra Comique and Thtre des Champs lyses

King Louis XIV allowed Jean Baptiste Lully to start the Acadmie Royale de Musique in 1672 This was an organization that included opera ballet and music The ballet company was part of the opera company Then Louis XIV started the ballet school called Acadmie Royale de Danse in 1661 From 1671 until Lullys death in 1687 the school was directed by the great dancing master Pierre Beauchamp the man who set down the five positions of the feet 

In 1713 King Louis XIV made the Opera company a state institution There was a group of professional dancers called Le Ballet de lOpra From that time until 1875 they used lots of theatres each one of which was destroyed by a fire All these companies were called Paris Opra or Opra de Paris

On October 29 1873 the old Paris Opra known as the Thtre de lAcadmie Royale de Musique which had been used since 1821 was destroyed by a fire which burned for 27 hours By 1875 the opera company moved to the new Palais Garnier which was part of the rebuilding of Paris by Emperor Napoleon III

When the Opra Bastille was built in 1989 the company chose it as their main theatre 

Faust or Faustus is a character from German legendary stories His name comes from a Latin word meaning lucky The legend is about a man called Faust Faust wants to have knowledge He meets the Devil The Devil tells Faust he can have anything he wants In return the Devil says Faust must give him his soul Faust agrees and the Devil lets Faust have a wonderful time but in the end Faust has to go to Hell

The story of Faust became famous all over Europe Many writers from different countries wrote their own versions of the Faust story eg Christopher Marlowe Goethe Mikhail Bulgakov Thomas Mann Many composers wrote music about Faust eg Hector Berlioz Franz Liszt Charles Gounod and Ferrucio Busoni

The adjective Faustian is used to describe a person who wants something so much that it leads them into trouble

In the early versions of the Faust story in ballads dramas and puppet plays Faust is always damned This is because he prefers human knowledge instead of Gods knowledge This was thought to be very bad at that time

Some of the plays and comic puppet theatre from around the 16th century make up their own versions of the story They often show Faust as a figure of vulgar fun The story became popular in England when Christopher Marlowe wrote a play called The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus But in Goethes version of the story two centuries later Faust is described as a well educated man who wants more than just meat and drink

Robert Mulligan was an Academy Award nominated American film and television director He directed films such as To Kill a Mockingbird and The Man in the Moon 

Austin was a British car manufacturer formed in 1905 the company merged with Morris in 1952 becoming the lead partner in British Motor Company This became British Leyland and then Austin Rover before the company became the Rover Group and the company began phasing the brand out in 1987 by 1989 all Austin Cars had been cleared of Austin branding The name has now passed into the ownership of Nanjing Motor Corporation who have stated an interest in reviving the name

The company was formed in 1905 by Herbert Austin originally making cars from a factory in Rotherham Yorkshire before moving to Longbridge Birmingham In the First World War Austin made aircraft for the Army and Navy it was this work what lead to the rapid expansion of the company following the war the company stopped making aircraft The company became Britains biggest car maker in 1952 it merged with its biggest rival Morris with Austin being the lead partner This company was known as the British Motor Company

Following the merger with Morris the model line up for Austin changed considerably The most notable car to come from this era was the Austin Mini this was also sold as a Morris Mini and was made up until 2000 Austin enjoyed a favourable market share during the 1950s and 1960s but its market dominance was to be tested in the 1970s after the creation of British Leyland

In 1968 British Motor Company merged with Leyland to become British Leyland It was the British Leyland years that were perhaps the most difficult and in 1975 British Leyland was nationalised Austins market share fell as did other marques within the company leading to the phasing out of the Morris name plate in 1981 There were many strikes at British Leylands factories making British Leyland and other companies with the same problem such as the Ford Motor Company unproductive compared to Japanese and European companied like Volkswagen Many of the models in this era failed to sell well either because they were old fashioned or deemed unreliable the Austin Princess and the Austin Allegro were the only modern cars of this era the 1300 1800 and Austin Maxi were all dated The Princess and Allegro sold well but were both saloons the only hatchback the company had was the Maxi which wasnt a popular car

Despite the huge success of the Austin Metro launched in 1980 there was trouble in the company In the 1980s Austin sold the most cars in the British Leyland group however when the company became Austin Rover a greater emphasis was placed on the more upmarket Rover Name In 1987 the company began phasing the name out and by 1989 it had been removed from all products

The name now belongs to Nanjing Motor Corporation who have expressed an interest in reviving it The currently make cars as MGs however it intends to use this brand name for luxury cars and sports cars Nanjing does not own the Rover Name so the Austin name is the most recent it has to use for its main stream mass market cars

Johann Wolfgang von Goethes Faust is the most famous play in all German literature It was published in two parts Part One is very dramatic and tells the main story Part II is extremely long and it is meant to be read rather than acted out on stage It is about Goethes philosophy as well as about history and politics

Goethes Faust is a re telling of the Faust legend which was very famous in Germany The legend tells of a man called Faust who is tired of studying and wants to have the greatest possible happiness The devil tells Faust he can help him to do this but that in the end Faust will have to give him his soul and go with him to hell  Faust makes a pact with Mephistopheles who promises him all his soul can wish for fine living gold women and honour Faust signs the pact with his blood Faust uses magic in the hope that it will tell him everything about life However in the end Mephistopheles wins his bet

The subject of Faust occupied Goethe all his life The name of Faust is mentioned in a comedy he wrote in 1769 Die Mitschuldigen  In 1773 when he was 24 he first read the poetry of Hans Sachs the medieval German poet He immediately started to imitate the rhythm of Sachss poetry This rhythm is known as Knttelvers It had 4 accented syllables in each line and an AABB or ABAB rhyming pattern eg

In 1887 long after Goethes death it was discovered that he had made a version of Faust which he never published but later decided to rewrite This version is known as the Urfaust It was written between 1772 and 1775 He changed a lot of it and it became Faust Part I A fragment was published in 1790 Then he finished it in 1806 published it in 1808 and changed it for a new edition in 1829 Part 2 was finished in 1831 a few months before he died and was not published until a few months after his death

Faust Part One starts off in heaven Mephistopheles makes a bet with God he says that he can go down to earth and meet Faust and make him do bad things

We then see Faust in his study Faust is trying to get to know all possible things He wants to know about science humans and religion He tries to use magic in order to understand everything there is to know but he thinks he is not managing to do it For a moment he thinks of killing himself but then hears people celebrating Easter and decides to go for a walk with Wagner his assistant A poodle who has no home follows Faust back to his house 

In Fausts study the poodle changes into the devil Faust makes an arrangement with the devil the devil will do everything that Faust wants while he is here on earth In exchange Faust will serve the devil in hell Fausts arrangement is that if during the time while Mephistopheles is serving Faust Faust is so pleased with anything the devil gives him that he wants to stay in that moment forever he will die that very moment 

Mephistopheles persuades Faust to sign the agreement with his own blood Faust has a few adventures and then meets Margaret He loves her and by offering her jewellery and with help of a neighbour Martha Gretchen lets herself into Fausts arms Faust and Gretchen want to sleep together so Gretchen gives her mother a sleeping potion so that she does not see Faust Faust and Gretchen sleep together Gretchens mother dies of the potion Gretchen discovers she is pregnant Gretchens brother says Faust is bad and challenges him but Faust kills him Gretchen has given birth to a baby but she drowns it She is found guilty of murder and is sent to prison Faust tries to save her from death but he cannot free her from prison Finding that they cannot free her Faust and the devil run away from the prison cell while voices from heaven say that Gretchen shall be saved

Faust Part Two is very different from Part One It keeps referring to classical literature  The romantic story of the first Faust is forgotten and Faust wakes in a field of fairies He has many adventures The piece is in five acts which each tell of different things In the end Faust goes to heaven because he loses only half the bet Angels who arrive as messengers of Gods mercy say at the end of Act 5 He who strives on and lives to strive Can earn redemption still

Goethes Faust had an enormous influence on all art in Western countries In Germany many writers were fascinated by the legend They often felt that Faust represented the spirit of the German people Dramas epic poems and novels were written about Faust Composers wrote operas about him Thomas Mann wrote a novel Dr Faustus which compares Fausts pact with the devil to the way the German people supported Hitler  Composers wrote operas about him or composed orchestral music inspired by the legend

Peter Fechter is one of the best known victims of the Berlin Wall Fechter was a bricklayer Aged 18 he tried to cross the wall into the West near Checkpoint Charlie to live with his sister He did this with his friend and colleague Helmut Kulbeik Both started to climb the wall at around 1415 Kubelik was successful and could escape Fechter was hit by several gunshots one of which pierced his lung and fell back down to what was called the Death strip He was unable to move and started to cry for help Crowds started to gather on both sides of the wall on the east side they were dispersed by police

Police gathered on the west side threw medical kits to him despite the crowd telling them they would not do more The DDR border guards did not do anything either neither did the United States personnel on duty at the Checkpoint

Fechter bled to death after about an hour After reunification two border police were found guilty of manslaughter They were convicted and given suspended prison terms of 20 and 21 months respectively Both had told the court they fired shots at Fechter but did not want to kill him The court also ruled that Fechter was killed by the shots and not by the absence of aid The evidence could not show who of three gunman was responsible for the bullet that killed Fechter

Manchester Metrolink is a light rail system in Greater Manchester England There are three lines which join up in Manchester city centre They serve the surrounding towns of Bury Altrincham and Eccles The system is owned by the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive It is operated under contract by Stagecoach Group

In Manchester city centre the Metrolink trams run on the roads Most of the routes in the suburbs use railway lines though Lots of extensions to the system are currently under construction or have been proposed In late 2008 works started extending the system to East Didsbury Ashton under Lyne Oldham Rochdale Mediacityuk and Manchester Airport The expansions will increase the systems length from 37km to 97km There will be at least 99 stops On the 13th May 2009 funding was secured for phase 3b Work will start from late 2009 If funding can be obtained then there may be more extensions to the system Stockport and The Trafford Centre are two examples

The construction of Manchesters railway network in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries had created a lot of termini around the City Centre These were not linked together This left a large amount of Manchester disconnected from the railway network

For many years there had been plans to connect Manchesters two main railway stations These are Piccadilly and Victoria In the late 1960s and early 1970s there were plans for a Picc Vic tunnel This tunnel would carry main line trains under the city centre The proposal was abandoned because it would cost too much

Queanbeyan is a city in New South Wales Australia It is also the local government area called Queanbeyan City Council It is very close to the Australian federal capital city of Canberra It is really now a part of the capital city as it is on the Australian Capital Territory border and is only convert10kmmi0lkonabbron from Canberras CBD The border itself is marked by a railway line The Queanbeyan River flows through Queanbeyan near the centre of the city

The town grew from a farm owned by ex convict inn keeper Timothy Beard It was on the banks of the Molonglo River The original name was Quinbean which means clear waters

Queanbeyan became a township in 1838 There were about 50 people living there Some of the important historic buildings still standing were built in the early days Traces of gold were found in 1851 There were also some lead and silver mines Settlers were often broken wikt linkrobbedrobbed by bushrangers including John Tennant Jacky Jacky Frank Gardiner and Ben Hall In 1836 the government built a Post Office at Queanbeyan 

The first bank was opened in Queanbeyan on 19 September 1859 This was the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited which is now part of the National Australia Bank The Golden Age now called The Queanbeyan Age was Queanbeyans first newspaper started in 1860 by John Gale In 1880 John James Wright the first mayor of Queanbeyan built a house on the banks of the Queanbeyan River In 1982 house became the Queanbeyan Art Centre

The railway reached Queanbeyan railway station in 1887 and it became the junction for the lines going to Canberra and Bombala There are now two trains a day the Countrylink Xplorer service between Canberra and Sydney

Queanbeyan became an important country town with 16 hotels and six flour mills powered by wind water horse and steam Canberra was started as the national capital in 1911 There were no hotels so people crossed the border to get a drink at Queanbeyans hotels When the Parliament moved to Canberra from Melbourne in 1926 Canberra got its first hotel 

Queanbeyan became a city on 7 July 1972 From 1982 to 1989 the Canberra Raiders rugby league team played their home games in Queanbeyan at Seiffert Oval

God is dead is a well known phrase by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche 

Friedrich Nietzsche wrote this in his book The Gay Science It is also found in Nietzsches classic work Thus Spoke Zarathustra which is most responsible for popularizing the phrase 

The phrase is not meant literally

The idea is stated in The Madman as follows

God is dead does not mean that Nietzsche believed in an actual God who first existed and then died in a literal sense It refers to the growth of non believers in supposedly Christian countries

When one gives up the Christian faith one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under ones feet This morality is by no means self evident By breaking one main concept out of Christianity the faith in God one breaks the whole nothing necessary remains in ones hands This is why in The Madman the passage quoted above mainly addresses nontheists Their problem is to retain any system of values without a divine order

Jean Franois Le Sueur was a French composer best known for his oratorios and operas

Jean Franois Le Sueur was born in a tiny village called Plessiel near Abbeville His great uncle was the painter Eustache Le Sueur He started his musical training by singing in the choir at the church of Abbeville then at the cathedral of Amiens Le Sueur became chorus master at the cathedral of Ses He went to Paris to study harmony His teacher was Abb Nicolas Roze chorus master at the church Saints Innocents Le Sueur got jobs at Dijon Le Mans Tours and then took over Rozes job at the Saints Innocents at Paris In 1786 he was made music director at the famous church Notre Dame de Paris

At Notre Dame he started to use orchestras to play the music for some of the special services The priests did not like this Le Sueur replied by writing a little book about music for big religious celebrations It was a bad time in France financially and the church had to make savings so Le Sueur could not have his orchestra any more so he resigned from his job

Le Sueur spent some time in London 1788 92 then returned to Paris where the revolution was going on Three of his operas were performed and he became professor at the Ecole de la Garde Nationale and then at the Conservatoire which was very new at the time There he taught basic music theory He was unable to get any more operas of his performed He wrote a book saying how music should be taught in France and criticizing the Conservatoire and its director Because of that he lost his job at the Conservatoire 

Le Sueur now had no job and so he was very poor Then in 1804 Napoleon made him matre de la chapelle at the Tuileries in the place of Giovanni Paisiello He was then able to have his most famous work performed at the Opra It was called Ossian ou Les bardes Napoleon liked it very much and gave Le Sueur the cross of the Lgion dhonneur Le Sueur composed the Triumphal March for the coronation of Napoleon In 1813 he was given a position at the Acadmie des Beaux Arts replacing Andr Grtry

At the Bourbon Restoration he was named composer of the royal chapel and conductor of the orchestra of the Opra From the beginning of 1818 he taught composition at the Conservatoire He stayed there many years His most famous pupils were Hector Berlioz Ambroise Thomas and Charles Gounod

He died in Paris

Anton Reicha was a Czech born composer who became naturalized French He was a lifelong friend of Beethoven Reicha is now best remembered for the large number of quintets that he wrote for wind instruments and for his work as a music teacher Franz Liszt and Hector Berlioz were both pupils of Reicha Reicha wrote several books about music theory and composition 

British Rails Class 01 diesel locomotives were a short wheelbase 0 4 0 diesel mechanical design intended for use in areas with tight curves and limited clearance

The British Rail Class 02 were a class of twenty 0 4 0 diesel hydraulic shunting locomotives They were built by the Yorkshire Engine Company in 1960 and 1961 They were built for use in places of restricted loading gauge and curves such as docks They had the door to the cab at the rear with a railed veranda behind the cab This feature was very unusual on British Rail locomotives It was used on many Yorkshire Engine Co designs and wasis quite normal in North American practice

The British Rail Class 03 locomotive is together with Class 04 one of BRs most successful smaller 0 6 0 diesel mechanical shunters There are 230 members of the class and it was built by British Railways Swindon and Doncaster works in 1957 1962 They are numbered D2000 D2199 and D2370 D2399 D2370 and D2371 were used as departmental locomotives and originally numbered 91 and 92 respectively

The British Rail Class 04 0 6 0 diesel mechanical shunting locomotive class was built between 1952 and 1962 It was the basis for the later Class 03 built in the British Railways workshops The Class 04 locomotives were supplied by the Drewry Car Co which at the time had no manufacturing capability Drewry sub contracted the construction work to two builders Both of these built other locomotives under the same arrangement Early locomotives were built by Vulcan Foundry and later examples were built by Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns

File8 Famous TajikpngthumbrightFamous Tajik people 1st row Ismail Samani Rudaki Abu Rayhan Biruni Avicenna

2nd row Al Khwrizm Rumi Emomalii Rahmon Hammasa Kohistani Tajiks are an originally Persian speaking peoples of Iranian origin spread in present day in Afghanistan Tajikistan southern Uzbekistan Because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan large refugee populations can also be found in both Iran and Pakistan

The Tajiks constitute almost four fifths of the population of Tajikistan In the early 21st century there were about than 6000000 Tajiks in Tajikistan and more than 1000000 in Uzbekistan There were over 7000000 in Afghanistan where they constituted about one third of the population Another 40000 lived in the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang in China

The name tjk refers to the traditionally sedentary people who speak a form of Persian called tjk in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and who speak the modern Persian language in Afghanistan

It is generally accepted that the origin of the word tjk is Middle Persian tzk Arab or an Iranian cognate word The Turks of Central Asia adopted a variant of this Iranian word tik to designate the Persian Muslims in the Oxus basin and Khorasan who were variously the Turks rivals models overlords and subjects The term emerged in the ninth and tenth centuries but it was not until the first third of the eleventh century that the term Tjk began to be applied to them Persian writers of the Ghaznavid Seljuq and Atbak periods adopted the term and extended its use to cover Persians in the rest of Iran So this word remained to be used to designate the Persian peoples in Afghanistan and Tajikistan today although these people are neither Arab nor Turk 

The Tajiks are the direct descendants of the Iranian peoples who have lived in Central Asia and northern Afghanistan since very ancient times They were the heirs and transmitters of the Central Asian sedentary culture that diffused in prehistoric times from the Iranian plateau into an area extending roughly from the Caspian Sea to the borders of China The ancestors of the Tajiks constituted the core of the ancient population of Khwrezm Sogdiana and Bactria which formed part of Transoxania They were included in the empires of Persia and Alexander the Great and they intermingled with such later invaders as the Kushns and Hepthalites in the 1st6th centuries AD Over the course of time the eastern Iranian dialect that was used by the ancient Tajiks eventually gave way to Farsi a western dialect spoken in Iran Afghanistan and Tajikistan

The Tajik people have a rich cultural heritage Their homeland which was once called Khorasan was a prosperous and important province of Persia as it was the seat of many rulers Khorasan enjoyed its peak of urban civilization in the period of Abbasids before the Mongol invasion of the thirteenth century and was one of the most significant areas in the muslim Persian world a great centre of literature where the New Persian literature arose and flourished Tajik cities like Herat Balkh Marv Samarkand Bukhara and Ghazni were centres of science and culture out of which came some of the most famous Islamic scholars Many poets arose among the Tajik people such as Rudaki an early Persian poet and Rumi the famous Sufi poet and scientists such as Avicenna Al Farabi Al Biruni Al Khwarizmi and many others who have made outstanding contributions in various domains such as mathematics astronomy medicine physics geography and geology

The Tajiks built villages of flat roofed mud or stone houses and cultivated irrigated fields of wheat barley and millet Their gardens were famous for melons and a variety of fruits Their crafts were highly developed and their towns along the caravan routes linking Persia China and India were centres of trade Turks subsequently migrated westward into the area inhabited by the Tajiks but Tajiks retained their Iranian culture and language

Most Tajiks are Sunni Muslims but a few in remote mountain areas are Shia

The British Rail Class 08 is a class of diesel locomotive designed for shunting It was the standard BR diesel electric shunter It was based on the LMS 12033 series Production started in 1953 and when it finished in 1962 the class had become the most numerous of all British classes numbering 996 in total There were also 26 of the near identical but higher geared Class 09 and 171 similar locomotives fitted with different engines and transmissions which together brought the total number of outwardly similar machines to 1193

Since their introduction rail freight has primarily moved to fixed rate bulk freight traffic and intermodal freight operations which reduce or remove the need for shunting therefore only a few class 08 locomotives remain in service today

Yellow fever is an illness which is caused by a virus The illness can cause bleeding problems It is called yellow because the skin sometimes becomes yellow like it does with jaundice There is a vaccine which can stop the disease but many people in Africa and South America are not vaccinated against it The World Health Organisation say that 200000 people are made ill with yellow fever every year and that 30000 people die from it Yellow fever is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito It does not spread person to person by direct contact

The Opra Comique is an opera house and opera company in Paris Its full name is thtre national de lOpra Comique

The Opra Comique company was started in 1714 to give somewhere to perform French operas At the time operas throughout Europe were nearly always in Italian Opra comique was a French tradition The operas in this tradition were performed with spoken dialogue between the musical numbers This is why the opera house and company were given that name

The Opras Comiques were more popular and less formal that the traditional Italian operas that were performed at the Acadmie Royale de Musique During the three centuries of its existence there have been several changes to it For a time the Opra Comique and the Opra were organized by the same institution

The Opra Comique put on first performances of many famous operas especially Bizets Carmen on 3 March 1875 and Debussys only opera Pellas et Mlisande on 30 April 1902 Berliozs The Damnation of Faust was also first performed there on 6 December 1846 That first performance was a disaster

The building in which the Opra Comique performs is called the salle Favart It is not the same building as in 1714 Two previous buildings were burnt down in 1838 and 1887 The present building was built in 1898

Sir Walter Scott 1st Baronet was a Scottish novelist and poet He was extremely popular in Europe during his time He wrote many historical novels His novels and poetry are still read and many of his works are thought of as classics Some of his most famous works are the poem The Lady of the Lake and the novels Ivanhoe Rob Roy Waverley The Heart of Midlothian and The Bride of Lammermoor

The British Rail Class 09 is a class of 0 6 0 diesel locomotive designed primarily for shunting but also short distance freight trips along branch lines For this reason though similar to the existing Class 08 shunting locomotives Class 09s were re geared to give a maximum top speed of 275 mph at the expense of a lower tractive effort They originally operated in the Southern Region of British Railways though following privatisation in 1997 they have been distributed much farther afield

The British Rail Class 10 diesel locomotive was a variation on the Class 08 diesel electric shunter A Blackstone diesel engine was fitted instead of one made by the English Electric company Traction motors were by either the General Electric Company plc or British Thomson Houston 

The locomotives were built at the BR Works in Darlington and Doncaster over the period 1953 62 Early batches were classified D34 and D35

The British Rail Class 11 is diesel shunting locomotive built from April 1945 to December 1952 They are based on a similar earlier batch built by the London Midland and Scottish Railway between 1939 and 1942

The British Rail Class 12 is a diesel locomotive built mainly for shunting duties 

This was the second batch of standard Southern Railway shunters based on the English Electric 6KT 350 hp diesel engine These locomotives were built by the SR in 1937 and were later classified D312 

The Class 12 locomotives were built at the BR Ashford Works over the period 19491952 They were numbered 1521115236 and became Class 12 No locomotives survived long enough to acquire Class 12 TOPS numbers though

The British Rail Class 13 was formed in 1965 The Tinsley Marshalling Yard needed more powerful shunters to move vehicles around This was provided by permanently coupling together two Class 08 shunters as a master and slave unit The second of the two units had its cab taken off Both units were ballasted to improve traction At first the units were coupled cab to cab but it was easier to couple Master nose to Slave cab The thinking behind adopting this dual locomotive design is that a larger rigid locomotive could not be used due to the risk of grounding on the hump

The British Rail Class 14 is a type of small diesel hydraulic locomotive built in the mid 1960s Twenty six of these 0 6 0 locomotives were ordered in January 1963 to be built at British Railways Swindon Works The anticipated work for this class was yard shunting trip work and short distance freight trains The order was expanded to 56 in mid 1963 before work had started on the first order

The British Rail Class 15 diesel locomotives also known as the BTH Type 1 were designed by British Thomson Houston and built by the Yorkshire Engine Company and the Clayton Equipment Company between 1957 and 1961

The North British Type 1 was a type of diesel locomotive ordered under British Railways 1955 Modernisation Plan Like other Type 1 designs they were relatively small locomotives intended primarily for local freight traffic

The Clayton Type 1 was a class of diesel locomotive operated by British Railways 

The British Rail Class 20 also known as an English Electric Type 1 is a class of diesel electric locomotive 228 locomotives in the class were built by English Electric between 1957 and 1968 The large number was partly to do with the failure of other early designs in the same power range and reliable locomotives veing needed

The locomotives were originally numbered D8000D8199 and D8300D8327 They are known by railway enthusiasts as Chopperscite book last Oakley first Michael title BR Class 20 diesels publisher Bradford Barton DEG date 1981 location Truro isbn 0 85153 419 8 a name taken from the distinctive beat the engine produces under load which resembles the sound of a helicopter

The pawn is the most weak piece in the game of chess standing for infantry or armed peasants or pikemen Each player starts the game with eight pawns one on each square of the second row from the view of the player In the white pawns start on a2 b2 c2 h2 while the black pawns start on a7 b7 c7 h7

Pawns move differently than other pieces Unlike all the other pieces pawns can not move backwards Most of the time a pawn moves by going up a single square but the first time each pawn is moved from its starting place it can go forward two squares Pawns may not use the first two square move to jump over a square with another piece on it or to capture Any piece in front of a pawn white or black stops its moving In the picture at right the pawn on c4 may move to c5 while the pawn on e2 may move to either e3 or e4

The white pawn at d5 can capture either the black rook at c6 or the black knight at e6 but not the bishop at d6 which blocks its straight way forward Unlike other pieces the pawn does not capture in the same way as it moves A pawn captures diagonally one square forward and to the left or right In the picture to the left the white pawn can capture either the black rook or the black knight

An even more unusual move is the en passant capture Suppose the first player is using white pieces En passant happens when the white pawn uses its first move option to move forward two squares instead of one and passes over a square that is occupied by an enemy pawn The black pawn which would have been able to capture the white pawn if the white one had moved forward only one square can capture the white pawn in its next move in passing as if the white pawn had moved forward only one square The black pawn moves into the empty square over which the white pawn moved and the white pawn is removed from the board The option to capture en passant can only be used on the move right after the double square pawn advance or the chance is lost The en passant move was added in the late thirteenth century to make up for the then newly added two square first move rule

The most simple piece in chess the pawn was started in the oldest version of chess Chaturanga It is present in all other important types of chess around the world The ability to move two spaces and to have an en passant capture were only started in 15th century Europe

In medieval chess players tried to make the pawns more interesting giving each ranks pawn the name of a commoners job from left to right

The North British Type 2 diesel electric was a type of diesel locomotive built by the North British Locomotive Company in Glasgow for British Railways in 1958 1960

Starting in 2007 the classification has been reused for new Vossloh G1206 acquired by Euro Cargo RailEWS

The British Rail Class 22 or Baby Warship was a class of diesel hydraulic locomotives designed for the Western Region and built by North British Locomotive Company They were very similar in appearance to the Class 21 diesel electrics

The British Rail Class 23 Bo Bo Diesel electric locomotives were a ten strong class of locomotives built by the English Electric Company in 1959 They were numbered from D5900 to D5909 The power unit used was a Napier Deltic T9 29 9 cylinder engine of 1100 bhp driving an EE generator which powered the four traction motors 

The British Rail Class 24 diesel locomotives also known as the Sulzer Type 2 were built from 1958 to 1961 One hundred and fifty one of these locomotives were built at Derby Crewe and Darlington the first twenty of them as part of the 1955 British Rail modernisation plan This class was used as the basis for the development of the Class 25 locomotives

The final survivor no 24081 was withdrawn from Crewe depot in 1980

The British Rail Class 25 diesel locomotives were also known as Sulzer Type 2 and nicknamed Rats 327 locomotives of this type were built between 1961 and 1967 

The British Rail Class 26 diesel locomotives also known as the BRCW Type 2 were built by the Birmingham Railway Carriage Wagon Company at Smethwick in 1958 59 Forty seven examples were built and the last were withdrawn from service in 1993 Like their higher powered sisters the BRCW Classes 27 and 33 they did not have fibreglass cab ends

British Rails Class 27 was a diesel locomotive built by the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company during 1961 and 1962 They were a development of the earlier Class 26 both were originally classified as the BRCW Type 2 There are 69 locomotives in the class

The British Rail Class 28 diesel locomotives or Metrovicks as they were popularly known were built as part of the British Railways Modernisation plan The locomotives had a Co Bo wheel arrangement unique in British Railways practice though not uncommon in other countries notably Japan This affected their route availability due to the different axle loading at each end of the loco and made maintenance more complicated The maximum tractive effort of 50000 lbf was unusually high for a Type 2 locomotive but as there were five driving axles the risk of wheelslip was minimal

The British Rail Class 29 consisted of 20 diesel locomotives which were rebuilt from the North British Class 21 The original license built MAN engines of the Class 21s had proved unreliable so in 1963 locomotive D6123 was sent to Paxmans Colchester works to receive a new Paxman Ventura V12 engine A further 19 were re engined in 1964 1965 at Polmadie Works with other changes made at the same time This included the fitting of four character headcode displays in the nose ends After rebuilding they returned to service from Eastfield depot in Glasgow

Although these offered more power and much improved reliability over the original Class 21s they did not survive much longer due to their small class size and the use of a non standard high speed diesel engine D6108 was withdrawn in May 1969 and scrapped by McWilliams of Shettleston in 1971 while the other 19 were withdrawn between April and December 1971 and scrapped at BRs Glasgow Works in 1971 72 No Class 21 or Class 29 locomotives survive today 

In the board game chess each player starts with 16 Chess pieces The moves of the pieces are defined by tradition and by the international chess federation FIDE 

The bottom right square of the board for each player must be white Remember White is right 

Pawn  A pawn can only move ahead to the far end of the board A pawn is placed in each square on the second row away from each player at the beginning of a game right in front of all of their other pieces so each player begins with eight pawns Most times a pawn can only move to one square the square in front of it But a pawn that has not moved yet in the game can move ahead two squares or just one 

If an enemy piece is straight in front of a pawn the pawn cannot capture that piece Pawns have a special way to capture A pawn can capture an enemy piece which is on the diagonal square to the left or right of the square in front of it This is the only time a pawn can move to a square that is not straight in front of it

If a pawn reaches the end of the board it is removed and replaced by any other piece the player chooses except a king or pawn

If a pawn moves two squares on its first move it may be taken by an enemy pawn as if it had moved only one This is called en passant A pawn is worth 1 point

Bishop  A bishop can move any number of squares diagonally meaning if you pretend the bishop is in the middle of a big X it can move to any square along the lines of the X Because of this a bishop will be on the same color of squares for the whole game At the start a bishop is placed on the third from the left and third from the right of the row of pieces closest to each player A bishop is worth 3 points

Knight  The knight is special because it is the only piece than can jump over other pieces When a knight moves first it goes two squares in one of the four ways a rook can move Then the knight ends its move by going one square to the side The knight is said to move in the shape of an L See the picture It jumps over the pieces on its way to its new square and does not capture them but the knight will capture an enemy piece if it lands on one Knights are placed at the second and seventh squares on the rows closest to each player between the rooks and the bishops A knight is worth 3 points

Rook  A rook can move any number of squares left or right on the ranks and up down on the files Rooks start at the far left and far right squares in the row closest to each player next to the knights A rook is worth 5 points

Queen  The queen combines the moves of a bishop and a rook The queen is placed next to the king on a square of its own colour Thus the two queens exactly face each other at the start The queen is worth 9 points

King  The king starts next to the queen The king can move to one of the eight squares around it It is limited as an active piece but always is vulnerable to attack No numerical value can be put on it

A king may perform a special move known as castling This is when a king moves two spaces towards a rook and the rook moves to the square on the other side of the king This may not be done if

The British Rail Class 31 diesel locomotives also known as the Brush Type 2 and originally as Class 30 were built by Brush Traction from 1957 62

The British Rail Class 33 also known as the BRCW Type 3 or Crompton is a class of Bo Bo diesel locomotives ordered in 1957 and built for the Southern Region of British Railways between 1959 and 1963

A total of 98 class 33s were built by the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company and they were called Cromptons after the Crompton Parkinson electrical equipment installed in them Like their lower powered BRCW sisters their bodywork and cab ends were of all steel construction

The original number sequence was D6500D6597 

The British Rail Class 35 is a class of mixed traffic B B diesel locomotive with hydraulic transmission On account of their Mekydro design hydraulic transmission units the design became known as the Hymeks

The type was developed for the Western Region of British Railways which had opted for lightweight locomotives with hydraulic transmission when allocated funds under the British Railways Modernisation Plan of 1955 One hundred and one of the class were built between 1961 and 1964 when it became apparent that there was a requirement for a medium power diesel hydraulic design for both secondary passenger work and freight duties

They were allocated to Bristol Bath Road Cardiff Canton and Old Oak Common None of the class was named Withdrawal from service began in 1971 and by 1975 all had been withdrawn Their early withdrawal was caused primarily by BR classifying the hydraulic transmission as non standard Four examples survived into preservation

The British Rail Class 37 is a diesel electric locomotive It is also known as the English Electric Type 3 The Class was ordered as part of the British Rail modernisation plan

The Class 37 became a familiar sight on many parts of the British Rail network They were on Inter City services in East Anglia and within Scotland They also performed well on secondary and inter regional services for many years The Class 37 is known by railway enthusiasts as a Tractor This nickname came from the similarity of the sound of the locomotive

The British Rail Class 40 is a type of British railway diesel locomotive Built by English Electric between 1958 and 1962 and eventually numbering 200 they were for a time the pride of the British Rail early diesel fleet Despite their initial success by the time the last examples were entering service they were already being replaced on some top link duties by more powerful locomotives As they were slowly relegated from express passenger uses the type found work on secondary passenger and freight services where they worked for many years the final locomotives being retired from regular service in 1985

Eudicots and Eudicotyledons are a type of flowering plant The are one of the two major clades A few examples of eudicots are forget me not cabbage apple dandelion buttercup maple and macadamia

Caryophyllales is a flowering plant order that includes the cacti carnations amaranths ice plants and most carnivorous plants Many members are succulent having fleshy stems or leaves

There have been two distinct types of British Rail locomotive that are referred to as Class 41

British Railways Type 4 Warship class diesel hydraulic locomotives were introduced in 1958 It was apparent at that time that the largest centre of expertise on diesel hydraulic locomotives was in Germany The Western Region of British Railways negotiated a licence with German manufacturers to scale down the German Federal Railways V200 design to suit the smaller loading gauge of the British network and to allow British manufacturers to construct the new design The resultant design bears a close resemblance both cosmetically and in the engineering employed They were divided into two batches examples built at BRs Swindon works were numbered in the series D800 to D832 and from D866 to D870 had a maximum tractive effort of 52400 pounds force and are the British Rail Class 42 of this article 33 others D833 865 were constructed by the North British Locomotive Company and became British Rail Class 43 They were allocated to Bristol Bath Road Plymouth Laira Newton Abbot and Old Oak Common

There have been two distinct types of British Rail locomotive that have been allocated Class 43

The British Rail Class 44 or Sulzer Type 4 diesel locomotives were built by British Railways Derby Works between 1959 to 1960 They were named after British mountains and consequently nicknamed Peaks

The British Rail Class 45 also known as the Sulzer Type 4 diesel locomotives were built by British Rail at their Derby and Crewe Works between 1960 and 1962 They were the successors to the Class 44 locomotives When initially put into service the locomotives were fitted with multi unit working and steam heating boilers for passenger service In the early 1970s fifty were fitted with electric train supply in place of their steam heating boilers and assigned to work services on the Midland Main Line from London St Pancras to Nottingham Derby and Sheffield All were withdrawn from service by 1989

The British Rail Class 46 is a class of diesel locomotive They were built from 1961 1963 at British Railways Derby Works and were initially numbered D138 D193 With the arrival of TOPS they were renumbered to Class 46 Fifty six locomotives were built The first was withdrawn in 1977 and all of them were withdrawn by 1984

The Class 46 design was structurally the same as the preceding Class 45 build and had the same Sulzer engine but differed in the fitment of a Brush generator and traction motors in place of the Crompton Parkinson equipment fitted to the Class 45

The British Rail Class 47 is a class of British railway diesel electric locomotive that was developed in the 1960s by Brush Traction A total of 512 Class 47s were built at Crewe Works and Brushs Falcon Works Loughborough between 1962 and 1968 which made them the most numerous class of British mainline diesel locomotive

They were fitted with the Sulzer 12LDA28C twin bank twelve cylinder unit producing convert2750bhpabbronlkin and have been used on both passenger and freight trains on Britains railways for over 40 years Despite the introduction of more modern types of traction as of 2008 a significant number are still in use both on the mainline and on heritage railways As of December 2008 103 locomotives are still extant with 29 working on the mainline

The British Rail Class 48 was a diesel locomotive class which consisted of five examples built at Brush Falcon Works in Loughborough and delivered between September 1965 and July 1966 They were part of the British Rail Class 47 order but differed from their classmates by being fitted with a Sulzer V12 12LVA24 power unit producing convert2650bhpabbronlkin0 as opposed to the standard 12LDA28C twin bank twelve cylinder unit of the remaining fleet

The British Rail Class 50 is a diesel locomotive built from 1967 68 by English Electric at their Vulcan Foundry Works in Newton le Willows Fifty of these locomotives were built to haul express passenger trains on the then non electrified section of the West Coast Main Line between Crewe Carlisle and Scotland They were originally hired from English Electric Leasings not being purchased outright by BR until around 1973 Under the pre 1968 classification system these locomotives were known as the English Electric Type 4 The class were affectionately nicknamed Hoovers by rail enthusiasts because of their distinctive engine sound caused by the centrifugal air filters originally fitted These proved unreliable and were later removed but the Hoover nickname stuck

British Rail assigned Class 52 to the class of 74 large Type 4 diesel hydraulic locomotives built for the Western Region of British Railways between 1961 and 1964 All were given two word names with the first word being Western and thus the type became known as Westerns

British Rail gave the name Class 53 to the single Brush Traction built example train Falcon Although it worked the idea of Class 53 was made old by new locomotive technology and was never made twice

The British Rail Class 55 is a class of diesel locomotive built between 1961 and 1962 by English Electric They were designed for the high speed express passenger services on the East Coast Main Line between London Kings Cross and Edinburgh They gained the name Deltic from the prototype locomotive DP1 Deltic which in turn was named for its Napier Deltic power units 22 locomotives were built and they dominated services on the line until their withdrawal at the end of 1981 Six locomotives were preserved and are still running today

The first thirty locomotives were built by Electroputere in Romania but these suffered from poor construction standards and many were withdrawn from service early The remaining 105 locomotives were built by BREL at Doncaster Works and Crewe Works Enthusiasts nicknamed them Grids likely due to the grid like horn cover on the locomotives cab ends The Grid name was given due to the fact that class 56 locomotives were the main motive power used on merry go round coal deliveries to national grid power stations

The British Rail Class 57 diesel locomotives were made by Brush Traction between 1997 and 2004 They are rebuilds with new engines of older Class 47 locomotives originally introduced in 19641965 They are known as bodysnatchers or Zombies to enthusiasts because the shell of the class 47 has been stripped rewired and re engined

The British Rail Class 58 is a class of Co Co diesel locomotive designed for heavy freight Introduced in 1982 they followed American practice of modularisation From new they were painted in grey Railfreight Sector livery instead of BR blue EWS withdrew them in 2002 after 20 years in service though 30 were subsequently hired abroadfour to the Netherlands eight to Spain and twenty to France

The Class 59 Co Co diesel locomotives were built and introduced between 1985 and 1995 by General Motors Electro Motive Diesel for private British companies initially Foster Yeoman They were designed for hauling heavy freight and designated JT26CW SS

The British Rail Class 60 is a class of Co Co diesel locomotive designed for heavy freight work While they remain the most powerful diesel locomotives in the UK fleet they have suffered from poor reliability throughout their service life

The Class 66 locomotive is a development of the Class 59 and used both on British and European railway networkswhere it is marketed as EMD Series 66 

The Class 67 locomotives were built from 1999 to 2000 by Alstom in Valencia Spain under sub contract from General Motors Diesel in Canada

The British Rail class 70 was a class of three 3rd rail Co Co electric locomotives The initial two were built by the Southern Railway at Ashford Works in 1941 and 1945 and were numbered CC1 and CC2 Electrical equipment was designed by Alfred Raworth and the body by Oliver Bulleid CC2 was modified slightly from the original design by C M Cock who had succeeded Raworth as Electrical Engineer The third was built by British Railways in 1948 and numbered 20003

The Class 70 has been in one accident On 10 January 2011 while being unloaded by a crane from a boat after delivery locomotive number 70012 was dropped from about 13 feet in the air back into the boat It has since been scrapped and a replacement ordered

Balaenoptera omurai is a species of whale Almost nothing is known about it It does not have a common name

A rook is a piece in the board game of chess Its name derives from its name in the old IndoArabic game Each player starts the game with two rooks When recording games it is shortened to R and when printed a figurine is used

In chess notation the white rooks start on the a1 and h1 squares and the black rooks start on the a8 and h8 squares 

The rook moves forward or back on the files through any number of squares without other pieces on them and sideways on the ranks This is shown in the diagram below Like other pieces it captures by going into the square on which an enemy piece stands 

The rook also takes part in a special move called castling along with the king

Angels and Airwaves is an American alternative rock band It was formed by former Blink 182 singer and guitarist Thomas DeLonge The memers of the band were Atom Willard former Offspring drummer Matt Wachter former bassist of 30 Seconds to Mars and David Kennedy former guitarist of Hazen Street and Boxcar Racer 

DeLonge created the band angels and airwaves to bring good music to people ears The band performed amazing live performances and was well liked by Delonges fans Most of the songs have long built up intros with guitars synthesizer drums and keyboards Delonge showed over time that his live voice had improved since his time singing for Blink 182 

Angels and Airwaves released their first album We Dont Need To Whisper in 2005 The second studio album I Empire was released in October 2007 It was a more lighthearted album with a faster beat AvA has toured very much They have said that they will be playing for the second year in a row at Vans Warped tour They will be playing the entire tour 

DeLonge has covered a few songs from Blink 182 but he has never played the full song in respect to his former band mates He has played slowed versions of Down I Miss You Not Now and Reckless Abandon He only plays these songs by himself with his guitar

Louis Antoine Jullien was a French conductor who was famous for his showmanship

Jullien was born in Sisteron in the French Alps At his baptism he had 36 godfathers and was given 36 Christian names He studied at the Paris Conservatoire He was a good musician but mostly he enjoyed popular dance music He conducted a band but had to leave Paris because he owed people a lot of money

He went to London where he formed a good orchestra His orchestra played at a series of summer concerts Later he conducted a series of winter concerts Although he was a good conductor he was a great showman He would make a big show of putting on his white gloves which were given to him on a silver plate He used a special baton which had jewels in it when he conducted Beethoven He wore a white waistcoat and enormous wrist bands and he had a huge moustache and long black hair He would throw himself around when conducting and finish by sinking into a velvet chair The audience loved it especially when he added military bands to his orchestra He used to conduct facing the audience He conducted concerts in the London theatres and parks 

Julliens programmes included works by the great composers eg Beethoven and Mozart but they were always mixed with light music dances quadrilles marches etc He often added lots of extra instruments to the great classics eg when he conducted Beethovens Fifth Symphony he added four ophicleides a saxophone and side drums 

Jullien travelled to Scotland Ireland and America with his orchestra In 1852 he produced an opera Pietro il grande at Covent Garden but it cost a ridiculous amount of money and he was financially ruined 

Eventually he went back to France where he was arrested and put in prison because of his debts He died in a lunatic asylum His wife to whom he had been happily married lived on for many years and their son Louis became a conductor and tried to conduct promenade concerts but he did not have much success

Julliens behaviour might seem strange to us today but he lived at a time when the role of the conductor was becoming very important as orchestras had become much larger than they had been in the 18th century He gave people who had never heard good classical music the chance to hear the music by the great composers He had a very big influence on the musical scene in London and people talked about him for many years after his death

The British Rail Class 71 was an electric locomotive used on the Southern Region of British Railways Unlike most other Southern Region electric locomotives they could not operate away from the electrified system

The British Rail Class 73 electro diesel locomotives are very unusual in that they can operate from a 750 V DC third rail supply but also have a diesel engine to allow them to operate on non electrified routes This makes them very versatile although the diesel engine produces less power than is available from the third rail supply so they rarely stray from the former Southern Region of British Rail Following the withdrawal of the more powerful Class 74 electro diesels in 1977 the Class 73 is now unique on the British rail system

British Rail class 74 was an electro diesel locomotive that operated on the Southern Region of British Railways rebuilt from redundant Class 71 locomotives in the late 1960s An electro diesel locomotive is one that can operate either from an electrical supply such as overhead catenary or an energized third rail or from an onboard diesel engine

The British Rail Class 76 also known as Class EM1 is a class of 15kV DC Bo Bo electric locomotive designed for use on the now closed Woodhead Line in Northern England

Class 80 was the TOPS classification allocated by British Rail to the prototype 25 kV AC electric locomotive This locomotive was built by Metropolitan Vickers initially as a prototype Gas turbine electric locomotive numbered 18100 British Rail allocated the number E1000 to the locomotive following its conversion from gas turbine propulsion 

The British Rail Class 77 also known as Class EM2 is a class of 15 kV DC Co Co electric locomotive They were built by Metropolitan Vickers in 19531954 for use over the Woodhead Line between Manchester and Sheffield

The British Rail Class 81 is an AC electric locomotive that formerly operated on the West Coast Main Line of the London Midland Region of British Rail

The British Rail Class 84 was a 25 kV AC electric locomotive that operated on the West Coast Main Line of the London Midland Region

The British Rail Class 86 was the standard electric locomotive built during the 1960s developed as a result of testing with the earlier Classes 81 82 83 84 and 85 One hundred of these locomotives were built from 1965 1966 by either English Electric at Vulcan Foundry Newton le Willows or British Rail at their Doncaster works The class was built to haul trains on the then newly electrified West Coast Main Line from London Euston to Birmingham Crewe Manchester Piccadilly Liverpool and later Preston and Glasgow They helped to replace steam locomotives which were finally withdrawn by BR in 1968

The British Rail Class 87 is a type of electric locomotive built from 1973 75 by British Rail Engineering Limited 36 of these locomotives were built to work passenger services over the West Coast Main Line They were the flagships of British Rails electric locomotive fleet until the late 1980s when the Class 90s started to come onstream The privatisation of British Rail saw all but one of the fleet transferred to Virgin Trains they continued their duties until the advent of the new Pendolino trains when they were transferred to other operators or withdrawn The last Class 87 in UK mainline use was withdrawn from service on 31 December 2007 Most have now been sold for reuse in Bulgaria

The British Rail Class 82 electric locomotives were built by Beyer Peacock and Company between 1960 and 1962 as part of the West Coast Main Line electrification

The British Rail Class 83 electric locomotives were built by English Electric at Vulcan Foundry Newton le Willows as part of the West Coast Main Line electrification

The British Rail Class 85 is an electric locomotive built during the early 1960s as part of BRs policy to develop a standard electric locomotive Five prototype classes were built and evaluated which eventually led to the development of the Class 86 locomotive The locomotives of Class 85 were Originally fitted with germanium rectifiers which were eventually replaced by silicon rectifiers Forty of these locomotives were built from 1961 64 by BR at Doncaster Works The class were used to haul trains on the then newly electrified West Coast Main Line from Birmingham to Crewe Manchester Piccadilly Liverpool and later Preston By 1965 electrification had spread south to London Euston

Under the earlier BR classification the type was given the designation AL5 and locomotives were numbered E3056 E3095 In 1968 this was changed to Class 85 when BR introduced a new computer numbering system From 1971 onwards locomotives were progressively renumbered into the 85001 040 series Fifteen locomotives were converted for freight only use numbered in the 851 series These locomotives were restricted to 80mph 

The Class 89 is a prototype design for an electric locomotive Only one unit was built no 89001 which was officially named Avocet by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on January 16 1989 at Sandy Bedfordshire  the home of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds It was built in 1986 by BREL at their Crewe Works and was used on test trains on both the West Coast Main Line and East Coast Main Line It was fitted with advanced power control systems and develops over 6000 bhp It was given the nickname Aardvark although the railfans used to call it The Badger owing to its sloping front ends

The British Rail Class 90 electric locomotives were built by BREL at Crewe from 1987 1990 Each locomotive weighs 845 tonnes and has a top speed of convert110mphkmhabbronlkon They operate from 25 kV AC overhead wires and produce convert5000bhpabbronlkon The class is employed on both express passenger services and heavy freight trains

The Japan Cup is the most important horse race in Japan It is held at the end of November in the Tokyo Racecourse The race is 2400 metres long and the winner gets about 533 million as an award

There have been a number of TOPS class numbers assigned to proposed locomotives that have not been built for one reason or another

The British Rail Class 91 is a class of 140 mph 6300 hp electric locomotives ordered specifically for the East Coast Main Line modernisation and electrification programme of the late 1980s Built to replace the previous Class 43 the Class 91s were given the auxiliary name of InterCity 225 to indicate their status as a new version of the 125 and their envisaged top speed of 225kmh The other end of the InterCity 225 train set is formed of a Driving Van Trailer built with a similar bodyshell to the Class 91 locomotives

Enchanted is a 2007 American musical film produced by Walt Disney Pictures written by Bill Kelly and directed by Kevin Lima It premiered on 20 October 2007 at the London Film Festival

The Class 92 is a dual voltage British railway locomotive which can run on 25 kV AC from overhead wires or 750 V DC from a third rail It was designed specifically to operate services through the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France Eurotunnel indicates the Class 92 locomotive as the reference for other locomotives which railway undertakings might want to get certified for usage in the Channel tunnel

Class 93 is the traction classification assigned to the electric locomotives that were to enter service as part of British Rails InterCity 250 project on the West Coast Main Line They would have been derived from the Class 91 locomotives that entered service on the East Coast Main Line in 1989 The locomotive would have been utilised along with a train of up to nine Mark 5 coaches and a DVT similar to the InterCity 225 sets The locomotives would have been capable of up to 155 mph Tenders to construct the locomotives and rolling stock were issued in March 1991 with an expected in service date of 1995 it was envisaged that up to 30 complete trains would be initially required with a total cost estimated at 380 million However the cancellation of the InterCity 250 project in 1992 meant that the rolling stock orders were never made Here is a picture of what the cab may have looked like

The 1994 Atlantic hurricane season was the time from June 1 to November 30 1994 when hurricanes officially formed in the Atlantic Ocean Storms sometimes form before and after these dates but most storms form during the season However in this season no Tropical Cyclone formed after November 30 the end of the season because the last storm Hurricane Gorden died on November 21 just nine days before the 30th 

The season was unusual in that it produced no major hurricanes which are those of Category 3 status or higher on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Scale The strongest Hurricane Florence its top winds were at a Category 2 storm with winds of 110 mph Aside from Chris Florence and Gordon none of the storms became hurricanes A famous hurricane from 1994 would probably be Hurricane Gordon Hurricane Gordon was a strange long lived November hurricane that killed at least 1100 people in Haiti

1994 Atlantic hurricane season storms

Alberto formed from a north moving tropical depression north of the Yucatn Peninsula on July 2 Tropical Storm Alberto continued north making landfall near Destin Florida on July 3 as a moderately strong tropical storm The storm weakened quickly to a tropical depression which then moved around Georgia and Alabama until it dissipated on July 7 Damage was guessed at 500 million and 30 deaths were caused by the effects of Tropical Storm Alberto

Tropical Depression Two formed near South Carolina on the 19th The depression moved north making landfall in South Carolina and dissipated on July 23rd No damage or deaths reported 

Beryl formed off the Florida Panhandle on August 15 only twelve hours before it made landfall near Panama City Florida Beryl quickly strengthened before landfall and reached its top winds of 60 mph Beryl caused inland flooding as it moved through Georgia across the Carolinas and all the way to Connecticut where it was absorbed by a frontal system Damage was guessed at 73 million Though it caused no deaths a lot of people were injured by the 37 tornadoes Beryl produced as it weakened

Chris formed midway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde on August 17 and reached hurricane strength the next day It moved to the northwest and turned north and brushed Bermuda as a weak tropical storm on the 21st Chris continued north and dissipated without causing any damage 

The wave that would become Tropical Depression Five was tracked beginning on August 17 The wave was upgraded into a depression on August 29 near the Yucatn Peninsula Tropical Depression Five made landfall in Tampico on the 31st and dissipating the same day over Mexico No damage was caused by Tropica Depression Five 

Tropical Storm Debby formed on September 10 just east of the lesser antilies The storm crossed some of the islands and dissipated south of Puerto Rico on the 11th Nine people dead because of Tropical Storm Debby Damage estimates are not available It cause flooding and mudslides in Saint Lucia 

Ernesto formed southwest of Cape Verde on September 22 it became Tropical Storm Ernesto It moved north for two days and by the 24th had weakened to a tropical depression Two days later Ernesto dissipated without affecting any land 

Tropical Depression Eight formed on September 19 in the southwestern Caribbean Sea The wave strengthened into Tropical Depression Eight on September 24 near Honduras Tropical Depression Eight made landfall in Mexico and dissipated the next day over Guatemala Some reports show that the remnants of Eight became Tropical Depression Ten 

Tropical Depression Nine form off the coast of Africa on September 26 It was upgraded to the ninth depression of the 1994 season 150 miles southeast from the Cape Verde Islands the next day The depression moved north and dissipated on September 29 

An area of disturbed weather related to Tropical Depression Eight moved across the northwest Caribbean Sea and the Yucatn Peninsula A tropical wave moved into the area causing an increase in showers and cloudiness The wave became Tropical Depression Ten on September 29 about 150 miles off the coast of Cuba The system became better organized and when the depression moved into the Gulf of Mexico it was absorbed by a non tropical system on 30th Tropical Depression Ten caused 5 million in damage

Florence at first formed as a subtropical depression in the central Atlantic on November 2 As it northwest it took on tropical characteristics and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Florence on the 4th It reached hurricane strength then turned to the northeast and on November 6 as it was picked up by a strong trough Two days later Florence was absorbed by the same trough that made it turn northeast There was no reported damage 

Hurricane Gordon was a very deadly and damaging tropical storm for the Caribbean Florida and parts of North Carolina The storm was very slow moving on its path over the Caribbean This storm killed over 1100 people The storms strange motion was making Hurricane Gordon hard to forecast where it would actually go and where it would reach land Damage was guessed to be at 400 million 

Around Christmas in 1994 a noreaster may have had tropical characteristics though it was not called a tropical system It affected the Mid Atlantic and New England causing damage at 21 million

In 1994 only 7 out of 21 names were used The following names were supposed to be used 

No names retired as a result all name will be used again in 2000

The British Rail Class 100 diesel multiple units were built by Gloucester Railway Carriage Wagon Company Limited from 1956 to 1958 designed and built in collaboration with the Transport Sales Dept of TI Ltd 

The British Rail Class 101 diesel multiple units were built by Metro Cammell at Washwood Heath in Birmingham from 1956 to 1959 following construction of a series of prototype units This class proved to be the most successful and longest lived of all BRs First Generation DMUs with the final five units being withdrawn on 24 December 2003 The oldest set was by then just over 47 years old

The British Rail Class 103 diesel multiple units were built by Park Royal Vehicles with diesel engines by British United Traction Ordered in the first half of 1955 20 of these sets were built by Park Royal at the Crossley Motors works in Stockport of the ACV Group They consisted of a power car and a driving trailer Standard BUT equipment was fitted with A type engines

A two car set with 16 first class and 100 second class seats weighed just under 60 long tons representing 1150 lb a seat and had 5 hp per ton of empty weight or 435 hp per ton when full

The British Rail Class 104 diesel multiple units were built by Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company from 1957 to 1959

The first units ordered were for the London Midland Region with the majority of the class for use in North West of England with sets also in Tyneside In the mid 1980s a few units reallocated to Scotland with one unit being repainted in a unique maroon and white livery for services to Oban  it became known as the Mexican Bean Other vehicles spent time in London and the last vehicles could be found there in the early 1990s

The class was gradually taken of service from the early 1980s The final vehicles were withdrawn in 1995

The British Rail Class 108 diesel multiple units were built by BR Derby from 1958 to 1961 with a final production quantity of 333 vehicles

These units stayed in were used till the 1990s after which they were withdrawn from traffic

The Class 111 DMUs were based on Class 1012s but with different engines The only external body difference was on the final batch of cars where a four character headcode box was fitted above the front cab windows with the destination indicator on top of a reduced height centre window

The first cars built part of an order for 339 Met Camm cars were 4 powertrailer sets for the LMR Manchester area built in early 1957 One of these was equipped with supercharged 230 hp 6 cylinder engines This was followed by ten 3 car sets comprising DMBSTSDMC for the NER at Bradford then a further twenty 3 car sets

The Class 112 DMUs used the standard Cravens body used for Class 105s but had a single Rolls Royce engine of 238 hp per car and they were all formed into power twins two car sets with both vehicles powered

There were two batches built the first 50 vehicles had standard mechanical transmission via a gearbox and were allocated the Class 112 The second batch of 50 cars had hydraulic transmission and became Class 113s

The cars were built for services in the LMR Central Division and in the Liverpool  St Helens area where the gradients in the Lancashire Yorkshire area required more power Both types also spent some time working from Cricklewood

The gross weight of a set with all seats occupied was approximately 70 tons giving 68 hp per ton Empty it was 81 hpton which compared favourably with 57 hpton that the Cravens powertrailer had

A red giant is a very big star that weighs about one half to ten times as much as our Sun Red giants get their name because they appear to be colored red and they are very large Many red giants could fit thousands and thousands of suns like ours inside of them Some red giants have names like Mira Aldebaran Arcturus and Gamma Crucis 

Right now our Sun is a main sequence star not a red giant However five billion years from now scientists believe our sun will become a red giant It will be about 200 times bigger than it is now It will become so big it will swallow up Mercury Venus and even the Earth

All new stars change hydrogen to helium through nuclear fusion This makes a lot of energy and heat In a normal star like our Sun and all other main sequence stars this change happens at the very center of the star Sooner or later almost all of the hydrogen at the center has changed to helium This causes the nuclear reaction to stop The center will start to get smaller due to the stars gravity This makes the layer just outside the center get hotter This layer still has hydrogen This hydrogen will fuse to make helium

The outer layers of the star will get much much bigger The star will get brighter sometimes as much as ten thousand times as bright as it was at first Since the outside of the star will get bigger the energy will be spread over a much larger area Because of this the temperature of the surface will go down and the color will change to red or orange

Sometime later red giants will start to fuse helium to make other elements like carbon nitrogen and oxygen Some of their outer layers will blow away leaving interstellar gas and dust circling the star In time most red giants will become white dwarfs Very large red giants become neutron stars or black holes

Hypergiants are the largest stars in the Universe even larger than supergiants The exact definition is unclear although the hypergiant with the largest known diameter is VY Canis Majoris which is between 1800 to 2100 times wider than the Sun or roughly the same width as the orbit of Saturn

Hypergiants are very rare and they have a short lifespan While the Sun has a lifespan of around 10 billion yeas hypergiants will only exist for a few million years

Shiver is a single released by rock band Coldplay Shiver was released off the album Parachutes in March 2000 A re release was released a year later in February 2001 

The format of the single by Coldplay is a CD It plays as an Extended Play

Yellow is a song by English alternative rock band Coldplay The band wrote the song and co produced it with British record producer Ken Nelson It was for their first album Parachutes The songs lyrics are a reference to band vocalist Chris Martins unreturned love

The song was released across the world in June 2000 It was the second single off the album following Shiver It was the lead single in the United States The single reached number four in the UK Singles Chart This gave the band their first top five hit in the United Kingdom

Helped by heavy rotation and usage in promotions the song made the band very popular Various recording artists worldwide have since made their own versions of Yellow It remains one of the bands most popular songs

Yellow was written in a Rockfield studio in Wales The studio is called the Quadrangle It is where Coldplay began working on their first album Parachutes One night after finishing recording Shiver the lead single of the album the band took a break and went out of the studio Outside there were few lights on and the stars in the sky were visible and just amazing according to the songs co producer Ken Nelson He told the band to look at the stars The band looked at the stars and felt generally inspired The songs main melody popped into the head of Chris Martin the bands vocalist The melody was a chord pattern At first Martin did not take it seriously as he relayed the tune to the rest of the band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice Martin has said The song had the word stars and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice The melody started off a lot slower according to Will Champion the bands drummer and sounded like a Neil Young song Not long after despite not taking the song seriously Martins idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse When Jonny Buckland the bands guitarist started playing it and added to it with his own ideas they had created the riff and it sort of got a bit heavier

While composing the songs lyrics however Martin could not find the right words He was thinking of a specific word to fit the songs main idea and theme He thought that this missing word was a key word in the lyrics He looked around the studio and found the telephone directory Yellow Pages Martin later titled the song Yellow as a reference to the directory But according to him In an alternate universe this song could be called Playboy The lyrics progressed from there with the band collaborating The bands bassist Guy Berryman came up with the opening line Look at the stars That night having quickly composed the song the band recorded it

The band and Nelson produced the track Nelson was introduced to the bands music through the bands manager Nelsons manager gave him a copy of an EP and single by Coldplay Nelson wanted to work them after seeing the band perform live Yellow was first recorded upstairs in the project studio This was a demo room in Liverpools Parr Street Studios

Nelson and the band had some problems when they were making some parts of the song Champion said that it was really difficult to record because it worked at about five or six different tempos It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play because sometimes it sounded too rushed and sometimes it sounded as if it was dragging The band was trying to get the tempo correctly according to Nelson because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didnt have the same groove To improve the song they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar They recorded it two or three times until Nelson and the band were happy at the output The backing vocals were recorded in the control room of Quadrangle

Nelson used an analogue tape to record most of the tracks in the album As recording progressed Yellow was one of a couple of songs that they couldnt quite get on analogue They recorded different versions but it did not satisfy their taste So Nelson used Pro Tools to get the feel of the track just right Once all of the takes were recorded into the computer we then put it down to the 2 inch which I found was a great way to do it according to Nelson

The song opens with an acoustic guitar part This is backed by an electric guitar copying the acoustic guitar It then forwards to the lead guitar line It then goes back to the acoustic section Its instrumentation is varied including the drums cymbals and the occasional hi hat and ascending bass guitar Yellow features Martins falsetto and nearly spoken word whispers Martin after the songs mixing felt that his voice was too subdued too quiet

Martin has explained that Yellow refers to the mood of the band Brightness and hope and broken wikt linkdevotiondevotion The references in some of the songs lyrics including the swimming and drawing a line are all metaphorical slants on the extent of his emotional devotion The drawing of a line refers to Martins habit of writing lists and underlining those important things on the list Martin has commented that the song is about devotion He refers to his unreturned love Most people have considered Yellow as a happy song even though the lyrics do not seem to be

Yellow and Shiver were first released as EPs in the spring of 2000 Yellow was later released as a single in UK on 26 June 2000 The single includes the songs Help Is Round the Corner and No More Keeping My Feet on the Ground The third song was taken from the bands first EP Safety In the United States however the song was released as the lead single off the album In October 2000 the track was sent to US college and alternative radio outlets The band released a limited edition CD of Trouble the third single off Parachutes which features a remix of Yellow It was pressed to 1000 copies and was issued only to fans and journalists

The single received a massive radio airplay particularly on BBC Radio 1 This was helped by its TV reception through its music video The reaction was mostly positive Even BBC Radio 2 played the track repeatedly This heavy rotation continued for months after its release Yellow eventually became 2000s most played song on the radio The song is also regularly played at various British clubs bars and sporting events People often sing along when it is played The song is often played during home games at English Championship club Watford Yellow was used as the theme song for ABC fall television ads a month after the album was released in the United States The song was also used as the theme music for The Cancer Council Australias Daffodil Day This was in recognition of that organisations official flowers yellow hue

Critics were positive towards the song Matt Diehl of Rolling Stone magazine has noted Yellow is unrepentantly romantic He added that the band creates a hypnotic slo mo otherworld where spirit rules supreme Yellow won Best Single at the 2001 NME Carling Awards It was nominated at the 2002 Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal Billboard said that every time that electric guitar riff barges in youre hooked all over again

Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone magazine has said that the song was a career making record Roach has claimed in his book Coldplay Nobody Said It Was Easy that although Shiver earned the band their first UK Top 40 single it was Yellow that has changed everything and that it exemplifies so much of what had made Coldplay so popular In the US after it was being used in promos of ABC the band grew in popularity which continued in 2001 According to Barry Walters in his review of Coldplays second album A Rush of Blood to the Head for Spin magazine the band is still known in the United States for their surprise smash Yellow A Billboard magazine review said After one single and its accompanying album Coldplay have already been anointed heir to the Brit rock throne The song has since been regarded as the centerpiece track on the album

Following the aftermath of the September 11 attacks Yellow was the first video played on MTV once normal programming resumed

The Nepenthes often known as Tropical Pitcher Plants or Monkey Cups are a genus of carnivorous plants in the family of the Nepenthaceae consisting of about 120 species Numerous hybrids exist both natural and created by humans These plants come from South China Indonesia Malaysia and the Philippines westward to Madagascar and the Seychelles southward to Australia and New Caledonia and northward to India and Sri Lanka Many are plants from hot humid lowland areas but the majority are from high in the mountains where nights are cold Nepenthes are often categorized as being lowland or highland varieties depending on how high they live above sea level Lowland varieties usually require high temperature and humidity levels Highland varieties usually require warm days but cold and humid nights The name Nepenthes was first published in 1737 in Carolus Linnaeuss Hortus Cliffortianus

Nepenthes traps contain a fluid of the plants own production which may be watery or syrupy and is used to drown prey The trapping efficiency of this fluid remains high even when significantly diluted by water as inevitably happens in wet conditions Many species of Nepenthes produce two different forms of pitchers Near the base of the plant are the large lower traps which usually sit on the ground while the upper pitchers may be smaller coloured differently and have different shapes and features than the lower pitchers 

The lower part of the trap contains glands which take nutrients from captured insects

One of the earliest pictures of Nepenthes appears in Leonard Plukenets Almagestum Botanicum of 1696 The plant called Utricaria vegetabilis zeylanensium is without doubt a N distillatoria

The Talyllyn Railway is a narrow gauge preserved railway in Wales It runs for convert725mikm from Tywynscrefa on the Mid Wales coast to Nant Gwernol near the village of Abergynolwyn The line was opened in 1866 to carry slate from the quarries at Bryn Eglwys to Tywyn It was the first narrow gauge railway in Britain authorised by Act of Parliament to carry passengers using steam haulage Despite severe under investment the line remained open and in 1951 it became the first railway in the world to be preserved as a heritage railway by volunteers 

Since preservation the railway has operated as a tourist attraction It has increased the amount of rolling stock it has It has done this by buying and building new locomotives and carriages In 1976 an extension was opened along the former mineral line from Abergynolwyn to the new station at Nant Gwernol In 2001 the preservation society celebrated its 50th anniversary In 2005 a major rebuilding and extension of Tywyn Wharf station took place This included a much expanded facility for the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum

The fictional Skarloey Railway was based on the Talyllyn Railway This fictional railway formed part of the Railway Series of childrens books by The Rev W Awdry The preservation of the line inspired the Ealing Comedy film The Titfield Thunderbolt

The origin of the railways name is uncertain It could refer to the parish of Talyllyn which contains its eastern terminus Or it could come from Tal y llynscrefb Tal y llyn is a large glacial ribbon lake at the foot of Cadair Idris convert3mikm further east The convert2ft3inmmadjonsigfig3 gauge of the track is unusual It was shared by only three other public railways in the United Kingdom the nearby Corris Railway and the subsequent Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway and Campbeltown and Machrihanish Light Railway

Slate quarrying began in the hills above Tywyn in the 1830s Although many small quarries and test levels were established only one major quarry was developed in the region It was at Bryn Eglwys convert7mikm north east of the town Underground working began in the early 1840s By 1847 the quarry was being worked by local landowner John Pughe The finished slates were sent by packhorse to the wharf at Pennal They were then transferred to boats for a river trip to Aberdyfi Finally they were loaded into seagoing vessels This was a complex and expensive transportation arrangement which limited the quarrys output In 1861 the outbreak of the American Civil War cut off supplies of cotton to the mills of the north west of England As a result a number of prosperous mill owners looked for new business opportunities to diversify their interests One such owner was William McConnel of Lancashire In 1859 he purchased a house near Dolgellau north of Tywyn In January 1864 McConnel formed the Aberdovey Slate Company The company leased the land including Bryn Eglwys from the landowner Lewis Morris of Machynlleth

McConnel set about improving Bryn Eglwys to increase its output In 1865 his company earmarked money for the construction of a narrow gauge railway connecting the quarry with the port of Aberdyfi The standard gauge Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway was expanding rapidly from its base at Machynlleth however In 1863 this railway had reached Tywyn so McConnel decided to build his line from the quarry to Tywyn This was the nearest point where slate could be transferred to the standard gauge railway This was despite the lines initial isolation from the rest of the system because of difficulties in bridging the estuary of the Afon Dyfi to the south An Act of Parliament allowing the company to operate passenger trains as a public railway was given Royal Assent on 5 July 186 The company appointed James Swinton Spooner as engineer for the construction He laid out plans for a relatively straight line climbing steadily from Tywyn to the quarry and work quickly got underway By September 1866 construction had advanced to the point where the Board of Trade inspector Captain Henry Tyler could make an initial inspection and report

Tylers report led to an unusual alteration It was discovered that the loading gauge of the line was too small The internal width of the overbridges was only convert9ft1incmabbron but the railways passenger carriages were convert5ft35incmabbron wide This left less than convert2ftcmabbron clearance on either side which was less than the minimum required clearance of convert2ft6incmabbron To alleviate this problem McConnel proposed that the doors on one side of each carriage be permanently barred and the track slewed off centre beneath the bridges This would allow adequate clearance at least on the side with doors and mean that passengers could get out of the carriages if the train stopped underneath a bridge Tyler agreed to this arrangement and to this day all carriages on the Talyllyn have doors on one side only an unusual feature for a public railway This feature is however shared with the neighbouring Corris Railway though for different reasons Tyler also required that improvements be made to the railways first two steam locomotives as locomotive No 1 suffered from excessive vertical motion and No 2 was said to suffer from horizontal oscillation No 1 was returned to its manufacturer where a set of trailing wheels was added to reduce the rear overhang The springs on No 2 were adjusted and the crank pins shortened to reduce its oscillation

When the Master first appeared in January 1971 he was played by Roger Delgado who continued in the role until his death in 1973 Afterwards Peter Pratt and Geoffrey Beevers played a decayed version of the Time Lord until Anthony Ainley assumed the part in 1981 He remained until Doctor Whos cancellation in 1989 In 1996 the Master was played by Eric Roberts in the TV movie In the revived series Derek Jacobi provided the characters re introduction before handing over to John Simm who portrayed the Master in the end of the 2007 series

In The Sound of Drums a flashback shows the Master at the age of eight when as part of a Time Lord initiation ceremony he is taken before a gap in the fabric of space and time known as the Untempered Schism from which one can see into the entire Vortex The Doctor states that looking into the time vortex causes some to be inspired some to run away and others to go mad it is implied that the latter is what happened to the Master

A would be universal conqueror the Master wants to control the universe His most distinctive ability is that of hypnotising people by fixing them with an intense stare often accompanied by the phrase I am the Master and you will obey me

The Master has also been featured in spin offs of the series which are of unclear canonicity and may not take place in the same continuity The Master in these stories is nevertheless recognisably the same person

The Symphonie fantastique is a symphony written by the French composer Hector Berlioz It is one of the most famous Romantic works for orchestra The official title of the piece is Episode de la Vie dun Artiste but it is always called by its subtitle Symphonie Fantastique which means Fantasy Symphony The Fantasy refers to the story that is described by the music

The symphony lasts about 45 minutes and is divided into 5 movements Berlioz himself wrote down the story that the music describes just as Beethoven had done with his Sixth Symphony Berliozs work is about a young artist In the music the young artist is represented by a tune This tune is often heard during the symphony That is why it is called an ide fixe which means a fixed idea ie an idea that keeps coming again and again An ide fixe is what Wagner would have called a leitmotif The first performance took place at the Paris Conservatoire in December 1830 Berlioz made several changes to the music between 1831 and 1845

The symphony is played by an orchestra consisting of 2 flutes 2 oboes 2 clarinets 4 bassoons 4 French horns 2 trumpets 2 cornets 3 trombones 2 ophicleides 2 pairs of timpani snare drum cymbals bass drum bells in C and G 2 harps and strings

The symphony is an example of programme music because it describes something apart from the music In this case it describes a story This is what the composer wrote

First movement A young artist was deeply in love with a girl who did not love him He felt so desperately sad that he tried to poison himself with opium He did not take enough to kill him It just made him fall into a deep sleep In this sleep he imagined all sorts of things His beloved came to him in a dream She changes into a musical theme which he just cannot forget He imagines her love and his tender feelings for her

Second movement He meets her at a ball Everyone is dancing He finds his beloved among the crowd

Third movement In the country he hears two shepherds who call to one another on their pipes The trees sway gently in the wind The young artist starts to feel happier Then he sees his beloved again He starts to worry that she may not want him any more The shepherd music starts again but it is only one of the shepherds playing The sun sets Far away a thunderstorm is heard

The fourth movement He dreams that he has killed his beloved in a fit of anger He is now being taken to the scaffold where he will have his head chopped off A march is played as he is taken away For a moment he thinks of his beloved again then the axe falls and he is executed

The fifth movement The artist is at the Witches Sabbath There are lots of ghosts and monsters around who have come to watch him being buried His beloved is heard but her tune now sounds horrible She has come to the Sabbath She joins the witches and they dance while the funeral music is heard

The first movement has a slow introduction The tune heard on the violins is already nearly like the ide fixe The ide fixe is heard in its full form when the music goes into the fast section It is played by the violins and solo flute The rhythm that the lower string instruments play underneath is very agitated The form of the movement is not much like the traditional sonata form Berlioz was more interested in the ide fixe which keeps haunting the young artist all the way through

The ball is represented in the music by a lively waltz The two harps make it sound very graceful Twice the waltz is interrupted by the ide fixe

The two shepherds who are playing to one another are represented by a cor anglais and an oboe which is played offstage so that it sounds distant Then the main gentle countryside theme is heard on solo flute and violins The ide fixe returns in the middle of the movement The sound of distant thunder at the end of the movement is played by four timpani

The movement starts with timpani rumbling and horns starting up the march theme Then the cellos and double basses start the march in its full form soon taken over by the violins Just before he is executed there is a short repetition of the ide fixe on a solo clarinet then the axe falls and his head falls into the basket

The ide fixe has now become a vulgar dance tune it is played on the E flat clarinet There are lots of effects including ghostly col legno playing in the strings the bubbling of the witches cauldron played by the wind instruments As the dance reaches a climax we hear the Dies Irae melody together with the Ronde du Sabbat which is a wild fugue

The Clean Tech Revolution The Next Big Growth and Investment Opportunity is a 2007 book by Ron Pernick and Clint Wilder They say that using clean technologies is a profitable enterprise that is moving steadily into mainstream business Clean technologies are seen to be important for economic growth 

Pernick and Wilder highlight eight major clean technology areas solar power wind power biofuels green buildings personal transportation the smart grid mobile applications and water filtration Very large corporations such as GE Toyota and Sharp and investment firms such as Goldman Sachs are spending billions of dollars on clean technology

Pernick and Wilder say that in the 1970s clean technology was considered alternative Even at the start of the 21st century the term clean tech was not yet widely used But now throughout much of the world in trends large and small there is the beginning of a revolution that is changing the places where we live and work the products we manufacture and purchase and the development plans of cities regional governments and nations around the globe

Pernick and Wilder highlight eight major clean technology sectors solar power wind power biofuels green buildings personal transportation the smart grid mobile applications and water filtration The authors explain how investors entrepreneurs and individuals can profit from technological innovation in these areas Pernick and Wilder identify some specific clean technologies companies and regions that are leading the way   

The book also explains that nuclear power and clean coal are not clean technologies Apart from the risks associated with nuclear power multibillion dollar nuclear plants are simply not cost effective when compared with other energy sources The authors also believe that clean coal is an oxymoron for a myriad of reasons including the sheer number of coal mine related deaths and the fact that coal fired plants even some cleaner ones are major contributors to serious illnesses such as asthma heart disease and mercury poisoning

Emerging clean tech cities are seen to include Copenhagen where wind power generates 20 percent of Denmarks electricity and Chicago a leader in green buildings saving energy heating and cooling costs

Pernick and Wilder identify six major forces which they call the six Cs that are pushing clean technology into the mainstream and driving rapid growth and expansion costs capital competition China consumers and climate

Songbirds are the main group of birds in the order Passeriformes They are the suborder Passeri sometimes called oscines 

There are about 4000 species of songbird Their syrinx is able to produce varied and beautiful singing They are a very successful group of birds in fact they are the dominant birds on Earth today

A passerine is a bird of the order Passeriformes which includes more than half of all bird species They are songbirds which can perch

Passerines are sometimes known as songbirds Most of them are small in size They can sing very well All passerines have four toes on each foot Three of the toes point forwards The other toe points backwards This means that passerines can easily hold onto trees or rocks Because of this they are also known as perching birds All passerines have 12 tail feathers Also all passerine chicks are born blind and bald when they hatch from the egg

Evidence on their evolution comes from comparative anatomy the fossil record and molecular biology It is thought that the first passerines evolved in the southern continent of Gondwana in the Paleogene maybe around the Upper Paleocene some 6055 mya

The early fossil record is poor because the first Passeriformes were on the small side and their delicate bones did not preserve well Two specimens from Queensland Australia are fossil bone fragments clearly recognizable as passeriform They are two species of about 10 and 20 cm in overall length This proves that some 55 mya barely into the early Eocene early perching birds were recognizably distinct It also suggests that the origin of this great order of birds was in the southern continent

There are three sub orders Acanthisitti Tyranni and Passeri There are only two bird species in the sub order Acanthisitti They are known as New Zealand wrens The sub order Tyranni are also known as the suboscines Many of these birds are found in tropical areas The sub order Passeri has the most bird species They are also known as the oscines They have the best songs of all birds

Suboscines

The Superb Lyrebird is a pheasant sized songbird approximately 100cm long with brown upper body plumage grayish brown below rounded wings and strong legs It is the longest and third heaviest of all songbirds

A Lyrebird is one of two species of ground dwelling Australian birds most notable for their superb ability to mimic natural and artificial sounds from their environment They are called lyrebirds because their tail feathers form the shape of a lyre a Greek musical instrument when they are lifted up

The Alberts Lyrebird is a pheasant sized songbird about 90 cm long with brown upper body feathers and rich chestnut below It is very similar with the Superb Lyrebird in its habits This bird also mimics other species sounds It is sometimes called the Prince Albert Lyrebird or the Northern Lyrebird Named after Queen Victorias husband Prince Albert they are smaller than the Superb Lyrebirds

Alberts Lyrebirds are only found in a small area of rainforest in the Lamington National Park near the border of Queensland and New South Wales There are about 3500 birds known to exist There are reports of the birds in the Blackall Range but this has not been proved Known groups of birds live on Tamborine Mountain Scenic Rim and the Nightcap Range

They eat small insects which they scratch up from the ground They are a shy bird which will run or fly away if disturbed During the breeding season in winter from May to August the male bird performs displays of song and dance to attract the females The songs are copied from other birds and forest sounds The songs can last up to four hours with some individual songs lasting up to one hour During his dance the male bird raises his tail feathers up and over his body The feathers form a lyre shape which is why they were given the name lyrebird

It is listed as a Vulnerable species because it lives in such a limited area it can only eat a small range of food from that area and it is not breeding quickly

The British Rail Class 142 is a class of Pacer diesel multiple units used in the United Kingdom 96 units were built by BREL in Derby between 1985 and 1987 They were a development of the earlier Class 141 which were introduced in 1984

Functional illiteracy means that a person is not able to read write and do math well in regular life Someone who is fully illiterate can not read write or do math at all Such people have perhaps never learnt how to read or write perhaps they did not need to A person who is functionally illiterate is different  at some point in their lives these people were taught reading and writing skills For different reasons adults who are functionally illiterate try to avoid writing and reading as much as possible That way a person who is functionally illiterate may be able to write their name but it is very difficult for them to write more than a few sentences 

These people have trouble functioning in modern society when they are confronted with printed materials they cannot perform simple tasks such as filling out a form understanding a contract following written instructions reading a newspaper article traffic signs consulting a dictionary or understanding a bus schedule 

Because of functional illiteracy these people also have a lot of trouble using modern communication technologies such as a personal computer or a mobile phone

The people who are functionally illiterate often have other problems as well Other people may intimidate them they may have higher health risks and stress Because they cannot get good jobs they often earn little money 

Crime researchers and sociologists have talked about the link between functional illiteracy and crime

Business magazine estimates that 15 million functionally illiterate adults had a job in the United States at the start of the 21st century The American Council of Life Insurers reported that 75 of the Fortune 500 companies provide some level of training to help their workers overcome this situation All over the US 30 million  14 of adults  are unable to perform simple and everyday literacy activities The National Center for Education Statistics has more detail

This report sees three parameters prose document and quantitative literacy There are four levels for each parameter below basic basic intermediate and proficient For prose literacy for example a below basic level of literacy means that a person can look at a short piece of text to get a small piece of uncomplicated information Similarly a person who is below basic in quantitative literacy might be able to add two numbers 

In the US 14 of adults are at the below basic level for prose literacy 12 are at the below basic level for document literacy and 22 are at that level for quantitative literacy Only 13 of the population is proficient in these three areas In the terms of the study proficient means these people are able to compare viewpoints in two editorials They can interpret a table about blood pressure age and physical activity They can also compute and compare the cost per ounce of food items 

In the UK according to the Daily Telegraph one in six British adults lacks the literacy skills of an 11 year old The UK governments Department for Education reported in 2006 that 47 percent of school children left school at age 16 without having achieved a basic level in functional maths and 42 percent fail to achieve a basic level of functional English Every year 100000 pupils leave school functionally illiterate in the UK

A Literacy at Work study published by the Northeast Institute in 2001 found that business losses attributed to basic skill deficiencies run into billions of dollars a year due to low productivity errors and accidents attributed to functional illiteracy

Sociological research has demonstrated that countries with lower levels of functional illiteracy among their adult populations tend to be those with the highest levels of scientific literacy among the lower stratum of young people nearing the end of their formal academic studies This correspondence suggests that a contributing factor to a societys level of civic literacy is the capacity of schools to ensure students attain the functional literacy required to comprehend the basic texts and documents associated with competent citizenship

The British Rail Class 143 is a diesel multiple unit part of the Pacer family of trains introduced between 1985 1986 They originally worked around North East England but were later transferred to Wales The coaches are based on an Alexander bus body mounted on a chassis from a freight or Goods truckFactdateAugust 2008 Twenty five units were built numbered 143001 025 but later re numbered 143601  143625 

The British Rail Class 144 Pacer diesel multiple units were built by BREL Derby from 1986 1987 A total of 23 units were built replacing many of the earlier First generation Heritage DMUs

The British Rail Class 150 Sprinter diesel multiple units were built by BREL from 1984 87 A total of 137 units were built in three main subclasses replacing many of the earlier first generation Heritage DMUs

The British Rail Class 151 was a prototype class of DMU built by Metro Cammell in the mid 1980s

The British Rail Class 153 Sprinter is a single car diesel multiple unit train

In the early 1990s British Rail took the decision that running 2 car trains on rural routes was inefficient and identified the need for single carriage trains Initially consideration was given to splitting the Met Cam Class 156 units to form class 152 units however due to various problems with the Class 155 units the decision was taken to split these units instead

Work was undertaken by Hunslett Barclay in Kilmarnock between 1991 and 1992 The modifications included fitting a cramped cab to the B end of each carriage making it extremely difficult to load a bicycle

The British Rail Class 155 Super Sprinter is a diesel multiple unit These DMUs were built by British Leyland at Workington between 1987 and 1988 as part of British Rails replacement of its ageing diesel fleet which were First Generation 

The British Rail Class 156 Super Sprinter is a diesel multiple unit A hundred and fourteen of these units were built from 1987 to 1989 by Metro Cammell at their Washwood Heath Works in Birmingham They were built to replace elderly First Generation Heritage DMUs and locomotive hauled passenger trains

Class 157 was the designation applied to a range of Diesel multiple unit trains of the Sprinter family planned for regional use in particular for the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive As well as the class number British Rail reserved carriage numbers in the 526xx and 576xx series for these units

As the Privatisation of British Rail began this project became unviable as resources were concentrated on the privatisation process leading to the famous 1064 day drought of new train orders By the time this period was over plans had moved on and Stratchclyde ended up receiving a batch of Class 170 units

British Rail Class 158 Express Sprinter is a type of diesel multiple unit train They were built for British Rail between 1989 and 1992 by BREL at their Derby Works They were built to replace old DMUs and locomotive hauled passenger trains Class 159 trains are almost the same as Class 158s

The British Rail Class 159 known as South Western Turbo by Network SouthEast is a diesel multiple unit built from 1989 93 by BREL at Derby Works 

The British Rail Class 165 Network Turbo diesel multiple units were built by BREL at York Works from 19901992 These units are suburban trains with an express version appearing later in the form of the Class 166 Network Express Turbo units The Class 165 belongs to the Turbo and the Networker families of trains

The British Rail Class 166 Network Express Turbo diesel multiple units were built by ABB at York Works from 1992 93 These units are the express version of the Class 165 Network Turbo units They have a top speed of 90mph are carpeted throughout and have air conditioning 

The Class 168 Clubman is a diesel multiple unit train used by Chiltern Railways for InterCity services between London and the Midlands They were built in several batches from 1997 onwards The first batch of units was classified 1680 under TOPS and bore a large resemblance both visually and in terms of electrical design to the Class 165 units previously built by BREL at York This is because they were based on plans originally drawn up by Network SouthEast and thus can be considered to be Networker Turbos Subsequent builds classified 1681 and 1682 were given the newer style cab and a new design of wiring and thus are part of the Turbostar family of trains 

The Class 170 Turbostar is a diesel multiple unit built by Bombardier Transportation at their Derby Litchurch Lane Works England This has become the most popular type of DMU built since the privatisation of Britains railways with 122 units built 

The Class 171 Turbostar is a type of DMU operated by Southern The Class 171 is identical to the Class 170 except for the replacement of the BSI coupler with a Dellner coupler This provision was made in order to allow emergency joining with Class 377 DC third rail electric units

The Class 172 is a planned diesel multiple unit of the Turbostar family similar to the Class 168 Class 170 and Class 171

The Class 175 Coradia is a model of diesel multiple unit passenger train used in the United Kingdom They were built from 19992001 by Alstom at Washwood Heath in Birmingham The fleet is currently based at Chester Depot The fleet is used in North Wales on services from Holyhead South Wales normally going south or up to the North Wales Coast Many also operate round the Manchester area

The Class 180 Adelante is a type of British diesel multiple unit built by Alstom between 2000 and 2001 at Washwood Heath in Birmingham The units are express trains originally built for First North Western but then the contract was passed over to First Great Western to supplement their High Speed Train fleet However due to reliability and operating problems the decision was made to withdraw most of the fleet from service The majority of the units have already been returned to the Leasing Company with the remainder of the fleet to follow in due course First Great Western announced in November 2010 that the Class 180s would be returning to their fleet in Spring 2012 for use on the Cotswold Line

The Class 185 is a diesel multiple unit passenger train built by Siemens in Germany for the British train operating company First TransPennine Express

The British Rail Class 303 is a type of electric multiple unit They are also known as Blue Train units They were introduced in 1960 for the electrification of the North Clyde and the Cathcart Circle lines in Strathclyde At first they were classified as AM3 units before the introduction of the TOPS classification system They were the dominant EMU on the Glasgow suburban railway network for over 25 years The final units were withdrawn from service in 2002

The British Rail Class 304 is a type of electric multiple unit They were built for suburban use on the first phases of the West Coast Main Line electrification between Crewe and ManchesterLiverpoolRugby They were at first classed as AM4 units and later became Class 304 under the TOPS numbering system They could be found in operation over most of the southern West Coast Main Line The units conformed to the 1959 design for alternating current electrical multiple units and were externally very similar to the Class 305 Class 308 and the 1200 V direct current class Class 504 units No units survived preservation and all units were eventually scrapped

The British Rail Class 305 was an alternating current electric multiple unit Under the pre 1973 British Rail numbering system the class was known as AM5 When TOPS as introduced the class became Class 305

The British Rail Class 306 was a type of electric multiple unit introduced in 1949 It consisted of 92 three car trains which were used on newly electrified suburban lines between Shenfield and London Liverpool Street

The British Rail Class 307 electric multiple units were built by BR at Eastleigh Works from 1954 1956 They were initially classified as AM7 before the introduction of TOPS

The British Rail Class 309 Clacton Express electric multiple units were built by British Rail York Works from 1962 1963 They were initially classified as Class AM9 before the introduction of TOPS These units were the first express 25 kV alternating current units to be built by British Rail and British Rails first EMUs to be capable of 100 mph

The British Rail Class 308 alternating current electric multiple units were built by BR at York in three batches from 196162 They were initially classified as AM8 units before the introduction of TOPS

The British Rail Class 310 is a slam door alternating current electric multiple unit introduced in 1966 as part of the West Coast Main Line electrification project They were initially classified as Class AM10 units before the introduction on the TOPS classification system Constructed at BRs Derby Carriage and Wagon Works They consisted of four carriages  a second class driving trailer a second class trailer a second class motor car and a composite driving trailer The maximum speed was 75 miles per hour A glass partition behind the drivers cab enabled passengers in the leading and rear coaches to have an excellent view of the line ahead or behind

The British Rail Class 312 is a type of alternating current electric multiple unit built in 1966 1974 intended for use on outer suburban passenger services It was the last class of multiple unit to be constructed to the British Rail Mark 2 bodyshell and also the last with slam doors This latter feature contributed to their relatively early withdrawal Ironically the examples withdrawn by First Great Eastern and later one Great Eastern between 2003 and 2004 were slightly newer than most of the carriages the operator is introducing during 2005 for use on its premier express service

British Rail Class 314 alternating current electric multiple units were built by BREL at York works from 1978 to 1979 They were the second variety of British Rails then standard 1972 design for suburban EMUs which eventually encompassed 755 vehicles and five Classes Able to operate from 25 kV overhead line current collection only the fleet works outer suburban services on the Strathclyde Passenger Transport rail network in Central Scotland

British Rail Class 315 alternating current electric multiple units were built by BREL at York works from 1980 to 1981 They were the fifth and final variety of British Rails then standard 1972 design for suburban EMUs which eventually encompassed 755 vehicles and five Classes Like the Glasgow based Class 314 units they are only able to operate from 25 kV overhead line current collection The fleet works inner suburban services on the Great Eastern Main Line run by the train operating company National Express East Anglia out of London Liverpool Street Class 315s also work services from Liverpool Street to Chingford Enfield Town Hertford East and Cheshunt 

In the Monday to Friday timetable there are 3 booked workings of 315s outside of the normal area These are the 0629 Southend Victoria to London Liverpool Street the 0720 Southend Victoria to London Liverpool Street and the 1749 London Liverpool Street to Southend Victoria 

It is expected that the class 315s operating on the Great Eastern Main Line will be required to work until 2018 when Crossrail is expected to take over and the oldest units will be 40 years old At this time it is unclear whether units operating West Anglia routes will be withdrawn and scrapped before 2018 or simply cascaded on to the Great Eastern Main Line

Class 316 and Class 457 were two suggested TOPS classifications They were given to a single electric multiple unit at different stages of its use as a prototype for the Networker series

The British Rail Class 317 electric multiple units were built by BREL at York Works in two batches from 1981 82 and 1985 87 They were the first of several classes of British Rail EMU to be based on the all steel Mark 3 bodyshell departing from the PEP aluminium design which had spawned the earlier Class 313 to Class 315 The Mark 3 bodyshell was also the basis of Class 318 Class 455 and the diesel sprinters pioneered by the Class 150

Nehebkau guarded the entrance to Duat the Egyptian underworld He was made up of Ka and Ba the two parts of the soul he is pictured as a snake with two heads Atum was said to have to keep his finger on Nehebkau to keep him from being out of control Since he was a snake he was believed to heal those bitten by snakes andor scorpions

The British Rail Class 318 is an electric multiple unit train which operates exclusively in the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport network in West Central Scotland The units were introduced fully on 29 September 1986 as part of the electrification of the Ayrshire Coast Line between Glasgow Central and AyrArdrossan with alternating current overhead lines Usage was extended to Largs in January 1987 They were also used on the Inverclyde Line in small numbers and on rare occasions the Cathcart Circle Lines

Ka is one of the five parts of the Egyptian idea of the soul The Ka was the life force and left the body during death Ka was believed to be in food and drink and was placed with the dead for offerings The Egyptians believed that at death the Ba and the Ka join together through Nehebkau before entering Duat

The British Rail Class 319 dual voltage electric multiple units were built by BREL York in two batches from 198788 and 1990 The trains were introduced for new north south cross London services from Bedford to Brighton and since privatisation these services have been operated by Thameslink and First Capital Connect the former franchise having been merged with the Great Northern section of the former WAGN franchise to form the latter train operating company at 0200 BST on 1 April 2006 as a result of re franchising Class 319 units have dual power pick up from either 25 kV alternating current overhead lines for services north of London or 750 V direct current third rail to the south However some units were only used on outer suburban services in South London The Class 325 postal units were based on the Class 319 units with the same traction equipment and body design but are fitted with cabs of the same design as the newer Class 365 and Class 465 Networker units

The British Rail Class 320 is an alternating current electric multiple unit train found on the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport rail network in Central Scotland and is used exclusively on the North Clyde Line between Helensburgh and Airdrie North Lanarkshire via Glasgow Queen Street railway station

What with the introduction of the class 380 dsiros for the Inverclyde line the class 334s will be put to service on the Airdrie to Bathgate route the class 320s will be split between the cathcart circle lines and the Argyll line 14 of the 1990 built EMUs will be put to work on the Glasgow  Newton Neilston and Cathcart Circle lines while the remaining units shall work alongside the class 318s on the North ClydeArgyll lines This can not happen without the class 320s bogies being upgraded currently they have a 75 mph top speed in November 2010 the class will be driven under their own power to WABTEC Doncaster by GBRF drivers where they will be given a full refurbishment scheme which shall include new seats toilets fitted painting into the new scotrail saltire livery and their top speed raised to 90 mph

Ba is one of the five parts of the spirit in Egyptian mythology Ba is considered to be the soul Ba is believed to have a unique personality based on the person who has it The Ba was pictured as a bird that flew from the body to join with the Ka at death A Ba was said to return to the sarcophagus if it was properly stored In some stories Bas sometimes act as guardians in the underworld

The British Rail Class 321 alternating current electric multiple units were built by BREL York in three batches from 1986 1989 The design was very successful and led to the development of the similar Class 320 and Class 322 units for use by Strathclyde PTE and Stansted Express respectively The bodyshell design was also used for construction of the Class 456 direct current units The Class 321s were nicknamed Dusty Bins due to the class number sharing the same name as the game show 3 2 1

Class 321s were originally built for the Bedford services However in 1990 they started being used on Great Eastern Main Line services to Southend Victoria Braintree and Clacton to replace the class 302 and 305 EMUs many of which were approaching 50 years old Some 321s were sent to work inter regional services for Silverlink and then briefly for London Midland primarily on Euston to NorthamptonMilton KeynesBirmingham services

London Midland have now stopped using class 321s on the majority of their services however a 321 can occasionally be seen working the St Albans Abbey service from Watford Junction but now days it is more likely to be a class 313 EMU built originally for the Moorgate Suburban Electrification 

On the Great Eastern Main Line class 321s primarily work services to Southend Victoria Southminster and Braintree From time to time they can also be found working the Romford to Upminster and Clacton services However this is rare and class 315s and 360s respectively are the main rolling stock used for these 2 services

High speed rail is a type of passenger rail transport that operates significantly faster than the normal speed of rail traffic Specific definitions include 200 kmh and faster depending on whether the track is upgraded or new by the European Union and above 90 mph by the United States Federal Railroad Administration but there is no single standard and lower speeds can be required by local constraints

The InterCity 125 was the brand name of British Rails High Speed Train fleet The InterCity 125 train is made up of two locomotives one at each end of a fixed formation of carriages and is capable of 125 mph in regular service British Rail initially used the fleet on the Great Western Main Line on the East Coast Main Line on the Cross Country Route and latterly on the Midland Main Line serving destinations such as London Bristol Edinburgh as far south as Penzance and as far north as Aberdeen and Inverness The InterCity 125 took the world record for the fastest diesel powered train when it was recorded at an absolute maximum speed of convert148mphkmhabbron during 1987

The 1970s proved to be a pivotal period for the anti nuclear movement in California There was confrontation between nuclear power advocates and environmentalists In 1981 1900 activists were arrested during protests at Diablo Canyon Power Plant In 1984 the Davis City Council declared the city to be a nuclear free zone California has banned the approval of new nuclear reactors since the late 1970s because of concerns over waste disposal 

The start of the anti nuclear movement in California was the controversy over Pacific Gas Electrics attempt to build the nations first nuclear power plant in Bodega Bay This conflict began in 1958 and ended in 1964 with the forced abandonment of these plans Subsequent plans to build a nuclear power plant in Malibu were also abandoned

The anti nuclear movement grew in California between 1964 and 1974 It was during this period that some scientists and engineers began supporting the positions of the activists They were influenced by the non material philosophy that had inspired activists and had impacted the public consciousness While Californian voters failed to pass a 1972 proposal placing a 5 year moratorium on nuclear plant construction anti nuclear groups campaigned to stop construction of several proposed plants in the seventies especially those located on the coast and near fault lines These proposals included the Sundesert Nuclear Power Plant which was never built

Over a two week period in 1981 1900 activists were arrested at Diablo Canyon Power Plant It was the largest arrest in the history of the US anti nuclear movement

In this period there were controversies within the Sierra Club about how to lead the anti nuclear movement and this led to a split over the Diablo Canyon plant which ended in success for the utilities The split led to the formation of Friends of the Earth led by David Brower

In 1979 Abalone Alliance members held a 38 day sit in in the Californian Governor Jerry Browns office to protest continued operation of Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station which was a duplicate of the Three Mile Island facility In 1989 Sacremento voters voted to shut down the Rancho Seco power plant

California has banned the approval of new nuclear reactors since the late 1970s because of concerns over waste disposal

On November 14th 1984 the Davis California City Council declared the city to be a nuclear free zone Another well known nuclear free community is Berkeley California whose citizens passed the Nuclear Free Berkeley Act in 1986 which allows the city to levy fines for nuclear weapons related activity and to boycott companies involved in the United States nuclear infrastructure

The British Rail Class 322 electric multiple units were built by BREL between 1988 90 Five 4 car units were built for the dedicated Stansted Express service from London Liverpool Street to Stansted Airport The units are now operated by First ScotRail between Edinburgh Waverley and North Berwick

Major General Lachlan Macquarie CB was a British military officer who was the fifth Governor of New South Wales from 1810 to 1821 He had a leading role in the social economic and architectural development of Australia Historians say he led the change of New South Wales from a penal colony to a free settlement This was very important in making the future of Australian society 

Macquarie was born on the island of Ulva in the Inner Hebrides Scotland His father had a small farm at Oskamull on Mull Macquaries brother Donald died as a prisoner of war during the American Revolution Macquarie joined the army the Royal Highland Emigrants He was sent to Nova Scotia in 1776 and later served at New York and Charleston In 1781 he became a Lieutenant and went to Jamaica for three years He returned to Scotland and after a number of years on half pay joined the 77th Regiment and went to India

When Macquarie became governor in 1810 the clashes between the settlers and Aboriginal people increased Governor Macquarie believed that the best way to treat Aboriginal people was to civilise them That meant replacing the traditional Aboriginal way of life with European ways 

Macquarie tried to send Aboriginal children to school but many left or returned to their tribes after a short time Macquarie tried to create a settlement for Aboriginal people by teaching them farming and building techniques His attempts failed because Aboriginal people did not want to become farmers After all his failures Macquarie then made laws to place Aboriginal people under British control Under these laws it was permitted to shoot Aboriginal people if they resisted

Macquarie was promoted a number of times which helped him pay off his debts In 1793 he married Jane Jarvis the daughter of the former Chief Justice of Antigua who was living in Bombay In 1795 Macquarie was fighting the Dutch on Ceylon In 1796 he became governor but rushed back to his wife who was ill She died from tuberculosis at Macao in China on 15 July 1796 He brought her body back to India and she was buried was buried in the Bombay cemetery on 16 January 1797 He stayed in the army and saw action at the battle of Seringapatam In 1800 he became the military secretary to the Governor of Bombay In 1801 Macquarie went to Egypt to fight the French Later after the French were defeated he became deputy adjutant general in charge of the remaining British forces He went back to Bombay in 1802 but had to return to Scotland to sort out his business affairs

Macquarie had become quite rich during his time in India as was able to buy 10000 acres on Mull During his stay in England he was made the assistant adjutant general of London when war started again with the French While in Scotland in 1804 he met Elizabeth Campbell who would later become his second wife He went back to Bombay for several years and went back to Britain again in 1807 to join the 73rd Regiment He married Elizabeth in Devon before going to Perth The 73rd Regiment was going to be posted to Australia to replace the New South Wales Corps and Macquarie was told he would be the new Governor of New South Wales He was to take over from William Bligh who had been removed from power during the Rum Rebellion He arrived in December 1809 and took up his new job as governor on 1 January 1810

Governor He was ordered to arrest John Macarthur and George Johnston who were the leaders of the Rum Rebellion but they had already sailed to England before he got to Australia There was a large increase in the number of convicts sent to Australia while Macquaire was governor He used the extra convicts to build roads building and towns He gave tickets of leave to well behaved convicts This caused him problems with the free settlers people who had not been convicts They thought they should have special rights and that the convicts should not be seen as their equals They made many complaints about Macquaries government back to their friends in England

Macquarie resigned at the end of 1821 because of poor health and the difficulty of the job He served longer than any other governor When he left 265 major works had been completed including new army barracks three convict barracks roads to Parramatta a road across the Blue Mountains stables a hospital and five towns along the Hawkesbury River which were out of reach of floodwaters

In 1822 and 1823 Macquarie took his family on a tour of France Italy and Switzerland In 1824 he went back to house on Mull In April 1824 while in London he died from a bladder and kidney infection His body was sent back to Mull for burial His grave is now looked after by the National Trust of Australia

The Cybermen are a fictional race of cyborgs in the British television series Doctor Who They are one of the greatest and longest enemies of the Doctor Cybermen were originally humanoids from the Earths twin planet Mondas The people of Mondas began to put more and more artificial metal parts into their bodies to keep themselves alive making them cyborgs This led to the race starting to think logically and calculating showing no emotions The Cybermen also turning other people into cyborgs

They were created by Dr Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis in 1966 first appearing in the serial The Tenth Planet which was the last to feature William Hartnell as the First Doctor They have since been in the show a lot

A parallel universe version of the Cybermen appeared in the 2006 series in the two part story Rise of the Cybermen and The Age of Steel They also appear in Army Of Ghosts and Doomsday They also appeared in the spin off series Torchwood in the episode Cyberwoman They would later return to the new series in the 2008 Christmas Special The Next Doctor introducing two new types of cyberman the Cyber Shades and the Cyber King 

While the Doctors other old enemies the Daleks did not change during the original seriess twenty six season run the Cybermen were seen to change with almost every appearance The Cybermen are humanoid but have replaced their limbs and other body parts with non living parts to the point where they dont have many flesh parts In their first appearance in the series the only portions of their bodies that still seemed human were their hands but by their next appearance in The Moonbase their bodies were entirely covered up in their metal suits with their hands replaced by two finger claws but changed back to regular five finger hands in The Invasion As there are not many of them the Cybermen often convert humans to cybermen

It is assumed that there are still human parts beneath their suits meaning they are actually cyborgs not robots in The Tenth Planet a Cyberman tells a group of humans that our brains are just like yours although by the time of Attack of the Cybermen their brains seem to have been replaced with electronics In Earthshock the actors chins were vaguely visible through a clear perspex area on the helmet to suggest some kind of human face In The Tomb of the Cybermen veins were visible through the circular head of the Cyberman Controller and in Attack of the Cybermen and The Age of Steel the Cyber Controllers brain is visible through the dome The first is a Mondas Cyber Controller while the second is an alternative cyberman However in Revenge of the Cybermen the Doctor says they are total machine creatures

Although the Cybermen often claim that they have done away with human emotion they have exhibited emotions ranging from anger to smug satisfaction in their confrontations with the Doctor Some Cybermen in the early stories were even given individual names such as Krang Some parallel Earth Cybermen did retain some memories of their pre conversion lives although their emotional response varied

This motive behind the removal of emotions is made more clear in The Age of Steel where it is done by putting in things that stuff them from feeling emotions In that episode the deactivation of their emotional inhibitors drives the converted Cybermen insane when they realise what they have become killing them This motive may also be applicable to Mondas Cybermen given their forcible conversion of other lifeforms to Cybermen to maintain their numbers despite the fact the Mondasians appear to have originally willingly converted themselves as a survival mechanism

Cybermen have a number of weaknesses over the years Their biggest weakness is gold It was not mentioned that they did not like gold until their attempt to destroy the planetoid Voga in Revenge of the Cybermen Initially it was explained that because it is very hard to grind up gold chokes their respiratory systems For example the However in later serials gold appeared to affect them rather like silver affects werewolves with gold coins or bullets with gold on the edge fired at them having the same effect The revived series Cybermen have no weakness to gold

Nearly all the cyberman costumes were silver in colour and included items and material such as cloth rubber diving suits PVC chest units tubing practice golf balls cricketers gloves and silver painted Doc Martens boots A BBC Cyberman costume from the black white era of TV has recently been discovered

The 1980s design used converted flight suits painted silver Unlike the Doctors other enemies the Cybermen have changed a lot in appearance over the years looking more and more modern although retaining certain commonalities of design the most iconic being the handle bars attached to Cybermen heads that were supposed to aid with their hearing their round eyeholes and their chest units Completely black coloured Cybermen were seen briefly in Attack of the Cybermen

The Cybermen returned in episodes 5 and 6 of the 2006 season of the new series in a two part story set on an alternate Earth The new Cybermen were designed by production designer Edward Thomass team and Neill Gorton at Millennium FX The new Cyberman design is tall in a style reminiscent of Art Deco with their Cybus Corporation logo on their chests and made to look like burnished steel instead of silver The other big changes in the Cyberman design is that the Cyber Controller had glowing eyes a transparent forehead revealing the brain and sockets on its chest plate providing connectors to other systems

Early Cybermen had an unsettling sing song voice created by changing their voices slightly on syllables which a voice does not normally change Their mouths opened fully and did not move when they were talking then their mouths would shut as soon as they stopped talking However they stopped doing this after their first few appearances

The voices for the 2006 return of the Cybermen were provided by Nicholas Briggs Shown in the season 2 DVD special feature Confidential Cut Downs the voice was created by processing Briggs voice through a voice modulator The new Cybermen have a blue light in their mouths which blinks in synchronisation with their speech

The Cybermen also use smaller cybernetic creatures called cybermats to attack In their first appearance in The Tomb of the Cybermen they resembled big metal fish and had segmented bodies with hair sensor probes along the base of their heads which were topped with eyes The Second Doctor described them as a form of metallic life

The second model of cybermat seen in The Wheel in Space was used for sabotage able to listen to human brainwaves They were carried to the Wheel in small sacs that sank through the walls of the space station causing drops in air pressure

The third model seen in Revenge of the Cybermen was a much larger snake like cybermat that could be remotely controlled and could inject poison into its victims

Cybermats appear in Blood of the Cybermen They look like flat snakes and can turn living things into Cyber Slaves with their poison They are remote controlled and are of the new 3rd race of cybermen They are Cyber Cats and Dogs

On the BBC website the Cybus Cybermen appear in two online games Cyber Assault and Save Paris both depicting the war between the Cybermen and Preachers on the parallel Earth The Adventure Games has an episode Blood of the Cybermen which feature a 3rd new race of Cybermen

Id like to propose moving Simple News from where it currently resides to greylinkWikipediaSimple News This move would have to take place after the second issue has come out in a few days and the page would contain both archives for old issues rules that articles should adhere to and possibly a template for Simple News itself

The contributors have shown that they are committed to the project and I think that it would attract attention and perhaps make the project seem more official if it were in the Wikipedia space What do you lot think  Gwib  1123 13 December 2008

Hello all

Im here to propose that the Nations Cup of the Wikicup be shut down Its causing way too much dramaz and is actually detracting from the whole point of the cup People are more worried about who they are going to be on a team with rather than actually getting on with preparing and editing The countries saga is just ridiculous as well

I also dont see how having a team cup will help at all except making more work for myself and Gwib

Thanks

Tell you what BG Ill run it myself Ill only have to add the points It wont be that hard just dont worry about it Yotcmdr Sign up for the wikicup talk 2105 14 December 2008

reset Yes Of course Nothing is wrong with how thats happening I only have an issue with the Nations Cup  perhaps next year ill draw up a detailed proposal So can I officially close Nations BG7even 1926 15 December 2008

Well Nations Cup and WikiCup are two projects all at the same time So we could have Nations Cup odd number years and WikiCup even numbered ones  S3CR3T 1937 15 December 2008

Hey all

I hope that this can be the last time we bring this here as I think it can solve all remaining issues

It relates to the update process

What I suggest is

If any editor has a discrepancy with any hook they can remove it from the next update page as long as the discussion is re added

Thanks

BG7even 0050 15 December 2008

Its fine I suppose For now Once we have more editors involved Id like it better if 2 or more were placed before removing Also Id love to get a bot in there to do the clerking one day Synergy 1024 15 December 2008

Id like to first create the stub category and second transclude the category to the template so all stubs will fall into one category Id like to do this so I can find stubs easier Any objections Id like to start fixing and adding info to a number of stub pages and this seems the most sensible idea Synergy 2127 22 December 2008

Id like to also say that once this is done the Simple Stub Project will begin Anyone is able to join and well be judging the need for any new stub types depending on how many articles we have for that specific subject Synergy 0220 23 December 2008

Can someone please allow non registered users to completely remove the Donate Now banner which is virtually pushing one coercing them to fill Jimbos pockets Can you at lease give the anonymous users the opportunity to get a break from this annoying crap without having to create an account Forcefeeding them an exaggerating saccharine beg for money from Jimbo isnt helping Just as one can remove the Wikicup notice can that option please replace collapse Jonas D Rand T 0125 23 December 2008

Yecch Jimbos overpowering kool aid has been spread all over the place Im not thirsty and Im sure many readers arent either 

Edit 0134 23 December 2008 I may come off as too harsh but I just dont think we should be forced to donate or pushed so hard 

Jonas D Rand T 0129 23 December 2008

Does it really harm you that much I mean just ignore it Do you think it costs nothing to maintain this site I mean everyone is welcome to contribute in their own way either by editing or donating or whatever If you dont want to donate then dont do it no one is holding a gun to your head to make you donate The banner isnt going to harm you and is a necessary evil to you know have a wiki that can actually be edited Djsasso 1412 23 December 2008

Dsjasso I was actually talking about logged out users who happen not to have an account for personal reasons or those who have not pursued account creation yet And yes it is quite annoying especially since Jimbo got rich off of futures trading and that WP gets enough donationa from the E yuppie techie crowd like Roger McNamee I donate by writing articles and contributing to discussions regarding community governance 

Bluegoblin The collapse button is just the lesser of two annoyings

Kennedy For your reference the word is spelled privelige Jonas D Rand T 1540 23 December 2008

Thank you Peter Bluegoblin Im tired of seeing Jimbo beg And most anons do not contribute to the encyclopedia constructively Can you please show evidence of this I dont believe it Also some users dont contribute to the encyclopedia much at all I am complaining because I dont think that anons should be pushed to give to Wikipedia Youve already got 3 million dollars give it a rest for those people who are tired of seeing you ask for money Poor Jimbo Jonas D Rand T 1558 23 December 2008

I did not personally attack I did not state that Majorly was not constructive period I stated that he was not that much of a contributor to the encyclopedic part of Wikipedia which I did on the basis of a statement that Majorly himself made I barely edit the encyclopedia on Simple Please do not misinterpret that as a personal attack as it would be no more of a personal attack than to accuse me of not contributing to the encyclopedia more than I do to discussion Jonas D Rand T 1617 23 December 2008

Just because a person chooses to not have an account and edit from an IP doesnt mean they shouldnt be asked to donate any less than someone who has They read the encyclopedia just like anyone else Just because Jimbo does or does not have money doesnt enter into it the foundation is a seperate entity Just because you dont like to read a banner that can be collapsed doesnt mean it should be gone It isnt harming you in any way nor is it harming IP editors I am sure And yes Jonas you comments towards majorly were a personal attack because your whole basis of arguement is that you can contribute in many ways to the encyclopedia and not just one Majorly doesnt edit articles much but he does other things to contribute to the encyclopedia Djsasso 1633 23 December 2008

Could someone please advise me I have just created the page Opra Comique This is a page about the opera house The enwiki page on this subject is called Opra Comique I would normally give my new page the same title as on enwiki There is already a page on Opra comique This is about the genre of French comic opera It links to the enwiki page of the same title When I wanted to create my page about the opera house just now I was unable to do so because typing Opra Comique in the search just redirected to the existing Opra comique page I could see no way round it other than to change the title to Opra Comique which is what I did However when I then went to the Opra comique page and clicked on the red link to Opra Comique it opened up a box headed Opra Comique for me to create an page So I could have done it that way  Two questions really why did this happen Secondly having done what I have shall I leave it or should I change the title to conform to enwiki title Indeed will I be able to move it Thanks in advance Hikitsurisan 2236 23 December 2008

The problem that I have with the simple version is that if this project is intended for children then there needs to be a rating level Articles that would not pass a movie rating of PG or PG 13 should not be in here Does a child really need to see a video of a man ejaculating or even read an article about a man ejaculating or see diagrams of men and women masterbating IMO if a child is interested in that content they should read the adult article with their parents Maybe include a simplified sub heading on the main article that is intended for high school and middle school children

Why do we need an wikipedia in simple English for ESL adults Why cant they just read an article in their native language Or why not just read the regular article How many adults do you know of who cant honestly figure out what the adult content articles are talking about especially with the pictures and videos that people like to include in these type of articles in the name of understanding the topic

My gripe is the articles in this project that are not content appropriate for children I just dont see the need for a simple English wikipedia for adults when this issue can be addressed by simply adding a sub heading on a given article Zzmonty

Well Ive been working like hell in my sandbox and have no clue how to insert a scrollbar to deal with a hoard of Userboxes Anyone can help me Resident Mario 2017 24 December 2008

Excuse me if I stir up things a bit but apparently nobody has effectively replied the two main objections raised against this project in the proposals to close this project namely

Im not opposed to the goals of this project yesterday I was trying to find info for a homework for my second grade niece and found that the Standard English was way above her understanding level and the article on this project was vague incomplete and still not quite simple  Im willing to cooperate but at this stage of development the name simple is misleading and I have no clue about how to fix the article in question without clear criteria about what is simple I also tried to add an article on controlled languages and found out that someone tried to make it simple but without any clear idea about how to do that To me this seems to be a matter of taste and taste is a bad standard  Slightly annoyed Lwyx 2048 11 December 2008 Perhaps very simply put 

I have an idea Im setting up a WikiProject so that discussion may take place there Just follow the rabbit Lwyx 1720 27 December 2008

Let me take that back Ill put it very simply before going any further The vocabulary for an encyclopaedia cant be smaller than 3000 words given the wide range of topics to cover Online tools to check readability may also help So based on the current tools Id say that the standards may be the following Lwyx 1852 27 December 2008

This root dictionary may be completed with other word lists to guarantee that the articles look familiar to readers These lists may be Dolchs 300 words for younger readers Frys 1000 Instant Words and the first 1000 words from the General Service List The total count of mixing these lists is around 1500 However many of them are already counted in the 3000 words from the previous lists Lwyx 1852 27 December 2008

Taking Dolchs and Frys rule that one grade is equal to 100 words the reading level is that of a Middle School graduate So the target audience may be either Middle School students adults within that range or ESL students in that level Lwyx 1852 27 December 2008

Duat also spelled Tuat is the Egyptian idea of the underworld To the Egyptians the underworld was divided into sections filled with dangers that the Egyptian Soul had to pass through This is the same realm that Ra was believed to pass into each night and battle Apophis The Egyptian Underworld is described in many funerary texts found in tombs of mummies believed to help guide them through death

In Duat is where the famous Weighing of the Heart is displayed Where the soul shown as a heart is weighed on the scales of Anubis against the feather of Maat 

The Egyptian idea of the underworld influenced many other ideas of life after death in other cultures Ammit was believed to eat the souls of people whose heart did not weigh the exact weight of Maats feather After this it was thought people either were digested eternally or were placed into a pit of liquid fire that shot from snakes mouths

Ammit was the Egyptian idea of the punishment of the soul Ammit was believed to eat any souls found to have sinned They would then be digested for eternity in acid Or Ammit who was believed to be the guardian of a lake of fire would place the soul into the liquid fire for all eternity

Ammit was a mix of the crocodile lion and hippo which were some of the most feared animals in Egypt at the time 

Rather than being worshiped Ammit was feared she was not viewed as a god Although she was viewed as a good force because she destroyed the evil

Although Ammit is seen as a devouring entity she is neutral and strictly serves at the whim of the other deities to take souls that have sinned against the gods and send them into oblivion

Michael Howe was a famous bushranger in Tasmania Australia He called himself the Lieutenant Governor of the Woods He kept a written record of his thoughts in a book he called The Journal of Dreams

Howe was born in Pontefract Yorkshire in 1787 He joined the merchant navy at Hull After a short while he ran away and joined the Royal Navy He deserted the navy after two years He had his own small boat and carried coal In 1811 Howe was arrested at York and charged with highway robbery He was sentenced to seven years in Van Diemens Land

Howe arrived in Hobart on October 19 1812 on the convict ship Indefatigable He was sent to work for John Ingle who had once been the Supervisor of Convicts He was now a farmer and merchant Howe soon escaped and went into the bush He joined up with a large group of escaped convicts who had become bushrangers The gang of 28 was led by John Whitehead It included two soldiers and two aboriginal women

The bushrangers robbed a lot of houses and farms around New Norfolk On April 25 1815 the gang went to the house of a MrCarlisle Carlisle and his friends went out to stop the gang from stealing a boat Carlisle was shot dead and his neighbour MrOBirne was badly wounded OBirne died a few days later The gang returned to New Norfolk in May 1815 to rob more houses They met a group of soldiers and John Whitehead was shot and killed To claim a reward for killing a bushranger the body had to be identified To stop people from claiming a reward for their capture Howe and Whitehead had made a promise to each other This would be to cut the head off whoever was killed first so no one would know who it was As soon as Whitehead was shot his head was cut off by Howe and hidden in the bush

After Whiteheads death Howe became leader of the gang of bushrangers He set up the gang as if they were on board a ship Gang members could be punished if they broke the gangs rules Punishment included having to cut and carry firewood and even included being lashed Howe would read to them from the Bible He wrote letters to Governor Davey In 1816 he signed the letters as Lieutentant Governor of the Woods In 1817 he began calling himself the Governor of the Ranges He was living with an aboriginal woman called Black Mary Members of the gang were known to be James Garry Peter Septon George Jones Richard Colier John Chapman Thomas Coyne James Parker Mathew Kegan John Brown and Nenis Curry The gang continued to rob people at Green Point Coal River and Bagdad

In 1817 Howe wrote to Governor William Sorell and offered to give himself up in return for a free pardon He offered to tell the government where all the gang members could be found He was put into Hobart gaol while he was being questioned about the gang He escaped while being taken for a walk through Hobart to get fresh air He went back and rejoined the gang Governor Lachlan Macquarie in Sydney stopped the pardon and told Sorell to put more effort in to capture Howe Sorell offered money a free pardon and a return to England for anyone that captured Howe

The hunt for the bushrangers became more organized John Chapman and a man called Elliot were shot dead by the soldiers in 1817 A gang member called Hillier cut Peter Septons head off to claim a reward He also tried to cut off Richard Coliers head Both men were hurt in the struggle Hillier was taken to Sydney where he was executed by hanging Colier was executed in Hobart on March 26 1818 In April 1818 a group of convicts tried to steal a government boat They were going to rescue Howe and take him to America John Brown James Parker Thomas Coyne and Mathew Kegan gave themselves up to the military They were all taken to Newcastle New South Wales where they were given the lash and sent to gaol

In September 1818 a group came from Sydney to join in the hunt for Howe They wanted the reward One member of the group was the famous aboriginal tracker Mosquito They nearly caught him They did get his guns and his knapsack In the knapsack they found his Journal of Dreams It was a book made from kangaroo skin and Howe had written in it using kangaroo blood as ink In it Howe wrote about his fear of being killed by the aborigines his dreams of his sister and lists of vegetables and flowers he would grow in a house in the forest As he escaped Howe thought Black Mary was slowing him down so he tried to shoot her 

On October 10 Howe was captured by two people he knew and trusted Watts and Drewe He managed to untie himself and stabbed Watts and shot Drewe dead Watts died later from the injuries On October 21 1818 Black Mary led another two men a convict Thomas Worrall and a soldier William Pugh to where Howe was hiding near the Shannon River Worrall had been a sailor who had been sent to Van Diemens Land for his part in the naval mutiny at the Nore in 1797 He wanted the reward so he could be free and return to England All the men shot at each other but after a fierce fight Pugh and Worrall bashed Howe to death with their muskets

Howe was buried by the river but his head was taken back to Hobart where it was put on public display

Much of the information comes from a book by Governor Sorells secretary Thomas Wells The book was called Michael Howe the Last and Worst of the Bushrangers of Van Diemens Land and printed in 1818 in Hobart This was the first work of general literature printed in Australia

Pont de Veyle is a commune It is found in the Rhne Alpes region in the Ain department in the east of France It is 10 kilometers east of Macon and about 400 km from Paris In 1999 there were 1571 people living in the commune It is built on an island made where the River Veyle separates into two branches The Veyle then flows into the River Sane which was made the border between the Kingdom of France and the German Empire in 843 by the Treaty of Verdun

Pont de Veyle was first started by the Lords of Bage and legally made a city by the Counts of Savoy in 1275 It only became French in 1601 under King Henri IV of France as part of the Treaty of Lyon

Because it was close to the border this city had to build a castle to defend themselves against the Lords of Macon the Sires of Beaujeu and the Princes of Dombes The castle had 14 towers but today only one remains the Clock Tower and a doorway from the 14th century joined by brick walls Today there is very little left of these walls The castle was surrounded by a moat filled with water From 1750 to 1800 they pulled down the city walls and towers that had become dangerous and were about to fall down

There are many old and historic buildings from the Renaissance and later centuries The Savoy or House of Lords whose facade was restored is one of the most beautiful in the region There is a priory of Saint Benedict with its Gothic doors There are many half timbered houses such as The House of the Watchman which was redeveloped with great care and taste There are also many spiral staircases of stone including one at City Hall which was part of the former College of the Jesuits The Jesuit style church was built in 1755 The hospital which was started in 1322 still has 18th century buildings 

After the Reformation and the religious wars there was a large group of Protestants living in the city When the Edict of Nantes a law which gave them religious freedom was overturned they fled the city and went to live in Switzerland and Germany

Jean Louis Carra a French journalist and revolutionary was born in Pont de Veyle on 9 March 1742 He was executed by the guillotine in Paris on 31 October 1793

For the original WWE Tag Team Championship that was active from 1971 through 2010 see World Tag Team Championship

After the Brand Extension in World Wrestling Entertainment the WWE Undisputed Championship and WWE Womens Championship became the only titles allowed to be fought for on both the Raw and SmackDown brands while the remaining titles were made where they could only be fought for on their own brands Originally a part of the SmackDown brand after the companys first brand extension in the spring of 2002 the Tag Team Championship was moved to the Raw brand that following summer The Tag Team Championship became apart of the Raw brand only leaving the SmackDown brand without a tag team title As a result SmackDown General Manager Stephanie McMahon introduced the new WWE Tag Team Championship and made it the tag team title for the SmackDown brand She stated that the first champions would be the winners of an eight team tournament On October 20 2002 the team of Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit beat Rey Mysterio and Edge at No Mercy 2002 in the tournament final to become the first ever WWE Tag Team Champions 

On October 17 2007 SmackDown and ECW announced a talent sharing agreement that made it where talent from either brands roster can compete on both brands As a result the title became to be fought for on both brands In late 2008 through early 2009 WWE Tag Team Champions The Colns engaged in rivalry with the World Tag Team Champions John Morrison and The Miz which resulted in the announcement on the March 17 edition of ECW that at WrestleMania XXV both teams would fight for their titles against each other and the winning team would hold both titles 

The result was the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship a combination of the two titles though both were kept active by themselves they were defended as one by one tag team The champions could appear on and defend the titles on any WWE brand Though eventually on August 16 2010 the World Tag Team Championship was retired in favor of continuing the history of the WWE Tag Team Championship following the introduction of new championship belts to then champions David Hart Smith and Tyson Kidd of The Hart Dynasty The champions can still compete on any brand

The current champions are the tag team of Kane and The Big Show who are in their first reign as a team By them selves this is Big Shows third reign and Kanes first They won the titles from Corre members Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater on the April 22 2011 edition of SmackDown

Make Mine Music is a 1946 animated movie produced by Walt Disney Pictures and first released to movie theaters by RKO Radio Pictures on August 15 1946 The eighth animated movie in the Disney animated movie canon the movie stars Nelson Eddy Dinah Shore Benny Goodman and The Andrews Sisters

The movie is made of ten parts or segments

During World War II much of Walt Disneys staff was drafted into the United States Army and those that were still there were called upon by the US government to make training and propaganda films As a result the studio was littered with unfinished story ideas In order to keep the movie division alive during this difficult time the studio released four package films including this one made up of various unrelated segments set to music

To date Make Mine Music is the only movie in the Disney animated features canon not to gain a Region 4 and Region 2 DVD release Its only home video release was on DVD on June 6 2000 under the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection title

Make Mine Music ended up being a slight disappointment itself particularly from Walt Disneys point of view It was not well received by the critics either Years later the segments were individually released as short subjects or used in various Disney television programs 

The movie was entered into the 1946 Cannes Film Festival

Ambulocetus had a long low body with short powerful limbs Its back legs in seemed to be used for movement Its feet had long probably webbed toes Each toe ended in a very small hooflet Its tail was slightly flattened like that of an otter to help it swim Its eyes and nostrils were on the top of its skull This let it see and breathe while just under the surface of the water It had a very dangerous set of teeth

One mostly complete specimen and several partial skeletons have been found in Pakistan

Maurice Durufl was a French composer and organist He was very self critical and destroyed any of his compositions that he thought were not really good This is why we now only have a small number of his works He wrote choral music and music for the organ His most famous work is his Requiem

Durufl was born in Louviers Haute Normandie In 1912 he joined the choir of Rouen Cathedral where he studied piano and organ When he was 17 he went to Paris and had private organ lessons with Charles Tournemire He became Tournemires assistant at the Basilique Ste Clotilde Paris until 1927 In 1920 Durufl went to study at the Conservatoire de Paris His organ teacher was Eugne Gigout When he graduated he got first prizes in organ harmony piano accompaniment and composition 

In 1929 Durufl became organist at St tienne du Mont in Paris a job he kept for the rest of his life 

In 1939 he gave the first performance of Francis Poulencs Organ Concerto In 1943 he became professor of harmony at the Conservatoire de Paris where he worked until 1970 In 1947 Durufl wrote his famous Requiem op 9 for soloists choir organ and orchestra In the same year Marie Madeleine Chevalier became his assistant organist at St tienne du Mont They married in 1953 after Durufl divorced his first wife The couple often travelled together to give organ recitals together They always spent many hours practising on the organs on which they had to perform often practising a lot of the time without the sound so that their fingers were really used to the feel of the organ

In 1975 Durufl was badly hurt in a car accident and had to give up performing His wife who was not so badly hurt in the accident was still able to play and continued to play the organ at St tienne du Mont

Durufl died in Louveciennes in 1986 aged 84

Durufl only left a few of his works for publication His two important organ works are the Suite op 5 which has a famous Toccata as last movement and his Prelude and Fugue sur le nom dAlain His Requiem remains a favourite work for choirs Durufls music uses Gregorian plainchant modal harmonies and polyphonic writing He was a great admirer of the music of Louis Vierne and Charles Tournemire and he made transcriptions of some of their improvisations

As a teenager Fischer became well known worldwide because of his skill at chess He won the American championship of 196364 winning all eleven of his games

Fischer was born in Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago Illinois on March 9 1943 His birth certificate said that his father was Hans Gerhardt Fischer a German His mother Regina Wender Fischer was a Polish Jewish American citizen Born in Switzerland she grew up in St Louis Missouri and later became a teacher a nurse and a doctor The two married in 1933 in Moscow USSR where Regina was studying medicine at the First Moscow Medical Institute They divorced in 1945 when Bobby was two years old so he grew up with his mother and older sister In 1948 the family moved to Mobile Arizona where Regina taught in an elementary school The next year they moved to Brooklyn New York

A 2002 article in The Philadelphia Inquirer said that Paul Nemenyi a doctor was Bobbys biological father not Hans Gerhardt Regina and Nemenyi had had an affair in 1942 and he gave her money to help her raise her child every month paying for Fischers schooling until he died in 1952 Fischer later told the chess player Zita Rajcsanyi that Nemenyi sometimes came to his Brooklyn apartment and took him to places

Fischer learned to play at the age of six His sister Joan bought him a chess set and Bobby learned how to play from the instructions Several years later he began to play at the Manhattan Chess Club He became well known around the world in 1956 when aged 13 he played a game against an American player named Donald Byrne In the game he sacrificed his queen and won Chess Review called this game the game of the century

At the age of 14 Fischer won the US Championship for the first time This would be the first of eight US Championships he would win

In 1972 he became the first and only American to win the World Chess Championship in the 20th century In the 19th century Paul Morphy was briefly the leading player Wilhelm Steinitz the first official world champion became an American citizen while he was champion To win the title Fischer beat Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union in a match held in Reykjavk Iceland However Fischer did not agree to a match to defend his title He lost his title in 1975 and the title of world champion was given to Anatoly Karpov

Fischer did not play in any public matches or tournaments for nearly 20 years In 1992 he defeated Spassky in a rematch in Yugoslavia The United States Department of State had told him not to play there because of events that happened after Yugoslavia began splitting into several new countries Since he disobeyed this order he could have been prosecuted if he returned to the US In fact he never returned there Fischers 1992 rematch against Spassky was the only time after becoming the world champion that Fischer played chess in public

After his match Fischer promoted a new type of chess called Fischer Random Chess where the pieces were randomly shuffled before the game so they would be on different squares to start every game

In July 2004 Fischer was arrested at an airport in Japan with a bad passport The United States wanted Japan to send him back to go to trial for playing chess in Yugoslavia in 1992 The government of Iceland eventually decided to make Fischer a citizen of Iceland and Fischer was sent there where he lived for the rest of his life

Fischer died of kidney failure on January 17 2008 He was buried at a small ceremony near the town of Selfoss Iceland

Fischer was born Jewish but he rejected the religion He used many racist insults toward Judaism Fischer denied the Holocaust and he read anti Semitic and white supremacist books such as Mein Kampf and The Protocols of the Elders of Zion As a young man Fischer joined the Radio Church of God He later left this evangelical Protestant church with outspoken comments While Fischer had a Catholic funeral it is unclear whether he became a Roman Catholic before his death

Fischer like Morphy chose to stop playing when he was still young He had a lifelong history of disputes conflicts and controversy He believed he was the victim of conspiracies Fischer showed symptoms of the mental illness paranoia similar to Morphy In Bobby Fischer The Wandering King authors Hans Bhm and Kees Jongkind write that Fischers radio broadcasts show that he was out of his mind a victim of his own mental illness

Phosgene is the chemical compound with the formula COCl2 This gas has no color The gas was used as a weapon during World War I It is responsible for most of the deaths related to poison gas during the war Today phosgene is used as a tool It is used for organic synthesis When there is a small amount in the air the smell is similar to that of freshly cut hay or grass Some soldiers during the First World War have stated that it smelled a little like May Blossom When chlorine is burned small amounts of phosgene are given off They are given off from the breakdown of chlorinated compounds

Today most phosgene is used to produce isocyanates The most important isocanates in this context are toluene diisocyanate and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate Both are precursors to polyurethanes Large amounts are also used to produce polycarbonates Polycarbonate is produced from its reaction with bisphenol A Polycarbonates are an important class of engineering thermoplastic They can be found in lenses in eye glasses

Phosgene is a strong poison Its smell may not be noticed Signs of exposure may sometimes be detected slowly Phosgene can be seen at 04 parts per million This amount is four times the safe amount Its high ability to poison doesnt come from the hydrogen chloride released by a process It comes from the action of the phosgene on the proteins in the pulmonary sac of the lungs The sacs are where the oxygen goes into the body Their damage makes it hard for the blood and air move oxygen and carbon This will make breathing very hard Badges are worn by those at risk of exposure

Sodium bicarbonate may be used to make spills of phosgene harmless Gas spills may be made harmless with a special liquid spray

The Transmission Control Protocol is one of the main protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite TCP is part of the popular TCPIP combination used by the Internet The Internet Protocol or IP makes sure data on the internet gets to the right place Then TCP makes sure the data is put in the right order and none of it is missing TCP also helps to control traffic on the internet so it doesnt get overloaded These protocols which are kind of like languages that computers use are designed so that any computer and any program can use them

TCP makes it easier for computer programs to communicate with each other typically over a computer network When a program wants to send a lot of data TCP is in charge of chopping the data up sending it through the network and putting it back together correctly on a different computer In the process IP chooses which wires and intersections get used to send all the data pieces in the fastest way It does this using packets

If there are a lot of people using the network it can get overloaded Also sometimes weather power outages and other problems can make communication hard Routers on the Internet use something called load balancing to try to fix some of these problems But still information can be delivered out of order get lost or even duplicated TCP is designed to notice all of these problems and try to fix them This can take awhile which is why the Internet sometimes seems slow Once the TCP receiver has finally reassembled a perfect copy of the data originally transmitted it passes that data to the computer program that asked for it In this way the program doesnt have to know about the network and TCP doesnt have to know about the programs data

Wagners music was an influence on his compositional style However he could not form a proper friendship with Wagner because of Wagners antisemitism
