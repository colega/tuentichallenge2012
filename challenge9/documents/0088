Illicium verum or Star anise is a spice that tastes like anise The star shaped fruits are harvested before they start getting ripe

Star anise has been used in a tea and the seeds are sometimes chewed after meals for digestion

Star anise is grown in four places in China and harvested between March and May It is also found in the south of New South Wales

Japanese star anise a similar tree is not eatable because it is highly toxic instead it has been burned as incense in Japan

The Great American Interchange was an important zoogeographic event about three million years ago Land and freshwater fauna migrated between North America and South America

The migration happened during the Pliocene 3626 million years ago The volcanic Isthmus of Panama rose up from the sea floor and bridged the two continents 

The land bridge in what is now Panama joined the Neotropic and Nearctic ecozones to form the Americas 

The interchange is visible from both stratigraphy and nature Its most dramatic effect is on the distribution of mammals but weak flying or flightless birds reptiles amphibians arthropods and even freshwater fish also migrated

The differences in the fauna of North and South America had been known for some time Both Humboldt and Darwin discussed it The interchange as a concept was first fully laid out in 1876 by the father of biogeography Alfred Russel Wallace Wallace had spent 18481852 exploring and collecting specimens in the Amazon Basin Others who made significant contributions to understanding the event in the century that followed include Florentino Ameghino and George Gaylord Simpson

Similar interchanges occurred earlier in the Cainozoic when the former Gondwana continents of India and Africa made contact with Eurasia about 50 and 30 mya respectively

When the global continent Pangaea broke up early in the Jurassic period the great southern supercontinent Gondwana was formed It separated from Laurasia 200180 mya 

In stages Gondwana also broke up eventually into half a dozen continents we recognise today They were Australasia Indian subcontinent Africa Madagascar Antarctica and South America

South America drifted west from Africa starting about 130 mya in the Lower Cretaceous There was open sea between them by 110 mya The last connection of South America with any part of Gondwana was a link with West Antarctica which broke in the Oligocene only 30 mya

When Gondwana was separated from Laurasia evolution of most animals and plants went on separately in the two great supercontinents Later as Gondwana broke up most of its fauna and flora also evolved separately 

This is not obvious in Africa and India since they moved north and joined the Eurasian continent long ago Animals moved north and south there also but the original pattern is now hard to see But in Australasia and South America the pattern is clear

The mammals are a good example Eutherian mammals evolved in Laurasia but few got to Gondwana before it was separated Earlier groups of mammals did get to Gondwana They were the marsupials the monotremes and other therian mammals 

Thus when South America was completely separated it had only the earlier types of mammals including some early eutherians such as the Xenarthra The groups which evolved later and which dominate the northern continents only got to South America by the Great American Interchange

After the late Mesozoic breakup of Gondwana South America spent most of the Cainozoic era as an island continent 

Its splendid isolation allowed the fauna to evolve into many forms found nowhere else on earth most of which are now extinct 

The endemic mammals initially consisted of metatherians including marsupials xenarthrans and a diverse group of South American ungulates

Marsupials appear to have travelled from South America through Antarctica to Australasia in the late Cretaceous or early Tertiary 

Ratites probably migrated by this route about the same time in the direction from South America towards AustraliaNew Zealand 

Other taxa that may have dispersed by the same route are parrots chelid turtles and meiolaniid turtles 

One living South American marsupial the tiny Monito del Monte is more closely related to Australian marsupials than to other South American marsupials Since it is the most basal australidelphian we know its group probably evolved in South America and then colonized Australia 

A 61 mya old platypus like monotreme fossil from Patagonia may be an Australian immigrant 

Marsupials in South America included didelphimorphs shrew opossums and several other small groups

The borhyaenids and the sabertooth Thylacosmilus are no longer considered to be marsupials They are sparassodont metatherians the sister group of the marsupials 

Sparassodonts were the only South American mammals to specialize as carnivores Their relative inefficiency created openings for nonmammalian predators to play more prominent roles than usual Sparassodonts shared the ecological niches for large predators with fearsome flightless terror birds whose closest extant relatives are the seriemas Terrestrial ziphodont crocodilians were also present at least through the middle Miocene Some of South Americas aquatic crocodilians reached monstrous sizes with lengths up to 12 m 

Through the skies over late Miocene South America soared the largest flying bird known the teratorn Argentavis with a wing span of 6 m or more which may have subsisted in part on the leftovers of Thylacosmilus kills

Xenarthrans are a curious group of mammals that developed morphological adaptations for specialized diets very early in their history 

In addition to those extant today a great diversity of larger types were present including pampatheres the ankylosaur like glyptodonts various ground sloths some of which reached the size of elephants and even semiaquatic sloths

The notoungulates and litopterns had many strange forms some examples of convergent evolution 

Both groups started evolving in the Lower Paleocene possibly from condylarth stock diversified dwindled before the great interchange and went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene The pyrotheres and astrapotheres were also strange but were less diverse and disappeared earlier well before the interchange 

The North American fauna was typical northern eutheria

Once the continents were joined invasions from the north to the south were numerous and significant in their effect Invasions from south to north were much less significant This is most clearly seen in the mammals

Reasons for this have been suggested Wetland tropical species going north encountered desert or at any rate dry conditions in Mexico where the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt also known as the Sierra Nevada or Snowy Mountain Range extends 900 km from west to east across central southern Mexico

However by far the most common theory is that North American fauna were topped up from time to time whenever Eurasian species could get over the Bering Strait 

This applies with force to mammals because the eutherian mammals originated in Asia and had undergone a great deal of evolution before they got to South America Marsupials originally in Eurasia had long before been out competed and gone extinct It is not surprising the eutherians did well in South America

Marsupials in both South America and Australasia were weak in predators The borhyaenids and Thylacosmilus were not marsupials they were the related group the sparassodonts Instead in South America the terror birds Phorusrhacos were for a long time the top predators 

All these native forms were wiped out as short faced bears wolves nine species of small cats cougars jaguars lions sabretooths established themselves 

The successes in the opposite direction are interesting Opossums as the Virginia Opossum are well established over a wide range They are the only surviving marsupial in North America though there were others before mankind arrived in the Americas

The top native South American mammal success for a long time was the superorder Xenarthra which had two different groups with large representatives in North America One group was the giant ground sloths such as the megalonychid Megalonyx This group lived in North America for over 10 million years well before the Great Interchange How they got there is not known They got as far north as Alaska and the Yukon

The other group was the glyptodonts such such as Glyptotherium texanum They were large heavily armoured relatives of the armadillo

The ability of South Americas xenarthrans to compete effectively against the northerners represents a special case The explanation for their success lies in part in their defence against predation This was based on body armor andor formidable claws The xenarthrans did not need to be fleet footed or quick witted to survive Such a strategy may have been forced on them by their low metabolic rate Their low metabolic rate in turn allowed them to subsist on less abundant andor less nutritious food sources Unfortunately the defensive adaptations of the large xenarthrans would have been useless against humans armed with spears and other projectiles

Eomaia is the earliest known fossil eutherian mammal It is exceptionally well preserved for a 125 million year old specimen 

It was discovered in rocks of the Yixian Formation Liaoning Province China These strata date to the Lower Cretaceous about 125 million years ago 

The fossil is convert10cmin in length and virtually complete It weighed between convert20 25goz Although the fossils skull is squashed flat its teeth tiny foot bones cartilages and even its fur are visible

Eomaia is a eutherian The eutherians are the placental mammals plus some extinct mammals which had not developed a placenta 

What distinguishes the eutheria from metatherians a group that includes modern marsupials are various features of the feet jaws and teeth

However Eomaia is not a true placental mammal as it lacks some features that are specific to placentals Eomaia has

Its discoverers sampled 268 characters from all major Mesozoic mammal clades and principal eutherian families of the Cretaceous period As a result they claim Eomaia is at the root of the eutherian family tree with a few other fossils

The Eomaia fossil shows clear traces of hair However this is not the earliest clear evidence of hair in the mammalian lineage as fossils of the docodont Castorocauda discovered in rocks dated to about 164 mya also have traces of fur

In baseball a stolen base is when a baserunner advances to the next base while the pitcher is throwing the ball to home plate In baseball statistics stolen bases are displayed as SB It is possible to steal second base third base or home plate but not to steal first base

If the defense does not try to put the baserunner out the play is called defensive indifference No stolen base is credited to the runner in this case Defensive indifference is usually only scored instead of a stolen base when the game is in a late inning and the team with the stealing baserunner is down by more than one run MLB Rule 1007 defines defensive indifference

A player who is good at stealing bases needs not just running speed but also good base running instincts quickness and split second timing The scoring and guidelines for awarding a stolen base to a runner are covered by rule 1007 of the Major League Baseball rule book

If a player is good at stealing bases his manager may let him try to steal a base whenever he thinks he can A player who is allowed to try to steal whenever he wants is said to have the green light Players who do not have the green light may only be allowed to steal when a coach or manager tells him to

The Battle of Finnburg was a battle between the Frisians and the Danes It was mentioned in two early medieval writings the Finnesburg Fragment and Beowulf These may describe a real or a completelymythical event 

According to the Finnesburg Fragment the Danish prince Hnaef came with sixty followers to visit and spent the winter at the Finnburg Finnburg was the fort of his brother in law Finn king of the Frisians There a fight started between the Frisians and the Danes A battle took place that lasted for three days The verses of the story that were found do not explain why the fight started nor do they give the outcome of the battle

In a passage of Beowulf a bard sings a song about the ending of the battle here named Freswael This is the same story as in the Finnesburg Fragment While in less detail the Beowulf episode is complete Here it is seen that the Frisians won the battle The Danish prince Hnaef and Finns son died in the battle After the fighting the parties make peace and the new Danish leader Hingest is allowed to leave with the surviving Danes

Caspar Wessel was a Danish Norwegian mathematician

He was born in Jonsrud Vestby Akershus Norway In 1763 having completed secondary school he went to Denmark for further studies In 1778 he acquired got degree of candidatus juris In 1794 he was hired as a surveyor in 1798 a Royal inspector of Surveying

As surveying is related to mathematics he later studied the geometrical importance of complex numbers His most important paper Om directionens analytiske betegning was published in 1799 by the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters Since it was in Danish it was not noticed by many people Later Jean Robert Argand and Carl Friedrich Gausss paper showed the same results

One of the more important but missed ideas shown in Wessels Om directionens analytiske betegning was vectors Wessels main thing he wanted to show in the paper was not this but he felt that the concept of numbers with length and direction would be needed Wessels thoughts on addition was Two straight lines are added if we unite them in such a way that the second line begins where the first one ends and then pass a straight line from the first to the last point of the united lines This line is the sum of the united lines Today the same idea is used when adding vectors

His paper was printed in a French translation in 1899 It was released in English in 1999 as On the analytic representation of direction

Johan Herman Wessel Wessels brother was a famous person in Danish Norwegian books

Global Handwashing Day is a campaign to encourage people around the world to wash their hands with soap It takes place on October 15 of each year The campaigns goal is to raise awareness of handwashing with soap as a key way to prevent diseases 

The holiday was made at the annual World Water Week 2008 which was held in Stockholm from August 17 to 23 Out of this week came the Public Private Partnership for Handwashing The Global Handwashing Day took place for the first time on October 15 2008 the date appointed by United Nations General Assembly to go along with the year 2008 as the International Year of Sanitation

The theme for Global Handwashing Days inaugural year was Focus on School Children The members pledged to get the maximum number of school children handwashing with soap in more than seventy countries

In Major League Baseball the 500 home run club is a term given to the group of batters who have hit 500 or more regular season home runs in their careers On August 11 1929 Babe Ruth became the first member of the club Ruth ended his career with 714 home runs This record stood from 1935 until Hank Aaron broke it in 1974 Aarons ending career total 755 stayed the record until Barry Bonds set the current mark of 762 during the 2007 season Gary Sheffield is the most recent to reach 500 home runs he hit his 500th home run on April 17 2009 Twenty five players are members of the 500 home run club

Of these 25 players 13 were right handed batters 10 were left handed and 2 were switch hitters The San Francisco Giants are the only franchise to have four players reach 500 home runs while on their roster Mel Ott while the team was in New York Willie Mays Willie McCovey and most recently Bonds Four 500 home run club membersAaron Mays Eddie Murray and Rafael Palmeiroare also members of the 3000 hit club Sheffields 500th home run was his first career home run with the New York Mets the first time that a players 500th home run was also his first with his franchise Alex Rodriguez at 32 years and 8 days was the youngest player to hit 500 Ted Williams at 41 years and 291 days was the oldest

Being a member of the 500 home run club is sometimes described as a guarantee of entry into the Baseball Hall of Fame Some believe the milestone has become less meaningful in recent years Mark McGwire and Rafael Palmeiro are the only currently eligible club members not elected to the Hall Eligibility requires that a player has been retired five seasons or be dead for at least six months Some believe the milestone has become less important with the large number of new members 10 players joined the club from 1999 to 2009 Also several of these recent members have had ties to performance enhancing drugs Some believe that by not electing McGwire to the Hall the voters were starting a guideline on how they would treat players from the Steroid Era

Eyre Coote was a British soldier and politician who was born in Ireland

He was the second son of the Very Rev Charles Coote DD Dean of Kilfenora After studying at Eton and Trinity College Dublin Coote bought a commission in the 34th Regiment of Foot  of which his uncle was colonel  in 1774 

He was soon sent to North America to fight in the Revolutionary War He fought in the Brooklyn in August 1776 as well as at Brandywine Germantown and Monmouth Court House before finally being taken prisoner at the final Battle of Yorktown in 1781 Between 1790 and 1798 he represented Ballynakill in the Irish House of Commons Then he sat for Maryborough until 1800

He served in England and Ireland when they were threatened by French invasion and against the French on the Continent He went on to serve in Holland Egypt and eventually became Governor General of Jamaica where he possibly sired an ancestor of Colin Powell

Sir Eyre was removed from the service on the 21 May 1816 because of the scandal he caused in the Christs Hospital school for boys On 25 November 1815 he entered the school and offered some boys money for an opportunity to flog them After that he asked them to flog him and gave them money He was caught by the school nurse and charged with indecent conduct before the Lord Mayor of London He was acquitted after giving 1000 to the school after that there was a military inquiry in April 1816 which stripped him of his rank and honours He was appointed GCB 1815 and stripped of it 1816

Tree frogs are frogs that spend most of their life in trees Today there are two large groups or lineages among the Neobatrachia These groups have evolved for a long time in similar conditions or habitats The result of this is that today there are species from different groups that look very much like each other This goes so far that in almost all cases where one group occurs the other does not Their current distribution shows that the last common ancestor of both groups lived before the dinosaurs disappeared

The NDH was ruled by Ante Paveli and his Ustae a racist terrorist and saboteur organization    which were followers of the Pure Party of Rights founded by Ante Starevi at the end of 19th century The NDH had a program formulated by Mile Budak to purge Croatia of Serbs by killing one third expelling the other third and assimilating the remaining third The first part of this programme was begun during WWII by a planned genocide in Jasenovac concentration camp and other places all over NDH

Following the attack of the Axis powers on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941 and the quick defeat of the Yugoslav army the whole country was occupied by Axis forces Hitler and Mussolini installed the Croatian Ustae who had long sought Croatian independence forming the Independent State of Croatia

The establishment of NDH was proclaimed on April 10 1941 by Slavko Kvaternik deputy leader of the Ustae Ante Paveli came to power as leader of the Croatian puppet state Paveli took power with Mussolini and Hitlers blessing On paper it was a kingdom under King Tomislav II of the House of Savoy But Tomislav II was only a figurehead with no real power

From a strategic perspective the establishment of the new puppet state was an obvious attempt by Hitler to pacify the now conquered Yugoslav peoples for the purpose of reducing the necessary occupation force to a minimum Vladko Maek the head of the Croatian Peasant Party the strongest elected party in Croatia at the time refused an offer from Germans to head the government but called on people to obey to and cooperate with the new government the same day Kvaternik made the proclamation Ante Paveli arrived on April 20th to become the poglavnik The Roman Catholic Churchs official stance was also openly positive in this period

On 19 May 1941 Paveli and Mussolini in accordance with the contract signed in Rapallo at the end of WWI between Serbs Kingdom of Jugoslavia and Italy signed Roma operating contract by which NDH had to cede to Italy almost all of Dalmatia and parts of Hrvatsko primorje and Gorski kotar NDH was also forbidden to have a navy These contracts illustrate more than anything else the dependence of the country upon the Axis powers

Much of the population of the Independent State of Croatia was not Croat mostly because of the inclusion of Bosnia It had significant populations of Serbs Bosnian Muslims Germans Hungarians and others The Catholics constituted just over 50 of the 63 million population Dr Mile Budak politician and minister of the NDH  also a Croatian writer immediately took the opportunity to proclaim the Muslims as Brothers Many Croatians agree with the idea that the majority of Bosnian Muslims are actually Croatians who were converted to Islam during the invasion of the Turks in the 15th Century  

Many Bosnian Muslims accepted the NDH and immediately became involved The most infamous of Islamic Ustase divisions was the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar In respect to the soldiers of Muslim faith a mosque was built in Zagreb  Croatias capital city known as Poglavnikova dzamija or Poglavniks Mosque 

The Ustase almost immediately enacted racial laws that reflected the acceptance of the ideology of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy with an emphasis placed on Croatian national issues

The first Legal order for the defense of the people and the state dated April 17 1941 ordered the death penalty for infringement of the honour and vital interests of the Croatian people and the survival of the Independent State of Croatia It was soon followed by the Legal order of races and the Legal order of the protection of Aryan blood and the honour of the Croatian people dated April 30 1941 as well as the Order of the creation and definition of the racial political committee dated June 4 1941 The enforcement of these legal acts was done not only through normal courts but also new out of order courts as well as mobile courts martial with extended jurisdictions

The normal jails could no longer sustain the rate of new inmates and the Ustaa government started preparing the grounds what would become the Jasenovac concentration camp by July 1941 The regime would eventually form concentration camps in eleven different locations

The Ustae started conducting a deliberate campaign of mass murder deportation and forced religious conversion in an attempt to remove the undesirables Serbs Jews Gypsies dissenting Croats and others

The Jasenovac concentration camp would become the place of murder of up to a hundred thousand people Overall Ustase death count is estimated at around 100000 people but all written records were destroyed to cover it up

By the end of the war the Croatian Serbs were reduced to 14 of the population due to killing or conversion The Croatian Jews were all but eliminated as only one fifth of them survived the war Many Jews were also deported to the concentration camps of Nazi Germany itself

The state of permanent terror mass killing raping women and looting properties of their victims in the Independet State of Croatia forced primarily the Serbs to rebel According to the Glaise von Horstenau reports Hitler was angry with Paveli whose policy inflamed the rebellion in Croatia  by which Hitler lost ability to engage the Independent State of Croatia forces on the Eastern Front Moreover Hitler was forced to engage his forces in quelling the rebellion For that reason Hitler summoned Paveli to his war headquoters in Vinica on September 23 1942 Consequently Paveli replaced his minister of the Armed Forces Slavko Kvaternik with the less zealous Jure Franceti Before meeting Hitler to appease the public Paveli published the Important Governments Announcement in which he threatened those who were spreading the news about non existent threats of disarmament of the Ustashe units by representatives of one foreign power about the Croatian Army replacement by a foreign army about the possibility that a foreign power would seize the power in Croatia 

Hans Helm the appointed head of Gestapo for the Independent State of Croatia in his confidential report  of January 14 1943 wrote Most of the partisan ranks are coming from the Serbs  due to the fact that they are the most villainous way persecuted the new regime in Croatia started the programs of annihilation and destruction of the Serbs which are publicly supported by the highest ranks of the Croatian government and adopted as the main government goal The fact that a different talk was coming from the official Ustashe side  under the rebellion pressure and due to the course of events  even a reconciliation was mentioned  leaves no possibility to compensate the harm caused by for example Dr Mile Budak the actual minister in Berlin  Appointed general Horstenau wrote in his report Ustashe movement is due to the mistakes and atrocities they have made and the corruption so compromised that the government executive branch shall be separated from the government  even for the price of breaking any possible connection with the government 

In August 1944 there was an attempt by Foreign Minister in NDH government Mladen Lorkovi and Minister of War Ante Voki to execute a coup detat against Ante Paveli The coup failed and its conspirators were executed

The NDH army withdrew towards Zagreb with German and Cossak troops by early 1945 and continued fighting for a week after the German surrender on May 9th 1945 They were soon overpowered and the Independent State of Croatia effectively ceased to exist in May 1945 near the end of the war The advance of Titos partisan forces joined by the Soviet Red Army caused mass retreat of the Ustae towards Austria

In May 1945 a large column composed of Ustaa followers and NDH Army troops and civilians retreated from the partisan forces heading northwest towards Italy and Austria Ante Paveli detached from the group and fled to Austria Italy and finally Argentina The rest of the group consisting of over 150000 soldiers and civilians negotiated passage with the British forces on the Austrian side of the Austrian Slovenian border The British Army then turned over a number of them to the partisan forces

The end of the war resulted in the establishment of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia officially making Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina one of six constituent republics in the new state

The Herald Sun is the biggest selling daily newspaper in Australia It sells about 515000 copies each day and is read by 1500000 people

The Herald Sun newspaper was formed in 1990 when the morning tabloid paper The Sun News Pictorial joined with the afternoon broadsheet paper The Herald It was first published on 8 October 1990 as the Herald Sun The hyphen in its title was dropped on May 1 1993

The Sun News Pictorial began on 11 September 1922 and bought by The Herald and Weekly Times in 1925

The Herald once sold almost 600000 copies but by the time of its 150th anniversary in 1990 it had fallen below 20000 This was caused by the impact of evening television news and more people using cars to get home from workThis was much less than that of the morning Sun

As a result The Herald and Weekly Times decided to merge the two and so after one hundred and fifty years ten months and two days of publication The Herald was published for the last time as a separate newspaper on 5 October 1990 The next day The Sun News Pictorial published its last edition The Sunday editions of the two newspapers had already been merged The resulting newspaper had both the size and style of The Sun News Pictorial

With sales still falling the afternoon edition was cancelled the last edition being published on December 21 2001 The News Limited now produces mX a free afternoon paper that can be picked up from stands throughout the Melbourne CBD It is not available outside that area

Religious Taoism is a system of belief that first showed up in writing in China about 2000 years ago People do not always write about their religions at first so this religion may be much older In it people do things somewhat like what people do in Shamanism They also have gods that take over a person to be able to talk to humans and answer their questions The total number of books in this religion is huge It is bigger than the Encyclopedia Britannica Among these books are Lao Zis Dao De Jing the Zhuang Zi and many other books by the teachers of Philosophical Daoism 

People who follow this religion believe that doing something with words thoughts symbolic actions etc can make things in the real world change That idea is hard to understand Here is an example There is an old story that says China was once covered by a flood The world was saved from the flood by Y who had only one leg that worked Y went to different parts of China in a special order and he dug ditches to let the flood water go into the ocean When something very bad happens in the world a Daoist priest can go to the Daoist temple and act out what Y did and just doing that will make the world get fixed

Daoist priests do many other things For instance they can use fire and noise to scare demons away They can do things to cure sickness They can perform funerals and help keep the new ghosts safe from harm

Ulster Scots are an ethnic group in Ireland descended from Lowland Scots and English from the border of those two countries were Border Reivers These people first began to occupy Ireland in large numbers with the Plantation of Ulster ordered by James I of England on land taken from the Irish nobility mostly in the Province of Ulster The term Ulster Scots refers to both these colonists of the 17th century and less commonly to the Gallowglass who began to arrive from what is now northwest Scotland centuries earlier

Ulster Scots were largely descended from colonists from Galloway Ayrshire and the Scottish Borders Country although some descend from people further north in the Scottish Lowlands and the Highlands Ulster Scots emigrated in significant numbers to the United States and all corners of the British Empire Canada Australia New Zealand South Africa and to a lesser extent to Argentina and Chile in South America 

Scotch Irish is a traditional term for Ulster Scots who later emigrated to what is now the United States Scots Irish is a more recent form of the American term the term has usually been Scotch Irish in America as evident in Merriam Webster dictionaries where the term Scotch Irish is recorded from 1744 while Scots Irish is not recorded until 1972 and is not to be confused with Irish Scots ie recent Irish immigrants to Scotland

The Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of JerusalemtagrefFor use in Canada in accordance with the countrys policy of official bilingualismgroupnnameLingo is a royal order of chivalry established in 1831 and found today throughout the Commonwealth of Nations Hong Kong Ireland and the United States of America Its world wide mission is to prevent and relieve sickness and injury and to act to enhance the health and well being of people anywhere in the world It is often simply called the Order of St John or as the Venerable Order of Saint John to distinguish it from other similarly named orders

The Order is not related to the Knights Hospitaler a mediaeval order which was also dedicated to St JOhn

The orders approximately 25000 confrres supported by 4000 employees and 250000 volunteers are mainly of Protestant denominations though those of other Christian denominations or other religions are accepted into the order and honorary membership is presented to distinguished adherents of other religions Membership in the order is by invitation only except via appointment to certain government or ecclesiastical offices in some realms People may not petition for admission It is perhaps best known through its service organizations St John Ambulance and St John Eye Hospital Group the memberships and work of which are not limited to any denomination or religion

The original order was divided into langues These were groups based on the tongue or language that the group spoke

The Order of St Johns biggest leap forward came in 1888 when Queen Victoria granted the society a royal charter yet again renaming the order this time as the Grand Priory of the Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem in England This was altered in 1926 to the Grand Priory in the British Realm of the Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem and then in 1936 as the Grand Priory in the British Realm of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem In 1961 it played a role in the establishment of the Alliance of the Orders of St John of Jerusalem and thereafter finally received through a concordat in 1963 collateral recognition by the Order of Malta The most recent royal charter was issued in 1955 with a supplemental charter released in 1974 recognizing the world wide scope of the organization by setting its present name In 1999 the order was granted special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council

The reigning monarch of each of the Commonwealth realms is the Sovereign Head of the Order of St John 

Knights and Dames receive the award from the Grand Prior when they are touched on the shoulder with a sword and are given their robes and insignia Post nominal letters of the order are not used outside the organization itself and a Knight and Dame may not use the prefix sir or dameCitation neededdateNovember 2010 though they may request from their local heraldic authority a personal coats of arms should they not already possess any and have it adorned with emblems of the Order of St John Further membership in the order only grants precedence within the society which is as follows

Precedence within each grade is dictated by dates of appointment save for those in Grade I who are either a head of state or a member of the royal family of a Commonwealth realm another Commonwealth country or foreign state in which case they all precede the other members of the grade in the following order

Following constitutional changes made in 1999 the Priory of England and The Islands was established alongside the existing Priories of Wales Scotland Canada Australia New Zealand South Africa and since 1996 the United States each of which is governed by a Prior and a Priory Chapter Commanderies governed by a Knight or Dame Commander and a Commandery Chapter may exist within or wholly or partly without the territory of a Priory known as Dependent or Independent Commanderies respectively Any country without a Priory or Commandery of its own is assumed into the home priory of England and The Islands many of these being smaller Commonwealth of Nations states in which the order has only a minor presencetagrefThose countries with Associations of the Order of St John are Antigua and Barbuda Barbados Bermuda Cyprus Dominica Fiji Ghana Gibraltar Grenada Guyana Hong Kong India Jamaica Kenya Malawi Malaysia Malta Mauritius Montserrat Namibia Nigeria Pakistan Papua New Guinea Saint Lucia Singapore Solomon Islands Sri Lanka Swaziland Tanzania Trinidad and Tobago Uganda Zambia and ZimbabwegroupnnameAssociation

The Order of St John is said to have arrived in Canada in 1648 as the second Governor of New France Charles de Montmagny was a member of the original order but it was not until 1883 that the first branch of the modern organization was established in the country at Quebec City growing to 12 branches by 1892 The Order of St John today forms part of the Canadian national honours system and the Priory established in 1946 out of the Commandery of Canada is the largest outside of the United Kingdom with some 6000 members The Canadian monarchs viceroy the governor general serves as the Prior and Chief Officer in Canada while the provincial viceroys the lieutenant governors act as the Vice Priors overseeing the administration of the order in their respective province These individuals thus automatically become Knights or Dames of Justice or Grace upon their swearing into viceregal office

An American Society of the Order of St John was established in 1957 as a foundation to assist the order with charitable work after 1961 focusing its efforts specifically on the St John Ophthalmic Hospital in Jerusalem and some other organizations aiding the sick This branch was successful enough that Queen Elizabeth II in 1996 officially created the Priory of the United States of America the seventh priory at the time with John R Drexel as the first Prior By late 2000 the US priory had approximately 1100 members As citizens of a country that did not have the sovereignty of the Order of St John vested in its head of state American inductees who first joined the new Priory were specifically asked to only pay due obedience to the governing authorities of the order in all things consistent with your duty to your own country thus eliminating any question of loyalty to a foreign head of state superseding American postulants duties as US citizens

The Sovereign makes all appointments to the order as she in her absolute discretion shall think fit though the constitution does impose certain limitations the maximum number of members is set at 35000 

To be inducted new members must recite the organizations declaration

Notwithstanding the orders devotion to Christian ideals of charity and its official position that the order has a Christian character its Grand Council has since 1999 affirmed that profession of the Christian Faith should not be a condition of membership of the Order The issue of the orders Christian character and the issue of inclusive membership was dealt with in the Grand Councils Pro Fide Report in 2005 wherein it was said that the orders life is shaped by Christian faith and values but that rather than the emphasis being primarily upon spiritual beliefs or doctrine it is on works of mercy rendered through St John therefore while the Great Officers are required to profess the Christian faith the same is not an essential condition of membership and the onus is on the man or woman who is invited to the privilege of membership to decide whether he or she can with a good conscience promise to be faithful to the stated aims and purposes of this Christian lay order of chivalry On the subject of inclusive membership the report stated Christian hospitality is a criterion which can be applied to the Orders relationships to persons of other religious faiths and the Order needs to be characterized by a hospitable disposition towards other faith traditions while holding fast to its own origins and foundational identity in Christian faith

As the Order of St John is open to the citizens of sixteen different countries each with their own system of orders decorations and medals the orders place of precedence varies from country to country Unlike with other multi level orders all the Order of St Johns grades rank between the societys predecessor and successor some examples follow

Jasenovac concentration camp was the largest extermination and concentration camp in the Independent State of Croatia during World War II The camp was established by the Ustae regime in August 1941 and dismantled in April 1945 In Jasenovac the largest number of victims were ethnic Serbs seen as the main racial enemy of the ISC The camp also held Jews Roma and a number of Yugoslav Partisans 

Jasenovac was a complex of five sub camps covering over convert240km2sqmiabbron on both banks of the Sava river The largest camp was at Jasenovac about convert100kmmiabbron southeast of Zagreb The complex included large grounds at Donja Gradina directly across the Sava river a Sisak childrens concentration camp in Sisak and a Stara Gradika concentration camp 

There were three legal orders of the ISC

These orders were enforced through the regular court system and through new special courts and mobile courts martial with extended jurisdiction In July 1941 when existing jails could no longer contain the growing number of new inmates the Ustae government began clearing the ground for what would become the Jasenovac concentration camp

The Independent State of Croatia was created and supported by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy It thus adopted their racial and political doctrines Jasenovac had a role in the Nazi final solution it was also used however in the ethnic cleansing of Romany and Serbian inhabitants  The Nazi institutions that directed the Ustaes death camps were

The Jasenovac complex was built between August 1941 and February 1942 The first two camps Krapje and Broica were closed in November 1941 

The three newer camps continued to function until the end of the war

The camp was constructed managed and supervised by Department III of the Ustaka Narodna Sluba or UNS a special police force of the ISC Vjekoslav Maks Luburi was head of the UNS Individuals managing the camp at different times included Miroslav Majstorovi and Dinko aki 

The Ustae interned tortured and executed men women and children in Jasenovac The largest number of victims were Serbs but other victims included Jews Bosnian MuslimsGypsies and Croatian resistance members opposed to the regime Upon arrival at the camp the prisoners were marked with colors similar to the use of Nazi concentration camp badges blue for Serbs and red for communists while Gypsies had no marks Most victims were killed at execution sites near the camp Granik Gradina and other places Those kept alive were mostly skilled at needed professions and trades and were employed in services and workshops at Jasenovac 

The living conditions in the camp evidenced the severity typical in Nazi death camps a meager diet deplorable accommodations and cruel behavior by the Ustae guards Also as in many camps conditions would be improved temporarily during visits by delegations   such as the press delegation that visited in February 1942 and a Red Cross delegation in June 1944  and reverted after the delegation left

Most of the executions of Jews at Jasenovac occurred prior to August 1942 Thereafter the ISC started to deport them to the Auschwitz concentration camp In general Jews were initially sent to Jasenovac from all parts of Croatia after being gathered in Zagreb and from Bosnia and Herzegovina after being gathered in Sarajevo Some however were transported directly to Jasenovac from other cities and smaller towns

In the late summer of 1942 tens of thousands of Serbian villagers were sent to Jasenovac from the Kozara mountain area where ISC forces were fighting against the Yugoslav Partisans Most of the men were killed at Jasenovac but women were sent to forced labor in Germany Children were taken from their mothers and either killed or dispersed to Catholic orphanages 

On the night of August 29 1942 the prison guards made bets among themselves as to who could liquidate the largest number of inmates One of the guards Petar Brzica reportedly cut the throats of about 1360 new arrivals with a butcher knife that became known as srbosjek Other participants who confessed to participating in the bet included Ante Zrinui who killed some 600 inmates and Mile Friganovi who gave a detailed and consistent report of the incident Friganovi admitted to having killed 1100 inmates He specifically recounted his torture of an old man named Vukasin he attempted to make the man bless Ante Paveli which the old man refused to do although Friganovi cut off his ears nose and tongue after each refusal Ultimately he cut out the old mans eyes tore out his heart and slashed his throat This incident was witnessed by Dr Nikola Nikoli

Besides sporadic killings and deaths due to the poor living conditions many inmates arriving at Jasenovac were scheduled for systematic liquidation An important criterion for selection was the duration of a prisoners anticipated detention Strong men capable of labor and sentenced to less than 3 years of incarceration were allowed to live All inmates with indeterminate sentences or sentences of 3 years or more were immediately scheduled for liquidation regardless of their fitness

Systematic extermination varied both as to place and form Some of the executions were mechanical following Nazi methodology while others were manual The mechanical means of extermination included

Manual methods the Ustaes favorites were liquidation that took part in utilizing sharp or blunt craftsmen tools knives saws hammers and et cetera These liquidations took place in various locations

In April 1945 as Yugoslav Partisans units approached the camp the Ustae camp supervisors attempted to erase traces of the bad things they did by working the death camp at full capacity On April 22 600 prisoners revolted 520 were killed and 80 escaped Before abandoning the camp shortly after the prisoner revolt the Ustae killed the remaining prisoners blasted and destroyed the buildings guardhouses torture rooms the Picili Furnace and the other structures Upon entering the camp the partisans found only ruins soot smoke and dead bodies

During the following months of 1945 the grounds of Jasenovac were thoroughly destroyed by prisoners of war The Allied forces captured 200 to 600 Croatian Home Guard members Laborers completed destruction of the camp leveling the site and dismantling the two kilometer long four meter high wall that surrounded it

Historians have had difficulty calculating the number of victims at Jasenovac Estimates of total deaths range from tens of thousands of deaths which is the most commonly cited contemporary figure to hundreds of thousands which was the most common estimate prior to the 1990s

The estimates vary due to lack of accurate records the methods used for making estimates and sometimes the political biases of the estimators In some cases entire families were exterminated leaving no one to submit their names to the lists On the other hand it has been found that the lists include the names of people who died elsewhere whose survival was not reported to the authorities or who are counted more than once on the lists

The Yad Vashem center claims that over 500000 Serbs were killed in the ISC including those who were killed at Jasenovac where approximately 600000 victims of all ethnicities were killed The same figures are concluded by the Simon Wiesentahl center According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum also citated in quote by the Jewish virtual library the victim figures are as follows 

The documentation from the time of Jasenovac revolves around the different sides in the battle for Yugoslavia The Germans and Italians on the one hand and the Partisans on the other There are also sources originating from the documentation of the Ustae themselves and of the Vatican These sources are in times considered contemporary because German and Ustae sources tend to exaggerate but the comparison of all different sources can give a reliable portrayt of the historical truth 

German generals issued reports of the number of victims as the war progressed German military commanders gave different figures for the number of Serbs Jews and others killed on the territory of the Independent State of Croatia They circulated figures of 400000 Serbs 350000 Serbs around 300000 in 1943 600 700000 until March 1944 700000 Hermann Neubacher calculates A third must become Catholic a third must leave the country and a third must die This last point of their program was accomplished When prominent Ustasha leaders claimed that they slaughtered a million Serbs that is in my opinion a boastful exaggeration On the basis of the reports submitted to me I believe that the number of defenseless victims slaughtered to be three quarters of a million 

Italian generals who were more overwhelmed by the atrocious Ustae slaughter also reported of similar figures to their commanders The Vaticans sources also speak of similar figures Eg of 350000 Serbs slaughtered by the end of 1942 and over 500000 people at all

The Ustae themselves gave more exaggerated assumptions of the number of people they killed Vjekoslav Maks Luburi commander in chief of all the Croatian camps announced the great efficiency of the Jasenovac camp at a ceremony on October 9 1942 During the banquet which followed he reported with pride We have slaughtered here at Jasenovac more people than the Ottoman Empire was able to do during its occupation of Europe Although the account may appear somewhat exaggerated its truthfulness can be found in several other Ustaee accounts A circular of the Ustae general headquarters that reads the concentration and labor camp in Jasenovac can receive an unlimited number of internees In the same spirit Miroslav Filipovic Majstorovic once captured by Yugoslav forces admitted in an attempt to somewhat minimize the rate of crimes committed in Jasenovac that during his three months of administration 20000 to 30000 people died whereas in other sources it is displayed as 40000

A report of the National Committee of Croatia for the investigation of the crimes of the occupation forces and their collaborators dated November 15 1945 which was commissioned by the new government of Yugoslavia under Tito stated that 500000 600000 people were killed at the Jasenovac complex These figures were cited by researcher Israel Gutman in the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust by the Simon Wiesenthal Center and others

Logically the number of casualties in Jasenovac is affected by several factors

Additionally crematories were constructed in Jasenovac as back as January 1942 due to difficulties of burial thus implying the massive death rate at hand there The same goes for gassing that also took place in Stara Gradiska later that year in both chambers and vans

Some of the camp officials and their post war fate are listed below

The Jasenovac Memorial Museum was temporarily abandoned during the Yugoslav wars In November 1991 Simo Brdar a former associate director of the Memorial collected the documentation from the museum and brought it to Bosnia and Herzegovina Brdar kept the documents until 2001 when he transferred them to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with the help of SFOR and the government of Republika Srpska 

The New York City Parks Department the Holocaust Park Committee and the Jasenovac Research Institute with the help of US Congressman Anthony Weiner established a public monument to the victims of Jasenovac in April 2005 Ten Yugoslavian Holocaust survivors were there as well as diplomats from Serbia Bosnia and Israel It remains the only public monument to Jasenovac victims outside of the Balkans Annual commemorations are held there every April

A Yew is a coniferous tree The name is most used for species of the genus Taxus or for other members of the coniferous family Taxaceae

All species of yew contain highly poisonous alkaloids known as taxanes All parts of the tree except the arils contain the alkaloid 

The arils are edible and sweet but the seeds are dangerously poisonous Unlike birds the human stomach can break down the seed coat and release the taxanes into the body This can have fatal results if yew berries are eaten without removing the seeds first 

The seeds and leaves will kill cattle and horses but deer can break down the poisons and will eat yew foliage freely In the wild deer browsing of yews is often so extensive that wild yew trees are often restricted to cliffs and steep slopes inaccessible to deer The foliage is also eaten by the larvae of some Lepidopteran insects including Willow Beauty

Yews are slow growing and can be very long lived and reach heights of 1 40 m with trunk diameters of up to 4 m They have reddish bark spear shaped flat dark green leaves 1 4 cm long and 2 3 mm broad arranged spirally on the stem but with the leaf bases twisted to align the leaves in two flat rows either side of the stem

The seed cones are highly modified each cone containing a single seed 4 7 mm long partly surrounded by a modified scale which develops into a soft bright red berry like structure called an aril 8 15 mm long and wide and open at the end 

The arils are mature 6 9 months after pollination and are eaten by thrushes waxwings and other birds which disperse the hard seeds undamaged in their droppings 

The male cones are round 3 6 mm diameter and shed their pollen in early spring Yews are mostly dioecious but occasional individuals can be variably monoecious or change sex with time

All of the yews are very closely related to each other and often described together as Taxus baccata 

Wichita Falls is a city in Wichita Couty Texas United States The population of Wichita Falls was 107000 in 2006 The mayors of Wichita Falls are Glenn Barham Linda Ammons Michael Smith Dorothy Roberts Burns Rick Hatcher Tim Ingle and Mary Ward Wichita Falls was founded on Sept 27 1872 when the Choctaw Indians settled the area in the early 18th century and then white settlers arrived in the 1860s to form cattle ranches

Diastole is the time during a heart beat when the heart fills with blood after a contraction The contraction of the heart is called systole and is the opposite of diastole The term diastole comes from the Greek word This means expanding or opening

There are two types of diastole 

During ventricular diastole the pressure in the ventricles drops When the pressure in the left ventricle becomes lower than the pressure in the left atrium the mitral valve opens The blood then flows from the atrium into the ventricle The speed at which the blood flows into the ventricles can be used to diagnose diastolic dysfunction

Because the heart relaxes during diastole diastolic pressure is the lowest pressure within the arterial blood stream during each heart beat The highest arterial pressure happens when the heart muscle contracts and is called systolic pressure

When blood pressure is measured for medical purposes diastolic pressure is the second number in the ratio of systolic to diastolic pressure for example 12080 

Systole is the time during a heart beat when the left ventricle contracts 

During systole the heart muscle contracts in response to a complex electrical stimulus generated automatically by the body This makes the blood flow out of the heart and into the body and lungs 

There are two phases

In the first phase the top chambers of the heart the atria contract This is called atrial systole They pump the blood down to the larger lower ventricle chambers of the heart 

When the lower chambers are filled and the valves to the atria are closed the ventricles contract This is the second phase and is called ventricular systole Blood is pumped out of the heart to the body from the left ventricle and to the lungs from the right ventricle as seen in the diagram to the right This phase is the origin of the pulse

Because the heart muscle contracts during systole Systolic pressure is the highest pressure within the arterial blood stream during each heart beat The lowest arterial pressure happens when the heart muscle relaxes and is called diastolic pressure

When blood pressure is measured for medical purposes systolic pressure is the first number in the ratio of systolic to diastolic pressure for example 12080

A psychoactive drug psychopharmaceutical or psychotropic is a chemical substance that crosses the blood brain barrier It action affects the central nervous system It can affect the brain and change perception mood consciousness cognition and behaviour Such substances can be taken for medical reasons Sometimes they are also used in rituals or as illegeal drugs These drugs enable their users to change their consciousness This can also help students when they are preparing their examinations Certain therapies also use such subtances 

Psychoactive substances change the consciousness and mood of their user The people using them may have pleasant feelings such as euphoria or they may be more alert For this reason may psychoactive substances are abused They are used outside the aims of the treatment This may lead to the user developing a psychological and physical dependence It will get more difficult to interrupt the cycle of abuse Drug rehabilitation aims to break this cycle of dependency this is done with psychotherapy support groups and even other psychoactive substances Acamprosate or naltrexone are examples of substances used to treat alcoholism methadone or buprenorphine maintenance therapy in the case of opioid dependency However the reverse is also true in some cases that is certain experiences on drugs may be so unfriendly and uncomforting that the user may never want to try the substance again This is especially true of the deliriants and dissociatives

In part because of this potential for abuse and dependency the ethics of drug use are the subject of a continuing philosophical debate Many governments worldwide have placed restrictions on drug production and sales in an attempt to decrease drug abuse Ethical concerns have also been raised about over use of these drugs clinically and about their marketing by manufacturers

Christian metal also known as white metal is a form of heavy metal music music which a Christian band makes to praise Jesus Christ Christian metal is typically performed by professed Christians sometimes principally for Christians who listen to heavy metal music and produced and distributed through various Christian networks

Christian metal bands exist in all the subgenres of heavy metal music and the only common link between most Christian metal bands are the lyrics The Christian themes are often melded with the subjects of the genre the band is rooted in regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter It has been argued that the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive alternative or counterbalance to secular metal music which is known for its generally dark and negative message

Christian metal emerged in the late 1970s as a means of evangelism to the wider heavy metal music scene and was pioneered by the American Resurrection Band and Swedish Jerusalem Los Angeles Stryper achieved wide success in the 1980s otherwise the genre was mostly ignored by the mainstream Californias Tourniquet and Australias Mortification led the movement in the 1990s The metalcore groups Underoath Demon Hunter As I Lay Dying and Norma Jean brought some mainstream attention to the movement in the first decade of the 21st century achieving ranks in the Billboard 200

Jerusalem is a Swedish Christian rock band founded in 1975 by Ulf Christiansson It was one of the first bands to combine Christian lyrics with a hard rock sound

Jerusalems message was primarily aimed at youth with their lyrics describing the bands relationship to God in an ordinary but radical way The bands purpose was expressly evangelistic Their concerts have been described as a series of revival meetings which often included altar calls and occasionally exorcismsWhen the band first toured in the mid 1970s in Sweden their combination of Christian lyrics with a hard rock sound was very controversial The band was only permitted to perform at a few churches

For albums released in both Swedish and English versions the English titles are in parentheses

Bohuslav Martin was a Czech composer He wrote an enormous amount of music including six symphonies 15 operas 14 ballet scores and many orchestral chamber vocal and instrumental works His music is often inspired by his native country

Martin was born in the tower of a village church and that is where he spent the first seven years of his life away from the rest of the world When he was old enough to go to school he had to climb the 193 steps down to the street every day He started to have violin lessons from the local tailor He was very shy because he was used to being all by himself with his family in the tower but he made good progress and in 1905 gave his first violin recital

Martin soon started to compose music and nothing else interested him very much He went to the Prague Conservatory to study the violin but he preferred going to the theatre and reading In 1909 he changed to the organ school but he did no work and was expelled from school

He managed to avoid fighting in the World War I by composing After the war he became a member of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra playing second violin

In 1923 he moved to Paris where he stayed for 17 years He was very poor He had some lessons with Albert Roussel and soon became known as a composer He married in 1931 and his wife worked hard to earn money so that he could spend his time composing He liked to use Czech folk stories and literature as inspiration for his music

In 1940 he had to leave Paris to escape from the Nazis He spent several months living rough often sleeping on stationplatforms In March 1941 he and his wife managed to get to New York

Life in the United States was hard for him He spoke no English and people there did not know his music He had left all his scores behind However he worked hard and the famous conductor Sergei Koussevitsky asked him to write a symphony His music still sounded very Czech After World War II he very much wanted to go back to his own country but the communist government made that impossible He had a bad fall and it took him years to recover properly He taught at Princeton University then he retired to Nice in France He died of cancer in Basle

Bohuslav Martin wrote a lot of music He loved sitting down and writing music Once he had finished a composition he was never very interested in hearing it performed or what happened to it As a result some of his music is very good but some of it is less interesting One of his last works was called eck Paije which uses Greek folk melody and church chant He was never influenced by American music he preferred the modes folktunes bagpipe drones and mountain calls of his native country His music can often be described as neoclassical in style

The Sparassodonts were an order of carnivorous Metatherian mammals They are all now extinct

The Sparassodonta is native to South America They were once considered to be true marsupials but are now thought to be a sister taxon to them 

A number of these mammalian predators closely resemble placental predators that evolved separately in Eurasia They were first described by Florentino Ameghino from fossils found in the Santa Cruz beds of Patagonia

Members of the order Sparassodonta showed many similarities with placental carnivora but they were not closely related They are a very good example of convergent evolution 

For example sparassodont molars were similar to the meat slicing teeth of modern cats The canines were also lengthened and in some cases such as Thylacosmilus resemble those of saber toothed cats like Smilodon Their body size varied ranging from 80 cm long to the size of todays modern big cats

Another family of large predators wrere the borhyaenids which were more like wolves or dogs

A dental formula is a summary of a mammals teeth

Almost all mammals have four kinds of teeth

Teeth numbers and form have adapted to different feeding methods Over time different mammal groups have evolved distinct dental features in the number and type of teeth and in the shape and size of the chewing surface

The number of teeth of each type is written as a dental formula for one side of the mouth or quadrant with the upper and lower teeth shown on separate rows The number of teeth in a mouth is twice that listed as there are two sides 

In each set incisors are indicated first canines second premolars third and finally molars giving ICPM So for example the formula 2123 for upper teeth indicates 2 incisors 1 canine 2 premolars and 3 molars on one side of the upper mouth 

The deciduous dental formula is notated in lowercase lettering preceded by the letter d eg didcdm An animals dentition for either deciduous or permanent teeth can thus be expressed as a dental formula written in the form of a fraction ICPM ICPM

Since the teeth are always listed in the same order the letters can be dropped thus

The modern diet known as the Paleolithic diet also called the caveman diet Stone Age diet and hunter gatherer diet is a way of eating It is based on the wild plants and animals that it is thought that the human species ate during the Paleolithic era This was a period about 25 million years long that ended around 10000 years ago when people began farming The term Paleolithic diet can also refer to what people actually ate back then instead of the diet today Meat fish vegetables fruit roots and nuts make up most of the modern Paleolithic diet It does not include grains legumes dairy products salt refined sugar and processed oils

Walter L Voegtlin first made the modern Paleolithic diet popular in the 1970s Authors and researchers recommended and changed the diet in several books and academic journals Paleolithic nutrition is based on the idea in evolution that modern humans are genetically adapted to the way their Paleolithic ancestors ate and that human genetics have not changed much since people began growing their own food Therefore a good way of eating today would be like how people ate then People who say this diet is good say that people today who eat food like of Paleolithic hunter gatherers do not have as many diseases and that two studies of the Paleolithic diet in humans have shown good things for peoples health

This way of eating is controversial among nutritionists and anthropologists People who do not think this is a good way of eating have argued that if hunter gatherer societies did not suffer from certain diseases this was because they ate food with fewer calories or for other reasons Some researchers do not think the reason for the diet makes sense They disagree with parts of the diet and think that they do not help peoples health or could even be bad for health They also say it may not be how people really ate in the Paleolithic era

A doctor Walter L Voegtlin was one of the first people to say that following a diet similar to that of the Paleolithic era might make a persons health better In 1975 he published a book in which he argued that humans are carnivorous animals and that the ancestral Paleolithic diet was that of a carnivorechiefly fats and protein with only small amounts of carbohydrates His ideas came from the way he treated things such as colitis Crohns disease and indigestion

In 1985 S Boyd Eaton and Melvin Konner both from Emory University published an important paper on Paleolithic nutrition in the New England Journal of Medicine which made more people know about the idea Three years later S Boyd Eaton Marjorie Shostak and Melvin Konner published a book about this way of eating The book was about having the same proportions of fat protein and carbohydrates vitamins and minerals as people near the end of the Paleolithic era ate The book did not say that people should not eat foods that were not available before people started farming such as skimmed milk whole grain bread brown rice and potatoes prepared without fat In 1989 these authors published a second book on Paleolithic nutrition

Starting in 1989 Swedish medical doctor and scientist Staffan Lindeberg did scientific studies of people living on Kitava one of the Trobriand Islands of Papua New Guinea These studies called the Kitava Study found that these people apparently did not suffer from stroke ischemic heart disease diabetes obesity or hypertension Starting with the first publication in 1993 the Kitava Study has led to science writings on whether diseases in Western countries are caused by what people eat In 2003 Lindeberg wrote a Swedish language medical textbook on the subject In 2010 this book was changed updated and published for the first time in English The 2010 book is written for both experts and regular people and uses science to say that people should use the Paleolithic diet

Foods that can be hunted and fished such as meat offal and seafood and that can be gathered such as eggs insects fruit nuts seeds vegetables mushrooms herbs and spices make up the Paleolithic diet Some books say that people doing the Paleolithic diet should only eat lean cuts of meat without food additives and that meats from wild animals and beef from cattle that ate grass are best because they have more omega 3 fats than with grain produced domestic meats They dont eat food that they dont think was eaten before people began farming This includes grains legumes dairy products salt refined sugar and processed oils Some supporters think they can use cooking oils with low omega 6 or omega 3 ratios such as olive oil and canola oil because it is healthy People following a Paleolithic diet mostly drink water although some also drink tea Alcoholic and fermented beverages are not part of the diet Also eating many different types of plant food is recommended Unlike raw food diets all foods may be cooked However there are also raw paleolithic dieters who believe that humans have not changed to be able to handle cooked foods and so they eat only foods which are both raw and paleolithic

According to some supporters of the Paleolithic diet people following the diet should get about 5665 of their food energy from animal foods and 3645 from plant foods They recommend a diet with much protein and few carbohydrates with about the same amount of fats in regular Western diets

According to S Boyd Eaton we are the heirs of inherited characteristics accrued over millions of years the vast majority of our biochemistry and physiology are tuned to life conditions that existed before the advent of agriculture some 10000 years ago Genetically our bodies are virtually the same as they were at the end of the Paleolithic era some 20000 years ago

Ideas about paleolithic nutrition come from evolutionary biology The reason for eating like this is that natural selection had enough time for Paleolithic humans bodies and metabolisms to get used to the food that they could eat then But in the 10000 years since people started farming natural selection has not had enough time for peoples genetics to change to get used to the new diet This has led to some diseases

More than 70 of the total daily energy consumed by all people in the United States comes from foods such as dairy products cereals refined sugars refined vegetable oils and alcohol that Paleolithic supporters say were not eaten during the Paleolithic era Supporters say that eating too many of these foods is why so many people have cardiovascular disease high blood pressure type 2 diabetes osteoporosis and cancer and are obese in the US and other Western countries today However there is evidence that Paleolithic societies may have been using cereals for food use at least as early as 23000 years ago more than 100000 years ago and perhaps as early as 200000 years ago However Loren Cordain has said that the new evidence shows that grains were not eaten much back then and he has also said that eating of wild grass seeds of any kind needs technology and processing to make the food possible to eat and that this technology was probably not around 105000 years ago

Not everybody agrees with evolutionary reasons behind the Paleoithic diet According to Alexander Strhle Maike Wolters and Andreas Hahn with the Department of Food Science at the University of Hanover saying the human genome evolved during the Pleistocene is not based on the right beliefs about evolution They also say that 10000 years may have been enough time for people to adapt to diets with food grown through farming For example alleles that helped people eat dairy became common in Europe just a few thousand years after people started raising animals There is also evidence that the diet of Stone Age humans may have had some form the refined starches and grains that are not part of the paleolithic diet A 2010 study showed the discovery of a 30000 year old mortar and pestle from which flour of several plants were isolated

The Palearctic ecozone is one of the eight dividing the Earths surface

The Palearctic is by far the largest ecozone It includes the terrestrial ecoregions of Europe Asia north of the Himalayan foothills northern Africa and the northern and central parts of the Arabian Peninsula 

The Palearctic ecozone includes mostly boreal and temperate climate ecoregions which run across Eurasia from western Europe to the Bering Strait

The boreal and temperate Euro Siberian region is the Palearctics largest biogeographic region which transitions from tundra in the northern reaches of Russia and Scandinavia to the vast taiga the boreal coniferous forests which run across the continent South of the taiga are a belt of temperate broadleaf and mixed forests and temperate coniferous forests This vast Euro Siberian region has many shared plant and animal species and many similarities with the temperate and boreal regions of the Nearctic of North America 

Eurasia and North America were often connected by the Bering land bridge and have very similar mammal and bird fauna with many Eurasian species having moved into North America and fewer North American species having moved into Eurasia 

Many zoologists consider the Palearctic and Nearctic to be a single Holarctic ecozone The Palearctic and Nearctic also share many plant species

The lands bordering the Mediterranean Sea in southern Europe north Africa and western Asia are home to the Mediterranean basin ecoregions which together constitute worlds largest and most diverse mediterranean climate region of the world with generally mild rainy winters and hot dry summers The Mediterranean basins mosaic of forests woodlands and scrub are home to 13000 endemic species Conservation International has designated the Mediterranean basin as one of the worlds biodiversity hotspots

A great belt of deserts including the Sahara desert and Arabian desert separates the Palearctic and Afrotropic ecoregions These desert ecoregions are included in the palearctic ecozone other biogeographers identify the ecozone boundary as the transition zone between the desert ecoregions and the Mediterranean basin ecoregions to the north This would place the deserts in the Afrotropic while others place the boundary through the middle of the desert

The Caucasus mountains which run between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea are a particularly rich mix of coniferous broadleaf and mixed forests and include some temperate rain forest

Central Asia and the Iranian plateau are home to dry steppe grasslands and desert basins with montane forests woodlands and grasslands in the regions high mountains and plateaux

The middle altitude foothills of the Himalaya between about 20002500 m form the boundary between the Palearctic and Indomalaya ecoregions

China Korea and Japan are more humid and temperate than adjacent Siberia and Central Asia and are home to rich temperate coniferous broadleaf and mixed forests These are now mostly limited to mountainous areas as the densely populated lowlands and river basins have been converted to intensive agricultural and urban use 

East Asia was not much affected by glaciation in the ice ages and retained 96 percent of Pliocene tree genera while Europe retained only 27 percent

The Holarctic ecozone refers to the habitats found throughout the northern continents of the world as a whole 

This region is divided into the Palearctic and the Nearctic The palearctic is Northern Africa and all of Eurasia with the exception of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent The Nearctic is North America north of southern Mexico 

These are further subdivided into a variety of ecoregions Many ecosystems and the animal and plant communities that depend on them are found across multiple continents in large portions of this ecozone 

The continuity of these ecosystems results from the shared glacial history of this ecozone Also during glacial periods mammal fauna was able to cross from Asia to North America via the Bering Strait 

Moodabidri is a town in India It is located in the Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka state It is 37 km away from the district headquarters Mangalore People there speak Tulu Konkani and Kannada

The Afrotropic is one of the Earths eight ecozones It is basically Africa south of the Sahara It was formerly known as the Ethiopian Zone

The zone includes southern and eastern fringes of the Arabian Peninsula the island of Madagascar southern Iran and extreme southwestern Pakistan and the islands of the western Indian Ocean 

Because Africa is a very large continent and runs northsouth acrsoss the equator the zone has many different climates and habitats

Most of the Afrotropic has a tropical climate A broad belt of deserts separate the Afrotropic from the Palearctic ecozone which includes northern Africa and temperate Eurasia

South of the Sahara two belts of tropical and subtropical grasslands savannas and shrublands run east and west across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ethiopian Highlands 

Immediately south of the Sahara lies the Sahel belt a transitional zone of semi arid short grassland and Acacia savanna 

Rainfall increases further south in the Sudan a belt of taller grasslands and savannas The Sudanian savanna is home to two great flooded grasslands and savannas the Sudd wetland in the Sudan and the Niger Inland Delta in Mali

South Arabia mostly Yemen and parts of western Oman and southwest Saudi Arabia has few permanent forests Otherwise woodlands scatter the land and are very small Juniper or Acacia forests

A belt of lowland tropical moist broadleaf forests runs across most of equatorial Africa 

The largest tropical forest zone in Africa are the forests of the Congo Basin in Central Africa A belt of tropical moist broadleaf forest also runs along the Indian Ocean coast from southern Somalia to South Africa

The Great Rift Valley gives East Africa its unique mix of deep lakes highlands volcanoes and grassland

Woodlands savannas grasslands and desert

Madagascar and neighboring islands form a distinctive sub region of the ecozone with numerous endemic taxa like the lemurs 

Madagascar and the Seychelles are old pieces of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana and broke away from it 150 million years ago In that sense it is not part of Africa and that explains why the advanced primates of Africa are not found in Madagascar Lemurs are found occupying more or less the same ecological niches

Other Indian ocean islands like the Comoros and Mascarene Islands are volcanic islands that formed more recently Madagascar contains several important biospheres as its Biodiversity and ratio of endemism is extremely high

Benedict Arnold V was a general during the American Revolutionary War He began the war in the Continental Army but later changed to the British Army While a general on the American side he became commander of the fort at West Point New York and plotted to surrender it to the British forces After the plot was exposed in September 1780 he was made a brigadier general in the British Army

Born in Connecticut Arnold was a merchant operating ships on the Atlantic Ocean when the war broke out in 1775 After joining the growing army outside Boston he distinguished himself through acts of cunning and bravery His actions included 

1775

1776

1777

In spite of successes Arnold was passed over for promotion by the Continental Congress while other officers claimed credit for some of his accomplishments Adversaries in military and political circles brought charges of corruption or other wrongdoing but he was acquitted in most formal inquiries Congress investigated his accounts and found that he owed it money after he had spent much of his own money on the war effort 

Frustrated and bitter Arnold decided to change sides in 1779 and opened secret negotiations with the British In July 1780 he asked for and got command of West Point in order to surrender it to the British Arnolds scheme was exposed when American forces captured British Major John Andr carrying papers that revealed the plot Upon learning of Andrs capture Arnold fled down the Hudson River to the British ship HMS Vulture He was almost captured by the forces of George Washington who had been alerted to the plot

Arnold got a commission as a brigadier general in the British Army an annual pension of 360 and a lump sum of over 6000 He led British forces on raids in Virginia and against New London and Groton Connecticut before the war effectively ended with the American victory at Yorktown In the winter of 1782 Arnold moved to London with his second wife Margaret Peggy Shippen Arnold He was well received by King George III and the Tories but frowned upon by the Whigs In 1787 he entered into mercantile business with his sons Richard and Henry in Saint John New Brunswick but returned to London to settle permanently in 1791 where he died ten years later

Because of the way he changed sides his name quickly became a byword in the United States for treason or betrayal His conflicting legacy is recalled in the ambiguous nature of some of the memorials that have been placed in his honour

Benedict was born the second of six children to Benedict Arnold III and Hannah Waterman King in Norwich Connecticut on January 14 1741 He was named after his great grandfather Benedict Arnold an early governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and his brother Benedict IV who died in infancy Only Benedict and his sister Hannah survived to adulthood his other brothers and sisters died of yellow fever in childhood Through his maternal grandmother Arnold was a descendant of John Lothropp an ancestor of at least four US presidents

Arnolds father was a successful businessman and the family moved in the upper levels of Norwich society When he was ten Arnold was sent to a private school in nearby Canterbury and was expected to go to Yale However the deaths of his siblings two years later may have contributed to a decline in the family fortunes since his father took up drinking By the time he was fourteen there was no money for private education His fathers alcoholism and ill health stopped him from training Arnold in the family business but his mothers family connections secured an apprenticeship for Arnold with two of her cousins brothers Daniel and Joshua Lathrop who operated a successful apothecary and general merchandise trade in Norwich  His apprenticeship with the Lathrops lasted seven years

In 1755 Arnold attracted by the sound of a drummer attempted to enlist in the provincial militia to fight in the French and Indian War but his mother refused permission In 1757 when he was sixteen he did enlist in the militia which marched off toward Albany and Lake George The French had besieged Fort William Henry and their Indian allies had committed atrocities after their victory Word of the sieges disastrous outcome led the company to turn around Arnold served for 13 days Some say that Arnold deserted in 1758 but there is no proof

Arnolds mother to whom he was very close died in 1759 His fathers alcoholism worsened after the death of his wife and the youth took on the responsibility of supporting his father and younger sister His father was arrested on several occasions for public drunkenness was refused communion by his church and eventually died in 1761

Helped by the Lathrops Arnold set himself up as a pharmacist and bookseller in New Haven Connecticut in 1762 Arnold was hardworking and successful and was able to expand his business In 1763 he repaid money borrowed from the Lathrops bought back the family homestead that his father had sold when deeply in debt and re sold it a year later for a substantial profit In 1764 he formed a partnership with Adam Babcock another young New Haven merchant Using the profits from the sale of his homestead they bought three trading ships and started trading with the West Indies During this time he brought his sister Hannah to New Haven to manage the apothecary business when he was absent He travelled a lot for his business throughout New England and from Quebec to the West Indies often in command of one of his own ships On one of his voyages Arnold fought a duel in Honduras with a British sea captain who had called him a damned Yankee destitute of good manners or those of a gentleman The captain was wounded after the first exchange of gunfire and apologized after Arnold threatened to aim to kill on the second

The Sugar Act of 1764 and the Stamp Act of 1765 limited trade in the colonies The latter act prompted Arnold to join the opposition to those taxes and also led him to join the Sons of Liberty a secret organization that was not afraid to use violence to oppose those and other unpopular Parliamentary measures At first Arnold took no part in any public demonstrations but like many merchants continued to trade as if the Stamp Act did not exist This meant he was a smuggler in defiance of the act Arnold also faced financial ruin He owed 16000 and some creditors spread rumours that he was bankrupt He took legal action against them On the night of 28 January 1767 Arnold and members of his crew watched by a crowd of Sons roughed up a man suspected of attempting to inform authorities of Arnolds smuggling Arnold was convicted of a disorderly conduct charge and fined the relatively small amount of 50 shillings publicity of the case and widespread sympathy for his view probably contributed to the light sentence

On 22 February 1767 he married Margaret Mansfield daughter of Samuel Mansfield the sheriff of New Haven an acquaintance that may have been made through the membership of both Mansfield and Arnold in the local Masonic Lodge Their first son Benedict VI was born the following year and was followed by brothers Richard in 1769 and Henry in 1772 Margaret died early in the revolution on 19 June 1775 while Arnold was still at Fort Ticonderoga The household even while she lived was dominated by Arnolds sister Hannah Arnold benefited from his relationship with Mansfield who became a partner in his business and used his position as sheriff to shield Arnold from creditors

Arnold was in the West Indies when the Boston Massacre took place on 5 March 1770 He wrote he was very much shocked and wondered good God are the Americans all asleep and tamely giving up their liberties or are they all turned philosophers that they dont take immediate vengeance on such miscreants

Arnold began the war when he was elected as a captain in Connecticuts militia in March 1775 After the start of fighting at Lexington and Concord the following month his company marched northeast to help at the siege of Boston that followed Arnold told the Massachusetts Committee of Safety of his idea to seize Fort Ticonderoga in New York which he knew was poorly defended They made him a colonel on 3 May 1775 and he immediately rode off to the west arriving at Castleton in the disputed New Hampshire Grants in time to join with Ethan Allen and his men in the capture of Fort Ticonderoga He followed up that action with a bold raid on Fort Saint Jean on the Richelieu River north of Lake Champlain When a Connecticut militia force arrived at Ticonderoga in June he had a dispute with its commander over control of the fort and resigned his Massachusetts commission He was on his way home from Ticonderoga when he learned that his wife died earlier in June

When the Second Continental Congress authorized an invasion of Quebec in part on the urging of Arnold he was passed over for command of the expedition Arnold then went to Cambridge Massachusetts and suggested to George Washington a second expedition to attack Quebec City via a wilderness route through present day Maine This expedition for which Arnold received a colonels commission in the Continental Army left Cambridge in September 1775 with 1100 men After a difficult passage in which 300 men turned back and another 200 died en route Arnold arrived before Quebec City in November Joined by Richard Montgomerys small army he took part in the assault on Quebec City on 31 December in which Montgomery was killed and Arnolds leg was shattered Rev Samuel Spring his chaplain carried him to the makeshift hospital at the Hotel Dieu Arnold who was promoted to brigadier general for his role in reaching Quebec maintained an ineffectual siege of the city until he was replaced by Major General David Wooster in April 1776 

Arnold then travelled to Montreal where he served as military commander of the city until forced to retreat by an advancing British army that had arrived at Quebec in May He commanded the rear of the Continental Army during its retreat from Saint Jean James Wilkinson said Arnold was the last person to leave before the British arrived He then directed the construction of a fleet to defend Lake Champlain which was defeated in the October 1776 Battle of Valcour Island His actions at Saint Jean and Valcour Island played a notable role in delaying the British advance against Ticonderoga until 1777

During these actions Arnold made a number of friends and a larger number of enemies within the army power structure and in Congress He had established decent relationships with George Washington commander of the army as well as Philip Schuyler and Horatio Gates both of whom had command of the armys Northern Department during 1775 and 1776 However a dispute with Moses Hazen commander of the 2nd Canadian Regiment boiled over into a court martial of Hazen at Ticonderoga during the summer of 1776 Only action by Gates then his superior at Ticonderoga prevented his own arrest on countercharges levelled by Hazen He had also had disagreements with John Brown and James Easton two lower level officers with political connections that resulted in ongoing suggestions of wrongdoing on his part Brown was particularly vicious publishing a handbill that claimed of Arnold Money is this mans God and to get enough of it he would sacrifice his country

General Washington sent Arnold to the defend Rhode Island after the British seized Newport in December 1776 where the militia was too poorly equipped to even consider an attack on the British Arnold was near his home so he took the opportunity to visit his children and he spent much of the winter socializing in Boston where he unsuccessfully courted a young belle named Betsy Deblois In February 1777 he learned that he had been passed over for promotion to major general by Congress Washington refused his offer to resign and wrote to members of Congress in an attempt to correct this noting that two or three other very good officers might be lost if they persisted in making politically motivated promotions Arnold was on his way to Philadelphia to discuss his future when he was alerted that a British force was marching toward a supply depot in Danbury Connecticut Along with David Wooster and Connecticut militia General Gold Selleck Silliman he organized the militia response In the Battle of Ridgefield he led a small contingent of militia attempting to stop or slow the British return to the coast and was again wounded in his left leg Arnold went on to Philadelphia where he met with members of Congress about his rank His action at Ridgefield coupled with the death of Wooster due to wounds sustained in the action resulted in Arnolds promotion to major general although his seniority was not restored over those who had been promoted before him Amid negotiations over that issue Arnold wrote out a letter of resignation on 11 July the same day word arrived in Philadelphia that Fort Ticonderoga had fallen to the British Washington refused his resignation and ordered him north to assist with the defence there

Arnold arrived in Schuylers camp at Fort Edward New York on 24 July On 13 August Schuyler dispatched him with a force of 900 to relieve the siege of Fort Stanwix where he used a trick to end the siege Arnold had an Indian messenger sent into the camp of British Brigadier General Barry St Leger with news that the approaching force was much larger and closer than it actually was this convinced St Legers Indian support to abandon him forcing him to give up the effort

Arnold then returned to the Hudson where General Gates had taken over command of the American army which had by then retreated to a camp south of Stillwater He then distinguished himself in both Battles of Saratoga even though General Gates following a series of escalating disagreements and disputes that culminated in a shouting match removed him from field command after the first battle During the fighting in the second battle Arnold against Gates orders took to the battlefield and led attacks on the British defences He was again severely wounded in the left leg late in the fighting Arnold himself said it would have been better had it been in the chest instead of the leg Burgoyne surrendered ten days after the second battle on 17 October 1777 In response to Arnolds valour at Saratoga Congress restored his command seniority However Arnold interpreted the manner in which they did so as an act of sympathy for his wounds and not an apology or recognition that they were righting a wrong

Arnold spent several months recovering from his injuries Rather than amputating his shattered left leg he had it crudely set leaving it convert2incm1 shorter than the right He returned to the army at Valley Forge in May 1778 to the applause of men who had served under him at Saratoga There he took part in the first recorded Oath of Allegiance along with many other soldiers as a sign of loyalty to the United States

FilePhiladelphiaPresidentsHousejpgthumbright250pxPresidents House Philadelphia Arnold made the Masters Penn mansion as it was then called his headquarters while military commander of Philadelphia It later served as the presidential mansion of George Washington and John Adams 17901800 After the British withdrew from Philadelphia in June 1778 Washington appointed Arnold military commander of the city Even before the Americans reoccupied Philadelphia Arnold began planning to capitalize financially on the change in power there engaging in a variety of business deals designed to profit from war related supply movements and benefitting from the protection of his authority These schemes were sometimes frustrated by powerful local politicians who eventually amassed enough evidence to publicly air charges Arnold demanded a court martial to clear the charges writing to Washington in May 1779 Having become a cripple in the service of my country I little expected to meet such ungrateful returns

Arnold lived extravagantly in Philadelphia and was a prominent figure on the social scene During the summer of 1778 Arnold met Peggy Shippen the 18 year old daughter of Judge Edward Shippen a Loyalist sympathizer who had done business with the British while they occupied the city Peggy had been courted by British Major John Andr during the British occupation of Philadelphia Peggy and Arnold married on 8 April 1779 Peggy and her circle of friends had found methods of staying in contact with paramours across the battle lines in spite of military bans on communication with the enemy Some of this communication was effected through the services of Joseph Stansbury a Philadelphia merchant

Sometime early in May 1779 Arnold met with Stansbury Stansbury whose testimony before a British commission apparently erroneously placed the date in June said that after meeting with Arnold I went secretly to New York with a tender of Arnolds services to Sir Henry Clinton Ignoring instructions from Arnold not to involve anyone else in the plot Stansbury crossed the British lines and went to see Jonathan Odell in New York Odell was a Loyalist working with William Franklin the last Colonial Governor of New Jersey and the son of Benjamin Franklin On 9 May Franklin introduced Stansbury to Major Andr who had just been named the British spy chief This was the beginning of a secret correspondence between Arnold and Andr sometimes using his wife Peggy as a willing intermediary that culminated over a year later with Arnolds change of sides

Andr spoke to General Clinton who gave him broad authority to pursue Arnolds offer Andr then drafted instructions to Stansbury and Arnold  This first letter opened a discussion on the types of assistance and intelligence Arnold might provide and included instructions for how to communicate in the future Letters would be passed through the womens circle that Peggy Arnold was a part of but only Peggy would be aware that some letters contained instructions written in both code and invisible ink that were to be passed on to Andr using Stansbury as the courier

By July 1779 Arnold was providing the British with troop locations and strengths as well as the locations of supply depots all the while negotiating over compensation At first he asked for indemnification of his losses and 10000 an amount the Continental Congress had given Charles Lee for his services in the Continental Army General Clinton who was pursuing a campaign to gain control of the Hudson River Valley was interested in plans and information on the defences of West Point and other defences on the Hudson River He also began to insist on a face to face meeting and suggested to Arnold that he pursue another high level command By October 1779 the negotiations had ground to a halt Furthermore Patriot mobs were scouring Philadelphia for Loyalists and Arnold and the Shippen family were being threatened Arnold was rebuffed by Congress and by local authorities in requests for security details for himself and his in laws

The court martial to consider the charges against Arnold began meeting on 1 June 1779 but was delayed until December 1779 by General Clintons capture of Stony Point New York throwing the army into a flurry of activity to react In spite of the fact that a number of members of the panel of judges were men ill disposed to Arnold over actions and disputes earlier in the war Arnold was cleared of all but two minor charges on 26 January 1780 Arnold worked over the next few months to publicize this fact however in early April just one week after Washington congratulated Arnold on the 19 May birth of his son Edward Shippen Arnold Washington published a formal rebuke of Arnolds behaviour

Shortly after Washingtons rebuke a Congressional inquiry into his expenditures concluded that Arnold had failed to fully account for his expenditures incurred during the Quebec invasion and that he owed the Congress some 1000 largely because he was unable to document them A significant number of these documents were lost during the retreat from Quebec angry and frustrated Arnold resigned his military command of Philadelphia in late April

Early in April Philip Schuyler had approached Arnold with the possibility of giving him the command at West Point Discussions between Schuyler and Washington on the subject had not borne fruit by early June Arnold reopened the secret channels with the British informing them of Schuylers proposals and including Schuylers assessment of conditions and West Point He also provided information on a proposed French American invasion of Quebec that was to go up the Connecticut River On 16 June Arnold inspected West Point while on his way home to Connecticut to take care of personal business and sent a highly detailed report through the secret channel When he reached Connecticut Arnold arranged to sell his home there and began transferring assets to London through intermediaries in New York By early July he was back in Philadelphia where he wrote another secret message to Clinton on 7 July which implied that his appointment to West Point was assured and that he might even provide a drawing of the works by which you might take West Point without loss

General Clinton and Major Andr who returned victorious from the Siege of Charleston on 18 June were immediately caught up in this news Clinton concerned that Washingtons army and the French fleet would join in Rhode Island again fixed on West Point as a strategic point to capture Andr who had spies and informers keeping track of Arnold verified his movements Excited by the prospects Clinton informed his superiors of his intelligence coups but failed to respond to Arnolds 7 July letter

Arnold next wrote a series of letters to Clinton even before he might have expected a response to the 7 July letter In a letter of 11 July he complained that the British did not appear to trust him and threatened to break off negotiations unless progress was made On 12 July he wrote again making explicit the offer to surrender West Point although his price rose to 20000 with a 1000 downpayment to be delivered with the response These letters were delivered not by Stansbury but by Samuel Wallis another Philadelphia businessman who spied for the British

On 3 August 1780 Arnold obtained command of West Point On 15 August he received a coded letter from Andr with Clintons final offer 20000 and no indemnification for his losses Due to difficulties in getting the messages across the lines neither side knew for some days that the other was in agreement to that offer Arnolds letters continued to detail Washingtons troop movements and provide information about French reinforcements that were being organized On 25 August Peggy finally delivered to him Clintons agreement to the terms

Washington in assigning Arnold to the command at West Point also gave him authority over the entire American controlled Hudson River from Albany down to the British lines outside New York City While en route to West Point Arnold renewed an acquaintance with Joshua Hett Smith someone Arnold knew had done spy work for both sides and who owned a house near the western bank of the Hudson just south of West Point

Once he established himself at West Point Arnold began systematically weakening its defences and military strength Needed repairs on the chain across the Hudson were never ordered Troops were liberally distributed within Arnolds command area or furnished to Washington on request He also peppered Washington with complaints about the lack of supplies writing Everything is wanting At the same time he tried to drain West Points supplies so that a siege would be more likely to succeed  His subordinates some of whom were long time associates grumbled about unnecessary distribution of supplies and eventually concluded that Arnold was selling some of the supplies on the black market for personal gain

On 30 August 30 Arnold sent a letter accepting Clintons terms and proposing a meeting to Andr through yet another intermediary William Heron a member of the Connecticut Assembly he thought he could trust Heron in a comic twist went into New York unaware of the significance of the letter and offered his own services to the British as a spy He then took the letter back to Connecticut where suspicious of Arnolds actions he delivered it to the head of the Connecticut militia General Parsons seeing a letter written as a coded business discussion laid it aside Four days later Arnold sent a ciphered letter with similar content into New York through the services of a prisoner of wars wife Eventually a meeting was set for 11 September near Dobbs Ferry This meeting was thwarted when British gunboats in the river not having been informed of his impending arrival fired on his boat

Arnold and Andr finally met on 21 September at Joshua Hett Smiths house On the morning of 22 September James Livingston the colonel in charge of the outpost at Verplancks Point fired on HMS Vulture the ship that was intended to carry Andr back to New York This action damaged the ship and she had to retreat downriver forcing Andr to return to New York overland Arnold wrote out passes for Andr so that he would be able to pass through the lines and also gave him plans for West Point On Saturday 23 September Andr was captured near Tarrytown by three Westchester patriots named John Paulding Isaac Van Wart and David Williams the papers exposing the plot to capture West Point were found and sent to Washington and Arnolds treachery came to light after Washington examined them Meanwhile Andr convinced the unsuspecting commanding officer to whom he was delivered Colonel John Jameson to send him back to Arnold at West Point However Major Benjamin Tallmadge a member of Washingtons secret service insisted Jameson order the prisoner intercepted and brought back Jameson reluctantly recalled the lieutenant delivering Andr into Arnolds custody but then sent the same lieutenant as a messenger to notify Arnold of Andrs arrest

Arnold learned of Andrs capture the following morning 24 September when he received Jamesons message that Andr was in his custody and that the papers Andr was carrying had been sent to General Washington Arnold received Jamesons letter while waiting for Washington with whom he had planned to have breakfast He made all haste to the shore and ordered bargemen to row him downriver to where the Vulture was anchored which then took him to New York From the ship Arnold wrote a letter to Washington requesting that Peggy be given safe passage to her family in Philadelphia a request Washington granted When presented with evidence of Arnolds betrayal it is reported that Washington was calm He did however investigate the extent of the betrayal and suggested in negotiations with General Clinton over the fate of Major Andr that he was willing to exchange Andr for Arnold This suggestion Clinton refused after a military tribunal Andr was hanged at Tappan New York on 2 October Washington also infiltrated men into New York in an attempt to kidnap Arnold this plan which very nearly succeeded failed when Arnold changed living quarters prior to sailing for Virginia in December

Arnold attempted to justify his actions in an open letter titled To the Inhabitants of America published in newspapers in October 1780 In the letter to Washington requesting safe passage for Peggy he wrote that Love to my country actuates my present conduct however it may appear inconsistent to the world who very seldom judge right of any mans actions

The British gave Arnold a brigadier generals commission with an annual income of several hundred pounds but only paid him 6315 plus an annual pension of 360 because his plot failed In December 1780 under orders from Clinton Arnold led a force of 1600 troops into Virginia where he captured Richmond by surprise and then went on a rampage through Virginia destroying supply houses foundries and mills This activity brought Virginias militia out and Arnold eventually retreated to Portsmouth to either be evacuated or reinforced The pursuing American army included the Marquis de Lafayette who was under orders from Washington to summarily hang Arnold if he was captured Reinforcements led by William Phillips arrived in late March and Phillips led further raids across Virginia including a defeat of Baron von Steuben at Petersburg until his death of fever on 12 May 1781 Arnold commanded the army only until 20 May when Lord Cornwallis arrived with the southern army and took over One colonel wrote to Clinton of Arnold there are many officers who must wish some other general in command Cornwallis ignored advice proffered by Arnold to locate a permanent base away from the coast that might have averted his later surrender at Yorktown

On his return to New York in June Arnold made a variety of proposals for continuing to attack essentially economic targets in order to force the Americans to end the war Clinton however was not interested in most of Arnolds aggressive ideas but finally relented and authorized Arnold to raid the port of New London Connecticut On 4 September not long after the birth of his and Peggys second son Arnolds force of over 1700 men raided and burned New London and captured Fort Griswold causing damage estimated at 500000 British casualties were highnearly one quarter of the force was killed or wounded a rate at which Clinton claimed he could ill afford more such victories

Even before Cornwalliss surrender in October Arnold had requested permission from Clinton to go to England to give Lord Germain his thoughts on the war in person When word of the surrender reached New York Arnold renewed the request which Clinton then granted On 8 December 1781 Arnold and his family left New York for England In London he aligned himself with the Tories advising Germain and King George III to renew the fight against the Americans In the House of Commons Edmund Burke expressed the hope that the government would not put Arnold at the head of a part of a British army lest the sentiments of true honour which every British officer holds dearer than life should be afflicted To Arnolds detriment the anti war Whigs had gotten the upper hand in Parliament and Germain was forced to resign with the government of Lord North falling not long after

Arnold then applied to accompany General Carleton who was going to New York to replace Clinton as commander in chief this request went nowhere Other attempts to gain positions within the government or the British East India Company over the next few years all failed and he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non wartime service His reputation also came under criticism in the British press especially when compared to that of Major Andr who was celebrated for his patriotism One particularly harsh critic said that he was a mean mercenary who having adopted a cause for the sake of plunder quits it when convicted of that charge In turning him down for an East India Company posting George Johnstone wrote Although I am satisfied with the purity of your conduct the generality do not think so While this is the case no power in this country could suddenly place you in the situation you aim at under the East India Company

In 1785 Arnold and his son Richard moved to Saint John New Brunswick where they speculated in land and established a business doing trade with the West Indies Arnold purchased large tracts of land in the Maugerville area and acquired city lots in Saint John and Fredericton Delivery of his first ship the Lord Sheffield was accompanied by accusations from the builder that Arnold had cheated him Arnold claimed that he had merely deducted the contractually agreed amount when the ship was delivered late After her first voyage Arnold returned to London in 1786 to bring his family to Saint John While there he disentangled himself from a lawsuit over an unpaid debt that Peggy had been fighting while he was away paying 900 to settle a 12000 loan he had taken while living in Philadelphia The family moved to Saint John in 1787 where Arnold created an uproar with a series of bad business deals and petty lawsuits Following the most serious a slander suit he won against a former business partner townspeople burned him in effigy in front of his house as Peggy and the children watched The family left Saint John to return to London in December 1791

In July 1792 he fought a bloodless duel with the James Maitland 8th Earl of Lauderdale after the Earl impugned his honour in the House of Lords With the outbreak of the French Revolution Arnold outfitted a privateer while continuing to do business in the West Indies even though the hostilities increased the risk He was imprisoned by French authorities on Guadeloupe amid accusations of spying for the British and narrowly eluded hanging by escaping to the blockading British fleet after bribing his guards He helped organize militia forces on British held islands receiving praise from the landowners for his efforts on their behalf This work which he hoped would earn him wider respect and a new command instead earned him and his sons a land grant of convert15000acreha in Upper Canada near present day Renfrew Ontario

In January 1801 Arnolds health began to decline Gout which he had suffered since 1775 attacked his unwounded leg to the point where he was unable to go to sea the other ached constantly and he walked only with a cane His doctors diagnosed him as having dropsy and a visit to the countryside only temporarily improved his condition He died after four days of delirium on 14 June 1801 at the age of 60 Legend has it that when he was on his deathbed he said Let me die in this old uniform in which I fought my battles May God forgive me for ever having put on another but this may be apocryphal Arnold was buried at St Marys Church Battersea in London England As a result of a clerical error in the parish records his remains were removed to an unmarked mass grave during church renovations a century later His funeral procession had seven mourning coaches and four state carriages the funeral was without military honours

He left a small estate reduced in size by his debts which Peggy undertook to clear Among his bequests were considerable gifts to one John Sage who turned out to be an illegitimate son conceived during his time in New Brunswick

Arnolds contributions to American independence are largely underrepresented in popular culture while his name became synonymous with traitor in the 19th century The demonization of Arnold began immediately after his betrayal became public Biblical themes were often invoked Benjamin Franklin wrote that Judas Iscariot sold only one man Arnold three million and Alexander Scammel described Arnolds actions as black as hell

Early biographers attempted to describe Arnolds entire life in terms of treacherous or morally questionable behaviour The first major biography of Arnold The Life and Treason of Benedict Arnold published in 1832 by historian Jared Sparks was particularly harsh in showing how Arnolds treacherous character was allegedly formed out of childhood experiences George Canning Hill who authored a series of moralistic biographies in the mid 19th century began his 1865 biography of Arnold Benedict the Traitor was born  Social historian Brian Carso notes that as the 19th century progressed the story of Arnolds betrayal took on near mythic proportions as a part of the national creation story and was again invoked as sectional conflicts leading up the American Civil War increased  Washington Irving used it as part of an argument against dismemberment of the union in his 1857 Life of George Washington pointing out that only the unity of New England and the southern states that led to independence was made possible in part by holding West Point Jefferson Davis and other southern secessionist leaders were unfavourably compared to Arnold implicitly and explicitly likening the idea of secession to treason Harpers Weekly published an article in 1861 describing Confederate leaders as a few men directing this colossal treason by whose side Benedict Arnold shines white as a saint

Fictional invocations of Arnolds name also carried strongly negative overtones A moralistic childrens tale entitled The Cruel Boy was widely circulated in the 19th century It described a boy who stole eggs from birds nests pulled wings off insects and engaged in other sorts of wanton cruelty who then grew up to become a traitor to his country The boy is not identified until the end of the story when his place of birth is given as Norwich Connecticut and his name is given as Benedict Arnold However not all depictions of Arnold were strongly negative Some theatrical treatments of the 19th century explored his duplicity seeking to understand rather than demonize it

The connection between Arnold and treason continued into the 20th and 21st centuries On an episode of The Brady Bunch Everyone Cant Be George Washington after Peter is assigned the role of Arnold in the school play everyone hates him A line by the comically insincere character Sir in the 1965 Broadway musical The Roar of the Greasepaint The Smell of the Crowd who often declares his integrity with references to entirely untrustworthy individuals which his foil Cocky does not understand declares God knows Im not perfect Cocky but by the unswerving loyalties of Benedict Arnold I do believe in forgiving a friendcitation neededdateDecember 2010 In a recent reference Dan Gilbert owner of the National Basketball Associations Cleveland Cavaliers subtly invoked Arnold in 2010 Upset over the manner in which LeBron James announced his departure from the team Gilberts company lowered the price of posters bearing Jamess likeness to 1741 referring to the year of Arnolds birth

Novelistic treatments of the American Revolutionary war sometimes feature Arnold as a character His Judas role in popular imagination is so fixed though that even an iconoclastic novel sequence like Gore Vidals Narratives of Empire does not question itfactdateMarch 2011reasonneed citation for characterization of Vidals work and fixity of Judas role in popular imagination But one notable treatment depicting Arnold very much in a positive light is Kenneth Roberts Arundel novels which cover many of the campaigns in which he participated

During his marriage to Margaret Mansfield Arnold had the following children

and with Peggy Shippen he raised a family active in British military service

On the battlefield at Saratoga now preserved in Saratoga National Historical Park stands a monument in memorial to Arnold but there is no mention of his name on the engraving Donated by Civil War General John Watts DePeyster the inscription on the Boot Monument reads In memory of the most brilliant soldier of the Continental army who was desperately wounded on this spot winning for his countrymen the decisive battle of the American Revolution and for himself the rank of Major General The victory monument at Saratoga has four niches three of which are occupied by statues of Generals Gates Schuyler and Morgan The fourth niche is empty

On the grounds of the United States Military Academy at West Point there are plaques commemorating all of the generals that served in the Revolution One plaque bears only a rank major general and a date born 1740 and no name

The house at 62 Gloucester Place where Arnold lived in central London still stands bearing a plaque that describes Arnold as an American Patriot The church where Arnold was buried St Marys Church Battersea England has a commemorative stained glass window which was added between 1976 and 1982 The faculty club at the University of New Brunswick Fredericton has a Benedict Arnold Room in which framed original letters written by Arnold hang on the walls

This page is a list of Transport for London contracted London Bus routes in London as well as private services that enter the Greater London area 

Historically bus routes run by London Transport were grouped by the type of service that they provided

The 1924 London Traffic Act imposed a numbering scheme known as the Bassom Scheme named after Chief Constable AE Bassom of the Metropolitan Police who made it Changing and short lines used letter suffixes The numbers were grouped also by the company that operated the route 

The numbering was revised in 1934 after London Transport was formed

100199

200299

Many of these routes are run for schools to lower overcrowding on normal bus services Their timetables are subject to short notice changing and re routing in accordance with school needs A notable exception is route 607 which is a limited stop service operating in West London whose number is inherited from the period when this route was served by trolleybuses 

These are Mobility Bus Routes These routes provide a once a week return journey to a local shopping centre where there is no alternative route in the main bus network Low floor buses across London has reduced a lot the number of Mobility Bus services

Night bus routes are often connected to the day number equivalent normally running the same route but with an extension at either end of the service This is normally to provide a night service to destinations served by tube or train during the day 

However in a few cases services have a route number that has no relation to its daytime equivalent such as the N5 which operates in a different part of London to day route 5

There are also 24 hour routes which are listed in the day routes above shaded blue Route 65 is classed as a 24 hour service but unusually has an extension to its night service rather than the night service being designated N65

These bus routes are operated with a London Service Permit issued by Transport for London and are generally routes from towns just outside the Greater London boundary to destinations within The exceptions are the 812 MB1 and R21 which run entirely within the boundary Another exception is the 724 which although run by a coach company it is a bus route

Coach services are not included in this list

This list shows some old routes that used to operate but do not exist anymore

Levenshtein Distance is a way to calculate how similar two words are to one another

The simple way this works is by counting how many times you need to change one word to turn it into another word

For example the Levenshtein distance between kitten and sitting is 3 since the following three edits change one into the other and there is no way to do it with fewer than three edits

This can be used by various websites when you change your password to make sure youre not using a similar password that can decrease the security of the website The given minimum distance between two passwords is recommended to be 5 so that means that 5 changes need to take place between your old password and your new password for certain websites to accept your new password

The Fukushima nuclear disaster is a series of ongoing equipment failures reactor meltdowns and releases of radioactive materials at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Station following the Thoku earthquake and tsunami on March 11 2011 The plant has six separate reactors maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company The accident is the second biggest nuclear accident after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster but more complex as all reactors are involved

At the time of the quake reactor 4 had been de fueled while 5 and 6 were in cold shutdown for planned maintenance The remaining reactors shut down automatically after the earthquake but the entire plant was flooded including low lying generators and electrical switchgear in reactor basements and external pumps for supplying cooling seawater The connection to the electrical grid was broken All power for cooling was lost and reactors started to overheat There was a partial core meltdown in reactors 1 2 and 3 hydrogen explosions destroyed the upper part of the buildings housing reactors 1 3 and 4 an explosion damaged the containment inside reactor 2 fires broke out at reactor 4 Despite being initially shutdown reactors 5 and 6 began to overheat Spent nuclear fuel rods stored in pools in each reactor building overheated as water levels in the pools dropped 

Fears of radiation leaks led to a 20 km radius evacuation around the plant while workers suffered radiation exposure and were temporarily moved out at various times Grid power was restored to parts of the plant on 20 March but machinery for reactors 1 through 4 damaged by floods fires and explosions was still not working Flooding with radioactive water through the basements of units 14 continues to prevent access to carry out repairs Measurements in areas of northern Japan 3050 km from the plant showed radioactive caesium levels high enough to cause concern Food grown in the area was banned from sale It was suggested that worldwide measurements of iodine 131 and caesium 137 indicate that the releases from Fukushima are of the same order of magnitude as the releases of those isotopes from the Chernobyl disaster in 1986

Tokyo officials said that tap water should not be used to prepare food for children Plutonium contamination has been detected in the soil at two sites in the plant Two workers hospitalized as a precaution on 25 March had been exposed to between 2000 and 6000 mSv of radiation at their ankles when standing in water in unit 3 Radiation levels varied widely over time and location

The nuclear emergencies at Japans Fukushima I and other nuclear facilities raised questions about the future of nuclear power Platts has said that the crisis at Japans Fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster the International Energy Agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035

The Macquarie River is one of the main inland rivers in New South Wales It begins in the central highlands of New South Wales near the town of Oberon The river flows northwest past the towns of Bathurst Wellington Dubbo Narromine and Warren to the Macquarie Marshes The Macquarie Marshes then drain into the lower Barwon River and then into the Darling River

Burrendong Dam is a large dam near Wellington which holds the waters of the Macquarie River and its tributaries the Cudgegong River and the Turon River to stop floods and provide water for irrigation The dam made Lake Burrendong

The Macquarie River flows for 626 kilometres and drops around 517 metres over its length Lake Burrendong is the only dam on the river

The Macquarie River starts at White Rock near Oberon at an elevation of 671m

Six rivers flow into the Macquarie River

There are 19 creeks that flow into the Macquarie River

The Macquarie system covers an area of more than 74000 square kilometres Over 72 of land is flat and 17 is hilly The rest is steep to mountainous reaching 900 metres The east boundary is formed by the Great Dividing Range from near Oberon in the south to Coolah in the north A mountain ridge goes north west from the Great Dividing Range for about 400 kilometres then the boundary turns north

From Bathurst near the start of the river it passes the following geographic areas

Rainfall varies across the area drained by the Macquarie River The mountain the peaks and tablelands receive higher rainfall due to the shadowing effects of the surrounding ranges The Great Dividing Range area receives between 750 to 900 mm annual median rainfall This is falls evenly throughout the year Gaps in the Dividing Range allows moist easterly air to pass inland annual median rainfall of 750 mm or more is experienced further westward Further north west it is drier in the Castelreagh and middle portions of the Macquarie valleys the annual median rainfall is 300 to 400 mm

Rainfall can vary dramatically over several years Records show that rainfall can be 200 or less than 50 of the average annual figure Evaporation varies from less than 1000 mm south east of Bathurst up to more than 2000 mm at Bourke 

The Wiradjuri people are the original people to live in the Macquarie River area The Wiradjuri called the river Wambool The famous Wiradjuri warrior Windradyne came from the upper Macquarie River region He was killed in a tribal battle alongside the river in 1829

Near Carinda between the Macquarie River and Marra Creek the oldest evidence of bread making in the world was found at an ancient lake known as Cuddie Springs

The upper parts of the Macquarie River were first seen by Europeans in 1813 The river was named for the Governor of New South Wales Lachlan Macquarie In 1813 surveyor George Evans wrote in his journal

Tuesday 30th November 1813 I have at length reached the Ridge I so much wished to do after walking about 2 Miles where I had a prospect to the North for a great distance A Mist arises from a part I suppose to be a River or a large Lagoon about 20 Miles Off Thursday 9th December 1813 I have called the Main Stream Macquarie River

In 1817 18 John Oxley followed the Lachlan and Macquarie Rivers In 1828 Charles Sturt proved that Macquarie River ended in marshes He discovered the Darling River

The Macquarie River area is a regulated Water Management Area and includes private irrigation as well as several public irrigation schemes

The Macquarie River has a history of flooding After major floods water can flow past the Macquarie Marshes and into the Barwon Darling river system upstream of Brewarrina

Recreational activities are popular along the length of the river particularly in the communities it passes by

Gas chromatography is a type of chromatography The sample to be tested is first turned into a gas and then carried through a column by a nonreactive carrier gas such as helium or other inert gas As the sample is carried through the column it is separated into its individual components To achieve this the column is housed inside a oven where the temperature is controlled to allow the individual components to exit the column at different times 

In selecting a carrier gas it is important to select a gas that will not react with the components of the sample The carrier gas should also be able to withstand high temperatures due to the oven The flow rate of the carrier gas is important in that if it is too high there is not enough time for the sample to interact with the column and no separation will be seen if it is too slow the experiment may take a very long time

The main type of columns used in gas chromatography is a capillary column Packed columns are created of fused silica or stainless steel To increase separation of a gas sample columns must be created of a large length and are coiled to fit inside of the oven Capillary columns are separated into two categories wall coated open tubular and support coated open tubular WCOT are capillary tubes with a thin layer of stationary phase and in SCOT the tube is lined with a thin film of support material As the sample moves through the column the individual parts of the sample become contained with the material inside of the column and are then released This action allows for a sample to become separated

It is important that the oven is capable of maintaining a constant temperature Since movement of the sample through the column relies on the boiling point of the sample being analyzed the oven should be set to a temperature that is slightly higher than its boiling point For samples with a large boiling range a temperature program can be used in which the column temperature is raised By using a high temperature the sample moves through the column faster while at lower temperatures the sample moves slower but better resolution is achieved

Many types of detectors are used in gas chromatographic separations with the most common are flame ionization thermal conductivity and mass spectrometry detectors In a flame ionization detectors the separated sample from the column is directed into a flame By creating a voltage near the burner tip and the detector the ions that are produced from the flame travel towards the detector Flame detectors are not capable of detecting H2O CO2 SO2 and CO 

With a thermal conductivity detector the sample from the column is passed into an area that is electrically heated The thermal conductivity of the column is reduced when the sample passes over by When this occurs the detector heats up and measures the change in resistance The thermal conductivity detector is capable of detecting all types of compounds

A mass spectrometer measures the mass to charge ratio of fragmented ions of a sample The output of a column can be feed directly into the ionization chamber of the mass spectrometer A mass spectrometry detector is capable of being able to obtain information from incompletely separated components Two types of mass spectrometer detectors used are quadrupole and time of flight mass analyzers In a quadrupole detector a voltage is produced which makes ions of a specific mass to travel to the detector In a time of flight mass analyzer the speed of an ion is measured allowing the mass to charge ratio to be known

Gas chromatography is regularly used to describe what is inside a complex sample The information obtained from gas chromatography is placed into a graph of detector response versus the time the sample leaves the column If the separate parts of a complex sample come out at different times far apart from one another it its possible to determine what came out of the column

If a sample is compared to a standard calibration it is possible to know how much of a separated part of the sample makes up the sample This is useful in monitoring quality of a product such as medicine beverage or perfume

Srbosjek is the colloquial serbo croatian term for a type of knife used for killing prisoners in Croatian concentration camps in World War II

The knife gained notoriety in the former Yugoslavian countries because it was used by the Croatian Ustae during World War II for the killing of prisoners in the concentration camps of the Nazi puppet Independent State of Croatia most notably the Jasenovac concentration camp The victims were Serbs Jews and Roma imprisoned on ethnic grounds and significant numbers of Croats imprisoned on the grounds that they were Yugoslav Partisans resistance members or on the suspicion of taking part in anti fascist activities

The upper part of the knife was made of leather as a sort of a glove designed to be worn with the thumb going through the hole so that only the blade protruded from the hand It was a curved 12 cm long knife with the edge on its concave side The knife was fastened to a bowed oval copper plate while the plate was fastened to a thick leather bangle The knife was fixed on the glove plate in order to prevent injuries and to prevent taking care of a separate knife in order to improve the work speed 

Such a type of wheat sheaf knife was manufactured prior to and during World War II by German factory Gebrder Grfrath from Solingen under the trademark Grwiso Gebrder Grfrath was taken over in 1961 by Hubertus Solingen  

In the Jasenovac concentration camp competitions in speedy slaughter were organized by the Ustae The winner of one such competition Petar Brzica allegedly slit the throats of 1360 prisoners

Biology is the science that deals with living things Sometimes it is necessary to make a difference between organisms that are alive and other things that are not alive This might not be as easy as it seems but in general

Many things that appear to be one organism are in fact several living together An example is lichen Lichen is a symbiosis between a blue green alga and a fungus Organisms that live together may not reproduce together but their life processes are bound up together They help each other to live

Modern ideas from molecular biology cell biology and cybernetics give us more ways of describing biological processes

All life processes on Earth use the the chemistry of carbon compounds In particular all life uses long chain molecules such as proteins and nucleic acid With water which is essential the long molecules are wrapped inside membranes to form cells This is true of all known life

Living organisms are open systems The main idea is that the processes serve to keep them alive by homeostasis They are always changing but always staying within certain limits as long as they live 

They do this by exchanging materials and information with their environment They undergo metabolism maintain homeostasis possess a capacity to grow respond to stimuli and reproduce All of this preserves the individual and its race or species

Leif Erikson Day is a holiday in the American and happens on October 9 It honors Leif Ericson the Norse explorer who brought the first Europeans known to have set foot in North America 

America Not Discovered by Columbus by Rasmus B Anderson was published in 1874 This book helped make popular the idea that Vikings were the first Europeans in the New World In 1925 American President Calvin Coolidge recognised Leif Erikson as the Discoverer of America This was due to research by Norwegian American scholars such as Knut Gjerset and Ludvig Hektoen 

In 1930 Wisconsin became the first state to officially adopt Leif Erikson Day as a state holiday A year later the state of Minnesota did the same By 1956 Leif Erikson Day was an official holiday seven states and one Canadian province 

In 1963 the US Representative from Duluth John Blatnik introduced a bill to observe Leif Erikson Day in the rest of the United States In 1964 the United States Congress authorized and requested the President to create the observance through a yearly proclamation Lyndon B Johnson and each President since have done so Presidents have used the proclamation to praise the spirit of discovery and the contributions of Americans of Nordic descent generally Some states officially commemorate Leif Erikson Day particularly in the Upper Midwest where large numbers of people from the Nordic countries settled

October 9th is not related with any event in Leif Eriksons life The date was chosen because the ship Restauration coming from Stavanger Norway arrived in New York Harbor on October 9 1825 This was the start of the first organized immigration from Norway to the United States

Guelders or Gueldres is the name of a historical county This became a duchy of the Holy Roman Empire in the Low Countries

The duchy was named after the town of Geldern in what is now called Germany The present province of Gelderland in the Netherlands occupies most of the area However the former duchy also included parts of the present Dutch province of Limburg and the territories in the present day German state of North Rhine Westphalia that were acquired by Prussia in 1713 

The duchy had four special parts which had their own centres

and was separated from the Lower Quarters

The county was first mentioned in about 1096 when Gerard III of Wassenberg was first documented as Count of Guelders It was then in the territory of Lower Lorraine in the area of Geldern and Roermond Its main stronghold was at Montfort Count Gerards son Gerard II in 1127 got the County of Zutphen in northern Hamaland by marriage In the 12th and 13th century Guelders became larger very quickly downstream along the sides of the Maas Rhine and IJssel rivers It even claimed the lands in the Duchy of Limburg In 1288 it lost the Battle of Worringen against Berg and Brabant

Guelders was often at war with its neighbours Not only with Brabant but also with the County of Holland and the Bishopric of Utrecht Its territory did not only grow because of its success in warfare it also did very well in times of peace William II count of both Holland and Zeeland gave Nijmegen in use to Guelders in return of a loan However he was not able to repay the debts so these lands became integral parts of Guelders 

In 1339 Count Reginald II of Guelders became a duke as ordered by Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV of Wittelsbach When Reginald died without an heir in 1371 William I of Jlich inherited Guelders In 1423 Guelders passed to the House of Egmond Duke Adolf was fighting with his father Arnold about the inheritance of the land Arnold came under pressure from the Burgundian duke Charles the Bold who put him in prison in 1471 When Arnold died in 1473 Duke Charles added Guelders to his Burgundian Netherlands

The last independent Duke of Guelders was Adolfs son Charles of Egmond He increased the size of the duchy northward and included what is now the Province of Overijssel He left the duchy to Duke William the Rich of Jlich Cleves Berg in his will However he was not able to hold on to it and Emperor Charles V of Habsburg soon moved in Guelders finally lost its independence when it was united with the Seventeen Provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands in 1543

Charles V stood down in 1556 He decided that the territories of the Burgundian Circle should be part of the monarchy of Spain The northern Netherlands stood up against King Philip II of Spain in the Dutch Revolt The three northern quarters of Gelderland joined the Union of Utrecht and became part of the United Provinces when the 1581 Act of Abjuration was agreed Only the Upper Quarter remained a part of the Spanish Netherlands 

The Treaty of Utrecht ended the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713 The Spanish Upper Quarter was again divided between Prussian Guelders the United Provinces Austria and the Duchy of Jlich 

In 1795 Guelders was conquered and incorporated by the French First Republic It was divided between the dpartements of Roer and Meuse Infrieure

Nizam a shortened version of Nizam ul Mulk meaning Administrator of the Realm was the title of the native sovereigns of Hyderabad State India since 1719 They belonged to the Asaf Jah dynasty The dynasty was founded by Mir Qamar ud Din Siddiqi a viceroy of the Deccan under the Mughal emperors from 1713 to 1721 After Aurangzebs death in 1707 the Mughal Empire fell apart and the viceroy in Hyderabad said he was independent From 1798 Hyderabad was one of the princely states of British India but it kept local control

Seven Nizams ruled Hyderabad for two centuries until Indian independence in 1947 The Asaf Jahi rulers used money to support much literature art architecture culture jewelry and rich food The Nizams ruled the state until September 1948 after independence from the British

The Asaf Jahi dynasty began near Samarkand The family came to India from Baghdad in the late 17th century They were direct descendants of the first Khalifa of Islam Hazrat Abu Baker Al Siddiq

Nizm ul mulk was a title first used in Urdu around 1600 It comes from the Arabic word nizm meaning order arrangement The Nizam was also called Ala Hadrat Ala Hazrat or Nizam Sarkar

The first Nizam ruled in place of the Mughal emperors After Aurangzeb died the Nizams left the Mughals to make an independent kingdom When the British got power over India the Nizams were allowed to continue to rule for the British The Nizams kept power in Hyderabad State until 17 September 1948 Hyderabad then became part of the new Indian Union

The Asaf Jah dynasty had only seven rulers However for 13 years after the rule of the first Nizam three of his sons ruled They were not officially recognized as the rulers

A legend about the first Nizam says that on one of his hunting trips he was offered some kulchas by a holy man He asked the Nizam to eat as many as he could The Nizam ate seven kulchas and the holy man predicted that seven generations of his family would rule the state

By tradition no Nizam has ever left India even if there was good a reason

Hyderabad did not join the first war of Indian Independence of 1857 against the British Therefore its Royal Family had special official status of Faithful Ally with Britain

The Asaf Jahis were built many buildings Several palaces of the Nizams were

Other landmarks like the Andhra Pradesh High Court Jubilee Hall Asafia library The Assembly building the Osmania Arts College and the Osmania Medical College are some of their important buildings

The Nizams liked the European style of architecture and created a fusion of European traditions with Hindu and Islamic forms and images

After the British left India in 1947 the princely state of Hyderabad did not join either of the new dominions of India or Pakistan The Nizams rule ended on 17 September 1948 His soldiers surrendered to Indian soldiers

All Nizams are buried in the royal graves at the Makkah Masjid near Charminar in Hyderabad Only the last Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan is buried in a different place His mausoleum is in the Judi Mosque facing King Kothi Palace

A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery is an 18 th century oil painting by Joseph Wright of Derby The painting shows a teacher talking about the sun and planets to his class Wright later created his similar An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump in 1768

Wrights The Orrery caused a great debate because in the past only religious events were used to express awe Wright used science to do so Wright lived in the technological age so he treated religious events and scientific miracles In the orrery demonstration the shadows created by the lamp mimic the sun and it is a part of the display He used a single candle to make his painting dramatic In two later paintings the lighting is normal

One person called Wright a very great and uncommon genius in a peculiar way The Orrery was painted without payment Wright expected that Washington Shirley 5th Earl Ferrers an amateur astronomer will buy the painting because Shirley had his own orrery and Wrights friend Peter Perez Burdett was staying with him Figures are considered to be portraits of Burdett and Ferrers In the picture Burdett is taking notes and Ferrers is seated with his son next to the orrery Ferrers purchased the painting for 210 but the 6th Earl sold it at an auction It is now held by Derby Museum and Art Gallery as its permanent display 

Some people say that John Whitehurst was the model for the teacher However other people say the figure is similar to a painting of Isaac Newton by Godfrey Kneller 

The Frankfurt Parliament was the first freely elected parliament for all of Germany Session was held from May 18 1848 to May 31 1849 in the Paulskirche at Frankfurt am Main It was elected during the March Revolution in the states of the German Confederation

The assembly produced the so called Paulskirche Constitution which proclaimed a German Empire based on the principles of parliamentary democracy This constitution fulfilled the main demands of the liberal and nationalist movements of the Vormrz and provided a foundation of human rights The parliament also proposed a constitutional monarchy headed by a hereditary emperor The Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm IV did not accept the office of emperor when it was offered to him He argued such an offer was an offence against the rights of the princes of the individual German states In the 20th century however major elements of the Frankfurt constitution became models for the Weimar Constitution of 1919 and the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany of 1949

King Frederick William IV of Prussia was the eldest son and successor of Frederick William III of Prussia He reigned as King of Prussia from 1840 to 1861 

Frederick William was educated by private tutors He served in the army during the War of Liberation against Napoleon I of France in 1814 but he was not interested in the army He loved both architecture and landscape gardening and was a patron of several great German artists such as architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and the composer Felix Mendelssohn He married Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria in 1823 but the couple had no children

Frederick William was Romanticist and had a nostalgia for the Middle Ages therefore he was conservative already at an early age He was against both liberalisation and unification of Germany and preferred to allow Austria to remain the first power in the German states

In the beginning of his reign he did not continue the reactionary policies of his father he reduced press censorship and promised a constitution but he did not want a popular legislative assembly but preferred to work with the aristocracy He was Lutheran but he released the imprisoned Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cologne and he decided to help the construction of Cologne Cathedral In 1844 he attended the celebrations of the completion of the cathedral so he was the first king of Prussia who entered a Roman Catholic building When he finally called a national assembly in 1847 it was not a representative body but rather a United Diet which cold speak for all the provincial estates and had the right to grant taxes and loans but no right to meet at regular intervals

When revolution broke out in Prussia in March 1848 as part of the European Revolutions of 1848 the king initially decided to fight it with the army but later decided to recall the troops and place himself at the head of the movement on 19 March He committed himself to German unification formed a liberal government accepted a national assembly and ordered that a Constitution of the Kingdom of Prussia should be drawn up When his position was more secure again however he quickly led the army to reoccupy Berlin and dissolved the assembly in December But he was still in favour of unification for some time So the Frankfurt Parliament offered him the crown of Germany on 3 April 1849 He did not accept it but he tried to establish a union of German states excluding Austria But rather soon after gave up this plan when Austria did not accept it

When he had dismissed the national assembly Frederick William decided to have a constitution with a parliament with two chambers an aristocratic upper house and an elected lower house The lower house was elected by all taxpayers but in a system that was based on the amount of taxes paid so that the rich had more influence than the poor The constitution also reserved for the king the power to appoint all ministers and reestablished the conservative district assemblies and provincial diets And it guaranteed that the bureaucracy and the military remained firmly in the hands of the king This was a more liberal system than had existed in Prussia before 1848 but was still a conservative system of government in which the monarch the aristocracy and the military kept most of the power This constitution lasted until the end of the Prussian kingdom in 1918

After a stroke in 1857 the king was partially paralyzed and largely mentally weak therefore his brother William became regent from 1858 until the kings death in 1861 then he became king himself as William I

The World Nuclear Industry Status Report is a yearly report about the global challenges facing the nuclear power industry The reports show that the share of nuclear generated electricity in the overall global energy production has decreased in the 2000s Nuclear power now accounts for about 13 percent of the worlds electricity generation and 55 percent of primary energy

The World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2010 2011 is authored by Mycle Schneider Antony Froggatt and Steve Thomas and published by the Washington based Worldwatch Institute The foreword is written by Amory Lovins

According to the report the international nuclear power industry has been unable to stop the slow decline of nuclear energy The worlds reactor fleet is aging quickly and not enough new units are coming online As of April 1 2011 there were 437 nuclear reactors operating in the world which was seven fewer than in 2002 The Olkiluoto plant has had particular problems The flagship EPR project at Olkiluoto in Finland managed by the largest nuclear builder in the world AREVA NP has turned into a financial fiasco The project is four years behind schedule and at least 90 percent over budget reaching a total cost estimate of 57 billion or close to 3500 per kilowatt 

The report says that the Fukushima I nuclear accidents have made things more difficult for nuclear energy There is no obvious sign that the international nuclear industry could eventually turn empirically evident downward trend into a promising future and the Fukushima nuclear disaster is likely to accelerate the decline With long lead times of 10 years and more it will be difficult to maintain let alone increase the number of operating nuclear power plants over the next 20 years Moreover says the report it is clear that nuclear power development cannot keep up with the pace of renewable energy commercialization

An attempted Italian colonization in America was done in 1608 by the Granduke of Tuscany Ferdinando I

The Italian colonization of the Americas was limited to an aborted attempt by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany to create a colony in South America in the early 1600s

In 1608 Ferdinando I of Tuscany organized an expedition under captain Robert Thornton in order to explore northern Brazil and the Amazon river and prepare for the establishment of a settlement in northern coastal South America which would serve as a base to export Brazilian wood to Renaissance Italy

Ferdinando I Grand Duke of Tuscany oversaw the only Italian attempt to create a colony in the Americas

When Thornton returned to Tuscany a year later he found Ferdinando I dead and his successor Cosimo II uninterested in the establishment of a colony Thornton was ready to sail back to the area between the rivers Orinoco and Amazon in the summer of 1609 with Italian settlers from Livorno and Lucca but the project was scrapped

Thorntons galleon Santa Lucia returned to Italy in 1609 with plenty of information some indigenous natives of the Americas and a few tropical parrots

He brought back with him to Tuscany five Arawak natives most of whom died of small pox Only one lived on at the Medici court for several years and learned to speak Italian These natives often talked about the richness and fertility of their native land speaking of a country rich in silver and gold Thornton himself corroborated these reports and asserted that the country was rich in rosewood wild sugar canes white pepper balsam cotton and many other kinds of merchandise which would form an abundant commerce for the Tuscans

The area that Thornton considered as a possible site of an Italian colony now lies in modern French Guyana near Cayenne which would be colonised by France in 1630

The Italians never created real colonies in the Americas and only made territorial colonies in other areas of the world mainly after their political unification in the 19th century 

Many Italians moved to America to live under other flags and created the settlements of emigrants sometimes called called colonies Those settlements where made by groups of Italian emigrants who settled together in the same place and around the same time founding a settlement that still exists today in many cases 

That was the first Italian settlement of this kind made in Venezuela by Luigi Castelli who wanted to settle in the late 1830s Italian emigrants from Tuscany in the same area where a few years later German emigrants settled and created the Colonia Tovar

Many of these Italian settlements were created in the second half of the 19th century mainly in Uruguay Argentina Chile Mexico and the Southern Region of Brazil

In most of those settlements the Italian language is still spoken today like in Capitn Pastene of Chile in Chipilo of Mexico or in Nova Veneza of Santa Catarina

None of these settlements are related to the Italian colonial empire of the 20th century

Homo cepranensis is a proposed name for a human species known from only one skull cap discovered in 1994 The fossil was discovered by archeologist Italo Biddittu and was nick named Ceprano Man after a nearby town in the province of Frosinone 89 kilometers Southeast of Rome Italy

The age of the fossil is estimated to be between 350000 to 500000 years old3 An adjacent site Fontana Ranuccio was dated to 487000  6000 years and Muttoni et al suggest that Ceprano is most likely 450000 years old The cranial features on the bone seem to be intermediate between those found on Homo erectus and those of later species such as Homo heidelbergensis which dominated Europe long before Homo neanderthalensis There is yet not enough material to make a complete analysis of the individual

Homo antecessor is an extinct human species dating from 12 million to 800000 years ago that was discovered by Eudald Carbonell Juan Luis Arsuaga and J M Bermdez de Castro H antecessor is one of the earliest known human varieties in Europe 

The best preserved fossil is a maxilla that belonged to a 10 year old individual found in Atapuerca Spain At the site were numerous examples of cuts where the flesh had been flensed from the bones which indicates that H antecessor could have practised cannibalism

Tsongkhapa was a big promoter of the Kadampa teachings and the mahyna principle of universal compassion as the fundamental spiritual orientation He combined this with a strong emphasis on the cultivation of in depth insight into the doctrine of emptiness as taught by the Indian masters Ngrjuna and Candrakrti Tsongkhapa said that these two aspects of the spiritual path compassion and insight into wisdom must be rooted in a big wish for liberation driven by a genuine sense of renunciation He called these the Three Principal Aspects of the Path and said that it is on the basis of these three that one must embark on the profound path of vajrayna Buddhism

The central teachings of the Gelug School are the Stages of the Path based on the teachings of the Indian master Atia and the systematic cultivation of the view of emptiness This is combined with the yogas of highest yoga tantra deities such as Guhyasamja Cakrasavara Yamntaka and Klacakra where the key focus is the direct experience of the union of bliss and emptiness

Quantum gravity is an area of research in physics Right now physics is able to describe gravity of real life sized objects using general relativity Physicists can also describe the universe on a microscopic scale with quantum mechanics The goal of quantum gravity is to develop a theory which contains both general relativity and quantum mechanics However combining the theories of the big and the small is very difficult in practice 

Physicists are working on a number of ways to write down a theory of quantum gravity One approach is to search for a unified field theory Physicists also try to develop theories at an even more fundamental level like string theory loop quantum gravity or other methods to find out why our current theories of gravity and quantum mechanics cannot be combined

In England a civil parish is a unit of local government Civil parishes are the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties It is an administrative parish in comparison to an ecclesiastical parish

The parish council can decide to call itself a town village neighbourhood or community and in a limited number of cases has city status granted by the monarch Civil parishes only cover part of England about 35 of the population 

There are currently no civil parishes in Greater London and before 2008 their creation was not permitted within a London Borough

The creation of ancient parishes was linked to the manorial system The parishes often shared the same boundaries as the manor of the local lord At first the manor was the main unit of local administration and justice in the early rural economy Eventually the church replaced the manor court as the rural administrative centre and levied a local tax on produce known as a tithe Responsibilitfor things such as relief of the poor passed from the Lord of the Manor to the church but in practice it was administered by monasteries After the dissolution of the monasteries the power to charge a rate to fund relief of the poor was given to the parish authorities by the 1601 Act for the Relief of the Poor

The parish authorities were known as vestries and were made up of all the inhabitants of the parish As the population was growing it became increasingly difficult to hold meetings as an open vestry In some mostly built up areas the select vestry took over responsibility from the community at large This innovation improved efficiency but allowed governance by a self perpetuating elite The administration of the parish system relied on the monopoly of the Church of England As religious membership became more fractured such as through the revival of Methodism the legitimacy of the parish vestry came into question and the perceived inefficiency and corruption inherent in the system became a source for concern Because of this scepticism during early the 19th century the parish progressively lost its powers to ad hoc boards and other organisations such as the loss of responsibility for poor relief through the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 The replacement boards were each able to levy their own rate in the parish The church rate ceased to be levied in many areas and was abolished altogether in 1868

The ancient parishes split into two distinct units during the 19th century The Poor Law Amendment Act 1866 declared that all areas that levied a separate rate extra parochial areas townships and chapelries become civil parishes as well The parishes for church use continued unchanged as ecclesiastical parishes The latter part of the 19th century saw most of the ancient irregularities inherited by the civil system cleaned up with the majority of exclaves abolished

Civil parishes in their modern sense were established afresh in 1894 by the Local Government Act 1894 The Act abolished vestries and established elected parish councils in all rural civil parishes with more than 300 electors These were grouped into rural districts Boundaries were altered to avoid parishes being split between counties Urban parishes continued to exist and boundaries were usually changed to be the same as the urban district or municipal borough in which they were situated Large towns originally split between multiple parishes were for the most part eventually joined into one parish No parish councils were formed for urban parishes and their only function was as areas electing guardians to Poor Law Unions With the abolition of the poor law system in 1930 the parishes had only a nominal existence

In 1965 civil parishes in London were formally abolished when Greater London was created as the legislative framework for Greater London did not make provision for any local government body below a London borough In 1974 the Local Government Act 1972 retained civil parishes in rural areas and small urban areas but abolished them in larger urban areas Many former urban districts and municipal boroughs that were being abolished rather than succeeded were continued as new parishes Urban areas that were considered too large to be single parishes were refused this permission and became unparished areas The Act also led to the possibility of sub division of all districts into multiple civil parishes For example Oxford whilst entirely unparished in 1974 now has four civil parishes covering part of its area

The creation of town and parish councils is encouraged in unparished areas The Local Government and Rating Act 1997 gave local residents the right to demand that a new parish and council be created in unparished areas This was extended to London boroughs by the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007  with this the City of London is at present the only part of England where civil parishes cannot be created 

If enough electors in an area of a proposed new parish sign a petition demanding its creation then the local district council or unitary authority must consider the proposal Recently established parish councils include Daventry Folkestone and Brixham In 2003 seven new parish councils were set up for Burton upon Trent and in 2001 the Milton Keynes urban area became entirely parished with ten new parishes being created In 2003 the village of Great Coates regained parish status Parishes can also be abolished where there is evidence that this in response to justified clear and sustained local support from the areas inhabitants Examples include Birtley which was abolished in 2006 and Southsea abolished in 2010

Every civil parish has a parish meeting consisting of all the electors of the parish Generally a meeting is held once a year A civil parish may have a parish council which exercises various local responsibilities given by statute If a parish has fewer than 200 electors it is usually deemed too small to have a parish council and instead will only have a parish meeting an example of direct democracy Alternatively several small parishes can be grouped together and share a common parish council or even a common parish meeting In places where there is no civil parish the administration of the activities normally undertaken by the parish becomes the responsibility of the district or borough council There are about 8700 parish and town councils in England and about 1500 parishes with only parish meetings Since 1997 around 100 new civil parishes have been created in some cases splitting existing civil parishes but mostly by creating new ones from unparished areas

Typical activities undertaken by parish or town councils include

The role played by parish councils varies Smaller parish councils have only limited resources and generally play only a minor role while some larger parish councils have a role similar to that of a small non metropolitan district Parish councils receive funding by levying a precept on the council tax paid by the residents of the parish

Parish councils are run by volunteer councillors who are elected to serve for four years and are not paid Some councils have chosen to pay their elected members a small allowance as permitted under Part 5 of the Local Government Act 2000 The Local Authorities Regulations 2003 The number of councillors varies roughly in proportion to the population of the parish Most parish councillors are elected to represent the entire parish though in parishes with larger populations or those that cover large areas the parish can be divided into wards These wards then return a certain number of councillors each to the parish council Only if there are more candidates standing for election than there are seats on the council will an election be held However sometimes there are fewer candidates than seats When this happens the vacant seats have to be filled by co option by the council When a vacancy arises for a seat mid term an election is only held if a certain number of parish residents request an election Otherwise the council will co opt someone to be the replacement councillor Every Parish Council in England must adopt a code of conduct and parish councillors must comply with its standards enforced by the Standards Board for England

A parish can have city status but only if that is granted by the Crown In England there are currently eight parishes with city status all places with long established Anglican cathedrals Chichester Ely Hereford Lichfield Ripon Salisbury Truro and Wells

The council of an ungrouped parish may unilaterally pass a resolution giving the parish the status of a town The parish council becomes a town council Around 400 parish councils are called town councils 

Under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 a civil parish may now be given an alternative style meaning one of the following

The chairman of a town council will have the title town mayor and that of a parish council which is a city will usually have the title of mayor As a result a parish council can also be called a town council a community council a village council or occasionally a city council

When a city or town has been abolished as a borough and it is considered desirable to maintain continuity of the charter the charter may be transferred to a parish council for its area Where there is no such parish council the district council may appoint charter trustees to whom the charter and the arms of the former borough will belong The charter trustees maintain traditions such as mayoralty An example of such a city was Hereford whose city council was merged in 1998 to form a unitary Herefordshire The area of the city of Hereford remained unparished until 2000 when a parish council was created for the city The charter trustees for the City of Bath make up the majority of the councillors on Bath and North East Somerset Council

Civil parishes do not cover the whole of England There are none in Greater London and very few in the other conurbations Civil parishes vary greatly in size many cover tiny hamlets with populations of less than 100 whereas some large parishes cover towns with populations of tens of thousands Weston super Mare with a population of 71758 is the most populous civil parish In many cases several small villages are located in a single parish Large urban areas are mostly unparished as the government at the time of the Local Government Act 1972 discouraged their creation for large towns or their suburbs but there is generally nothing to stop their establishment For example Birmingham has a parish New Frankley whilst Oxford has four and Northampton has seven Parishes could not however be established in London until the changing of the law in 2007 and as yet none have been established there

The 2001 census recorded several parishes with no inhabitants These were Chester Castle Newland with Woodhouse Moor Beaumont Chase Martinsthorpe Meering Stanground North Sturston Tottington and Tyneham The last three had been taken over by the British Armed Forces during World War II and remain deserted

Ancient parishes often had detached parts exclaves and enclaves which were not joined to the rest of the parish In some cases the detached part was in a different county In other cases an entire parish was in a detached part of the county to which it belonged There were also many examples of parishes divided between two or more counties

These anomalies were mostly fixed in the 19th century Before civil parishes were introduced the Counties Act 1844 transferred many parishes which were detached parts of a county to the county in which they were geographically located The remaining detached parishes were transferred in the 1890s and in 1931 The detached part of the parish of Tetworth Huntingdonshire surrounded by Cambridgeshire remained until the boundaries were changed in 1965 

Other laws including the Divided Parishes and Poor Law Amendment Act 1882 eliminated most instances of civil parishes belonging to two counties and by 1901 Stanground in Huntingdonshire and the Isle of Ely was the sole remaining example Stanground was split into two parishes one in each county in 1905

The Grito de Dolores marks the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence It is also the most important national holiday in Mexico It is also known as El Grito de la Independencia The Grito was the battle cry said by Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla a Roman Catholic priest on 16 September 1810 This happened in the small town of Dolores near Guanajuato 

Hidalgo and a number of criollos were planning to fight the Spanish colonial government but they were betrayed 

Because he was afraid to get arrested Hidalgo made his brother Mauricio and a number of other men with guns go to the sheriff On the night of 15 September they made the sheriff set free the pro independence prisoners They set eighty free 

The next morning at around 600 am Hidalgo ordered the church bells to be rung He made his congregation come together With Ignacio Allende and Juan Aldama by his side he spoke to the people in front of his church He encouraged them to go against the Spanish government Researchers do not agree as to what exactly Hidalgo said at the time  

The Battle of Guanajuato the first important fight in the war happened 4 days later Mexicos independence from Spain wouldnt be declared until September 27 1821 after ten years of war This happened with the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire

Every year on the night of September 15 the President of Mexico rings the bell of the National Palace in Mexico City at around eleven in the evening After the ringing of the bell he repeats a cry of patriotism based upon the Grito de Dolores He calls out the names of the important heroes of the Mexican War of Independence and ends with the shout of Viva Mexico from the balcony of the palace After the shouting he rings the bell again and waves the Flag of Mexico to the applause of the crowd in the Plaza de la Constitucin This is followed by the playing and mass singing of the Himno Nacional Mexicano the national anthem On the morning of September 16 or Independence Day the national military parade starts in the Zcalo It goes past the Hidalgo Memorial and ends on the Paseo de la Reforma Mexico Citys main boulevard 

A similar celebration happens in cities and towns all over Mexico and in Mexican embassies and consulates worldwide on the 15th or the 16th The mayor or governor ambassadors or consuls will take on the role of the president and ring the bells give a speech and so on

In the 19th century Mexican presidents in their last year in office started to come to Dolores Hidalgo for the Grito de Dolores President Caldern went to Dolores Hidalgo as part of the bicentennial celebrations in 2010 on the 16th of September

September 16 is Independence Day in Mexico and is considered a patriotic holiday or fiesta patria This day is celebrated with parades patriotic programs drum and bugle and marching band competitions and other special events

The Criollos were a social class in the caste system of the overseas colonies established by Spain in the 16th century especially in Latin America The name was used for people of pure or mostly Spanish blood but who were born in the colony

The Criollo class was seen as lower than the Peninsulares Peninsulares were the people who lived in the colony but were born in Spain Criollos were higher statusrank than all other castes Examples of other castes are people of mixed descent Amerindians and enslaved Africans 

The term Criollo is often translated into English as Creole However the word creole is also used for many ethnic groups around the world who have no historic connection to Spain or to any colonial system 

Until 1760 the Spanish colonies were ruled under laws designed by the Spanish Habsburgs They gave the American provinces great independence The situation changed with the Bourbon Reforms during the reign of Charles III 

Spain needed to get more money from its colonies for the European and global wars it was fighting so it could maintain the Spanish Empire The Crown made the Penisulares more important and they took over many administrative offices which had been filled by Criollos At the same time reforms by the Catholic Church reduced the roles and privileges of the lower ranks of the clergy who were mostly Criolloscitation neededdateAugust 2009

By the 19th century this unfair policy of the Spanish Crown and the examples of the American and French revolutions led the Criollos to rebel against the Peninsulares With increasing support of the other castes they started to fight Spain in for independence

Jure Franceti was an Ustashe Commissioner of Bosnia and Herzegovina responsible for the massacre of Bosnian Serbs and Jews

Franceti was born in Otoac on July 3 1912 After gymnasium he went to study law at the University of Zagreb were he joined the Ustaa movement Soon after he was exiled from Zagreb for five years as a result of his anti Yugoslav political activities He stayed in Otoac for a short time before emigrating to Italy in March 1933 He took the Ustaa oath in the Borgotaro camp on April 24 1933 and then spent the following four years in Austria Italy and Hungary In Hungary he joined to the Ustashe terrorist group camp at Jankapuszta under new conspirative name Laszlo 

After the assassination of Alexander I of Yugoslavia he was interned on Sardinia by Mussolini at the request of the Yugoslav government After a general declaration of amnesty in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Franceti returned to Croatia in November 1937 but was immediately arrested and exiled to his hometown The next year Franceti returned to Zagreb hoping to complete his study of law but was forced to complete his military service instead In late 1940 he was again arrested in Zagreb because of a congratulatory telegraph to Jozef Tiso president of the newly formed Slovak Republic signed by a number of Croat nationalists He was again exiled to his native Otoac After delivering an inflammatory nationalistic speech at a local schools New Years celebration in Otoac on January 12 1941 he escaped to Germany to avoid another arrest

Franceti earned his only military education and officer rank while serving the Kingdom of Yugoslavia Army He became a non commissioned officer in the rank of sergeant About Francetis military experience and knowledge his Ustashe superior Eugen Dido Kvaternik wrote He did not have basic military knowledge nor military education nor did he have any talent for basic military organization After establishment of the Independent State of Croatia in April 1941 he and other 10 Ustaas organized the Black Legion Jure Franceti became the leader of the Black Legion and earned the rank of colonel in the Ustaa army Kvaternik believed that Franceti a born guerrilla and a son of our mountainous Hercegovina was the reason good enough to put him in the role of military leader in Bosnia and Herzegovina In order to consolidate the Ustashe party power much of the party work in the province he put in the hands of Catholic priests Francetis Ustashe took control over the local administration by dismissing all civil servants and teachers belonging to the category of Srbijanci as well as those who were Jews Killings arrests and deportation of Serbs and Jews was a regular duty of Francetis henchmen  based and justified by the official Ustashe policy which demanded total extermination of Jews and murder expulsion and conversion to the Roman Catholicism of Serb population in Bosnia and Herzegovina Franceti participated personally in arresting and interrogations of prominent Serbian and Jewish leaders and ordered the murders of some of them He even turned his own Sarajevo apartment into the prison kitchen and laundry room

Justification for the slaughter of Bosnian Serbs and Jews Francetic found in the propaganda of the Jewish communist hydra had succeeded in misleading a majority of the Serb Orthodox population in eastern Bosnia into commiting criminal acts against the state and concluded that the most drastic means would have to be empolyed against them

Ustashes unseen cruelty and savagery applied against Serbs and Jews even prompted the German command to demand that Franceti as the commander of the 1st Brigade Black Legion be dismissed Paveli defied and promoted Franceti to commander of all Ustashe field formations In the pre war times about 15000 Jews lived in Bosnia and Herzegovina About 3000 women and children of this number  were arrested and kept in Kruschnitze concentration camp Later they will be deported to Jasenovac and Stara Gradiska concentration camps Additional 7000 Bosnian Jews will be deported directly to Jasenovac concentration camp

Ustashe authorities were so concerned about the effect of his death would have on supporters of their movement that the news of his death was delayed until the beginning of March 1943 Official announcement of his death came on March 31 1943 when Ustashe declared eight days of official mourning

Memorial plaque to this Ustashe leader was erected in Slunj as an embrace by those responsible of the NDH and ethnic hatred

In late 2004 the Croatian government ordered the removal of the memorial plaque in Slunj 

In January 2005 in the outskirts of Split unknown persons erected overnight a memorial to Francetic and Budak to show the extreme rights anger at Sanaders betrayal of the Ustasha cause and the prime ministers cooperation with ICTY

The rock cycle is the process by which rocks of one kind change into rocks of another kind There are three main kinds of rocks igneous rock metamorphic rock and sedimentary rock Each of these rocks can change into the other kinds by one of these processes cooling melting heatpressure weatheringerosion and compactingcementing Two other substances also can become rocks and enter the rock cycle They are magma which is liquid rock above or below ground and sediment which is dust from crushed rock

Igneous rock is hardened magma which can happen above or below ground It can melt into magma erode into sediment or be pressed tightly together to become metamorphic

Metamorphic rock is pressurized igneous or sedimentary rock It can erode into sediment or melt into magma It formed under extreme pressure and temperature

Sedimentary rock is compacted sediment which can come from any of the other rocks It can erode back into sediment or be pressurized into metamorphic rock 

These processes can occur in different orders and the cycle goes on forever Earth has several processes for changing rocks Wind and water can create sediment from rocks and movement of a tectonic plate creates heat and pressure which compacts rocks into rock crystals and eventually rock

Popham said

Im confident we can do this because the village Wi Fi has a 30Mbps upload speed Its a bit of fun but it has a serious purpose too The serious side is to demonstrate that it can be done it Allcapsis possible to live broadcast events like this using relatively cheap equipment and a good internet connection It will also demonstrate the importance of good internet connectivity in rural areas and the need for fast Allcapsupload connections if we are to realise the aspiration to use the internet to enable more people to produce their own content

The match was 20 overs per side This is called the Twenty20 format There was an extra rule that said that any batsman who scored 20 runs had to retire Wray won the toss They decided to bowl first After 20 overs The Rest of the World had scored 69 runs and lost 5 wickets That meant that Wray needed 70 runs off 20 overs Wray managed to do that Their final runs were a six Wray won in their eleventh over They won by 8 wickets

The Mexican War of Independence was a war between the people of Mexico and the Spanish colonial government It started on 16 September 1810 It was started by Mexican born Spaniards Mestizos and Amerindians who wanted independence from Spain 

The idea of a Mexican independence goes back to the years after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire Martn Corts led a revolt against the Spanish colonial government

After the plot called the Conspiracy of the Machetes was not succesful in 1799 the War of Independence really started with the Grito de Dolores in 1811 

Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla was a Mexican priest and member of a group of educated Criollos in Quertaro They met in tertulias and decided in 1810 that a revolt against the colonial government was needed Hidalgo worked closely with Ignacio de Allende a nobleman with military training The plan was for a battle in December 1810

They were betrayed by a member of the group Hidalgo then turned to his parishioners in the town of Dolores Around 600 am of September 16 1811 he declared independence from the Spanish crown and war against the government in what was known as the Grito de Dolores The revolutionary army decided to fight for independence They marched on to Guanajuato which was a major colonial mining centre governed by Spaniards and criollos 

There the leaders of this citizens army which was more like an unorganised mob locked themselves in the granary They killed most of the much hated Spaniards and Criollos that were there This als including high ranking nobles and supporters of the fight for Independence This caused Hidalgo and Allende to fight with eachother After that Allende did not want to fight alongside Hidalgo and left with his soldiers

On October 30 Miguel Hidalgos army fought the Spanish resistance at the Battle of Monte de las Cruces They won this battle 

In January 1811 Spanish forces fought the Battle of the Bridge of Caldern and the peasant army lost It made the rebels flee towards the United States Mexican border where they hoped to escape However they were caught by the Spanish army 

Hidalgo and what was left of his army were caught in the state of Coahuila at the Wells of Bajn He had a trial done by the Inquisition on 30 July 1811 He was executed

After the death of Father Hidalgo the leadership of the revolutionary army was taken over by Jos Mara Morelos Under his leadership the cities of Oaxaca and Acapulco were taken In 1813 the Congress of Chilpancingo had their first meeting On 6 November of that year the Congress signed the first official document of independence known as the Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America It was followed by a long war at the Siege of Cuautla In 1815 Morelos was caught by Spanish colonial authorities He was put on trial and executed for treason in San Cristbal Ecatepec on 22 December

By early 1820 the independence movement was close to collapse Two of their main leaders were executed and the rebels found it hard to fight the well organised Spanish military Also many of the most influential criollos did not care any more The violence of Hidalgos and Moreloss unorganised army mob was not liked They wanted a better less bloody way to get independence 

In December 1820 Viceroy Juan Ruiz de Apodaca sent a force led by a royalist criollo officer Colonel Agustn de Iturbide to fight in Oaxaca Iturbide was famous for the way in which he went after Hidalgos and Moreloss rebels during the early independence struggle 

The fight at Oaxaca came at the same time as successful coup in Spain against the monarchy of Ferdinand VII Ferdinand was forced to reinstate the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812 When this news reached Mexico Iturbide saw in it an opportunity for the criollos to gain control of Mexico After first clashing with Guerreros forces Iturbide switched sides He invited the rebel leader to meet and discuss a new independence struggle

While in the town of Iguala Iturbide created three rules or guarantees for Mexican independence from Spain

He made his troops accept these rules They are known as the Plan of Iguala Iturbide then persuaded Guerrero to join his forces in support of the new independence A new army the Army of the Three Guarantees was then placed under Iturbides command to enforce the Plan of Iguala The plan was so broad that it pleased both patriots and loyalists The goal of independence and the protection of Roman Catholicism brought together all factions

Iturbides army was joined by rebel forces from all over Mexico When the rebels victory became certain the viceroy resigned On August 24 1821 representatives of the Spanish crown and Iturbide signed the Treaty of Crdoba This recognized Mexican independence under the terms of the Plan of Iguala 

On September 27 the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City The next day Iturbide proclaimed the independence of the Mexican Empire 

On the night of the May 18 1822 a mass of people marched through the streets They demanded that their commander in chief Iturbide accept the throne The next day the congress declared Iturbide emperor of Mexico

Plausible deniability is a goal sometimes used by the governments that are called world powers especially in the 21st century If one government does something wrong or evil plausible deniability means how much that government is able to convince people the denial or lie that it didnt cause it or know anything about it

Example

Country 1 desires to rob the natural resources of Country 2 Soon many insults lying accusations or other bad stories are heard around the world about Country 2 Then many more wrong things are done to the leaders government and people of Country 2 Even if it seems clear that the cause of all these problems is Country 1 as long as the leader of Country 1 can say I didnt know anything order anything or plan anything his denial of responsibility can fool the people for a little while 

But in the long run the denial often doesnt work In past history this method was used in the 20th century by totalitarian leaders like Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin while it was considered reprehensible by most civilized peoples

Vermiculite is a mineral that is dug out of the ground in China South Africa Russia and Brazil When it is dug from the ground it is a hard rock Vermiculite gets bigger when it is heated and changes into a material that looks like worms This was first done in the United States of America in the year 1824

When Vermiculite has changed into small grains it is a very good material for insulation and is used to stop the escape of heat in things like ovens furnaces and houses in cold countries It is also very good at holding water so it is used in the soil of plants in pots and helping to grow seeds

Because the Vermiculite grains are spongy but not hard they are used inside cases or boxes to protect articles from breakage when they are being transported

Vermiculite is also used in hydroponics as a material for the roots of plants to hold on to

Because it does not burn Vermiculite is used with other materials in fillings in walls or ceilings to stop the spread of fire 

Although vermiculite is not a form of asbestos it is often contaminated with asbestos Any vermiculite insulation found in a building should be treated as containing asbestos until confirmed otherwise by a laboratory

Peter Le Lievre was a Guernsey Artist Wine Merchant and Militia Officer

Peter Le Lievre was educated at Elizabeth College he never married and lived all his life at 17 Hauteville St Peter Port with his two sisters

Although known today as an artist Le Lievre was better known in his day as a businessman and as the Lt Col of the Artillery Regiment in the Guernsey Militia He did however design two lighthouses for St Peter Port harbour and some of his works were published in his lifetime It was only after the death of his sister Mary in 1904 that his works were exhibited publicly His work has gained in popularity since then In June 2010 a Blue Plaque to commemorate his life was unveiled at 17 Hauteville 

The Blue Plaque is a scheme for remembering the links between famous people and buildings by placing plaques on the walls The scheme was started by the Royal Society of Arts in London and the very first plaques was in fact of red terracotta placed on the outside of a former home of Lord Byron 

The Society erected 36 plaques between 1866  1901 responsibility for them was transferred to the London County Council and later the Greater London Council and most recently English Heritage Similar schemes are now operated in all the constituent countries of the United Kingdom 

English Heritage looks after the Blue plaque scheme in the London Boroughs Similar schemes exist outside London run by each local authority The system has been adopted outside the United Kingdom too for example in June 2010 a Blue Plaque was put on the home of Guernsey artist Peter Le Lievre

Burhou is a small island approximately ifeqonpadleftFORMATNUM14R160ifeqexpr00padleftFORMATNUM3R160convertif1miFORMATNUM14Rifeqexpr0000rifeqspuserredLoffAoffDbSoffs3 northwest of Alderney that is part of the Channel Islands No one lives on Burhou and it is a bird sanctuary so landing there is banned from 15 March to 27 July The islands wildlife includes a colony of puffins and large numbers of rabbits

It has no landing stage as such but visitors use a small inlet In rough weather it may be impossible to land

The Guernsey botanist ED Marquand called it the most desolate and lonely of all the islands in our archipelago He had to spend the night there as his return journey was delayed by fog

The 1906 book The Channel Pilot states 

The States of Alderney member John Beaman has political responsibility for the island

Burhou like many other Channel Islands has the Norman suffix hou meaning a small island from the Old Norse holmr According to Dr SK Kellet Smith bur refers to a storehouse  Burhou is just the place where a fisherman would place a depository for his gear

Signs of human occupationvisitation are much older Flint flakes have been found on the island and one is currently in the Alderney Museum In 1847 FC Lukis found two standing stones but these have since been lost according to the archaeologist David Johnston

According to the Assize Roll of the 14th century Burhou was a rabbit warren and a refuge for fishermen This would have meant that there would have been some kind of shelter there as it would be difficult for the fishermen to take refuge without it

A hut was built on the island in 1820 as a shelter for fishermen and sailors at the instigation of General Le Mesurier but was destroyed during the German occupation of the Channel Islands The hut was replaced in 1953 with basic accommodation which is rented out to visitors by Alderney Harbour Office

Attempts have been made to raise sheep there In 1900 a French couple lived there for a year The soil is thin and spray often goes right over the island so the soil is very salty The island has no fresh water supply for much of the year and has to rely on shipments or formerly tanks

The islands animals are mainly birds although rabbits are long established here The island has many puffins and some storm petrels Although the latter have declined they used to nest in the cottages storm loft Roderick Dobson in Birds of the Channel Islands said that puffins had been plentiful for over a century The Birds of Guernsey by Cecil Smith states likewise The puffins have had to compete with gulls and in 1949 hundreds died from red mite infestation The rabbit holes on the island make good nesting for them

Amongst the plants noted here are sea spurry forget me nots scarlet pimpernel field bugloss bracken and nettles ED Marquand counted 18 species of plant here in 1909 but by the late twentieth century Frances Le Sueur and David McClintock found 45 which they wrote up in the Transactions of La Socit Guernesiaise

Oscillation is the repetitive variation typically in time of some measure about a central value or between two or more different states Familiar examples include a swinging pendulum and AC power The term vibration is sometimes used more narrowly to mean a mechanical oscillation but sometimes is used to be synonymous with oscillation Oscillations occur not only in physical systems but also in biological systems and in human society

Ortac is a small uninhabited islet about 5 km West of the coast of Alderney near to the islet of Burhou It measures about 50 by 70 metres

AH Ewen thinks that the rocks name meant large rock at the edge from the Norman language Or Etac Alexander Deschamps said that the French used to call it the Eagles Nest

Ortac and Alderney along with the Casquets are part of the same sandstone ridge

Paul Naftel a Guernsey artist drew Ortac and the drawing appeared in Ansted Lathams book The Channel Islands The writers themselves commented 

If the sea bottom which is in very few parts as much as 20 fathoms deep were elevated 120 feet the island of Alderney the Burhou and Ortac group and the Casquets would be connected by low land and form a narrow island around 12 miles long

The 1906 book The Channel Pilot states 

Between Ortac Verte Tte and Burhou Island are scattered many dangerous rocks and ledges among which the streams run with great velocity

It also supposedly contains a cave known as the Oven

Victor Hugo who lived on Guernsey and who wrote much about the Channel Islands says in his novel The Laughing Man

on the port bow arose standing stark cut out on the background of mist a tall opaque mass vertical right angled a tower of the abyss It was the Ortac rock The Ortac all of a piece rises up in a straight line to eighty feet above the angry beating of the waves An immovable cliff it plunges its rectilinear planes apeak into the numberless serpentine coils of the sea At night it stands an enormous block resting on the folds of a huge black sheet In time of storm it awaits the stroke of the axe which is the thunderclap

To be wrecked on the Casquets is to be cut into ribbons to strike on the Ortac is to be crushed into powder On a straight frontage such of that of the Ortac neither the wave nor the cannon ball can ricochet if the wave carries the vessel on the rock she breaks on it and is lost

Meanwhile in another work The Toilers of the Sea he mentions the curious anecdote that Ortac was inhabited by Saint Malo

The Norman fishermen who frequent the Channel have many precautions to take at sea by reason of the illusions with which Satan environs them It has long been an article of popular faith that Saint Maclou inhabited the great square rock called Ortac in the sea between Alderney and the Casquets and many old sailors used to declare that they had often seen him there seated and reading a book Accordingly the sailors as they passed were in the habit of kneeling many times before the Ortac rock until the day when the fable was destroyed and the truth took its place For it has been discovered and is now well established that the lonely inhabitant Of the rock is not a saint but a devil This evil spirit whose name is Jochmus had the impudence to pass himself of for many centuries as Saint Maclou Even the Church herself is not proof against snares of this kind The demons Ragubel Oribel and Tobiel were regarded as saints until the year 745 when Pope Zachary having at length exposed them turned them out of saintly company This sort of weeding of the saintly calendar is certainly very useful but it can only be practiced by very accomplished judges of devils and their ways

Ortac is noted for its large gannet colony This is of fairly recent origin On 19 June 1940 Major JAA Wallace was preparing for the evacuation of Alderney and went there to inspect the kittiwake colony He found only one gannet He found none on Les Etacs off Alderney Now both swarm with the birds

In 1979 a mission with two naval helicopters was launched to remove nets and rubbish used in nests and which were trapped

Romeo 41 is an Airway over the English Channel from the Channel Islands Control Area to the Solent Control Area There is a reporting point named ORTAC at southern boundary between Romeo 41 and the Channel Islands Control Zone Its position is 49 59 57N 2 0 18W which is about 30 miles north north east of Alderney This is not coincident with the islet named Ortac but its name is undoubtedly derived from the islet 

Many Standard Instrument Approach and Departure Procedures into Channel Islands airports use ORTAC as part of the procedure A typical clearance for an Aurigny flight from Alderney to Southampton will read as follows Ayline 123 your clearance is to the Northern Zone boundary via ORTAC on track Romeo 41

Anti Gaddafi tribes   UN member states enforcing UNSC Resolution 1973

The Libyan Civil War was a war in Libya during the year 2011 It began 17 February 2011 when many Libyans tired of Muammar al Gaddafis 42 year rule protested against him Gaddafi responded by sending troops and tanks to break up the rebellion Things worsened when Gaddhafi began censoring the internet and cut water lines and besieged many cities In response the protesters started their own government and army to fight against Gaddafi and his sons

There were many small protests of about 300 500 people throughout January but major protests didnt begin until February 14 2011 Then 3 days later the conflict escalated as thousands of people joined the protests Gaddafi vowed to hunt them down and clean Libya house by house until all Rebels are gone However even some of Gaddafis soldiers began joining the Rebels in protest 

There were small battles in February until February 24 when Gaddafi sent tanks and troops into Misrata and attacked Then on March 6 launched a counter offensive against Rebels until 12 March He regained Ras Lanuf and Brega The Rebels gained power when NATO and other countries began bombarding Gaddafis forces through airstrikes 

The Rebels launched a counter offensive on March 27 that lasted until April 1 The Rebels regained a few cities but nothing big

Since late April most battles in Libya have died down and there has been less fighting

The Battle of Misrata was the fiercest battle in the civil war The Hamza Brigade fought for Gaddafi against the Rebels from 24 February to 11 March until on 12 March The Khamis Brigade run by Gaddafis son Khamis rolled in and nearly destroyed the entire city Later NATO and the Rebels won the battle and took control of the city

As soon as the Rebels began attacking loyalist forces they started their own government the National Transitional Council

The Battle of PasschendaeletagrefBattle of Passchendaele is the most used name for the campaign in English but is not used everywhere Third Battle of Ypres was the name used by the British Official History of the First World War The German history uses the words Third Flanders Battle while the French know it as Second Battle of Flanders groupNote was one of the biggest battles of the First World War It happened between July and November 1917 Allied troops attacked the German Army in many operations The Allies were commanded by British leaders The battle was fought for control of a village named PasschendaeletagrefPasschendaele is now called PassendalegroupNote Passchendaele is near the town of Ypres in West Flanders Belgium The purpose of the battle was to wear out the enemy and to secure the Belgian coast and connect with the Dutch front lines The British commander was Douglas Haig He planned the battle in three parts These were capturing Passchendaele Ridge moving to capture Roeselare and Operation Hush In Operation Hush marines were to land somewhere on the Belgian coast and there would be a breakout attack from Nieuwpoort and the Yser bridgehead The battle was also supposed to distract the German army from the French army in the Aisne This was good because many of their soldiers were running away 

The British launched many massive attacks They were helped a lot by artillery aircraft and sometimes tanks The British win This is because they were up against a large and modern German defence The British and French armies eventually became tactically better and were close to winning later in the year

The battle was made up of bite and hold attacks This captured ground that could be useful It also wore down the German army with attacks and counter attacks by the German army to stop the Allied attacks and take back ground It lasted until the Canadian Corps captured Passchendaele on 6 November 1917 The battle ended on 10 November apart from small operations Causing huge casualties for the Germans the Allies had captured 5 miles of some of the best defended territory in the world They lost 140000 men This is a ratio of about 2 inches of ground taken by every dead soldier The Germans took back the lost ground when the line was shortened five months later during the Battle of the Lys losing it forever on 28 September 1918

Passchendaele has become popular with the misery of grinding attrition warfare This type of warfare was often fought in thick mud The land between Dixmude and the river Lys was crossed by streams and ditches that were used for drainage Most of these flowed west moving towards the YpresCommines canal which went north south The land was flat and swampy but for good drainage August 1917 was very cold and wet This was not usual Very big artillery strikes had also destroyed the ground surface There were times where it was dry It was most dry in September but mud was still in parts of the battlefield Tanks got stuck in mud and some soldiers and horses drowned in it 

Ridges went in a curve pattern from south of Ypres east then north to Passchendaele and Staden They were sixty metres high at the most This high ground had been fought over a lot since 1914

Many historians have different opinions on this battle Most of this debate is in Britain The volume of the British Official History of the War that wrote about the Battle of Passchendaele was the last ever published Some people say that it was written to make Field Marshal Douglas Haig look better and to make General Hubert Gough the commander of the Fifth Army look worse The many dead and injured men the British Army had only to capture a very small amount of land have made many historians follow the example of David Lloyd George the British Prime Minister at the time and use it as an example of wasting soldiers and being a bad leader Lloyd George who was almost certainly affected by Basil Liddell Hart wrote 100 pages of memoires to a review of British generalship at Third Ypres

There is also a revisionist way of thinking which tries to say that the British Army did well in the battle Revisionists say that the British caused many casualties in the German Army helped the French and came up with attack tactics which could win against German defences These tactics made the Germans want winter to come badly Revisionist say that that these things were important in winning the war in 1918

Death and injury amounts for the battle are still not decided on Some people say that the Allies suffered much heavier losses than the Germans Others say different things However nobody says that hundreds of thousands of soldiers on both sides were not killed or hurt The last survivor of the battle Private Harry Patch died on 25 July 2009

From time to time my travels took me out to California to the San Francisco area When they did Id try to go up to Sacramento to Beale Air Force Base to visit my brother

Milankovich cycles are small slow but regular changes in the Earths orbit round the Sun and the tilt of the Earths axis 

The dynamics are complex The changes affect the insolation This leads to cycles of climate on Earth at about 21000 41000 years 100000 and 400000 years This whole field is still under active research

Using applied mathematics Milankovi predicted that variations in eccentricity axial tilt and precession of the Earths orbit caused climate patterns on Earth

Earths orbit is an ellipse The eccentricity is a measure of the departure of this ellipse from circularity The shape of the Earths orbit varies in time between nearly circular and mildly elliptical 

The angle of the Earths axial tilt varies with respect to the plane of the Earths orbit 

When the obliquity increases the summers in both hemispheres receive more heat and light from the Sun and winters less Conversely when the obliquity decreases summers receive less sunshine and winters more

Precession is the wobble of the Earths axis This gyroscopic motion is due to the tidal forces exerted by the sun and the moon on the solid Earth which has the shape of an oblate spheroid rather than a sphere The sun and moon contribute roughly equally to this effect

When the axis points toward the Sun one polar hemisphere has a greater difference between the seasons while the other has milder seasons The hemisphere that is in summer at perihelion receives much of the corresponding increase in solar radiation but that same hemisphere in winter at aphelion has a colder winter The other hemisphere will have a relatively warmer winter and cooler summer

Planets orbiting the Sun follow elliptical orbits that rotate gradually over time 

In addition the orbital ellipse itself precesses in space primarily as a result of interactions with Jupiter and Saturn This shortens the period of the precession of the equinoxes from 257715 to 21636 years

The inclination of Earths orbit drifts up and down relative to its present orbit with a cycle having a period of about 70000 years Milankovitch did not study this three dimensional movement This movement is known as precession of the ecliptic or planetary precession

Researchers noted this drift and also that the orbit moves relative to the orbits of the other planets The invariable plane the plane that represents the angular momentum of the Solar System is approximately the orbital plane of Jupiter The inclination of the Earths orbit has a 100000 year cycle relative to the invariable plane This is very similar to the 100000 year eccentricity period This 100000 year cycle closely matches the 100000 year pattern of ice ages

It has been proposed that a disk of dust and other debris exists in the plane which affects the Earths climate The Earth moves through this plane around January 9 and July 9 when there is an increase in radar detected meteors and meteor related noctilucent clouds

A study of the Antarctic ice cores using oxygen nitrogen ratios in air bubbles trapped in the ice concluded that the climatic response documented in the ice cores was driven by Northern hemisphere insolation as proposed by the Milankovitch hypothesis This is an additional validation of the Milankovitch hypothesis by a relatively new method It is not consistent with the inclination theory of the 100000 year cycle

David Muoz David Muoz is the older brother born in 1976 He is the singer and also plays some guitar

They are brothers born in Extremadura The brothers grew up listening to such bands as Los Chichos Los Chunguitos and Bordn on their trips with their parents from Cornell to Zarza Capilla where their parents were from

As they grew up Jos and David attended college for some time before deciding that it was not appropriate for them After quitting their studies they worked for a factory manufacturing automobile parts for the company SEAT It was in that factory where they began composing their earliest songs and they began to play in local bars

After playing a song for the bosses at BMG Music Espaa Estopa was given a record deal and so began their rise to fame a rise which has happened extremely quickly

At the very end of February 2011 a destructive tornado outbreak impacted 40 of the US Most tornadoes were rated EF0 or EF1 yet there were tornadoes rated EF2 In the evening of April 26 dangerous supercells formed over New Mexico Then during the night the supercells merged into a squall line over Texas On April 27 the squall line became spread out over Arkansas Louisiana and Missouri Then more severe thunderstorms formed over Illinois The severe thunderstorms later moved on into Indiana and then into Ohio Those severe thunderstorms produced tornaoes mainly over Tennessee and Kentucky Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes also impacted Mississippi During the night the storms moved towards the Atlantic On February 28 Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes impacted West Virginia Virginia and the Carolina Then severe thunderstorms also developed across parts of Maryland Delaware and even Southern New Jersey Those storms also produced some tornadoes To the North heavy rain impacted those areas Heavy snow and blizzard conditions developed around Maine

Heavy rain impacted areas to the North of the tornado outbreak The heavy rain caused flooding with a widespread 1 to 2 inches of rain

In Maine heavy snow developed with blizzard conditions A widespread 10 to 20 inches of snow fell across Maine along with strong winds

A rainband is an area of rainfall where all the clouds and precipitation are stretched out in a long line or band Rainbands can be stratiform or convective They are caused by differences in temperature When seen on a weather radar the long narrow shape is called a banded structure Rainbands in a tropical cyclone are curved and may even spiral around the center of the cyclone Tropical cyclone rainbands include rain showers and thunderstorms When this includes an eyewall and the eye they make a hurricane or tropical storm The size of rainbands around a tropical cyclone helps to measure the cyclones intensity

Rainbands that form near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which can produce tornadoes The shape of rainbands linked with cold fronts can be changed by mountains The mountains block the winds which can then form a low level barrier jet Bands of thunderstorms can form when sea breeze and land breezes meet if enough moisture is present Sometimes sea breeze rainbands which are ahead of a cold front can hide the location of the cold front itself Rainbands in an extratropical cyclone can cause large amounts of rain or snow Behind extratropical cyclones rainbands can form downwind of large warmer bodies of water such as the Great Lakes If the air is cold enough these rainbands can cause heavy snowfalls

Rainbands ahead of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts have little upward motion They tend to be wide and stratiform in nature In an atmosphere with rich low level moisture and vertical wind shear narrow convective rainbands form These are known as squall lines and are usually in the cyclones warm sector ahead of strong cold fronts associated with extratropical cyclones Wider rain bands can form behind cold fronts which usually have more stratiform and less convective precipitation In colder cyclones small bands of heavy snow can occur with a width of convert20mikm to convert50mikm These bands are linked with areas of frontogensis or zones of strengthening temperature contrast The curved air flow from extratropical cyclones bringing cold air across the relatively warm Great Lakes can lead to narrow lake effect snow bands These can bring heavy localized snowfalls

Rainbands exist on the edges of tropical cyclones and point towards the cyclones center of low pressure Rainbands within tropical cyclones need moisture and a low level pool of cooler air Bands located convert80kmmi to convert150kmmi from a cyclones center move outward They can cause heavy rains and squalls of wind as well as tornadoes Some rainbands move closer to the center forming a secondary or outer eyewall within intense hurricanes Spiral rainbands are such a basic part of a tropical cyclone that in most tropical cyclone basins use of the satellite based Dvorak technique is the main method used to determine a tropical cyclones maximum sustained winds Using this method the area of spiral banding and difference in temperature between the eye and eyewall is used to estimate the maximum sustained wind and a central pressure 

Convective rainbands can form parallel mountains on their windward side This is due to lee waves triggered by hills just upstream of the clouds formation Their spacing is normally convert5kmmi to convert10kmmi apart When rainbands near frontal zones get close to steep mountains a low level barrier jet stream forms parallel to and just before the mountain ridge This slows down the frontal rainband just before the mountain barrier If enough moisture is present sea breeze and land breeze fronts can form convective rainbands Sea breeze front thunderstorm lines can become strong enough to hide the location of an approaching cold front by evening The edge of ocean currents can cause thunderstorm bands due to heat differences where they meet Downwind of islands rainbands can form when low level winds meet downwind of the island edges Offshore California this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts

The FB Frauenliga is the highest level of Women soccer in Austria The most successful team was USC Landhaus Wien with 12 titels in the last years SV Neulengbach was the best club in Austria winning all titels from 200304 on

Women football was played in Austria actually before the Second World War In 1936 the first championship was organized by the sterreichische Damenfuball Union with 9 teams from the Vienna area But after the occupation of Austria by Nazi Germany it was suppressed This continued till the end of the 1960s In 1968 USC Landhaus Wien was one of the first women soccer clubs in Autria In 1972 the first women championship after the war was organized by the Vienna Football Union 1980 the first pure women soccer club was founded In 1982 the FB organized the championship for the first time Actually 334 teams are playing in 5 divisions Also the number of players increased from 7 000 to around 17 000

The Middle Jurassic is the second epoch of the Jurassic period It lasted from 176 161 million years ago

In the Middle Jurassic Pangaea began to split apart It began to separate into Laurasia and Gondwana and the Atlantic Ocean formed Tectonic activities closed the Paleo Tethys Ocean A subduction zone on the coast of western North America continues to create the ancestral Rocky Mountains

During this time marine life flourished Ichthyosaurs although common are reduced in diversity A type of crocodilians first appeared

Plesiosaurs became common at this time The top marine predators the pliosaurs grew to the size of killer whales and larger eg Pliosaurus Liopleurodon 

New types of dinosaurs evolved on land Cetiosaurus was an early sauropod found in England in the mid 19th century 

The environment in which Cetiosaurus lived was floodplain and open woodland Brachiosaurs Megalosaurus and Hypsilophodon also lived in this environment

The cynodont therapsids flourished with the dinosaurs but they were only shrew sized None grew larger than a badger One group of cynodonts the Trithelodonts were becoming rare and eventually became extinct at the end of this epoch The Tritylodonts were still common though In this epoch true mammals evolved from a group of cynodonts

Conifers were dominant in the Middle Jurassic Other plants such as ginkgoes cycads and ferns were also common These are the trees which the large herbivores ate

The Club des Hashischins the Hashish Club was a Parisian group who explored using drugs mainly hashish to get creative ideas 

It was active from about 1844 to 1849 Some of the most important literary and intellectual people in Paris were members They including Dr Jacques Joseph Moreau Thophile Gautier Charles Baudelaire Victor Hugo Honor de Balzac Grard de Nerval Eugne Delacroix and Alexandre Dumas pre Monthly sances were held at the Htel de Lauzun on the le Saint Louis

Gautier wrote about the club in an article called the Le Club des Hachichin published in the Revue des Deux Mondes in February 1846 While he is often said to have started the club in the article he says he was attending their sances for the first time that evening

The group dressed up in Arab clothing They drank coffee and added hashish cinnamon cloves nutmeg pistachio sugar orange juice butter and cantharides It was a thick green mixture like a jam

Dr Moreau wrote a book in 1846 about the cannabis and the drug taking experiments of the club The 439 page book was called Hashish and Mental Illness  Psychological Studies Baudelaire wrote that while the drug did give people ideas it quickly affected their personality They felt they could only create while under the influence of the drug

Cominform is an organisation set up in 1947 to coordinate the European Communist parties It was actually an organisation which enabled the Communist Party in the USSR to control the other Communist parties in Europe

A surveyor is a person who has the skills to accurately find out the position of points and the distances and angles between them These points are usually positions on the surface of the Earth Finding these points is called surveying Surveyors are needed to make land maps and boundaries for ownership of land In order to find the information they need surveyors use geometry engineering trigonometry mathematics physics and law

There are different types of surveyor A construction or building surveyor is the person who has to make sure that buildings are being put up in the correct place and fit in with planning and building laws A quantity surveyor is the person who keeps track of costs on a building project A hydrographic surveyor measures points to do with water such as rivers lakes and oceans A marine surveyor is a person who inspects ships A mine surveyor is the person who finds out the position of underground mines for example gold mines or coal mines

2005 he went from Brazil to Israel where he started playing for Hapoel Kfar Saba and soon became one of the best defenders in the league After four years with this club he went one to an Israelian top club Hapoel Tel Aviv because his old club was relegated to the second league With Tel Aviv he became cup winner and champion in 2010 They also played in the UEFA Champions league 201011 after eliminating Red Bull Salzburg in the play off round He played in the Champions league group stage but in December 2010 he signed with FC Red Bull SalzburgIn a preliminary match he was injured badly so he missed the whole second part of the 201011 season

The Ustae or Ustashas or Ustashi was a Croatian racist terrorist and Nazi like movement It was engaged in terrorist activities before World War II Under protection of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany Ustae ruled a part of Yugoslavia after that country was occupied by the Axis powers At the end of World War II the Ustae were defeated and expelled by the Yugoslav Partisans

Croatian politician Stjepan Radi was shot on October 1928 and died a month later Alexander I King of Yugoslavia imposed royal dictatorship in January 1929 and prohibited all political parties Ante Paveli left the country for Vienna He and Gustav Perec a former Austro Hungarian lieutenant colonel established contact with organization of Macedonian political emigres These two groups agreed to coordinate their political activities for achieving full independence for Macedonia and Croatia There and then Paveli secretly met with the leader of outlawed Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization Ivan Mikhailov a declared enemy of Yugoslavia and made agreement with him to cooperate against Yugoslav state

Due to these circumstances the Court for the Preservation of the State in Belgrade sentenced Paveli and Perec to death on 17 July 1929 The exiles started organizing support for their cause among the Croatian emigration in Europe North and South America Ustae organization was small in numbers and was organized in military patterns They fought Yugoslav statehood by means of terror

The roots of the Ustae ideology were in the Croatian nationalism of the nineteenth century The Ustae ideological system was chiefly based on the traditional pure Croatian nationalism of Ante Starevi About it W Safran wroteBut another vision of Croatian identity that was closely tied to the Catholic Church and the Vatican and was led by an ex seminarist Ante Starcevic became the ideological precursor to the Ustase Starcevic and his followers emphasized the high achievements of Western Catholic Croatian culture while Serbian culture was depicted as oriental and inferior Starevis racism was further fully elaborated by Ustaa Ivo Pilar under pseudonym L von Sdland His book was translated into Croatian language in the year of 1943 by Pavelis regime as one of the tenets of his Ustae and his Independent State of CroatiaAt the same time the Ustae borrowed from traditional Croatian nationalism the National Socialism of Hitler the fascism of Mussolini and even from the program of the Croatian Peasant Party The Ustae aimed at an ethnically pure Croatia and saw the Serbs that lived in Croatia Bosnia and Herzegovina as their biggest obstacle Along that line Ustae ministers Mile Budak Mirko Puk and Milovan ani will declare in May 1941 that the goal of the new Ustae policy was an ethnically clean Croatia They also publicly announced the strategy to achieve their goal which resembles to the bloodiest religious wars A third must become Catholic a third must leave the country and a third must die

The Ustae persecuted the Serbs who were Orthodox Christians yet they were tolerant toward the Bosnian Muslims claiming that the Muslims were actually ethnic Croats that converted to Islam during the Ottoman Turk occupation of Bosnia The state even converted a former museum in Zagreb for use as a mosque The basic principles of the movement were laid out by Paveli in his 1929 pamphlet Principles of the Ustae Movement

A problem with the Nazi ideology was that the Croats are Slavs and were considered inferior by Nazi standards Ustae ideology thus created a theory about a pseudo Gothic origin of the Croats in order to raise their standing on the Aryan ladder

At Janka Puszta training facility in Hungary IMRO terrorists trained Ustae operatives in bomb making and conspirational activities The Ustae put knowledge to immediate use carrying out about half dozen assassinations of Yugoslavian officials or pro Serb civilians and a dozen bombings of trains including the Orient Express and other public targets during the first four years of its existence This caused the Yugoslav Government to complain to the League of Nations and forced Hungary to close down Janka Pusta Ustae training camp Internal power struggle and discovery that Perecs mistress was a Yugoslav police informant will lead to the Perec assassination by Paveli in 1933 

The Ustae received the most funds from Mussolini who also supplied the group with an Italian headquarters that changed location whenever Yugoslavia managed to track it down Camps for training terrorists and saboteurs were set up in Italy chiefly at Brescia and Borgotaro An armed insurrection was attempted in 1933 when the Ustae armed by the Italians attempted to invade the country by crossing the Adriatic sea in motorboats This was unsuccessful but its lack of success probably was instrumental in the decision to assassinate King Alexander I of Yugoslavia 

Two attempts were made the last one successful and Alexander was slain at Marseilles 9 October 1934 along with the French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou In the wake of the assassination Mussolini renounced the Ustae and the group went deeply underground The singular lack of armed protection afforded to the Yugoslav monarch and the general laxity of security precautions when it was well known that one attempt had already been made on Alexanders life are grim tributes to Paveli organizational abilities he had apparently been able to bribe a high official in the Surete General The Prefect of Police of Marseilles Jouhannaud was subsequently removed from office

The assassin was Vlada Georgief Cernozemski a Bulgarian who had already killed two members of the Bulgarian Parliament in Sofia His accomplices were arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment Pavelic was condemned to death by France but managed to escape

Yugoslavia brought charges against Hungary and Italy before the League of Nations in November 1934 offering evidence that Italy and Hungary had openly conspired against her sovereignty League of Nations did not discussed the Italian conspiracy against national sovereignty of Yugoslavia Moreover Italy refused to extradite Paveli and Kvaternik to either France or Yugoslavia and Hungary bore the brunt of the charges 

After the assassination the Ustae activities were prevented completely A great number of Ustae was caught and arrested in Italy Germany and Hungary Italy interned many Ustashe to the Lipari camp where many died Janka Puszta Ustae camp was raided by Hungarian police which ended in arresting some of them Ustae from Germany escaped to Switzerland France and England

Widespread outrage at the assassination of Alexander and Barthou led to the first international efforts to combat terrorism since the St Petersburg Protocol of 1904 The issue was taken up by the League of nations which passed the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism in 1937

After March 1937 when Italy and Yugoslavia signed a pact of friendship many Ustae in Italy were extradited to Yugoslavia

The Axis Powers invaded Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941 On April 10 the most senior home based Ustaa Slavko Kvaternik took control of the police in Zagreb and in a radio broadcast that day proclaimed the formation of the Independent State of Croatia Maek issued a statement that day calling on all Croatians to co operate with the new authorities

Meanwhile Paveli and several hundred Ustae left their camps in Italy for Zagreb where Paveli set up his government on 17 April He accorded himself the title of Poglavnik  which was equivalent to Fhrer or Headman in English Pavelis Independent State of Croatia comprised territory of Croatia Srem and Bosnia Herzegovina  except parts of the Dalmatian coast and islands which were ceded to the Italians De facto control over this territory varied for the majority of the war as the Partisans grew more successful while the Germans and Italians increasingly exercised direct control over areas of their interest 

All who opposed andor threatened the Ustae were outlawed In early 1941 Jews and Serbs were ordered to leave certain areas of Zagreb

Paveli first met with Adolf Hitler on 6 June 1941 Mile Budak then a minister in Pavelis government publicly proclaimed the violent racial policy of the state on 22 July 1941 Maks Luburi one of the chiefs of the secret police started building concentration camps in the summer of the same year Ustae activities in villages across the Dinaric Alps led to the Italians and the Germans expressing disquiet As early as July 10 1941 Wehrmacht General Edmund Glaise von Horstenau reported the following to the German High Command the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht

A Gestapo report to Reichsfhrer SS Heinrich Himmler dated February 17 1942 stated that

Italian troops in the field had competing territorial claims with their Ustae allies and had cooperated from the start with Chetnik units operating in the southern areas that they controlled Hitler tried to insist that Mussolini should have his forces work with the Ustae but senior Italian commanders such as General Mario Roatta ignored such orders

The Ustae enacted race laws patterned after those of the Third Reich which were aimed against Jews and Roma and Serbs who were collectively declared enemies of the Croatian people Serbs Jews Roma and anti fascists including Communist and dissident Croat Byzantine Catholic priests were interned in concentration camps the largest of which was the Jasenovac complex where many were killed by Ustae militia The exact number of victims is not known The number of murdered Jews is fairly reliable around 32000 Jews were killed during World War II on NDH territory Gypsies numbered around 40000 fewer after the war Of the number of Serbs who died estimates tend to vary between 300000 and 700000

The history textbooks in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia cited 700000 as the total number of victims at Jasenovac According to the Simon Wiesenthal Center Ustasa terrorists killed 500000 Serbs expelled 250000 and forced 250000 to convert to Catholicism They murdered thousands of Jews and Gypsies 

The Jasenovac Memorial Area currently headed by Slavko Goldstein keeps a list of 59188 names of Jasenovac victims that was gathered by government officials in Belgrade in 1964 The previous head of the Memorial Area Simo Brdar estimated at least 365000 dead at Jasenovac 

The Belgrade Museum of Holocaust compiled a list of over 77000 names of Jasenovac victims It was previously headed by Milan Bulaji who supported the claim of a total of 700000 victims The current administration of the Museum has further expanded the list to include a bit over 80000 names During the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann Alexander Arnon testified about the treatment of Jews in Yugoslavia during the war Alexander Arnons testimony included estimates of hundreds of thousands killed in one camp

During World War II various German military commanders gave different figures for the number of Serbs Jews and others killed on the territory of the Independent State of Croatia They circulated figures of 400000 Serbs 350000 Serbs between 300000 more than 34 of a million Serbs in 1943 600 700000 until March 1944 700000

The first group of camps was formed in the spring of 1941 These included

These six camps were closed by October 1942 The Jasenovac complex was built between August 1941 and February 1942 The first two camps Krapje and Broica were closed in November 1941 The three newer camps continued to function until the end of the war

There were also other camps in

Numbers of prisoners

The Ustae held the position that Eastern Orthodoxy as a symbol of Serbian nationalism was their greatest foe The Ustae never recognized the existence of a Serb people on the territories of Croatia or Bosnia they recognized only Croats of the Eastern faith They also called Bosnian Muslims Croats of the Islamic faith but they had a stronger ethnic dislike of Serbs

Some former priests mostly Franciscans particularly in but not limited to Herzegovina and Bosnia took part in the atrocities themselves Miroslav Filipovi was a Franciscan friar who joined the Ustaa army on 7 February 1942 in a brutal massacre of 2730 Serbs of the nearby villages including 500 children He was hanged for his war crimes in his Franciscan robes Filipovi became Chief Guard of Jasenovac concentration camp where he was nicknamed Fra Sotona by the camp inmates

At the end of war Ustae continued fighting for a short while after the formal surrender of German Army Group E on 9 May 1945 and many refugees attempted to escape to Austria Paveli however with the help of associates among the Franciscans managed to escape and hide in Austria and Rome later fleeing to Argentina

The remaining Ustae went underground or fled to countries such as Canada Australia Germany and South America with the assistance of Roman Catholic churches and their grassroots supporters Some of them persisted in their crusade against Yugoslavia

With the defeat of the Independent State of Croatia the movement ceased to exist Infighting over the failure to establish a Croatian state also fragmented the surviving Ustae Ante Paveli formed the Croatian Liberation Movement which drew several of the former states leaders Vjekoslav Vrani founded a reformed Croatian Liberation Movement and was its leader Vjekoslav Luburi helped form a organization called the Croatian National Resistance Odpor became the most violent of the Ustae organizations which were born after the WWII Luburi commanded the organization for twenty five years from his refugee in Spain His organization was heavily involved in racketeering attempted murder extortion hijacking terrorist bombing and other violent crimes After his death his successors on the organization commanding post sought out criminal organization ties with La Cosa Nostra the Provisional IRA and the Croatian Mafia in San PedroOdpor was banned in Germany for terrorist activities and operated between legitimate emigre functions and a thuggish underworld Its leaders tried to distance the organization from the acts of the so called renegade elements that hijacked international flights and served prison sentences for extortion Odpor embraced a radical nationalist ideology that differed only marginally from Ustae ideology

The Odpor most spectacular terrorist action was hijacking TWA Flight 355 in September 10 1976 This terrorist action was masterminded by Zvonko Busic that time the leader of the American branch of Odpor and carried out by him and four more Croatian terrorists Busic also planted a bomb at Grand Central Station in New York An attempt to dismantle the bomb ended in blast which killed one police officer and wounding the three others All terrorists surrendered and Busic was sentenced to life in prison Other four terrorists were sentenced to various long term imprisonments

Uniformitarianism is the idea of James Hutton in his 1795 book Theory of the Earth with proofs and illustrations

In this work Hutton proposed that the causes acting on the world today also acted in the past This means that the rocks of the Earth were formed by processes which we can see operating today These processes though very slow made the world what it is today The idea is part of a wider philosophy called the philosophy of naturalism

The term uniformitarianism was invented by William Whewell in 1837 to describe Huttons basic idea This idea is the foundation of modern geology 

Huttons ideas were popularised by John Playfair in 1802 in Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth and by Charles Lyell in his Principles of Geology The phrase the present is the key to the past is Lyells most famous quotation

Uniformitarianism is opposed by catastrophism the idea that major changes in the Earth take place through sudden and violent events

Evidence for this can be found in the north Atlantic sediment cores which show poorly sorted angular and contain rocks These were originally in the icebergs but dropped to the bottom of the ocean when the icebergs melted

Heinrich events are a possible trigger to the onset of mini ice ages which follow a long period of thaw An example might be the Younger Dryas a brief cold period from about 128 thousand years ago to about 115 thousand years ago 

The Younger Dryas stadial is thought to have been caused by the collapse of the North American ice sheets although rival theories have been proposed

Randy Roth is an American murderer and thief from Washington He was found guilty of the 1991 murder of his fourth wife Cynthia Baumgartner Roth Police thought he killed his second wife Janis Roth in 1981 but he was never put on trial for that He was also found guilty of stealing from the place he worked from an insurance company and from Social Security He was sent to jail for first degree murder in 1992

Janis Miranda married Roth in March 1981 They were both divorced and raising a child on their own While they were dating Janis and Randy seemed to be a very happy couple They seemed to be very much in love After they got married they were not like that anymore Janis friends saw that she did not seem as happy as she had before Randy made sure they had a large amount of life insurance He said he wanted to be able to pay the bills if something bad happened

On the day after Thanksgiving 1981 something bad did happen Janis fell to her death from a cliff at a place called Beacon Rock Randy Roth was the only person who saw what happened What he told the police and rescue workers who came to look for her did not always make sense They could not find Janis for many hours When they found her she was not below the spot that Randy Roth said she fell from The police thought Randy might have pushed Janis off a cliff but they could not prove it The same day as the fall Randy made sure Janis would cremated The next day he made sure he would get paid the insurance money What he did not do was tell Janis family and friends that she was dead He did not even tell her own daughter for a whole week

Roth had been married three times by the time he met Cynthia Baumgartner in 1990 Baumgartner was also a single parent Her husband had died of Hodgkins Disease in 1985 Randy Roth only told her about his own dead wife because she did not believe in divorce He never told her that he had been divorced twice Cynthia found out that Roth felt a need to control everything in her life He did not want her doing anything on her own Her friends saw that the way she looked and how clean her house was was not as good as they used to be They thought that Cynthia was sorry she had married Randy Roth Roth was also abusive to all three of the boys in their house 

On July 23 1991 they took Cynthias two sons on a day trip to a big lake called Lake Sammamish This is the same lake where Ted Bundy had kidnapped two young women years before It was hot when the Roths arrived and the beach was crowded Randy and Cynthia left the boys to play in the swimming area while they paddled their convert11ft inflatable raft into deeper waters Several hours later Randy Roth came back with Cynthia She was either dead or dying from drowning Lifeguards and paramedics tried to save her and take her to a hospital She was dead when she got there Randy Roth said that waves caused by a motorboat made the raft flip over and that Cynthia drowned because of that

The police noticed that Randy Roth did not seem very upset that his wife was dead He also did not always tell the story of how she died the same way They began to think he might have killed her Once again they could not prove it right away Just like when Janis had died he did not tell her friends and family but he did start trying to collect money from the insurance company right away He had Cynthia cremated even though her parents did not want him to After a while he thought he was not going to get in any trouble but on October 8 1991 he was arrested for murdering Cynthia

The police knew it was going to be hard to get a jury to believe that Randy Roth killed his wife Nobody but Roth saw what happened and there was no way to find anything at the place where she died since it was in a lake They talked to the families of his other wives and his friends and neighbors They began to think he did it for money They also thought that he stole from people he worked for Lori Baker was a friend of Cynthias She found out that Cynthias will was missing and that Randy Roth was the last person to open the safe deposit box where it had been Luckily there was another copy When they read it they found out that Cynthia wanted her friend Lori and not Randy Roth to raise her sons if she died This made Randy Roth very angry He was hoping to get money from Social Security that they pay to children whose parents die in accidents When Lori Baker came to get the boys stuff from Randys house he yelled at her and would not let her take some of the stuff

Neighbors and an old friend of Roth told the police that Roth had faked burglaries to get money from the insurance company A girl he had lived next door to told them she had sex with Randy when she was only fifteen years old They said they never told anyone these things before because they were scared Randy Roth might do something to them

Roth had claimed that he had served in the Marines in a special forces unit in the Vietnam War He also said he had been taught how to kill someone with no weapons and without leaving any marks on them Randy Roth had been in the Marines but he worked as a file clerk in Okinawa He had never been to Vietnam or fought in a war His mother helped him get out of the Marines early 

The police also talked to people about the death of Janis Roth ten years earlier They met the police who had investigated it They found out that there were a lot of things that were the same He had said things that did not match up with other things he said He did not seem as upset as most people would be if their wife died He had her cremated right away It seemed like he had killed two of his wives and done other criminal things A judge decided they could arrest him and search his house When they searched they found many things that should not have been there Most of these things belonged to the place where Randy Roth worked He had stolen them They also found receipts from when Randy Roth had bought things he said he was given by the Marines for fighting in Vietnam In the garage they found a poem that Cynthia wrote about how Randy did not really love her They also found out that Randy Roth had called someone on the telephone Those people got to the house before the police and took some of the stolen things out of the house

The police had the raft that Randy said had flipped over They took it back to the same place at the lake and tried to get a boat to make a wave big enough to make it flip over They could not get the boat to flip over They threw bags of things into the lake that Randy said he had got back out after he got Cynthia back in the raft They found out that the things sank too fast for that to be true They also found out that Randy had a brother who was already in jail for killing a woman and that Randy had been to jail for stealing They talked to the people from Social Security and found he had told them lies to try and get money They felt like they found out about a lot of dishonest things Randy did that would make him look bad in court 

Randy Roths lawyer tried to stop the trial When that did not work he tried to get the judge to tell the other lawyers that they could not tell the jury about the other crimes Randy Roth did That did not work either 

Randys lawyer told the jury that he was just unlucky The prosecutor said he was greedy and did not care about anyone but himself 

Over one hundred people got up and talked about Randy Roth One of them told how he had taught Randy how to scuba dive and that he was a very good swimmer Roth had told the police that he was not good at swimming People who were at the lake said that when Randy came back with Cynthia that he was not in a hurry or very upset about his wife drowning Jalina Miranda was the daughter of Janis Roth She told them how Randy did not tell her for a week that her mother was dead and that he stole money from her They also heard the poem that Cynthia wrote about how Randy did not love her 

Randy Roth took the stand and talked for twenty hours It took almost a week before they were done asking him questions The prosecutor tried to get him to talk about all the lies he had told about Vietnam and other things He could not lie that any longer but he said that he was telling the truth about how Cynthia died He never got upset or angry about anything and still did not seem sad about his wife dying 

Eight and a half hours after the trial ended the jury came back and said he was guilty of murdering his wife and stealing

Beacon Rock where Janis fell and died was in a place called Skamania County They said if Randy Roth went to jail for more than fifty years they would not put him on trial for killing Janis Trials cost much money and Skamania County did not want to use that money if Roth was going to be put in jail for more than 50 years already The judge said Randy would go to jail for fifty one years Fifty years for killing Cynthia and one year for stealing He will not be able to get parole until at least 2029 Lori Baker the friend who took in Cynthia Roths sons went to court to make sure that Rany Roth and his family did not get any money from the insurance company or from selling Randy and Cynthias house Two books were written about Randy Roth and the murder These books were A Rose for Her Grave by Ann Rule and Fatal Charm by Carlton Smith

Doric order was one of the three orders of architecture in Ancient Greece the other two orders were Corinthian order and Ionic order The order was named after the style of columns used in buildings It included the base the shaft the top and the part supported at the top the architrave the frieze and the cornice Each order has its own style

Doric was the earliest style and used by the Greeks for most of their buildings and temples including the Parthenon It is believed that the style was first made using wood The style features heavy columns a saucer shaped capital on the top and no base

The numbers refer to the picture on the right

The columns are fluted which means they have about 20 grooves cut into them The top of the column the capital is made up of a group of annulets The saucer shaped piece is called the echinus Above this is a square piece of stone called the abacus on the top This supports the entablature which is about one third of the height of the column This is made up of a plain architrave and a frieze with triglyphs Between the triglyphs are square spaces called metopes which can be used for sculptures Above this is a cornice with large blocks called mutules which overhang the frieze The lower surface of these blocks are called the soffit Above this the block of stone has a plain vertical face called the corona It is finished on the top with more decorations

Part of the frieze sculptures from the Parthenon were removed in the 1800s and taken to the British Museum They are known as the Elgin Marbles

King Creole is an American movie directed by Michael Curtiz released by Paramount Pictures on July 2 1958 The film stars Elvis Presley Carolyn Jones and Walter Matthau It is Presleys fourth movie It was based on the 1952 novel by Harold Robbins A Stone for Danny Fisher

Presley plays a teenager named Danny Fisher who is forced to drop out of school to help support his father Always in trouble Danny is saved from a jail term by New Orleans saloon keeper Charlie Le Grand who gives the boy a job as a singer Soon a local gang boss Maxie Fields a shadowy figure from Dannys criminal past puts pressure on the boy insisting that Danny sing at his saloon To tempt Danny Maxie relies upon the seductive charms of his girlfriend Ronnie while Dannys true love Nellie suffers on the sidelines

Hal Wallis purchased the rights to A Stone For Danny Fisher so he could make a non musical movie starring either James Dean or Ben Gazzara After Dean died in 1955 the project did not continue In January 1957 following the success of an Off Broadway stage version of the story Presleys name was suggested as a possible replacement The character of Fisher was changed from a boxer to a singer and the story was moved from New York to New Orleans 

With filming starting in January 1958 Presley had to get special permission to delay his entry to the US Army until after filming was complete

Michael Curtiz a noted director during the golden era of the Hollywood studio system was hired for the project His famous movies included The Adventures of Robin Hood in 1938 Yankee Doodle Dandy in 1942 and in the same year Casablanca 

After seeing an early copy of the movie Presley thanked Curtiz for giving him the chance to show people he could be an actor King Creole was said to have been Presleys favorite role of his entire career He had high hopes of returning from the Army to pick up from where he had left off However despite success of the movie he never got the chance to be taken as seriously as an actor again with the exception of the westerns Charro and Flaming Star This was partly due to the success of later movies such as Blue Hawaii GI Blues and Viva Las Vegas These were all quick to make low cost box office hits They had enough songs to sell soundtrack albums and entertain the thousands of Presley fans who were more eager to see him sing than act

King Creole was the last movie Presley made during the 1950s and is often said to be his best role 

Filming took place between January 20 and March 12 1958 Twelve days after the finishing King Creole Presley joined the US Army

An artesian aquifer is an underground layer which holds groundwater under pressure This causes the water level in the well to rise to a point where the pressure is equal to the weight of water putting it under pressure This type of well is called an artesian well Water may even reach the ground surface if the natural pressure is high enough in which case the well is called a flowing artesian well 

An aquifer is a geologic layer which can hold water such as sand and gravel limestone or sandstone through which water flows and is stored An artesian aquifer is trapped between rocks or clay which causes the pressure Water returns to the aquifers when the water table at its recharge zone is at a higher elevation than the head of the well 

Fossil water aquifers can also be artesian if they are under sufficient pressure from the surrounding rocks This is similar to how many newly tapped oil wells are pressurized

Artesian wells were named after the old province of Artois in France where many artesian wells were drilled by Carthusian monks from 1126

There are artesian aquifers in many countries including Australia the USA Spain Italy the United Kingdom Fiji and Canada The Great Artesian Basin is the largest and deepest artesian basin in the world occupying 23 of the Australian continent

Molecular vibrations are one of three different kinds of motion for molecules that include translational motion and rotational motion

A vibrational motion for a molecule is when the bonds between atoms within a molecule move Think of the atoms as round balls that are attached by a spring that can stretch back and forth An example of this motion is stretching the simplest example of a vibration for a molecule and occurs between just two atoms Some examples of molecules that are like this include hydrogen H2 nitrogen N2 and oxygen O2

If the molecule has more than two atoms than things get more complicated Suppose just one more atom is added so now there are three atoms like in water H2O where the two hydrogen atoms are both attached to the central oxygen atom Remember with hydrogen there was one kind of stretching but in water there are two kinds of stretching and four other kinds of vibration called bending vibrations as shown below

The atoms in a CH2 group or molecules like water can vibrate in six different ways symmetric and antisymmetric stretching scissoring rocking wagging and twisting

symmetric stretching when the two attached atoms move away and toward the central atom at the same time

antisymmetric stretching When the two attached atoms move away and toward the central atom at the same time

scissoring Just like the name says scissoring is when the two atoms move away and toward each other

rocking This motion is like a pendulum on a clock going back and forth only here an atom is the pendulum and there are two instead of one

wagging If a person holds up their hand in front of them and puts there two fingers in a V sign and bend there wrist toward and away from them Here the tips of the fingers are the attached atoms and the wrist is the central atom

twisting This motion is like a person is walking on a treadmill where their waist is the central atom and their feet are the two attached atoms

Molecules with more than three atoms are even more complicated and have even more vibrations which are sometimes called vibrational modes Each new vibrational mode is basically a different combination of the six shown above The more atoms in the molecule the more ways they can be combined For most molecules with N atoms the number of possible vibrations for that molecule is 3N  6 while linear molecules or molecules with there atoms in a straight line have 3N 5 vibrational modes

h is plancks constant

 is frequency and represents the rate at which the bond is squished together and pulled apart again The larger the faster this rate becomes

 is the energy required to push and pull the bond together

where Delta n is the energy transition

When light of a certain frequency hits a molecule that has a vibration whose motion corresponds to the same frequency then the light gets absorbed into the molecule and the energy from the light causes the bonds to move in that specific vibrational motion By checking for light that gets absorbed scientists can tell if a certain kind of molecular bond is there and match it against a list of molecules that have that bond

However some molecules like helium and argon have only one atom and dont have any bonds This means that they wont absorb any light in the same way a molecule with more than one molecule can

The specific fields of chemistry that use molecular vibrations in their studies include infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy with IR being more widely used and having three subfields of its own These subfields are known as Near IR Mid IR and Far IR spectroscopy The following is a general list of these fields and real world applications

Near IR quantitative determination of species such as proteins fats low low molecular weight hydrocarbons and water Further use is obtained in the agricultural products food petroleum and chemical industries

Mid IRThe most popular of the IR fields is used in determining structure of organic and biochemical compounds

Far IR this field is less popular though it has found uses in inorganic studies 

Raman Is used for the qualitative and quantitative study of inorganic organic and biological systems often as a complimentary technique to IR

All the Asian Tigers tried to export things to rich industrialized nations They grew rich very quickly for decades Each nation was not a democracy and people were not very free in the the early years All of these countries later became freer and people now think Taiwan and Korea are liberal democracies  

In 1997 people started to invest money on things they shouldnt and that hurt the economies of those countries But now these countries are getting richer again  Unfortunately the bubble burst in 1997 as the financial successes lead to dangerously unwise investments and the market imploded Lack of transparency in financial practices corporate favoritism and rampant corruption meant no one really knew where their money was going and people started to notice When exports began to diminish rapidly the new foreign investors simply pulled their money out of the tiger economies and the bottom fell out Suddenly economists wondered whether they were a little too trigger happy in labeling the tiger economies such a resounding success Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman patted himself on the back for predicting back in 1994 that the whole Asian escapade was just a bubble all perspiration no inspiration 

BRIC is used to talk about the countries of Brazil Russia India and China Many economists think that all these countries are at a similar stage of economic development When people write about these countries they usually write BRICs or the BRIC countries

The acronym was invented by Jim ONeill an economist who worked for Goldman Sachs In 2001 he wrote an article that he called Building Better Global Economic BRICs People now use the acronym a lot to comple G7 developed countries to the developed countries People talk about how developed countries are becoming less important in world trade and developing countries are becoming more important

The Non Aligned Movement is an international organization who do not want to be officially aligned with or against any major power bloc In 2011 the movement had 118 members and 20 observer countries

The group was started in Belgrade in 1961 It was created by Yugoslavias President Josip Broz Tito Indias first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru Egypts second President Gamal Abdel Nasser Ghanas first president Kwame Nkrumah and Indonesias first President Sukarno All five leaders believed that developing countries should not help either the Western or Eastern blocs in the Cold War They also believed that developing countries should not be capitalist or communist but should try to find a different way to help their people

The Havana Declaration of 1979 said that the purpose is the organization is to help countries keep their the national independence sovereignty territorial integrity and security of non aligned countries in their struggle against imperialism colonialism neo colonialism racism and all forms of foreign aggression occupation domination interference or hegemony as well as against great power and bloc politics This means that they wanted to govern their countries without the capitalist or communist countries telling them how

The countries of the non aligned movement are nearly two thirds of the United Nationss members and 55 of the world population

Between summits the Non Aligned Movement is run by the secretary general elected at last summit meeting As a considerable part of the movements work is undertaken at the United Nations in New York the chair countrys ambassador to the UN is expected to devote time and effort to matters concerning the Non Aligned Movement The Coordinating Bureau also based at the UN is the main instrument for directing the work of the movements task forces committees and working groups

The following countries and organizations have observer status

Economic development is the growth of the standard of living of a countrys people from a low income country to a high income economy When the local quality of life is improved there is more economic development

When social scientists study economic development they look at a lot of things They want to know about the waves of economic development used by historians They also want to know how development in happening today They want to know why people invest more money in some countries than in others They also want to know why people are better at making things to sell in some countries than in others

One way to measure economic development is human development Human development is very important and includes the health of the people and their education This usually goes together with economic growth As people in a country become healthier and get better education they also usually get richer because healthy educated workers are more productive and richer workers can afford health and education The Human Development Index looks at how long people live how well people read how many people go to school and how much money people make

The term newly industrialized country is a socioeconomic classification used by political scientists and economists to talk about several countries around the world

NICs are countries who still are not developed countries but are doing better than other developing countries  NICs have fast growing economies and export a lot In NICs many things in the country change quickly as people from the country move to the cities to take jobs in factories

Fraternities and sororities are social groups for college students though sometimes high schools have them too They exist mostly in the United States and Europe The words frater and soror are Latin for brother and sister and used to show closeness between members They also denote whether the group is for men or women Sororities are only for women Fraternities are primarily for men but less often a fraternity can be for both men and women

Fraternities and sororities often have groups at many different schools Each fraternity or sorority is given two or three Greek letters to call themselves for example or To tell the difference between groups at different schools called chapters each chapter is given another set of Greek letters For example a woman in the Alpha Phi sorority who goes to the University of Toronto is part of the sororitys chapter Chapters sometimes have houses on or near the campus of the college the members attend that members can live in

Fraternities and sororities often participate in community service

Fraternities and sororities are often exclusive meaning people who want to join need to be invited to do so This is done during a process called rushing During a rush people who want to join a chapter will talk to current members If the member think the person rushing is a good fit for the group they will get an invitation called a bid to join the chapter If the person rushing accepts they become a pledge 

The pledging period is a time when the pledge is not yet a full member and may leave or be refused membership at any time Sometimes members of the chapter will put the pledge through trials Sometimes they are tests on the history of the fraternity they are trying to join wearing a badge with the fraternitys letters on it at all times or performing public service Sometimes the trials are cruel dangerous or humiliating If the trials are cruel it is called hazing Hazing is illegal in 44 states

After the pledging period the pledge becomes a full member of the chapter and fraternity or sorority

Fire has effects on the ecosystem where it occurs Fire ecology is about studying these effects as well as the processes that cause these fires In many ecosystems the occurrence of fire helps keep the habitat intact examples of such habitats are the North American prairie and chaparral ecosystems and the South African savanna In these ecosystems fire helps renew the habitat In such systems many plants have adapted and require fire to germinate

If the fires are suppressed inflammable debris accumulate These debris will burn less often but the wildfires they cause will be larger and more destructive 

In the United States campaigns have made people believe that wildfires are always harmful to nature This is based on the outdated belief that ecosystems grow towards an equilibrium disturbances such as fires disrupts the harmony of nature More recently research has shown that in some ecosystems fire plays an important role to make the system work properly fire also helps biodiversity of many habitats In such habitats the organisms have adapted and developed strategies to withstand the fire and use it for their purpose 

Campaigns in the United States have historically molded public opinion to believe that wildfires are always harmful to nature This view is based on the outdated belief that ecosystems progress toward an equilibrium and that any disturbance such as fire disrupts the harmony of nature More recent ecological research has shown however that fire is an integral component in the function and biodiversity of many natural habitats and that the organisms within these communities have adapted to withstand and even to exploit natural wildfire

The term seed ferns refers to several distinct groups of extinct seed plants 

The oldest fossil evidence of plants of this type is from Upper Devonian strata and they flourished particularly during the Carboniferous and Permian periods 

Pteridosperms declined during the Mesozoic Era and had mostly disappeared by the end of the Cretaceous though some fossil pteridosperm like plants seem to have survived into Eocene times in Tasmania 

The concept of the pteridosperms goes back to the late 19th century when palaeobotanists came to realise that many Carboniferous fossils resembling fern fronds had anatomical features like cycads 

British palaeobotanists made the critical discovery that some of these fronds were associated with seeds and concluded that the fronds and seeds belonged to the same plants 

Initially it was still thought that they were intermediate between the ferns and cycads and especially in the English speaking world they were referred to as seed ferns or pteridosperms Today most palaeobotanists regard them as being only distantly related to ferns and that these names are misleading but the names have nevertheless stuck

Later during the 20th century the concept of pteridosperms was expanded to include various Mesozoic groups of seed plants with fern like fronds Some palaeobotanists also included seed plant groups with entire leaves such as Glossopteris and its relatives which was clearly stretching the concept 

The seed ferns were by far the earliest seed plants and must have included the ancestors of the later plants They are spread across a range of clades and many palaeobotanists today would regard pteridosperms as little more than a paraphyletic grade group

So does the concept of pteridosperms have any value today Many palaeobotanists still use the term in an informal sense for the seed plants that are not angiosperms coniferoids ginkgophytes or cycadophytes 

This is particularly useful for extinct seed plant groups whose relationships are unknown We can call them pteridosperms with no suggestion of being a clade Also for curators or collectors the term pteridosperm is a useful shorthand for describing fern like fronds probably produced by seed plants which are often found in Palaeozoic and Mesozoic fossil floras

Robert John Riggins is a retired American football quarterback who used to play for the New York Jets and Washington Redskins of the NFL He was nicknamed The Diesel He won Super Bowl XVII with the Washington Redskins where he was also the MVP and is a member of the Redskins Ring of Fame He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1992

Glossopteris is the largest and best known genus of the extinct seed ferns

The Glossopteridales arose in the Southern Hemisphere around the beginning of the Permian Their distribution across several continents led Eduard Suess to suggest the southern continents were once together in a single supercontinent Gondwana 

These plants went on to become the dominant elements of the southern flora through the rest of the Permian but disappeared in almost all places at the end of the Permian 

The only convincing Triassic records are very earliest Triassic leaves from Nidpur India Even these records are somewhat questionable owing to faulting and complex juxtapositioning of Permian and Triassic strata at Nidpur 

Although most modern palaeobotany textbooks cite the continuation of glossopterids into later parts of the Triassic and in some cases into the Jurassic these are mistakes based on misidentification of similar leaves such as those of Gontriglossa Sagenopteris or Mexiglossa 

Glossopterids were thus one of the major casualties of the end Permian mass extinction event

The Gnetophytes are a group of seed plants with three genera Their evolutionary relationships are unclear

Creutzfeldt Jakob disease is an incurable disease of the human brain It is caused by special proteins called prions and it always leads to death There are different versions of the disease Some have genetic origins others have been acquired by coming into contact with infected tissue There is about one case per year per million inhabitants

German neurologist Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt first described the disease in 1920 Shortly after Creutzfeldt Alfons Maria Jakob also described the disease so that it is called CreutzfeldtJakob today 

An early description of familial CJD stems from the German psychiatrist and neurologist Friedrich Meggendorfer

The order Paucituberculata contains the six surviving species of shrew opossum Caenolestes is the main genus and the group as a whole may be called caenolestids

They are small shrew like marsupials of the Andes mountains of South America 

20 million years ago there were at least seven genera in South America Today just three genera remain They live in inaccessible forest and grassland regions of the high Andes 

Insectivores were absent from South America until the Great American Interchange three million years ago and are present now only in the northwestern part of the continent Shrew opossums have lost ground to the these and other placental invaders that fill the same ecological niches Nevertheless the ranges of shrew opossums and insectivores overlap broadly 

Shrew opossums are about the size of a small rat with thin limbs a long pointed snout and a slender hairy tail They are largely carnivorous being active hunters of insects earthworms and small vertebrates They have small eyes and poor sight and hunt in the early evening and at night using their hearing and long sensitive whiskers to locate prey They seem to spend much of their lives in underground burrows and on surface runways 

Largely because of their rugged inaccessible habitat they are very poorly known Recent studies suggest that they may be more common than had been thought

Lepidodendron is an extinct genus of primitive plant They were the first large land plants and a major part of the coal forest tropical flora 

They were huge over convert30mft 1abbrofflkoff and the trunks were often over convert1mftabbronlkoff in diameter 

Sometimes called giant club mosses they are actually closer to quillworts than to clubmosses

They thrived during the Pennsylvanian sub period of the Carboniferous 315300 million years years ago

The conditions were tropical swamps and rain forests of a huge river system much larger that the Amazon basin 

The river plain which was the heart of the wetland stretched across Pangaea 5000 km from eastern Canada to the Ukraine and was 700 km widep6 This would make the Pennsylvanian basin larger than any wetlands on Earth today

The rainforest system collapsed about halfway through the Pennsylvanian and was replaced by a cooler drier climate 

The wetland forests ended when the land level was raised by the pressure of the Gondwana continent against Laurussia causing the zone of contact to be raised The end of the Coal Measures marks the end of the Carboniferous period China was too far away to be affected and there the wetland forests continued for another 50 million years into the early Permianp30

Lepidodendron had tall thick trunks that rarely branched and were topped with a crown of bifurcating branches bearing clusters of leaves These leaves were long and narrow similar to large blades of grass and were spirally arranged  

The closely packed diamond shaped leaf scars left on the trunk and stems as the plant grew provide some of the most interesting and common fossils in Carboniferous shales and accompanying coal deposits These fossils look much like tire tracks or alligator skin 

The scars or leaf cushions were composed of green photosynthetic tissue evidenced by the cuticle covering and being dotted with stomata microscopic pores through which carbon dioxide from the air diffuses into plants Likewise the trunks of Lepidodendron would have been green unlike modern trees which have scaly non photosynthetic brown or gray bark

Lepidodendron has been likened to a giant herb The trunks produced very little if any wood Most structural support came from a thick bark like region This region remained around the trunk as a rigid layer that did not flake off like that of most modern trees As the tree grew the leaf cushions expanded to accommodate the increasing width of the trunk

The branches of this plant ended in cone like structures Lepidodendron did not produce seeds like many modern plants Instead it reproduced by means of spores

Garret FitzGerald was an Irish politician who was twice Taoiseach of Ireland from July 1981 to February 1982 and again from December 1982 to March 1987 FitzGerald was elected to Seanad ireann in 1965 and in 1969 to Dil ireann as a Fine Gael TD He served as Foreign Affairs Minister from 1973 to 1977 FitzGerald was the leader of Fine Gael between 1977 and 1987

He was the son of Desmond FitzGerald the first Minister for External Affairs of the Irish Free State following independence from the United Kingdom in 1922 At the time of his death FitzGerald was the President of the Institute of International and European Affairs had a column in The Irish Times and occasionally made appearances on television programmes

Garret FitzGerald was born in Dublin in 1926 into a very politically active family His father was Desmond FitzGerald and was the Minister for External Affairs at the time of his sons birth FitzGerald senior had been active in Sinn Fin during the Irish War of Independence and had been one of the founders of Cumann na nGaedheal the party formed to support the Anglo Irish Treaty of 1921 which created the Irish Free State

Although a senior figure on the pro treaty side of Irelands political divide Desmond FitzGerald had remained friendly with anti Treaty republicans such as Belfast man Sen MacEntee a minister in amon de Valeras government and father in law of Conor Cruise OBrien The families of Patrick McGilligan and Ernest Blythe were also frequent visitors to the FitzGerald household FitzGeralds mother the former Mabel Washington McConnell was a nationalist and republican of Ulster Protestant descent Her son would later describe his political objective as the creation of a pluralist Ireland where the northern Protestants of his mothers family tradition and the southern Catholics of his fathers could feel equally at home

Garret FitzGerald was educated at the Jesuit Belvedere College and University College Dublin from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1946 later returning to complete a PhD which he obtained in 1968 He was deeply interested in the politics of the Spanish Civil War and World War II A bright student who counted among his contemporaries in UCD his future political rival Charles Haughey who also knew Joan OFarrell a fellow student whom FitzGerald married in 1947

Following his university education in 1947 he started working with Aer Lingus the state airline of Ireland and became an authority on the strategic economic planning of transport During this time he wrote many newspaper articles was the Irish correspondent for the Economist Magazine and was encouraged to write on National Accounts and economics by the Features Editor in The Irish Times He remained in Aer Lingus until 1959 when after undertaking a study of the economics of Irish Industry in Trinity College Dublin he became a lecturer in economics at UCD

Fitzgerald was also qualified as a barrister from the Kings Inns of Ireland

Garret FitzGerald was eager to enter politics and it was suggested by several members of Fianna Fil including Charles Haughey and Michael Yeats that he should join that party Ultimately FitzGerald made his entry into party politics under the banner of Fine Gael He attached himself to the liberal wing of Fine Gael which rallied around the Just Society programme written by Declan Costello FitzGerald was elected to Seanad ireann in 1965 and soon built up his political profile FitzGerald was elected to Dil ireann at the 1969 general election for the Dublin South East constituency the same year he obtained his PhD for a thesis later published under the title Planning in Ireland He became an important figure almost immediately in the parliamentary party and his liberal ideas were seen as a counterweight to the conservative leader Liam Cosgrave Difference in political outlook and FitzGeralds ambitions for the Fine Gael leadership resulted in profound tensionsCitation neededdateApril 2007 between the two men In his leadership address to the 1972 Fine Gael ard fheis in Cork Citation neededdateApril 2007 Cosgrave referred to the mongrel foxes who should be rooted out of the party a reference seen by many as an attack on FitzGeralds efforts to unseat him as leader

After the 1973 general election Fine Gael came to power in a coalition government with the Labour Party with Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach FitzGerald hoped that he would take over as Minister for Finance particularly after a good performance in a pre election debate with the actual Minister for Finance George Colley However the position went to Richie Ryan with FitzGerald becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs It was a case of history repeating itself as FitzGeralds father had held that post in a government led by Liam Cosgraves father W T Cosgrave fifty years earlier His appointment to Iveagh House would have a huge effect on FitzGeralds own career and the future of Fine Gael Cosgrave was suspicious of FitzGeralds liberal ideas and believed that he had designs on the leadership During his period in foreign affairs Fitzgerald developed a good relationship with Liam Cosgrave and all the tension that had existed between them in opposition disappeared

The ministers role had changed a lot since his fathers day Ireland was no longer a member of the Commonwealth of Nations but in 1973 had joined the European Economic Community now known as the European Union FitzGerald as Foreign Minister was free from any blame due to other Ministers mishandling of the economy If anything his time at the Department of Foreign Affairs helped him to achieve the leadership of the party His innovative views energy and fluency in French won him and through him Ireland a status in European affairs far exceeding the countrys size and ensured that the first Irish Presidency of the European Council in 1975 was a noted success

In 1977 the National Coalition of Fine Gael and Labour suffered a disastrous electoral defeat in the general election Liam Cosgrave resigned as party leader and FitzGerald was chosen to succeed him In his new role as Leader of the Opposition and party leader he set about modernising and revitalising Fine Gael He immediately appointed a General Secretary to oversee all of this a tactic copied from Fianna Fil Under FitzGerald Fine Gael experienced a rapid rise in support and popularity By the November 1982 election it held only five seats fewer than Fianna Fil with Fine Gael in the Oireachtas bigger than Fianna Fil an unprecedented achievement

By the time of the 1981 general election Fine Gael had a party machine that could easily match Fianna Fils The party won 65 seats and formed a minority coalition government with the Labour Party and the support of a number of Independent TDs FitzGerald was elected Taoiseach on 30 June 1981 To the surprise of many Fitzgerald excluded Richie Ryan Richard Burke and Tom ODonnell former Fine Gael stalwarts from the cabinet 

Two fundamental problems faced FitzGerald during his first period Northern Ireland and the worsening economic situation A protest march in support of the H Block hunger strikers in July 1981 was dealt with by FitzGerald harshly On one occasion where he with relatives of the hunger strike he refused to meet the family of Bobby Sands MP the Officer Commanding of the Provisional IRA hunger strikers and the first to die on this strike along with the sister of Raymond McCreesh who had died on 21 May During the meeting two of Thomas McElwee sisters Mary and Nora broke down and left the meeting Mary McElwee stated that Hes doing nothing hes asking for suggestions Fitzgerald then ordered Gardai to remove the families from the meeting Fitzgeralds response was in the words of Eamonn Sweeney to lay all the blame for the hunger strikers on the Republican movement and to suggest an immediate unilateral end to their military campaign

The economic crisis was also a lot worse than FitzGerald had feared Fine Gael had to jettison its plans for tax cuts in the run up to the election and a draconian mid year budget was introduced almost immediately The July Budget seemed exceptionally austere for a government dependent on Independent TDs support However the second budget introduced by John Bruton led to the Governments shock defeat in Dil ireann on the evening of 27 January 1982

Viewing his defeat as a loss of support FitzGerald headed to ras an Uachtarin to ask the President Patrick Hillery to dissolve the Dil and call a general election When he got there he was told that senior opposition figures including Fianna Fil leader Charles Haughey Brian Lenihan and Sylvester Barrett had made a series of telephone calls demanding that the President refuse to grant the dissolution This would force FitzGerald to resign as Taoiseach and allow the Dil to nominate someone else for the post The President is said to have angrily rejected such pressure regarding it as gross misconduct and granted the dissolution

In the subsequent general election in February 1982 Fine Gael lost only two seats and were out of power However a third general election within eighteen months in November 1982 resulted in FitzGerald being returned as Taoiseach for a second time heading a Fine Gael Labour coalition with a working majority

Deep economic recession dominated FitzGeralds second term as well as his first The pursuit of fiscal rectitude in order to reduce a high national debt needed a firm control of public spending and Labour found this hard to accept The friendly relationship the Taoiseach developed with Tnaiste Dick Spring successfully avoided a collapse of the coalition for more than four years despite tensions between other ministers and enabled the Government to survive Fine Gael wanted to revive the economy by controlling public spending and imposing cutbacks in order to reduce the public budget deficit 

The measures proposed by FitzGeralds Minister for Finance Alan Dukes were completely unacceptable to the Labour Party which was under enormous pressure from its support base to maintain public services The two parties in Government found themselves in a stalemate position They stopped the financial crisis from worsening but could not take the decisive action that would generate economic growth With negligible economic growth and large scale unemployment the FitzGerald Government was deeply unpopular with the public The Fianna Fil opposition added to the woes of the Government by taking a decidedly opportunistic and populist line in opposing every suggested reform and cutback

As Taoiseach for a second time FitzGerald advocated a liberalisation of Irish society to create what he called the non sectarian nation of Tone and Davis His attempt to introduce divorce was defeated in a referendum although he did liberalise Irelands contraception laws A controversial Pro Life Amendment which was stated to recognise the Right to Life of the Unborn with due regard to the Equal Right to Life of the Mother was added to the Irish constitution against FitzGeralds advice in a national referendum

FitzGerald set up The New Ireland Forum in 1983 which brought together representatives of the constitutional political parties in the Republic and the nationalist SDLP from the North Although the Unionist parties spurned his invitation to join and the Forums conclusions proposing various forms of association between Northern Ireland and the Republic were rejected outright by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the Forum provided the impetus for the resumption of serious negotiations between the Irish and British governments which culminated in the Anglo Irish Agreement of November 1985 This agreement provided for a mechanism by which the Republic of Ireland could be consulted by the British Government under Margaret Thatcher regarding the governance of Northern Ireland and was bitterly opposed by Unionists in Northern Ireland whose MPs all resigned their seats in the British Parliament in protest New elections were required to be held in Northern Ireland in which the unionists lost the seat of to Seamus Mallon of the SDLP

While the Agreement was repudiated and condemned by Unionists it was said to become the basis for developing trust and common action between the governments which in time would ultimately bring about the Downing Street Declaration of 1993 and the later republican and loyalist cease fires

In 1986 FitzGerald tried to reshuffle his cabinet but certain ministers including notably Barry Desmond refused to move from his Health and Social Welfare portfolio The eventual outcome of the cabinet changes further undermined FitzGeralds authority The new Progressive Democrats party was launched at the same time by Desmond OMalley out of the divisions within Fianna Fil Ironically it struck an immediate chord with many disenchanted Fine Gael supporters who had tired of the failure to fully address the economic crisis and who yearned for a coherent rightwing policy from FitzGerald Seeing its support base under attack from the right only strengthened the resolve of FitzGeralds Fine Gael colleagues to break with the Labour Party approach despite their leaders close empathy with that party

Stymied by economic crisis FitzGerald tried to rescue some of his ambitions to reform the State and he proposed in the summer of 1986 a referendum to change the Constitution to allow for divorce The proposed amendment was mired in controversy and the many accompanying legal changes needed were not clearly presented Haughey skillfully opposed the referendum along with the Roman Catholic Church and landed interests worried about property rights The defeat of the referendum sealed the fate of the Government

In January 1987 the Labour Party members of the government withdrew from the government over disagreements due to budget proposals FitzGerald continued as Taoiseach heading a minority Fine Gael government and proposed the stringent budgetary cutbacks that Labour had blocked for some four years Fianna Fil returned to power in March 1987 after Fine Gael were heavily defeated in the 1987 general election The Progressive Democrats won some 14 seats mainly from Fine Gael Although Haughey did not have an overall majority when it came to a vote the Independent Socialist TD Tony Gregory voted against Fitzgerald but abstained on Haughey seeing Haughey as the lesser of two evils Haughey was elected Taoiseach on the casting vote of the Ceann Comhairle

FitzGerald retired as leader of Fine Gael immediately after the election by the Dil of Charles Haughey as Taoiseach to be replaced by Alan Dukes His autobiography All in a Life appeared in 1991 immediately becoming a best seller He retired completely from politics at the 1992 general election His wife Joan predeceased him dying in 1999 after a long illness

After that FitzGerald wrote a weekly column every Saturday in The Irish Times and lectured widely at home and abroad on public affairs He came out of retirement to campaign for a yes vote in the second Irish referendum on the EUs Treaty of Nice held in 2002 He held the post of Chancellor of the National University of Ireland from 1997 to 2009 In March 2000 Fitzgerald was on the Board of Directors of Electioncom when it conducted the worlds first public election ever held over the Internet which was the Arizona Democratic Primary which was won by Al Gore in that primary voter turnout increased more than 500 over the 1996 primary

FitzGerald took a leading part in the campaign for the second referendum on the EUs Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 He argued for Ireland to continue with European integration FitzGerald has been scathing of the record of the Fianna Fil led Government since 1997 on the economy and the national finances He was a frequent critic in his column in The Irish Times of the loss of competitiveness that occurred and the inflation caused by the tax cuts and excessive public spending increases of the Celtic Tiger era In 2009 FitzGerald received a new ministerial car the first and only one to be purchased by the state since an economic recession hit the country in 2008 In 2010 FitzGerald appeared on RTs Top 40 Irishmen list

In early 1999 it was revealed that some six years earlier AIB and Ansbacher Banks wrote off debts of almost IR200000 owed by FitzGerald following the collapse of the aircraft leasing company Guinness Peat Aviation in which he was a shareholder Chairman of AIB at the time Peter Sutherland was also a former director of GPA and had served as Attorney General under FitzGerald prior to FitzGerald appointing him as Irelands member of the European Commission The Moriarty Tribunal investigated this matter and compared the treatment by AIB of FitzGerald with their treatment of Charles Haughey They found no evidence of any wrongdoing indeed the Tribunal heard evidence as to the considerable hardship that FitzGerald went to  even selling his family home  to repay the debt to the best of his ability

The Tribunal concluded in their report In summary it would appear that in compromising his indebtedness with the Bank Dr Fitzgerald disposed of his only substantial asset namely his family home at Palmerston Road a property which would now be worth a considerable sum of money As in Mr Haugheys case there was a substantial discounting or forbearance shown in Dr Fitzgeralds case However in contrast with Mr Haugheys case Dr Fitzgeralds case involved the effective exhaustion of his assets in order to achieve a settlement whereas Mr Haugheys assets were retained virtually intact

On 5 May 2011 it was reported that FitzGerald was seriously ill in a Dublin hospital The Taoiseach Enda Kenny sent his regards and called him an institution He was put on a ventilator On 19 May he died aged 85 in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital in Dublin

President Mary McAleese described him as a man steeped in the history of the State who constantly strove to make Ireland a better place for all its people His thoughtful writing distinctive voice and probing intellect all combined to make him one of our national treasures Above all Garret Fitzgerald was a true public servant she said Long after he departed active politics Garret continued to contribute to public life through his voluminous writing and scholarship His weekly columns in The Irish Times were essential reading for those who sought enlightenment on the issues and debates of the day

Taoiseach Enda Kenny said Dr FitzGerald was a truly remarkable man who made a truly remarkable contribution to Ireland and that his towering intellect and enthusiasm for life will be missed by everybody He had an eternal optimism for what could be achieved in politics You could not tire him out and his belief that politics and democracy would work for peace Former Taoiseach and Fine Gael leader John Bruton said FitzGerald would stand out as a man who changed Ireland and that he had changed attitudes to in the Republic to Northern Ireland and to Europe and that he saw that Ireland could do best in Europe if it contributed creatively to goals and ambitions of other members

His death occurred during the third day of Queen Elizabeth IIs visit to the Republic of Ireland an event designed to mark the completion of the Northern Ireland peace process which arguably FitzGerald began with the Anglo Irish Agreement In response to his death the Queen said of FitzGerald I was saddened to hear this mornings news of the death of Garret FitzGerald a true statesman He made a lasting contribution to peace and will be greatly missed British Prime Minister David Cameron who was also in Ireland said of him

I watched him as a student of politics rather than someone involved in politics and he always struck me as someone who was a statesman as well as a politician someone who was in politics for all the right reasons and someone who made a huge contribution to the peace process bringing reconciliation for all that had happened in the past And I think that today of all days with the state visit and the warm relationship between Britain and Ireland that he can see that some of his work being completed

Lake Torrens National Park is a national park in South Australia 345 km north of Adelaide The park protects the area around Lake Torrens which is a large dry salt lake covering an area of 5700 square kilometres The lake is part of a large rift valley that also includes Spencer Gulf Lake Torrens has been filled with water twice in the last 150 years The lake filled in 2010 and attracted a large number of birds including 150000 Banded Stilts This bird can only breed on islands in flooded salt lakes and have only bred in South Australia seven times in the last 70 years The last known breeding was at Lake Eyre in 2000 During dry times the stilts live at the Coorong Lakes waiting for the salt lakes to flood

Lake Torrens was discovered by Edward John Eyre in 1839 For many years it was believed that Lake Torrens was a large horseshoe shaped salt lake in the northern Flinders Ranges This salt lake blocked any path to the interior The first European to get through this barrier was A C Gregory from the north in March 1858 Later in 1858 an expedition under Benjamin Herschel Babbage and Major Warburton in the north west also crossed the non existent barrier near modern Marree Eyres horseshoe lake was actually made up of six large salt lakes Lake Frome Lake Callabonna Lake Blanche Lake Gregory Lake Eyre South and Lake Torrens itself

Hominini is the tribe of Homininae that comprises Humans and two species of the genus Pan their ancestors and the extinct lineages of their common ancestor Members of the tribe are called hominins The subtribe Hominina is the human branch including genus Homo and its close relatives but not Pan All species in this tribe carry the same four blood types which can be exchanged between species

The hominins are hominids primates characterized by the straight position and the biped movement Previously they were considered like a family and today like a subtribe of whom at the moment humans only survives the Homo Fossil units are known that date from does more than 6 million years

The Summer Palace is a palace in Beijing China It is mainly dominated by Longevity Hill and the Kunming Lake It covers an expanse of 29 square kilometers three quarters of which is water 

Between 1750 and 1764 the Qing Emperor Qianlong created the Garden of Clear Ripples extending the area of the lake and carrying out other improvements based on the hill and its landscape During the Second Opium War the garden and its buildings were destroyed by the allied forces Between 1886 and 1895 it was reconstructed by Emperor Guangxu and renamed the Summer Palace for use by Empress Dowager Cixi It was damaged in 1900 by the international expeditionary force during the suppression of the Boxer Rising and restored two years later It became a public park in 1924

There are many buildings in the Summer Palace including The Cloud Dispelling Hall the Temple of Buddhist Virtue and the Sea of Wisdom Temple

The Banded Stilt Cladorhynchus leucocephalus is a nomadic stilt from Australia It gets its name from the red brown breast band found on breeding adults This is mottled or completely absent in non breeding adults and juveniles Its remaining feathers are pied and the eyes are dark brown The Banded Stilt stands between 3545 cm tall It is called the Flamingo of Australia and the Rottnest snipe on Rottnest Island though not related to true snipes

They spend much of their life on the coast in river estuaries and on tidal flats but they breed in the desert when the water conditions are suitable They lay 3 4 white brown or black eggs in nests scraped in the sand Banded Stilts breed on islands created when dry salt lakes fill with water during a flood They come to the lakes to eat the brine shrimp Paratemia The eggs of the shrimp can lie in the dry lake beds for many years until the rains fall In 200 years of European settlement in Australia Banded Stilts have only been recorded as breeding on 20 occasions In South Australia where the stilts are listed as a vulnerable species they have only bred seven times in the last 70 years In 2010 there was a huge breeding event at Lake Torrens National Park where more than 150000 birds gathered as the lake filled for only the second time in 150 years The eggs and chicks are often eaten by silver gulls In 2000 when the stilts were breeding on Lake Eyre nearly all the chicks were eaten

Brief psychotic disorder is a short illness of less than one month that has psychotic symptoms This could be like having schizophrenia symptoms for a only an hour but it can be any psychotic disorder such as delusions or hallucinations Doctors describe three types of BPD The first type is caused by some kind of traumatic stress The second type has no known cause Some psychologists believe it could be from stimulants such as caffeine morphine or any type of drug There is no known cure but staying away from caffeinated drinking may lower the risk of brief psychotic disorder The third type is caused by childbirth and usually affects mothers about four weeks after having a baby

Conduct disorder is a mental disorder in which a person habitually deliberately violates the rights of others They are typically aggressive and use threats assaults and theft They do not feel bad or guilty about hurting people and often enjoy doing so Many people with CD go on to develop antisocial personality disorder The person feels that Acting out is positive attention and in turn gives them a sense of importance Some known causes are child neglect and the loss of family member and or parent Anti psychotic therapy is recommended

Heuristics is the art of finding an adequate solution to a problem using limited knowledge and little time More formally heuristics are based on experience they can speed up the search for a solution using simple rules where a complete search cannot be done because it either takes too long or it is too difficult to do These rules often resemble rules of thumb or educated guesses 

In more precise terms heuristics are strategies using readily accessible though loosely applicable information to control problem solving in human beings and machines

Heuristics can be used in some fields of science but not in others For economics a solution that is one percent off is often acceptable a telescope that has an error of one degree is probably unusable of pointed to far away space The same telescope pointed to the window across the street will probably tolerate this error missing by one degree will not have a big impact on a short distance 

Heuristics can be used to estimate an answer which is then made more clear by performing an exact solution at a very small scale perhaps to save time money or labor on a project  for example a heuristic guess as to how much weight a bridge is expected to carry can be used to determine whether the bridge should be made of wood stone or steel and appropriate quantities of the needed material can be purchased while the exact design of the bridge is being completed

However the use of heuristics in certain very technical fields may be damaging  computer science is one example Programming a computer to perform more or less the desired actions can result in severe glitches therefore computer tasks generally must be fairly exact However there are certain areas in which computers can calculate heuristic solutions safely  for example Googles search technology relies heavily on heuristics producing near miss matches to a search query when an exact match cannot be found This enables a human user who is capable of fuzzy logic to correct for any mistakes the heuristic search produces

Hox genes are a group of related genes that determine the basic structure and orientation of an organism Hox is short for homeobox 

Hox genes are critical for the proper placement of segment structures of animals during early embryonic development

Hox genes are defined as 

In some organisms especially vertebrates the various Hox genes are very close to one another on the chromosome in groups or clusters

The order of the genes on the chromosome is the same as the expression of the genes in the developing embryo The first gene is expressed in front of the developing organism The reason for this co linearity is not yet completely understood The diagram above shows the relationship between the genes and protein expression in flies

The homeodomain protein motif is highly similar in many animals In addition homeodomains of individual Hox proteins are simila in many species

Because of this it is thought Hox gene clusters evolved from a single Hox gene via tandem gene duplication A Hox gene cluster with at least seven different Hox genes was probably present in the common ancestor of all bilateral animals

Humans have a total of 39 hox genes in clusters on four chromosomes

Who Owns My Heart is Cyrus second single It was released October 22 2010 Cyrus described it as a total dance track with a cool idea Cyrus Who Owns My Heart is a club oriented song that speaks of meeting a potential love on the dance floor The song tries not to proceed to question Who owns my heart Is it love or is it art Bill Lamb of Aboutcom thought that despite its beat the overall sound of Who Owns My Heart is faceless and dull The video starts with Cyrus asleep blindfolded on a mattress in a bedroom She wakes up and shakes on the mattress Following Cyrus goes to a bathroom her outfit is a white tank top white boy shorts a fishnet hair wrap rollers and heavy metal jewelry While in the bathroom scenes Cyrus sings as she sits on the edge of a bathtub and prepares herself for a party When the chorus comes on Cyrus appears shaking in the backseat of a limousine costumed in a low cut gold halter top black hots pants a black jacket with shoulder pads and big hair Once arrived at the mansion party she is first seen dancing ontop of a big wooden table In continuing after Cyrus dances with multiple people on the dance floor Cut scenes feature Cyrus in all prior scenes or dancing with others in the mansions study The video finishes with Cyrus back in her bedroom once again waking up

Every Rose Has Its Thorn is Cyrus third single It was a single on June 11th 2011 It was made by Poison in 1988 Mileys version is one minute and 29 seconds shorter than Poisons official song Hollywood Records is due to release Cyrus cover in June 2011 while a music video is in the works

Phase shift keying is a way of transmitting information This is done by modulating the phase of a carrier wave In such a system the amplitude of the wave does not carry any information all information is present in the phase of the signal In many cases this allows to better use the bandwidth available 

If we think of a wave as a wiggly line wiggling a specific amount of times a second and we can change at which part of the wiggle it is in Say if it is at the top of its wiggle and we straight away change it to the bottom of its wiggle this is called a phase shift We can use that change to convey information

By either changing or not changing the wave every time it gets to the top of its wiggle we can send either ones or zeros This is called Binary Phase Shift Keying If we change the phase of the wave as it reaches the top we can have this represent a 1 If we dont change it at the top we can have this represent a 0 We can use a computer and a radio to turn text into a wave like this and then send it A radio and a computer listening to this wave changing or not changing can figure out the original message being sent and turn it back into text

Binary Phase Shift Keying can be used to send computer data across radio waves quite efficiently Certain Wireless LAN standards use Phase shift keying which they sometimes couple with Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing to get higher data rates

The Pritzker Architecture Prize is given each year by the Hyatt Foundation It is for talented and significant architect who has created great projects throughout his or her life Jay A Pritzker and his wife Cindy began the award in 1979 The Pritzker family pays for the prize It is the top prize in architecture and it is often called the Nobel Prize of architecture The country race religion or political ideas of the architect are not important Winners get US100000 and a certificate Winners receive a medal The back of the medal has these words in Latinfirmitas utilitas venustas The idea comes from the Roman architect Vitruvius Before 1987 a limited edition Henry Moore sculpture came with the prize money

Martha Thorne has been the Executive Director since 2009 The director asks many people including past winners academics critics and others involved in architecture to suggest possible winners Any licensed architect can also apply for the prize before 1 November every year In 1988 Gordon Bunshaft applied for the award himself and eventually won it Five to nine jury members meet early the next year before announcing the winner in spring

The first winner was Philip Johnson The award was for 50 years of imagination and vitality shown by the many museums theaters libraries houses gardens and corporate structures The 2004 laureate Zaha Hadid was the first female prize winner Rye Nishizawa became the youngest winner in 2010 at age 44 The most recent winner in 2011 is Portuguese architect Eduardo Souto de Moura

Skin cancer is a term that is used for all bad forms of growth of the skin In everyday use people often talk about melanoma but there are other forms of skin cancer too These are usually named after the type of cell that grows uncontrollably Most skin cancers develop in the epidermis Very often a tumor can be seen so it is often possible to detect skin cancer at an early stage Very few people with skin cancer will die of the disease though it can be disfiguring Melanoma survival rates are poorer than for non melanoma skin cancer although when melanoma is diagnosed at an early stage treatment is easier and more people survive

Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed type of cancer Melanoma and non melanoma skin cancers combined are more common than lung breast colorectal and prostate cancer Melanoma is less common than both basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma but it is the most serious for example in the UK there were over 11700 new cases of melanoma in 2008 and over 2000 deaths It is the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15 34 in the UK Most cases are caused by over exposure to UV rays from the sun or sunbeds Non melanoma skin cancers are the most common skin cancers The majority of these are basal cell carcinomas These are usually localized growths caused by excessive cumulative exposure to the sun and do not tend to spread

The Dodder Cuscuta is a genus of about 100170 species of parasitic flowering plants 

Recent genetic research has shown that it is correctly placed in the morning glory family Convolvulaceae 

The genus is found throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the world Most species live in subtropical and tropical regions The genus is rare in cool temperate climates with only four species native to northern Europe

Dodder can be identified by its thin stems They look leafless with the leaves reduced to minute scales 

From mid summer to early autumn the vines can produce small fruit that take the same color as the vine and are about the size of a common pea It has very low levels of chlorophyll some species such as Cuscuta reflexa can photosynthesize slightly Others such as C europaea are entirely dependent on the host plants for nutrition 

Dodder flowers range in color from white to pink to yellow to cream Some flower in the early summer others later depending on the species The seeds are tiny and produced in large amounts They have a hard coating and can survive in the soil for 510 years or more

Dodder seeds sprout at or near the surface of the soil Germination occurs without a host but the seedling must reach a green plant quickly Dodder grows toward the smell of nearby plants 

If a plant is not reached within 5 to 10 days of germination the dodder seedling will die Before a host plant is reached the dodder as other plants relies on food reserves in the embryo the cotyledons are very small

After a dodder attaches itself to a plant it wraps itself around it If the host contains food useful to dodder the dodder produces haustoria that insert themselves into the host The original root of the dodder in the soil then dies 

The dodder can grow and attach itself to multiple plants In tropical areas it can grow continuously and may reach high into the canopy of shrubs and trees In temperate climates it is an annual plant restricted to low vegetation that can be reached by new seedlings each spring

Dodder is parasitic on a very wide variety of plants including a number of agricultural and horticultural crop species such as alfalfa flax clover potatoes chrysanthemum dahlia trumpet vine ivy and petunias among others

The Kangaroo Island Kangaroo Rosenbergs Sand Goanna Southern Brown Bandicoot Tammar Wallaby Common Brushtail Possum Short beaked Echidna and New Zealand Fur Seal are native to the island as well as six bat and frog species The sole endemic vertebrate species is a small marsupial carnivore called the Kangaroo Island Dunnart The Koala Common Ringtail Possum and Platypus have been introduced and still survive there Kangaroo Island had a native species of Emu the Kangaroo Island Emu however it became extinct between 1802 and official European settlement in 1836 perhaps owing to bushfires or from hunting by sealers or whalers

The introduced Koalas have flourished so well on the island that their preferred food source the Manna Gum is at risk of local extinction Koalas have recently been forced to turn to other less palatable species Park Management has been searching for a solution

The island is a major tourist attraction

Colugos are gliding mammals in the order Dermoptera 

There are two living species found in south east Asia They are also called flying lemurs though they are not lemurs They can glide long distances as they have a thin membrane stretched to the ends of the tail and each limb 

Colugos live in the tropical rain forests of southeast Asia Their diet includes leaves and young shoots During the day they rest high in the trees clinging to trunks or hiding in tree holes At dusk they become active gliding from trunk to trunk like sheets of paper blown on the wind The young are carried clinging to the flight membrane

Colugos range from Burma Indochina and southern Thailand to peninsular Malaysia Singapore and the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Java They also occur throughout Borneo A second colugo species inhabits the southern Philippines 

A main battle tank also called a battle tank is a tank that is used as the most powerful combat vehicle in modern armies They were made to replace the medium medium and heavy tanks used in World War II with just one tank Lighter armor made it easier to put bigger guns on tanks without adding weight Light tanks are still used in some armies that do not need large guns

MBTs are the main force in ground fights but get help from other combat vehicles and soldiers who travel in infantry combat vehicles They also get help from observation or attack aircraft

Medium tanks were the earliest MBTs MBTs started replacing medium tanks when guns on medium tanks became powerful enough to win against heavy tanks Heavy tanks could not carry armor strong enough to win against medium tanks

The nuclear weapon threat and other anti tank weapons in the Cold War made countries add more protection to survive in all types of combat Weapon designers made powerful cannons to defeat the armor

The first Soviet main battle tank was the T 64 and the first American MBT was the M60 Patton By the late 1970s MBTs were manufactured by France West Germany Britain India Japan the USSR Sweden Switzerland and the United States

The Soviet Union made MBTs very quickly because it needed them for their type of war The Soviet Union improved the cannon by replacing the loader crewman with an automatic autoloader This made the turret smaller which also makes the tank harder to see or hit The Soviet Union made missiles that could be shot much farther than other ammunition

After the Cold War American tanks quickly defeated Iraqi tanks in the Gulf War The American MBTs were still not as good as attack helicopters at destroying Iraqi tanks Some said that the MBTs could not stop an enemy force from attacking

Swami Vivekananda was the chief disciple of the Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa At birth he was called Narendranath Dutta He was the founder of Ramakrishna Mission He introduced Hindu philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga in Europe and America He brought Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the end of the 19th century Vivekananda is considered to be a major force in the revival of Hinduism in modern India He is perhaps best known for his inspiring speech beginning with Sisters and Brothers of America Through this he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the Worlds Religions at Chicago in 1893

Swami Vivekananda was born in Shimla Pally in Calcutta on 12 January 1863 He was named Narendranath Dutta His father Vishwanath Dutta was an attorney of Calcutta High Court His mother was Bhuvaneshwari Devi Narendranaths thinking and personality were influenced by his parentsthe father by his rational mind and the mother by her religious temperament From his mother he learnt the power of self control Young Naren was very expert in meditation and could enter the state of samadhi very easily He saw a light while falling asleep Once he had a vision of Buddha during his meditation During his childhood he had a great fascination for wandering ascetics and monks He was also very expert in games and naughty acts Even in his young age he showed remarkable leadership qualities

In his youth he visited the Brahmo Samaj and later he came in contact with Sri Ramakrishna Sri Ramakrishna initiated him and after his death Naren left his house He took the monk name of Swami Vivekananda and stayed at the Boranagar Monastery with his monk brothers Later he set out for touring India He wandered from place to place until he reached Trivandum and decided to attend the Paliament of Religions at Chicago He delivered the great speech at Chicago and brought Hinduism to the status of a major religion

Vivekananda became very popular after delivering lectures at many places of America and England He came back to India and founded the Ramakrishna Math and Mission in 1897 He also founded the Advaita Ashrama in Mayavati near Almora on March 19 1899 The Ashrama was a branch of the Ramakrishna Math He composed the famous arati song Khandana Bhava Bandhana during the event of consecration of Ramakrishnas temple at a devotees house at Calcutta

In June 1899 he went to the West for the second time After delivering many lectures in USA he returned to Belur Math in December 1900 He spent the last two years of his life in Belur Math His health deteriorated due to excessive work and delivering lectures He entered Mahasamadhi at ten minutes past nine PM on July 4 1902 while he was meditating

Vivekanandas books on the four Yogas are still seen as fundamental texts for anyone interested in the Hindu practice of Yoga His letters are of great literary and spiritual value He was also considered a very good singer and a poet By the time of his death He had composed many songs including his favorite song Kali The Mother He used humor for his teachings and was also an excellent cook His language is very free flowing These all works were compiled to form a 10 volume set The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda

Ashford Black Marble is a kind of dark limestone which was mined from Ashford in the Water in Derbyshire England Once cut turned and polished its shiny black surface becomes very beautiful Strictly speaking Ashford Black Marble is not a marble formed by heat but a smooth sedimentary rock a hard mass of dusty minerals To make art objects Ashford Black Marble can be cut as materials of them and put together with other fine stones Derby Museum has a diagram of Ecton Hill made from Ashford Black Marble and other minerals

Ashford Black Marble had been used for decorative purpose since the prehistoric age Bess of Hardwick was known to use Ashford Black Marble

Henry Watson played important roles in the development of the local industry of inlaying Ashford Black Marble in the 1750s He was the uncle of Derbyshire geologist White Watson and had a water powered mill at Ashford in the Water

In the late 1780s Derbyshire geologist White Watson made geological picture boards using Ashford Black Marble into which other local rocks were inlaid These boards show layers of rock in different parts of the county Derby Museum has a diagram of Ecton Hill made from Ashford Black Marble and other minerals

William Martin was once a partner with Watson and wrote the first scientific study of fossils His Petrifacta Derbiensia says that White Watsons uncle and workers at the Black Marble mine called some of the fossils crocodile tails because they thought they were the remains of crocodiles

In 2006 Buxton Museum bought the Black Marble collection that had been left by John Michael Tomlinson He had spent over 50 years to collect them after finding that his ancestors had been involved in Ashford Black Marble manufacturing

The interquartile range is a way to see how spread out scores are and tells us what the range is in the middle of a set of scores The interquartile range is more reliable as it eliminates the outliers It is calculated by splitting the scores into four equal parts called quartiles after the scores have been arranged in ascending order

Example

We can now see that there is a large difference between the range and the inter quartile range If we remove the score 29 and then find the range it is 151 14 which is much closer to the IQR Sometimes sets of scores can have outliers that are much further away from the other scores and can result in a false judgement of the spread of scores

Duffield Castle was a Norman Castle in Duffield Derbyshire The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument

The rocky site was easy to defend because it was surrounded by the river in three sides and hard to climb It is not clear whether the site was inhabited in prehistoric times The Roman army might have been there to protect the ford nearby where people from Lutudarum Wirksworth passed before joining Rykneld Street at Derventio which was N shaped route for the North Sea ports

Ancient items of Anglo Saxons have been found there They suggest that Saxon Thane named Siward or his relatives might have occupied the site Also many Roman or Romano British pottery has been found including roof tiles of Roman pattern Some of them were kept in the Derby Museum but others kept in the Parish Room were unfortunately lost

Henry de Ferrers faithfully served King William and was given land in Derbyshire which became known as Duffield Frith It was between Heage and Shottle on the North and Tutbury on the South He built Tutbury Castle as his main residence He built another castle at Duffield to protect north side of his land This castle was probably built of wood

His third son Robert fought the Scots in the Battle of the Standard in 1138 and became the first Earl of Derby

His great grandson William became the Earl in 1162 He supported Kings sons when they resisted Henry II and finally both castles were destroyed in 1173

William II was favored by King John and took back the land of Wirksworth Ashbourne and Horston Castle The castles at Tutbury and Duffield were rebuilt with stone William III was also favored as William II was

The next Earl Robert fought against Henry III and Tutbury Castle was destroyed Once the king forgave Robert but he resisted again and was defeated in battle at Chesterfield He lost his land in 1269 and Duffield Castle was destroyed His lands were given to Prince Edmund who became first Earl of Lancaster shortly later

The castle was completely destroyed Most of the stones were taken away as materials of other buildings and the place gradually retuned to wild

When the site was surveyed the base of a traditional Norman motte and bailey castle was found with a large rock on it The size of the rock was really remarkable about 98 feet in length and 95 feet in width only slightly smaller than the White Tower in London

The grounds were saved with definite shape of foundations and transferred to the National Trust in 1899 For many years Parish Council was in charge of the site but recently the role was handed down to the Trust

Other surveys in the 1930s and in 1957 verified the residence before the arrival of the Normans because many RomanoBritish items were found

A geophysical investigation of the site was carried out by the University of Bradford in 2001 Traces of other structures to the south and the southeast were found and they appeared to date from the same period The Trust is planning to raise necessary funds to carry out further investigations

Les Casquets or Casquets is a group of rocks 13 kilometres northwest of Alderney and are part of an underwater sandstone ridge Other parts which emerge above the water are the islets of Burhou and Ortac Little grows on them

Theories as to the origin of the name include 

A map dated from around 1640 gives a Latin name Casus Rupes which would seem to confirm the third theory above but which may be a folk etymology

There have been numerous wrecks on the islets fierce tides reaching 6 7 knots on springs and a lack of landmarks account for many wrecks in the area The most famous include SS Stella wrecked in 1899 The largest wreck was the 8000 tonne water tanker Constantia S 

It was believed for centuries that HMS Victory was wrecked in 1744 on the Casquets the lightkeeper of Alderney even being court martialled for failure to keep the light on at the time of the ships loss However when the wreck of that ship was found in 2008 it was over 60 nautical miles from the Casquets

The first lighthouses started operation on 30 October 1724 and were three towers lit by coal fires called St Peter St Thomas and the Dungeon Three stone towers were built so the lights would not look like those in nearby France

They were built by Thomas Le Cocq owner of the rocks under licence from Trinity House and who was paid a halfpenny per ton of ship when vessels passed the rocks and in turn he paid Trinity House 50 pounds per year for the right to run the lighthouses The lighthouses reverted back to Trinity House in 1785

They were converted to oil lamps with metal reflectors which were first used on 25 November 1790 and upgraded again with apparatus to rotate a beam of light in 1818 This had a clockwork mechanism which was wound up every hour and a half and gave one flash every 15 seconds

The lighthouses were badly damaged and the lanterns smashed in a severe storm on 31 October 1823 The towers were raised by a further 10 yards in 1854 and equipped with 184 kilocandela lamps which gave three slow flashes every half minute In 1877 the North West Tower was raised again and the lights in the other two towers turned off

British commandos of the Small Scale Raiding Force made two raids during the Second World War on the lighthouse following the German occupation of the Channel Islands in 1940 The first raid Operation Dryad took place on 23 September 1942 and the seven keepers were taken back to England as prisoners of war

In 1954 the lighthouse was coverted to electricity and a 2830 kilocandela lamp was put in The lamp is unusual because it rotates anti clockwise At the same time the other two towers were reduced in height

The current light in the 23 metres North West Tower is 37 metres above mean sea level and flashes five times every 30 seconds and with flashes 37 seconds apart It can be seen for around 24 nautical miles in clear weather The East Tower contains the foghorn which produces two blasts every 60 seconds and this has a nominal range of 3 nautical miles The South West Tower is topped with a helipad and there is another helipad on a flat section of the rock The rocks are also marked using racon with a Morse letter T on radar displays The lighthouse complex was automated in 1990 and is monitored and controlled from the Trinity House Operations Control Centre in Harwich

Paulo Friere was an educator born in Brazil He developed new ideas about education for the oppressed  people who have been trodden down 

Paulo Freire wrote about the philosophy of education that came not only from old school such as Plato but also from modern Marxist and anti colonialist thinkers In fact in many ways his Pedagogy of the Oppressed may be best read as an extension of or reply to Frantz Fanons The Wretched of the Earth which emphasized the need to provide native populations with an education which was simultaneously new and modern and anti colonial

In Pedagogy of the Oppressed Freire talks about the oppressors oppressed distinctionseeing differences between the two positions in an unjust society the oppressor and the oppressed Freire makes no direct reference to his most direct influence for the distinction which stems back to a least Hegel in 1802 and has since been reprised by many authors including Engels Marx Lenin Gramsci Simone Weil and others

Freire advocates that education allows the oppressed to regain their humanity and overcome their condition however he acknowledges that in order for this to take effect the oppressed have to play a role in their own liberation As he states No pedagogy which is truly liberating can remain distant from the oppressed by treating them as unfortunates and by presenting for their emulation models from among the oppressors The oppressed must be their own example in the struggle for their redemption Likewise the oppressors must also be willing to rethink their way of life and to examine their own role in the oppression if true liberation is to occur those who authentically commit themselves to the people must re examine themselves constantly

Freire believed education to be a political act that could not be divorced from pedagogy Freire defined this as a main tenet of critical pedagogy Teachers and students must be made aware of the politics that surround education The way students are taught and what they are taught serves a political agenda Teachers themselves have political notions they bring into the classroom Freire believed that education makes sense because women and men learn that through learning they can make and remake themselves because women and men are able to take responsibility for themselves as beings capable of knowing of knowing that they know and knowing that they dont 

In terms of actual pedagogy Freire is best known for his attack on what he called the banking concept of education in which the student was viewed as an empty account to be filled by the teacher He notes that it transforms students into receiving objects It attempts to control thinking and action leads men and women to adjust to the world and inhibits their creative power The basic critique was not new Rousseaus conception of the child as an active learner was already a step away from tabula rasa In addition thinkers like John Dewey were strongly critical of the transmission of mere facts as the goal of education Dewey often described education as a mechanism for social change explaining that education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction Freires work however updated the concept and placed it in context with current theories and practices of education laying the foundation for what is now called critical pedagogy

More challenging is Freires strong aversion to the teacher student difference This splitis admitted in Rousseau and constrained in Dewey but Freire comes close to insisting that it be completely abolished This is hard to imagine in absolute terms since there must be some enactment of the teacher student relationship in the parent child relationship but what Freire suggests is that a deep reciprocity be inserted into our notions of teacher and student He goes so far as to say that Education must begin with the solution of the teacher student contradiction by reconciling the poles of the contradiction so that both are simultaneously students and teachers Freire wants us to think in terms of teacher student and student teacher that is a teacher who learns and a learner who teaches as the basic roles of classroom participation Freire however insists that educator and student though sharing democratic social relations of education are not on an equal footing but the educator must be humble enough to be disposed to relearn that which heshe already thinks she knows through interaction with the learner The authority which the educator enjoys must not be allowed to degenerate into authoritarianism teachers must recognize that their fundamental objective is to fight alongside the people for the recovery of the peoples stolen humanity not to win the people over to their side

Brother Can You Spare a Dime also sung as Buddy Can You Spare a Dime is one of the best known American songs of the Great Depression Written in 1931 by lyricist E Y Yip Harburg and composer Jay Gorney Brother Can You Spare a Dime was part of the 1932 musical New Americana the melody is based on a Russian lullaby Gorney heard as a child It became best known however through recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee Both versions were released right before Franklin Delano Roosevelts election to the presidency and both became number one hits on the charts The Brunswick Crosby recording became the best selling record of its period and came to be viewed as an anthem of the shattered dreams of the era

The song asks why the men who built the nation built the railroads built the skyscrapers who fought in the war who tilled the earth who did what their nation asked of them should now that the work is done and their labor no longer necessary find themselves abandoned in bread lines 

The song has unusual structure for a Broadway song Firstly rather than starting in a major key as most Broadway songs do it begins in a minor key which is darker and more appropriate for the Depression When discussing the prosperous past and building the railroads the song jumps an octave and moves briefly into a major key evoking energy and optimism It then reverts to a minor key in the word time in the line Once I built a railroad made it run Made it race against time marking the end of prosperous times and changing to a wistful mood The song then ends not on a note of resignation but with anger repeating the beginning an octave higher but with a significant change the friendly Brother can you spare a dime is replaced with the aggressive Buddy can you spare a dime

During the bad times in the 1970s the New York Times asked Harburg to update Brother for a new age and he responded with

Persistent organic pollutants are organic compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation through chemical biological and photolytic processes For this reason they persist in the environment for a long time They can be transported over long distances and bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue When going up a food chain there will be larger amounts of these substances For this reasob they have a large impact on human health and the environment

Many POPs are currently or were in the past used as pesticides Others are used in industrial processes and in the production goods such as solvents polyvinyl chloride and pharmaceuticals There are a few natural sources of POPs most POPs are created by humans in industrial processes either intentionally or as byproducts

The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants is an international treaty signed in 2001 The treaty became effective in May 2004 Its aim is to limit the use and production of Persistent Organic Pollutants Examples of substances affected by the treaty are Polychlorinated biphenyl and Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane An extension to the treaty in 2009 added other substances like Lindane Critics have said that the treaty limits the effectiveness of the fight against diseases such as malaria This is not the case as the use of certain substances for vector control is permitted this includes the use against mosquitoes

The following chemicals are listed

On 11 March 2011 several nuclear reactors in Japan were badly damaged by the 2011 Thoku earthquake and tsunami

The Tkai Nuclear Power Plant lost external electric power experienced the failure of one of its two cooling pumps and two of its three emergency power generators External electric power could only be restored two days after the earthquake 

The Japanese government declared an atomic power emergency and evacuated thousands of residents living close to TEPCOs Fukushima I plant Reactors 4 5 and 6 had been shut down prior to the earthquake for planned maintenance The remaining reactors were shut down automatically after the earthquake but the subsequent tsunami flooded the plant knocking out emergency generators needed to run pumps which cool and control the reactors The flooding and earthquake damage prevented assistance being brought from elsewhere Over the following days there was evidence of partial nuclear meltdowns in reactors 1 2 and 3 hydrogen explosions destroyed the upper cladding of the building housing reactors 1 and 3 an explosion damaged reactor 2s containment and severe fires broke out at reactor 4

The Japanese authorities rated the events at reactors 1 2 and 3 as a level 5 on the International Nuclear Event Scale while the events at reactor 4 were placed at level 3 The situation as a whole was rated as level 7 On 20 March Japans chief cabinet secretary Yukio Edano confirmed for the first time that the nuclear complex with heavy damage to reactors and buildings and with radioactive contamination throughout would be closed once the crisis was over At the same time questions are being asked looking back about whether company management waited too long before pumping seawater into the plant a measure that would ruin and has now ruined the reactors and looking forward whether time is working for or against the workers and soldiers struggling to re establish cooling at the crippled plant One report noted that defense minister Toshimi Kitazawa on 21 March had committed military firefighters to spray water around the clock on an overheated storage pool at Reactor No 3 The report concluded with a senior nuclear executive who insisted on anonymity but has many contacts in Japan saying that caution as plant operators have been struggling to reduce workers risk had increased the risk of a serious accident He suggested that Japans military assume primary responsibility Its the same trade off you have to make in war and that is the sacrifice of a few for the safety of many he said But a corporation just cannot do that

1710 Comment by filmmaker Judy Irving

The film was approved for national broadcast in 1985 but that decision was rejected a year later Many people believe that was censorship BJBullert commented that the PBSKQED decision robbed a national public television audience He extrapolates this critical remark to the media across the board and its failure to focus public attention on the putative biological hazard of nuclear power

BJ Bullert in his book Public Television Politics and the Battle over Documentary Film protested what he viewed as censorship He stated that Dark Circle was outside of the mainstream at that time but now the viewpoint in the film is widely accepted Nat Katzman former KQED station manager disagreed He is quoted in Bullerts book saying Its more difficult to say falsified anything but it left one with the uncomfortable feeling that this is propaganda not journalism

The film is clearly created to raise public alarm about the hazards of nuclear power It is also about problems at the regulatory agency the Nuclear Regulatory Commission However there are numerous points in the film in which the voices heard are those of the workers We also hear from the Pacific Gas and Electric management and the lawyer for the NRC

English grammar is the grammar of the English language Grammar is the rules about how to speak and write in a language English grammar started out based on Old English which is considered to be a Germanic language After the Norman French conquered England in 1066 parts of the Latin language were brought to the English language by the Norman French

Some people use grammar that is different from other people when speaking For example people who use what is called General American English or BBC English might say I didnt do anything while someone who speaks what is called African American Vernacular English might say I didnt do nothing London working class version I aint done nuffink These differences are called dialects The dialect a person uses is usually decided by where they live Even though the dialects of English use different words or word order they still have grammar rules However when writing in American English grammar uses the rules of General American English When people talk about using proper English they usually mean using the grammar of general British English as described in standard reference works The models for spoken English in Britain are often called Received Pronunciation or BBC English

English makes few changes to its word endings These are called plurals and possessives are the most common English verbs we drop most endings except one I love you love but she loves That final s is a remnant of Anglo Saxon which had more suffixes Verbs do have endings which show changes in tense walked walking

Word order is the other big difference In English adjectives usually come before the noun Most Romance languages normally put their adjectives after the nouns For example in English a person may say I like fast cars but in Spanish it is Me gustan los coches rpidos The order of the words has changed if just the words without the grammar are translated into English it would mean to me they please the cars fast This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order In German main verbs often come near the end of sentences but in English we usually put them between subject and object as the cat sat on the mat

Grammar studies the different parts of language The parts of language are called parts of speech The parts of speech are nouns pronouns verbs adjectives adverbs prepositions conjunctions and interjections

Nouns are things They can be a single thing such as an apple They can also be plural such as a box of apples There is a special kind of noun called a proper noun which is a name For instance Johnny Appleseed

Pronouns are special types of nouns They are not a particular thing They can mean many different things An example is the word it In the sentence I like the ball it is blue you have to look at what comes before it to know that it is talking about the ball The noun before a pronoun that the pronoun really means is called the antecedent

The basic verb form is called the infinitive The infinitive for existence is to be A famous example is the speech of Hamlet to be or not to be Variations of the infinitive create verb tenses The past tense of to be in English is was The future tense is will

Words that tell you about nouns are called adjectives  When an adjective is used you learn more about the noun An example would be the words red and juicy in the phrase the red apple is juicy They do not have any endings Even if the noun they talk about is plural they stay the same You can see this in the sentence the red apples are juicy

Adverbs are words that tell you about words that are not nouns An adverb can describe a verb like the word quickly in the sentence He ran quickly They can also describe an adjective The adverb very describes the adjective sick in the sentence The boy is very sick Adverbs can even describe other adverbs as in the sentence He ran very quickly

A preposition is a word that describes how one noun relate to another the sentence as a whole They usually come before the noun that they add to the sentence which is called the object of the preposition An example is the word over in the sentence he walked over bridge

A conjugation is a word that connects other parts of a sentence They can connect two words that both do the same thing in a sentence And in the sentence the boy and the girl run connects the boy to the girl because the both run They can even connect two clauses that would normally be different sentences together The word but in the sentence I like cats but he likes dogs is a conjunction doing this

Interjections are words that do not fit normal grammar rules Interjections can and often do take the place of an entire sentence as they can give they meaning of a whole sentence in a single word These can be used to show emotions such as the word Hooray which means that the speaker is happy or likes something They are also used to shorten common phrases that would otherwise need a full sentence to talk about For example saying the word yes is much simpler than saying what you say is true so it is usually used instead Interjections like these can be helpful for saving time and making complex sentences very simple Often though interjections may have no meaning at all such as the word um

Grammar also studies how the parts of language work together This is called syntax Some common ways in which the words fit together are sentences phrases clauses and paragraphs

Halteres are small knobbed structures modified from the hind wings in flies They vibrate during flight and help the insect fly better

The halteres evolved from wings Ancestral flying insects had two pairs of wings like dragonflies hymenoptera and lepidoptera still do Flies have only the front pair of wings

Halteres help balancing and improve flight They help flies to perform their fast aerobatics In addition to providing rapid feedback to the muscles steering the wings they also help stabilise the head during flight

They are flapped rapidly and work as gyroscopes telling the insect about its body position during flight

Every vibrating object tends to maintain its plane of vibration a result of the Coriolis effect If the body of the insect changes direction in flight or rotates about its axis the vibrating halteres exert a force on the body The insect detects this force with sensory organs at the base of the halteres 

The two halteres vibrate in different planes each forming an angle of about 45 degrees with the long axis of the insect This increases the information got from the halteres

In Diptera the formation of the haltere during metamorphosis is dependent on the homeotic gene Ultrabithorax If this gene is experimentally deactivated the haltere will develop into a fully developed wing This is an excellent illustration of an important mechanism of evolutionary development a simple homeotic gene change can result in a radically different phenotype

The Strepsiptera small insects parasitic on bees wasps and cockroaches also have halteres We know the evolution was independent because in the Strepsiptera the forewings evolved into halteres while in the Diptera the hindwings changed into halteres This is a classic case of convergent evolution

Grimaldi and Engel say halteres have evolved at least seven times in insects and in most cases it is known to be associated with improved manoeuvering in flight

The islands name contains the hou suffix which means a small island

In 1416 it became part of Henry V of Englands estate It is still a Crown lease and is owned by the States of Guernsey

From 1920 to 1923 it was leased by Compton MacKenzie along with Herm and remained part of that estate for years although it is currently part of a different one

The British 1957 musical Free as Air by Dorothy Reynolds Julian Slade was set on the fictitious island of Terhou which was based on Jethou

On the top is a marker It is said that in earlier times pirates were hanged on it with chains like nearby Crevichon

From September 1964 until December 1971 the island was occupied by the Faed family consisting of Mr Angus Faed his wife Susan Faed and their four children Colin Erik Colette and Amanda Mrs Susan Faed was the 22nd tenant of Jethou

It is flanked by two islets Crevichon to the north and Fauconniere to the south There is one house on the island and two cottages as well as a large garage where vehicles such as quad bikes and tractors are stored

It is now leased by Sir Peter Ogden of IT company Computacenter

Unlike the largely autonomous islands of Sark and Alderney within the Bailiwick Jethou cannot pass its own laws It is administered by the States of Guernsey and elects members to the States of Deliberation as part of the St Peter Port South electoral district

At the east of Jethou puffins can be seen swimming off the rocks

They also nest there in the east clifftop

Not to be confused with Lihou Reef National Nature Reserve

Lihou is a small tidal island that is part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey Channel Islands It lies off the west coast of Guernsey and is the most westerly point in the Channel Islands Coordinates coord49273816N240444W The island was bought by the States of Guernsey in January 1995 Lihou is connected to Guernsey at low tide by an ancient stone causeway between the island and LEree headland It is part of the Parish of St Peters Lihous bird and marine life makes it an important conservation area

Like many other Channel Islands Lihous name contains the Norman language suffix hou of Old Norse origin

The island has the ruins of the priory of St Mary which is believed to have been set up by Benedictine monks in the 12th century The monks of the priory were not very popular with the local people who thought they were devil worshippers This animosity may be due to the monks insistence on rights of wreck Until 1415 it was under the control of Mont Saint Michel and then Eton College until the Reformation when it was closed and fell into disrepair

The house on Lihou was used for target practice by heavy artillery during the German Occupation of the Channel Islands during World War II It has now been rebuilt as accommodation for school groups and is used as an educational resource

Vraic was harvested and dried on frames set up on the beach A 1927 factory building produced iodine from seaweed All traces of the industry disappeared during the German Occupation

The Lihou family name is included in parish records which go back as far as the early 15th century and there are a number of groups who study the ancestry of the Lihous More recently a group was set up using the social networking site Facebook which links Lihous around the world

 hou is a suffix found in many Channel Islands and Norman names It is the Norman language version of the Old Norse holmr meaning a small island and often found anglicised elsewhere as holm It can still be found in modern Scandinavian languages eg Stockholm

The Norman hommethoumet also comes from this suffix 

In Parisian French the equivalent is lot which is the same as the English islet

A verge or vergee is a unit of area a quarter of the French acre Other spellings include vergie and vrgie It is not an SI unit The SI unit of area is the square metre

The term derives from Latin virga Compare French verge

In the Channel Islands it is a standard measure of land but the statutory definition differs between the bailiwicks

In France a verge was 12100 square Paris feet It was 25 perches The surveying perch measured 22 French feet the royal perch was 18 French feet

Derby Silk Mill is a museum of industry in Derby England The museum is housed in a historic former silk mill which is part of Derwent Valley Mills Between 1717 and 1721 George Sorocold built Britains first mill beside the River Derwent This mill was built to produce silk threads using machines powered by a water wheel

John Lombe copied the design for the machines used for spinning large quantities of silk when he was working within the Italian Silk Industry This may be the first example of industrial espionage

Traditionally the spinning wheel had been used for producing small quantities of silk thread at the homes of local spinsters But these new large machines were able to produce far greater quantities of silk and came to compete with the Italians However these machines required large buildings and a huge power source An undershot water wheel turned by the mill fleam on the west side of the new Silk Mill drove these large spinning machines

John Lombe unnaturally died in 1722 It was believed that he was killed with poison by an Italian as the revenge for stealing trade secrets His half brother Sir Thomas Lombe Knt died on 2 June 1739 leaving his estate to his widow and their two daughters 

Dame Elizabeth advertised the lease of the building and machinery in 1739 and the remaining 64 years of the lease were assigned to Richard Wilson junior of Leeds for 2800

Richard Wilson stayed in Leeds and took a proportion of the profits The mill was conducted by William and Samuel Lloyd and Thomas Bennet as salaried manager

A description of the mill by William Wilson dating from sometime between 1739 and 1753 is left as follows

These circular spinning machines were the most progressive feature of the factory Also they used the single source of power and employed many organized workers Due to these total process of production from raw silk to fine quality thread the Lombes silk mill is regarded as the first successful use of the factory system in Britain

The Silk Mill was visited by many tourists For example Boswell visited there in September 1777 Not all visitors thought that the mill was in good condition Torrington commented on the heat stinks and noise In 1835 Fairholt was shocked at unhealthy poor children Foreign visitors also visited the mill during their trips

William Hutton was once the employees and he later recalled the long hours low wages and beatings Work only stopped in time of extreme dryness or frost or lack of silk supply But in August 1748 unofficial holidays were taken during elections and Derby races

The partnership of Wilson and Lloyd ended in 1753 due to quarrel and legal suits Lloyd remained in possession of the building and machinery 

In 1765 Thomas Bennet bought the mill from Lloyd subject to a mortgage to the Wilson family but the mill was neglected for years because other mills in Derby and Cheshire had grown to become competitor and silk trade itself had declined

Lamech Swift became the sub tenant in 1780 He paid 7 to the Corporation and 170 to Thomas Wilson per year respectively He conflicted with the Corporation on repairs to dams in 1781 he remained in occupation until the lease expired in 1803

The Corporation advertised the lease in 1803 to run for 60 years The advertisement said that the Italian works was still used for throwing silk

In November 1833 labor movements began in Derby which led to the formation of the Grand National Trades Union in February 1834 Several months later Tolpuddle Martyrs occurred The Silk Mill was not at the centre of the movements Taylor was one of the employers who agreed not to employ any worker who was a union member By the middle of April 1834 Taylor reported that two thirds of his machinery was working and many of his former workers were applying for reinstatement According to The Derby Mercury some of the former unionists were never able to find next employment in Derby This event is commemorated by a march organized by the Derby Trades Union Council every year on the weekend before MayDay

The Taylor family remained in occupation of the mill but in 1865 they ruined and were forced to sell their machinery and lease The Derby Mercury advertised many silk mills for sale that year and it were obvious that a general depression was hitting the industry This took place four years before the Cobden Treaty with France which is said to have effectively destroyed the British silk industry

The long connection with silk production ended in about 1908 when FW Hampshire and Company the Chemists moved into the buildings to make fly papers and cough medicines On 5 December 1910 at 500 am fire broke out in the near flour mill of Sowter Bothers and soon the flame spread to the Silk Mill The mills east wall fell into the river and the whole building was burnt up Great efforts were made by the Borough Fire Brigade and the Midland Railway Company who saved the shell of the tower and the outline of the doorways leading into the original five floors These can still be seen today on the tower staircase The building was rebuilt at the same height but with three stories instead of five and remains that way today

During the 1920s the building passed ownership to the Electricity Authority They used it partly as stores workshops and a canteen Hidden from the road by the power station the mills existence was largely forgotten by the general public until the power station was removed in 1970 It was then converted into Industrial Museum which Derby had proposed for a long time The museum opened on 29 November 1974

Derby City Council closed the museum on 3 April 2011 in order to free funds for the redevelopment of the Silk Mill museum and other museums in the city The Report of the Strategic Director of Neighbourhoods indicated that 86 full time jobs would be lost but on the contrary 197000 would be saved to offset the loss of Renaissance Programme funding No date for the re opening of the museum is given in the report although a period of two years has been reported

Auch is a commune It is found in the Gers department in the south of France

Auch is twinned with

Crevichon is an islet off Herm immediately to the north of Jethou in the Channel Islands

According to Dr SK Kellett Smith it means island of crabs crayfish or cranes 

Like many names in the Channel Islands it is Norman language in origin A thousand years ago the water level was ten feet lower so there were many more of the animals the island was named after

The island is about 212 by 168 metres at its widest Its area is less than three hectares The distance to Jethou is about 215 metres

A 16th century drawing of the islet now in the British Museum shows Crevichon as apparently a wooded islet

Prof John Le Patourel in The Building of Castle Cornet said that in 1566 iron and hammers were taken to Creavissham and the island quarried for the castle The quarry has been used since then but this has made the island much smaller and less visible As a result a fifteen foot marker was built on the top Crevichon may have provided the granite for the steps of St Pauls Cathedral in London

It is said that in earlier times pirates were hanged on it with chains like nearby Jethou

Compton Mackenzie former owner of Herm called Crevichon Merg in his book Fairy Gold which is a fictionalised version of the islands

In 1953 Victor Coysh says that he saw the remains of a German bomber from the time of the occupation

Other wrecks include

Les Houmets are to the east of Guernsey in the Channel Islands Their name comes from hou a NormanGuernsiais word meaning islets They are tidal islands

Amongst the islets are Houmet BenestHoumet Bent Houmet Paradis and Houmet Hommetol Although Victor Hugo suggests that they were heavily eroded by quarrying Victor Coysh disagrees saying

Victor Hugo who wrote about many of the Channel Islands in his books described Les Houmets in The Toilers of the Sea Gilliat the main character lives on Houmet Paradis

Moreover this house had some very nasty inhabitants besides Gilliat

The novel was written in the 1860s and set in the 1820s when the islands were still inhabited

Houmet BenestBent is about two hundred yards from the shore It is triangular and 80 50 yards There is an 18th century gun battery here to defend against the French The German occupation added their own and the British another after the Germans left The steamer Clarrie sank off Houmet Bent in 1921 in the Great Roussel Heathery Brae in 1952 tried to salvage it but ended up being wrecked itself and there are also the wrecks of Vixen Rescue and Romp went ashore here It is covered in grass and brambles

Houmet Paradis the fictional Gilliats home was originally known as Houmet de lEperquerie as it was used for fish gutting and drying on stands known as perques It was formerly owned by the Collas family whose estate at Paradis gave the islet its new name In the 1920s it was used for quarrying and it was also used for grazing cattle and has a lot of grass In 1951 it was sold to James Watson of Newcastle upon Tyne for 500 who placed the island under the stewardship of the National Trust of Guernsey It remained within the family until 2004 when it was sold at auction by James Watsons grandson to a local consortium to keep the island as a nature reserve

Hommetol more commonly called Omptolle by the Ordnance Survey etc is used for gathering ormer It is mostly covered in thrift

The old English language name of the force was the Civic Guard but this title is no longer used Garda Sochna na hireann is usually rendered as the Guardian of the Peace of Ireland or the Guardians of the Peace

The full official title of the force is rarely used in speech It is known in decreasing order of formality as An Garda Sochna the Garda Sochna the Garda the Garda or the Guards

An individual officer is also called a garda or informally a guard A police station is called a Garda station Garda is also the lowest rank within the force also used as a title eg Garda John Murphy analogous to the British term constable or the American officer Guard is the most common form of address used by members of the public speaking to a garda on duty A female officer was once officially referred to as a bangharda This term was abolished in 1990 but is still used colloquially in place of the now gender neutral garda

The force is headed by the Commissioner Immediately below him are two Deputy Commissioners one in charge of Operations and the other Strategy and Change Management The Chief Administrative Officer has responsibility for resource management has the same rank as a Deputy Commissioner There are twelve Assistant Commissioners one for each of the six geographical Regions and the remainder dealing with various national support functions At an equivalent or near equivalent level to the Assistant Commissioners are the positions of Chief Medical Officer Executive Director of ICT and Executive Director of Finance

The six geographical Assistant Commissioners command the six Garda Force Regions which are currently

Reporting to the Assistant Commissioners are about 50 Chief Superintendents about half of whom supervise what are called Divisions Each Division contains a number of Districts each commanded by a Superintendent assisted by a team of Inspectors Each District contains a number of Subdistricts which are usually commanded by Sergeants

Usually each Subdistrict contains only one Garda station A different number of Garda are based at each station depending on its importance Most of these stations employ the basic rank of Garda which was referred to as the rank of Guard until 1972 The most junior members of the force are students whose duties can vary depending on their training progress They are often have clerical duties as part of their extra curricular studies

The Garda organisation also has over 2500 civilian support staff covering areas such as human resources occupational health services finance and procurement internal audit IT and telecommunications accommodation and fleet management scenes of crime support research and analysis training and general administration The figure also includes industrial staff such as traffic wardens drivers and cleaners It is ongoing government policy to bring the level of non officer support in the organisation up to international standards  thus enhancing its capacity and expertise in a range of specialist and administrative functions and releasing more of its police officers for core operational duties

The Garda Sochna Act 2005 provided for the establishment of a Garda Reserve consisting of 4000 to assist the force in performing its functions and supplement the work of members of the Garda Sochna

The job of the Garda Reserve is to be a source of local strength and knowledge Reservists carry out duties decided by the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform With reduced training these duties and powers must be operated under the supervision of regular members of the Force and are also limited from those of regular members

As of November 2010 there are 850 graduated Garda Reserve and another 148 in further training the first batch of 36 Garda Reserves graduated on 15 December 2006 at the Garda College in Templemore

Most uniformed members of An Garda Sochna do not usually carry firearms It is a tradition of the service that standard policing is carried out in both rural and urban areas by uniformed officers equipped only with a wooden truncheon From March 2007 all new Garda have been issued with ASP extendable batons with existing members trained in time In addition the Garda Commissioner announced in October 2008 that all Garda are to be issued with Pepper Spray As of December 2009 all Garda have been trained and issued with this Spray

The force when originally created was armed but the Provisional Government reversed the decision and reconstituted the force as an unarmed police force This was in contrast to the attitude of the British Dublin Castle administration which refused appeals from the Royal Irish Constabulary that that force be disarmed In the words of first Commissioner Michael Staines TD

According to Tom Garvin such a decision gave the new force a cultural ace the taboo on killing unarmed men and women who could not reasonably be seen as spies and informers

Although a mostly unarmed force certain units of the Garda such as detective units the regional support units and the Emergency Response Unit are commissioned to carry firearms The original stock of Smith Wesson Model 10 revolvers are being replaced by the Sig Sauer P226 and Walther P99C semi automatic pistols Regional Support Units are equipped with Heckler Koch MP7 sub machine guns in addition to issue pistols and non lethal weapons such as tasers and pepper spray They serve as a first response to back up regular Garda officers in critical situations due to a rise of incidents that involve firearm use In order to be issued with a firearm or to carry a firearm whilst on duty a Garda must be in possession of a valid gun card

Garda patrol cars are mainly white with yellow and blue fluorescent livery whereas traffic unit vehicles adopt the battenburg pattern The Garda crest is also present on vehicles An Garda Sochna also use unmarked patrol cars in their duties and use of such vehicles is increasing becoming a matter of cost rather than the need to hide the vehicles as the amendments to the exterior of the vehicle such as LED strobes Tetra aerials and bumper LEDs in particular are extremely visibleCitation neededdateNovember 2009

The Civic Guard was formed by the Provisional Government in February 1922 to take over the responsibility of policing the fledgling Irish Free State It replaced the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Irish Republican Police of 1919 1922 In August 1922 the force accompanied Michael Collins when he met the Lord Lieutenant in Dublin Castle

The Garda Sochna Act 1923 enacted after the creation of the Irish Free State on 8 August 1923 provided for the creation of a force of police to be called and known as The Garda Sochana Under section 22 The Civic Guard were deemed to have been established under and to be governed by the Act The law therefore renamed the existing force

During the Civil War of 1922 23 the new Free State set up the Criminal Investigation Department as an armed plain clothed counter insurgency unit It was disbanded after the end of the war in October 1923 and elements of it were absorbed into the Dublin Metropolitan Police

In Dublin policing remained the responsibility of the Dublin Metropolitan Police until it merged with the Garda Sochna in 1925 Since then the Garda has been the only police force in the state now known as the Republic of Ireland with the exception of the Military Police within the Irish Defence Forces the Airport Police and Dublin Port and Dn Laoghaire Harbour police forces

First established in 1925 the Scott Medal for Bravery is the highest honour for bravery and valour awarded to a member of the Garda Sochna The first medals were funded by Colonel Walter Scott an honorary Commissioner of the New York Police Department The first recipient of the Scott Medal was Pat Malone of St Lukes Cork City who  as an unarmed Garda  disarmed Toms g Mac Curtain

To mark the United States link the American English spelling of valor is used on the medal The Garda Commissioner chooses the recipients of the medal which is presented by the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform

In 2000 Anne McCabe  widow of Garda Jerry McCabe who was killed by armed Provisional IRA bank robbers accepted the Scott Medal for Bravery that had been awarded posthumously to her husband

The Irish Republican Police had at least one member killed by the RIC 21 July 1920 The Civic Guard had one killed by accident 22 September 1922 another was killed March 1923 by Frank Teeling Likewise 4 members of the Oriel House Criminal Investigation Department were killedDied of wounds during the Irish Civil War The Garda Roll of Honour lists 31 members of the Garda killed between 1922 and 1999 See Below

The first Commissioner Michael Staines who was a Pro Treaty member of Dil ireann held office for only eight months It was his successors Eoin ODuffy and amon Broy who played a central role in the development of the force ODuffy was Commissioner in the early years of the force when to many peoples surprise the ability of the force to succeed despite being unarmed was established ODuffy later became a short lived political leader of the quasi fascist Blueshirts before heading to Spain to fight alongside Francisco Francos Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War Broy had greatly helped the Irish Republican Army during the Anglo Irish War while serving with the Dublin Metropolitan Police Broys fame grew in the 1990s when he featured in the film Michael Collins in which it was misleadingly suggested that he had been murdered by the British during the War of Independence when in reality he lived for decades and headed the Garda Sochna from 1933 to 1938 Broy was followed by Commissioners Michael Kinnane and Daniel Costigan The first Commissioner to rise from the rank of ordinary Garda was William P Quinn who was appointed in February 1965

One later Commissioner Edmund Garvey was sacked by the Fianna Fil government of Jack Lynch in 1978 after it had lost confidence in him Garvey won unfair dismissal legal proceedings against the government which was upheld in the Irish Supreme Court This outcome required the passing of the Garda Sochna Act 1979 to retrospectively validate the actions of Garveys successor since he had become Commissioner Garveys successor Patrick McLaughlin was forced to resign along with his deputy in 1983 over his minor involvement in a political scandal The current Commissioner since December 2010 is Martin Callinan

During the Emergency there were two reserve forces to the Garda An Taca Sochna and the Local Security Force

An Taca Sochna had the power of arrest and wore uniform and were allowed to leave the reserve or sign up as full members of the Garda at the end of the war before the reserve was disbanded The reserve was established by the Emergency Powers Order 1939

The Local Security Force did not have the power of arrest and part of the reserve was soon absorbed into the Irish Army Reserve under the command of the Irish Army

Since 1989 the Garda has been part of United Nations peace keeping forces Its first mission was when a 50 strong force was sent to Namibia Since then the force has acted in Angola Cambodia Cyprus Mozambique South Africa and the former Yugoslavia The forces first fatality abroad was Garda Sergeant Paul M Reid who was fatally injured while on duty with the United Nations UNPROFOR at Snipers Alley in Sarajevo on 18 May 1995

Members of the Garda also serve in the Embassies of Ireland in London The Hague Madrid and Paris Members are also seconded to Europol in The Hague Holland and Interpol in Lyon France There are also many members working directly for UN and European agencies such as the War Crimes Tribunal

Garda officers also co operate with members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to combat cross border crime They have also accompanied politicians from the Republic such as the President on visits to Northern Ireland

Under an agreement with the British Government and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea the Garda and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are allowed to inspect the Sellafield nuclear facility in Cumbria England

Like every police force in the world the Garda have had many complaints against them including allegations of discourtesy harassment and perjury A total of 1173 complaints were made by the public against the Garda in 2005 while over 2000 complaints were made in 2009 

Some incidents involving the Garda have attracted wide scale attentionsuch as those that led to the Morris and Barr Tribunalsand have resulted in broad reform initiativesCitation neededdateMay 2009 Other reports suggest that people who frequent gay and lesbian establishments feel that the Garda are not doing enough to tackle reported homophobic crime in Ireland In 2007 there was also some debate when a potential Sikh applicant of the Garda Reserve requested that he be allowed wear a turban in place of a standard uniform cap  Ultimately the provision was not made as it was stated that the force had the same uniform requirements for all members

The Kerry Babies case was one of the first public inquiries into mishandling of a Garda investigation Later in the 1980s the Ferns Report described as wholly inadequate the handling of one of eight formal complaints made to Wexford garda but noted that the remaining formal complaints were handled in an effective professional and sensitive manner

The Garda were also criticised in the Murphy Report in relation to the handing over of the case of Fr Edmondus to Archbishop McQuaid by Commissioner Costigan Some very senior Garda were criticised for regarding priests as being outside their remit in 1960 On November 26 2009 then Commissioner Fachtna Murphy apologised for the failure of An Garda Siochna to protect victims of child abuse in the Dublin Archdiocese He said that inappropriate relationships and contacts between garda and the Dublin Archdiocese had taken place at a time of undue or misguided deference to religious authorities and that these were incompatible with any investigation On 27 November 2009 he announced that a senior investigator would examine the findings in the report

The Garda were criticised by the commission of investigation into the Dean Lyons case for their handling of the investigation into the Grangegorman killings In his report George Birmingham said that the Garda had used leading questions in their interviews with Lyons and had failed to act on a suspicion that Lyons confession was unreliable For a period the garda involved in the case failed to act on the knowledge that another man Mark Nash had confessed to the crime They were also criticised for failing to keep adequate records of their interviews with Lyons

In the 1990s and early 2000s there were a series of allegations including suggestions of corrupt and dishonest policing in County Donegal This became the subject of a judicial inquiry the Morris Tribunal The tribunal found that some garda based in County Donegal had invented a Provisional IRA informer made bombs and claimed credit for locating them and attempted to frame Raphoe publican Frank McBrearty Junior for murder the latter case involving a 15m settlement with the State In a report to the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform the Morris Tribunal expressed grave concern about organised insubordination within the force that proper discipline has been lost from Garda suggesting that a few mischief makers abused their positions within the Garda and used the disciplinary process to damage the force The tribunal also expressed concern that recruits were brought into an undisciplined culture that had the potential to do great damage in the longer term and warned that a terrible and costly waste of talent would occur if the situation continued These scandals damaged the reputation and standing of the force in County DonegalCitation neededdateNovember 2009

On 20 April 2000 members of the Emergency Response Unit shot dead from behind 27 year old John Carthy at the end of a 25 hour siege as he left his home in Abbeylara County Longford with a loaded shotgun in his hands There were allegations made of inappropriate handling of the situation and of the overuse of armed force by the Garda This led to a Garda inquiry and later a Tribunal of Inquiry chaired by Mr Justice Robert Barr This inquiry was established on 1 July 2002 and the hearing of evidence was completed on 7 December 2004 The final report was expected within six months but publication of the report was delayed until 20 July 2006 The official findings of the tribunal were that Sgt Michael Jackson made 14 mistakes in his role as negotiator during the siege and that he failed to make real efforts to achieve resolution during the armed stand off It further stated however that Sgt Jackson was limited by lack of experience and resources The tribunal recommended that there be an urgent review of Garda command structures and that the ERU be equipped with stun guns and other non lethal options including non compliant firearms support police dogs

The Barr tribunal also recommended a formal working arrangement between Garda and State psychologists and improvements in Garda training This included a recommendation that local Garda superintendents undergo refresher training for one week every year as scene commanders and a similar refresher course for ERU officers of the rank of inspector or superintendent Garda Commissioner Conroy in a letter to the family of John Carthy stated that the force was truly apologetic for his death Former Superintendent Joe Shelley whose failure to interview John Carthy was cited in the Barr Tribunal Report as extraordinary and who was also severely criticised in the Report of the Morris Tribunal into the controversial death of Richie Barron was awarded a top up bonus of 110000 when he took early retirement in July 2005 Mr Justice Morris described Shelleys probe as prejudiced tendentious utterly negligent in the highest degree

One of the first charges of serious misconduct against the force came from the handling of the Sallins Train Robbery in 1976 This case eventually led to a serious miscarriage of justice and accusations that a Heavy Gang within the force intimidated and tortured accused This eventually led to a Presidential pardon for one of the accused

In 2004 an RT Prime Time documentary accused elements within the Garda of abusing their powers by physically assaulting people arrested A retired Circuit Court judge suggested that some members of the force had committed perjury in criminal trials before him but later stated that he was misquoted while a Minister of State accused Garda in one instance of torture The Garda Commissioner accused the television programme of lacking balance

The Prime Time documentary followed footage published by the Independent Media Centre Ireland showing scuffles between Garda and Reclaim the Streets demonstrators One Garda in this footage was later convicted of common assault which is a summary matter while several other Garda were acquitted

The family of Eddie Fullerton a Buncrana Sinn Fin councillor killed in his home by members of the Ulster Defence Association in 1991 have criticised the Gardas handling of the investigation and in 2005 they started a campaign for an inquiry

The Smithwick Tribunal is also investigating allegations of collusion following the deaths of two Royal Ulster Constabulary officers killed by the Provisional IRA as they returned from a meeting with the Garda in the Republic of Ireland following a recommendation from the Cory Collusion Inquiry

Protests at the proposed Royal Dutch Shell Corrib gas refinery in Kilcommon parish Erris County Mayo have seen a large Garda operation at its construction sites with up to 200 Garda involved making it the single biggest policing operation in the country at times By September 2008 the cost of the operation was 10 Million and is estimated to have cost 135 Million by the end of January 2009 This is comparable to the 20 Million budgeted for Operation Anvil targeting organised crime criminal gangs and their associates A section of road used by the protesters has been dubbed the Golden Mile by Garda because of the overtime opportunities Complaints have been made about the Garda handling of the protests and several TDs including former Green Party leader Trevor Sargent have criticised the Gardas handling of the situation

Partly as a result of some of the above incidents the Garda Sochna has undergone a number of reforms in recent years The Morris Tribunal in particular recommended major changes to the way the forces management discipline promotion and accountability arrangements Many of these recommendations were enacted by the Garda Sochna Act 2005

Mr Justice Morris also said that the code of discipline was extremely complex and at times cynically manipulated to promote indiscipline across the force Judicial reviews for example were cited as a means for delaying disciplinary action

The fall out form the Morris Tribunal was considerable While fifteen members of the force were sacked between 2001 and 2006 and a further 42 resigned instead of being dismissed Commissioner Conroy said that he was limited in what he could do to deal with members whose misbehaviour is cited in public inquiries

With strong support from opposition parties and reflecting widespread political consensus the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform responded to many of these issues by announcing a new draft code of discipline on 17 August 2006 The new streamlined code introduced new procedures to enable the Commissioner to summarily dismiss a Garda alleged to have brought the force into disrepute abandoned duties compromised the security of the State or unjustifiably infringed the rights of other persons

The Arrente people the indigenous Australian people who live in the area believe the mountains were once giant caterpillars called Yerrenye 

The Butlers of Ormonde were an Old English dynasty They had been very important people the southeast of Ireland since the Middle Ages His father was Thomas Butler Viscount Thurles Thurles is a place in County Tipperary James was the oldest son 

His father died in 1619 when he was 9 years old He became Viscount Thurles His mother took him to England where his grandfather made him go to a Catholic school James I was King at the time James I was a Protestant and wanted to make sure that James would also be a Protestant This would give him power in Ireland once James Butler went back to Thurles James I placed James Butler under the care of archbishop George Abbot When he was fifteen he went to live with his grandfather at Drury lane 

It became very important in his life that he was a Protestant Almost all his relatives were Catholics This made his family not like him very much They had land and possessions taken from them and they were not treated fairly because they were Catholics This did not happen to James

In December 1629 he married Lady Elizabeth Preston In 1634 on the death of his grandfather he became Earl of Ormonde

In 1633 Thomas Wentworth 1st Earl of Strafford became head of government in Ireland He liked Ormonde He wrote to Charles I saying that Ormonde was young but take it from me a very staid head Ormonde became Wentworths friend and supporter 

Wentworth planned to take land from the Catholics in Ireland He did this to get money for the British king He also wanted to break the political power of the Irish Catholic gentry Ormonde supported this plan 

The plans made his relatives very angry and many of them opposed Wentworth This led to armed rebellion The opposition to Wentworth helped an impeachment of the Earl by the English Parliament He was executed in May 1641 

When the Irish Rebellion of 1641 started Ormonde was in command of government troops based in Dublin Most of the country was taken by the Catholic rebels who included Ormondes Butler relatives Rebel leader Richard Butler 3rd Viscount Mountgarret was Ormondes cousin In spring 1642 Mountgarret and Ormonde were the commanders of the two sides at the battle of Kilrush with Ormondes side winning

In spring 1642 the Irish Catholics formed their own government the Catholic Confederation The capital was Kilkenny They started to organise their own troops Also in early 1642 the king sent in troops from England and Scotland to help with the fight The Irish Confederate War had started 

Ormonde cleared the area around Dublin of Confederate forces He got control of the area historically known as the Pale In March 1643 Ormonde brought his troops to New Ross This was deep in the territory of the Catholic Confederation He won a small victory there before returning to Dublin 

However Ormonde was in a very difficult situation The Confederates held two thirds of the island The English Civil War had started in September 1642 This meant that there were not going to be more troops from England to help him The King had even asked to send back the troops he had sent before

Isolated in Dublin Ormonde agreed to a ceasefire with the Catholics which began in September 1643 The greater part of Ireland was given up into the hands of the Catholic Confederation This left only districts in the north the Dublin Pale round Cork City and certain smallish garrisons in the possession of Protestant commanders This truce was strongly opposed by the Lords Justices and the Protestant community in general in Ireland

In November 1643 the king appointed Ormonde as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland This was the highest post in the Irish government Ormonde was told to stop the kings Parliamentarian enemies being helped from Ireland He also had to deliver more troops to fight for the Royalist side in England He was also given the kings authority to make peace with the Catholic Confederation They could then allow their troops to fight against the Parliamentarians

Ormonde had a difficult job to do 

The Old native Irish and Catholic Irish of English descent had their own government in Confederate Ireland They would support King Charles I of England if he would allow them freedom to be Catholics and give them self government On the other side any deals he made with Catholic Confederates meant that his support among English and Scottish Protestants in Ireland would become less 

On August 25 1645 Edward Somerset 2nd Marquess of Worcester acting on behalf of King Charles signed a treaty in Kilkenny with the Irish Catholic Confederates He did not talk about this with the Irish Protestant community Irish Protestants were strongly against this and Charles was forced to undo the treaty almost immediately He was afraid that almost all Irish Protestant would give support to the other side in the English Civil War 

On March 28 1646 Ormonde on behalf of the king signed another treaty with the Confederates This one gave them religious and other rights However the Confederates General Assembly in Kilkenny did not like the deal This was in part because of what the popes ambassador Giovanni Battista Rinuccini said He did not want the Catholics to compromise The Confederates arrested those among them who had signed the treaty with Ormonde

Ormonde then judged that he could not keep the Confederates out of Dublin He asked for help from English Long Parliament and signed an agreement with them on June 19 1647 At the beginning of August Ormonde handed over Dublin together with 3000 royalist troops under his command to the Parliamentarian commander Michael Jones He had arrived from England with 5000 Parliamentarian troops Ormonde in turn sailed to England He said about his surrender that he preferred English rebels to Irish ones 

The royalist and parliamentarian troops were fighting on different sides in the English Civil War But in Ireland they fought together against the Catholic Confederates The combined troops won a major battle against the Confederates soon afterward near Dublin

In March 1648 he joined the queen and the Prince of Wales in Paris In September he went back to Ireland He was going to try to get the Irish Confederates and the Irish Protestants to support the king now that the popes nuncio was gone 

The Irish Confederates wanted to make a compromise now Their battle against the English Parliamentarian forces was not going well On 17 January 1649 Ormonde signed a peace with the rebels which said that they could practice their religion freely

After Charles I was executed in 1649 he stated Irelands support for Charles II Ormonde was put in command of the Irish Confederates armies and also the English Royalist troops who had come to Ireland Almost all of Ireland was under his control before August 1649 Yet Ormonde was not able to stop the conquest of Ireland by Oliver Cromwell in 1649 50 

Most of the English and Protestant Royalist troops left Ormondes side and went to fight for Cromwell in May 1650 The Irish Catholic troops were the only ones left under his command They did not trust him Ormonde was made to leave his command in late 1650 He returned to France later that year In Cromwells Act of Settlement 1652 all of Ormondes lands in Ireland were taken from him

Ormonde was great friends with Charles II and the queen mother in Paris He went to Aix and Cologne with Charles when he had to leave France He played an active part in the secret planning of the Restoration

After Charles II became king Ormonde got a lot of different responsibilities and titles from the king He was made

He also got back his lands in Ireland On 4 November 1661 he became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland again He did not like it when Charles II stopped importing cattle from Ireland In return he stopped importing cattle from Scotland

In March 1669 Ormonde was removed from the government of Ireland He did not mind He made sure that his sons and others that listened to him stayed in their posts He was chosen as Chancellor of the University of Oxford on 4 August 1669

In 1670 an attempt was made to kill the duke by an adventurer named Thomas Blood Ormonde was attacked by Blood and his helpers while driving up St Jamess Street on the night of 6 December 1670 He was pulled out of his carriage and taken on horseback along Piccadilly They wanted to hang him at Tyburn Ormonde managed to escape

In 1677 the king decided that he would become the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland once again 

On his arrival in Ireland he set up a tax system and reorganised the army After the Popish Plot in England Ormonde at once took action that would make Roman Catholics powerless There were far more Catholics than Protestants in the country In 1682 he went back to London at the request of the King who he supported The last thing he did as lord lieutenant was to declare Irish support for James II of England after the death of Charles II 

Ormonde lived in retirement at Cornbury in Oxfordshire Ormonde died on 21 July 1688 at Kingston Lacy Dorset Ormonde was buried in Westminster Abbey on 1 August 1688

Macbeth is an opera by Giuseppe Verdi It is based on Shakespeares play with the same name The opera is in Italian The libretto was written by Francesco Maria Piave with some extra additions by Andrea Maffei

Verdi wrote several works based on Shakespeare plays Macbeth was the first of these It was composed in 1847 at a time when he was composing a lot of operas In those days Italian operas were always about a love story but Macbeth was unusual because there was no love story Instead it is a story about wanting power even if means murder The opera helped to make him very famous and it has remained one of his most popular operas 

Andrea Maffei a poet and friend of Verdi suggested to him that Macbeth would be a good story to make into an opera Verdi did not read Shakespeares original work until after he had composed the opera The words were written for him by Piave who based the libretto on an Italian translation Verdi loved the story he thought it was one of the greatest creations of man The opera is very similar to the story told by Shakespeare but Verdi uses a large chorus of witches instead of just three The last act ends with the refugees coming together on the English border and in the revised version ends with a chorus of bards celebrating their victory over the cruel tyrant

The 1847 version was performed a great deal all over Italy Then in 1865 Verdi made several changes to the opera in a revised version It was to be performed in Paris and in France people expected to have ballet music in operas Verdi wrote some music for the dancers and took the opportunity to make other changes as well This is the version that is usually performed today

After 1865 it was not performed very often Verdi was very disappointed about this because he was particularly proud of this opera He had worked closely with Piave It was Verdi who gave Piave the outline of the story he wanted him to write Verdi concentrated on three main characters Lady Macbeth Macbeth and the Witches It was not until around the time of World War II that it became very popular again

Scene 1 A heath

In the prelude we hear music that comes later in the sleep walking scene The chorus of Witches prophesy the future A messenger arrives to say that Macbeth has been given the title and estates of Cawdor Macbeth and Banquo his general think about the witches prophecy Half of the prophecy has just come true The witches dance and sing at the end of this scene

Scene 2 Macbeths castle

Lady Macbeth reads a letter from her husband in which he tells her about the prophecy the witches had made She decides to make sure that Macbeth really does become king She decides that she must persuade her husband to murder Duncano Macbeth sees a dagger in front of him He takes it and murders Duncano Then he is horrified at what he has done His wife is disgusted that her husband feels terrible about the murder She takes the dagger and completes the crime then smears Duncanos blood on the guards who are asleep Banquo and Macduff a Scottish nobleman arrive Macduff discovers the crime and all the characters sing a chorus asking God to punish the murderer 

Scene 1 A room in the castle

Macbeth is now king He is worried about the prophecy that Bancos heirs will become king He and his wife decide that Banco and his son must be murdered

Scene 2 Outside the castle 

A gang of murderers are waiting for Banco He is caught but his son Fleanzio manages to escape 

Scene 3 A dining hall in the castle

Macbeth receives the guests and Lady Macbeth sings a brindisi which is quite similar to the famous one in La Traviata Macbeth is told that Banco has been murdered but when he goes back to the table he finds Bancos ghost sitting in his place He shouts and raves at the ghost The other people cannot see the ghost and think that Macbeth has gone mad The feast ends quickly

The witches cave

The witches are sitting round a cauldron in a dark cave They sing and then dance a ballet which was written for the 1865 version The music sounds like magic Macbeth enters and wants the witches to tell him his future They conjure up three apparitions for him The first one tells him to beware of Macduff The second tells him that he cannot be harmed by a man born of woman The third one says that he cannot be conquered till Birnam Wood marches against him 

Macbeth is then shown the ghost of Banco and his descendants eight future Kings of Scotland This shows that the witches prophecy from the beginning of the opera must indeed come true Macbeth collapses When he recovers and tells his wife what he saw she is even more determined to kill Bancos son and all his family

Scene 1 Near the border between England and Scotland

Scottish refugees stand near the English border and sing a song about how Macbeth the tyrant is oppressing his people

Malcolm Bancos son tells his soldiers to cut branches from trees in Birnam Wood and carry them as they attack Macbeths army They want to free Scotland from tyranny

 Scene 2 Macbeths castle 

A doctor and a servant watch the Queen as she walks in her sleep wringing her hands trying to clean them of blood 

Scene 3 The battlefield

Macbeth has heard that an army is coming towards him He is told that the Queen is dead but he does not seem to mind He gets his army together Bancos army march against him with their tree branches The prophecy has come true Birnam Wood has marched up against him Macduff fights Macbeth and kills him He tells Macbeth that he was not born of woman but ripped from his mothers womb The fight continues Macduff kills Macbeth Macduffs men call out that Macduff is the new King All the soldiers and the women sing a hymn to victory

Diffraction is a physics concept Diffraction occurs when waves bend around small obstacles or when waves spread out after they pass through small openings Diffraction occurs with all waves including sound waves water waves and electromagnetic waves such as light that the eye can see Diffraction also occurs with matter such as electrons

Diffraction is caused by one wave of light being shifted by a diffracting object This shift will cause the wave to have interference with itself Interference can be either constructive or destructive When interference is constructive the intensity of the wave will increase When interference is destructive the intensity will decrease sometimes to a point where it is completely destroyed These patterns of interference rely on the size of the diffracting object and the size of the wave The strongest examples of diffraction occur in waves where the wavelength is close to the same size of the object causing the diffraction

Diffraction can be used to separate different wavelengths of light using a diffraction grating A diffraction grating can be a series of closely spaced slits or a mirror with a series of small grooves Diffraction gratings work because different wavelengths of light will constructively interfere at different angles Diffraction gratings are used in many analytical chemistry tools such as a spectrometer

Diffraction can also be used to look at molecules using X ray crystallography In X ray crystallography X rays are aimed on a crystal The crystal diffracts the X ray and makes a diffraction pattern This pattern is unique to the type of crystal and can be used to identify the molecule that makes the crystal

The Royal Hospital Kilmainham is a 17th century building in Kilmainham Dublin Ireland It was built to be a home for retired soldiers It was used as a home for over 250 years 

The hospital was built between 1680 and 1684 by architect Sir William Robinson He was the official State Surveyor General for James Butler 1st Duke of Ormonde and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to King Charles II The style is based on Les Invalides in Paris The Royal Hospital Chelsea in Chelsea London was completed two years later and looks alike in style 

The Tudor Gothic gateway at the end of the road leading to the Royal Hospital was designed by Francis Johnston He was one of the leading architects of the day This gateway originally stood beside the River Liffey at Bloody Bridge It was moved after the arrival of the railway in 1844 

When the Irish Free State was formed they thought about using the building for the Oireachtas ireann the new Irish national parliament This did not happen After the soldiers were all gone the buildings were used for different things like offices for the Garda Sochna and as storage for the National Museum of Ireland 

The Government of Ireland restored the buildings in different stages from 1957 and opened in 1985 as the National Centre for Culture and the Arts In 1991 the Irish Museum of Modern Art was opened here

Every year on the National Day of Commemoration the President of Ireland lays a wreath in the courtyard in memory of all Irishmen and Irishwomen who have died in past wars and on service with the United Nations

Kilmainham is an area of Dublin It lies south of the River Liffey and west of the city centre in the Dublin 8 postal district 

In the Viking era there was a monastery here The monastery was home to the first Norse base in Ireland

In the 12th century the lands on the banks of the Liffey belonged to the Knights Templars Strongbow built a castle for them about a mile away from the Danish wall of old Dublin Here the Templars lived for nearly a century and a half In 1308 Edward II ruled that they were no longer allowed to practice their religion Thirty members of the Templars were imprisoned in Dublin Their lands and rights were given to the priory of the Knights of St John of Jerusalem They were there until the monasteries were closed in the 16th century 

The Manor of Kilmainham was a liberty This means it had special rights The manor was an area that included parts of Jamess Street and side streets and went as far as Lucan and Chapelizod 

Until the time of Queen Elizabeth the lord lieutenants used the manor of Kilmainham In 1559 the earl of Sussex found that the building at Kilmainham was damaged by a storm The following year Elizabeth ordered that Dublin Castle be improved so the lord lieutenant could live there From that time Kilmainham was no longer used much

The Royal Hospital Kilmainham is in Kilmainham It was built on the site where the Knights of St John of Jerusalem had their priory in Dublin It is now the Irish Museum of Modern Art Nearby is also Kilmainham Gaol where the executions of the leaders of the Easter Rising took place 

Kilmainham also has one of a small number of Viking era burial sites within Dublin

Balancing selection refers to selective processes by which different alleles are kept in the gene pool of a population at frequencies above that of gene mutation

This usually happens when the heterozygote for a gene has a higher adaptive value than the homozygote In this way genetic polymorphism is conserved

Evidence for balancing selection can be found in the number of alleles in a population which are maintained above mutation rate frequencies All modern research has shown that this significant genetic variation is common in panmictic populations It is the field experience of Darwin Wallace and others that natural populations in the wild are extraordinarily varied Museum collections of single species tell the same story

There are several ways balancing selection works to maintain polymorphism The two major and most studied are heterozygote advantage and frequency dependent selection

In heterozygote advantage or heterotic balancing selection an individual who is heterozygous at a particular gene locus has a greater fitness than a homozygous individual Polymorphisms maintained by this mechanism are balanced polymorphisms

A well studied case is that of sickle cell anemia in humans a hereditary disease that damages red blood cells Sickle cell anemia is caused by the inheritance of a variant hemoglobin gene from both parents In these individuals hemoglobin in red blood cells is extremely sensitive to oxygen deprivation and this causes shorter life expectancy

A person who inherits the sickle cell gene from one parent and a normal hemoglobin gene from the other has a normal life expectancy The heterozygote is resistant to the malarial parasite which kills a large number of people each year The heterozygote frequency is kept high because of the fierce selection against both the homozygotes 

The heterozygote has a permanent advantage wherever malaria exists

Frequency dependent selection occurs when the fitness of a phenotype depends on its frequency 

In positive frequency dependent selection the fitness of a phenotype increases as it becomes more common In negative frequency dependent selection the fitness of a phenotype increases as it becomes less common For example in prey switching rare morphs of prey are fitter because predators concentrate on more frequent morphs

The fitness of a genotype may vary greatly between larval and adult stages or between parts of a habitat range

The fitness of a genotype may depend on the fitness of other genotypes in the population this covers many natural situations where the best thing to do depends on what other members of the population are doing at the time

Philip Dormer Stanhope 4th Earl of Chesterfield PC KG was a British statesman and intellectual

Stanhope was born in London He got his schooling at Trinity Hall Cambridge After that he went on the Grand Tour of the continent He became gentleman of the bedchamber to the Prince of Wales

In 1715 he entered the House of Commons as Lord Stanhope of Shelford and member for St Germans He left for Paris and sent the government valuable information about the Jacobite plot In 1716 he returned to Britain and sat in the House of Commons He liked to take part in the debates 

He took his seat in the House of Lords In 1728 he was sent to the Hague as ambassador He did a good job and got the Order of the Garter in 1730 and the position of Lord Steward After he did not support Walpoles Excise Bill he was dismissed from his stewardship He spent years opposing the ruling party in the House of Lords First against Robert Walpole and then against King George II of England In 1744 the Broad Bottom party led by Chesterfield and Pitt came into office They ruled together with the Pelhams 

He was then sent to the Hague as ambassador a second time The object of his mission was to persuade the Dutch to join in the War of the Austrian Succession His mission was successful When he got back to London he was made Lord Lieutenancy of Ireland This was a position he wanted for a long time

He took the his role seriously He established schools and manufacturing in Ireland In politics he found a way to work with both Protestant and Roman Catholic parties 

He also still took his seat in the Upper House In 1751 he helped in making the Gregorian calendar a fact That Act of Parliament is sometimes known as Chesterfields Act After he slowly became deaf he had to stop his work in the parliament 

He lived for some years at the Rangers House Chesterfield Walk Greenwich London

In politics he is best known for the time he was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland As a writer he is best known for his Letters to his Son Those letters were not really written to be read by the general public His widow Eugenia Stanhope first published them in 1774 Letters to his Godson was published in 1890 Both sets of letters are written with great style and knowledge 

Chesterfield County Virginia and Chesterfield County South Carolina in the United States were named in his honour He also plays a role in the 1757 1758 novel The Virginians by William Makepeace Thackery

Things he has probably said 

The Grand Tour was the name of travel through Europe by rich European young men between 1660 until about 1840 It was done to learn about European society and art The idea was that what they learned on their travels could be used to help those that stayed at home Italy was often the final country to visit They would mostly travel with servants and a teacher called a bear leader

Which places the Grand Tour would visit changed through the years An example would be a British tourist would go from Dover England and crossed the English Channel to Ostend in the Spanish NetherlandsBelgium or Calais or Le Havre in France 

There they could rent or buy a carriage and travel to Paris Or they could make the trip by boat traveling up the Seine to Paris or up the Rhine to Basel 

In Paris the traveler could take lessons in French dancing fencing and horse riding Paris was popular because of the language and fashion of French high society

From Paris he would go to Switzerland for a while often to Geneva From there the traveler would make a difficult crossing over the Alps into northern Italy 

Once in Italy the tourist would visit Turin then might spend a few months in Florence Other Grand Tourists would be in Florence to welcome him A trip to Pisa then on to Padua Bologna and Venice 

Venice was seen as the most important place for Italian architecture and was very important place to visit

From Venice the traveler went to Rome to study the ruins of ancient Rome Some travelers also visited Naples to study music Naples was often the final destination before turning back

From here the traveler went north through the Alps to the German speaking parts of Europe From there travelers visited Holland and Flanders before returning across the Channel to England

Alnico is an acronym of iron alloys which are made up of iron and aluminium nickel and cobalt and hence the acronym Al Ni Co Alnico may also contain copper and sometimes titanium

Alnico alloys are ferromagnetic Alnico alloys also have a high coercivity and are used to make permanent magnets Before rare earth magnets were developed in the 1970s alnico magnets were the most strongest type of magnet The development of Alnico began when T Mishima in Japan found that an alloy of iron nickel and aluminium had double the coercivity than best magnets of that time

Alnico alloys make strong powerful magnets and can be made magnets to produce strong magnetic fields Rare earth magnets like neodymium and samarium cobalt are the only easily found magnets which are stronger than alnico magnets Alnico magnets produce very strong magnetic fields at their poles as high as 1500 gauss 015 tesla which is about 3000 times stronger than earths magnetic field

Some types of alnico magnets are isotropic and can be properly magnetised in all directions Other types like alnico 5 and alnico 8 are anisotropic have a preferred direction for magnetisation Anisotropic alnico alloys will make stronger magnets in their preferred direction than an isotropic alnico alloy

Alnico magnets have one of the highest Curie temperatures They are the only magnets that have useful magnetism even when heated red hot

In 2008 the cost of Alnico magnets was about 44kg

Hermit thrush is a common bird that is found in Canada the United States and Mexico The size of one is 15 to 17 cm It has a brown head It is closely related to the Mexican Russet Nightingale thrush They are mainly brown and have a reddish tail Underneath they are white with some dark spots They have pink legs The hermit thrush is the state bird of Vermont

The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland is the name of a political office It was the representative of the King and head of the Irish executive between 1171 and 1922 The term is always pronounced as Lord Lef tenant of Ireland 

Other words used for this office were Judiciar in the early mediaeval period and Lord Deputy as late as the 17th century The people in this job were often also called viceroy from the French vice roi or deputy king 

In the Middle Ages some Lord Lieutenants had been Irish noblemen After that only noblemen from Great Britain worked in this job

The Kings representative had a number of different roles He was

The Lord Lieutenant was helped to govern by the Irish Privy Council This was a group of people chosen to be on the Council Some inherited their seat They usually met in the Council Chamber in Dublin Castle 

The main politicians were

Lords Lieutenant stayed in power until the British Governmentthe King wanted them to leave

Two Lords Lieutenant Lord Hartington and the Duke of Portland went from Dublin Castle to 10 Downing Street as Prime Minister of Great Britain in 1756 and 1783 respectively At other times the post was used to move politicians that were no longer wanted in London out of the way

By the mid to late 19th century the post was no longer very important The Chief Secretary for Ireland had become more important in ruling the country than the Lord Lieutenant 

The official house of the Lord Lieutenant was the Viceregal Apartments in Dublin Castle This was also where the Viceregal Court was based When the Lord Lieutenant had to live in Ireland full time this had to change In 1781 the British government bought the former rangers house in Phoenix Park It was named the Viceregal Lodge It is now known as ras an Uachtarin It is the residence of the President of Ireland 

The Lords Lieutenant then only lived in the Castle during the Social Season

The office of Lord Lieutenant like the British government in Ireland was generally unpopular 

From the early 19th century calls were made frequently to get rid of the office However the office survived right down until the end of British rule in most of Ireland 

Dublin Zoo in Phoenix Park Dublin Ireland is the largest zoo in Ireland It is one of Dublins most popular attractions It was opened in 1831 

It is over convert24ha0 in size It has a number of special areas like

It was founded in 1830 and opened to the public on 1 September 1831 This makes it the third oldest zoo in the world The animals 46 mammals and 72 birds were a present from London Zoo It now has over 600 animals from all over the world

In 2010 Dublin Zoo received 963053 visitors

A how to or a how to is an informal often short description of how to accomplish some specific physical task think to resolve some specific problem or just think about a topic

Wild type is a term in genetics for the most common type in a natural population It is applied to alleles of a gene or the genotypes or phenotypes of a species

The term is used in genetics to contrast normal alleles with mutant alleles

With Drosophila melanogaster wild type usually means the standard version of the famous laboratory population used in the TH Morgan laboratory and since used around the world This was of course only a sample of the natural populations

Tbor is a city in the Czech Republic It is located in the South Bohemian Region Since the 2007 census the population was 35859 The city was started in 1420 and the current mayor is Hana Randov The city is named after Mount Tabor

Yamaguchi is a city in southern Japan It is the capital of Yamaguchi prefecture The city had a population of 198971 people in 2010 Yamaguchi was made when 40 towns were merged together on April 1 1889

Random mating is a term in population genetics It describes an ideal situation in which all individuals on one sex are equally potential partners of all members of the opposite sex The technical term for it is panmixia 

Random mating is one of the requirements for the HardyWeinberg law to hold This is the foundation equation of population genetics

There are a number of types of non random mating such as mate choice mating type selfing in some flowering plants and in general inbreeding Mechanical or geographical differences within a species will often prevent a whole species being panmictic

The opposite of random mating is assortative mating

The Ernst Happel Stadion is a football stadium in Vienna Austria The Ernst Happel Stadium is the largest football stadium in Austria It is the home of the Austrian national football team Club football matches are limited to the Austrian cup final and international competitions with one of Viennas top clubs FK Austria Wien and SK Rapid Wien as their homegrounds are too small for UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup matches Local derbies between FK Austria and SK Rapid have also been played in the stadium

The stadium was built between 1929 and 1931 It was used and opend for the second Workers Olympiad 1931 The capacity of the stadium was approximately 60000 people The first match in the new stadium was a match between a selection from workers sportclubs from Lower Austria and Vienna 

During the occupation of Austria by Nazi Germany it was used as barracks and also as collecting point for Viennese Jews In 2003 a private plaque was created in the VIP area to remind on this incidents In 1944 the stadium was bombed and heavily demaged

After the Second World war the stadium was reconstructed 1956 the capacity was extended to 92708 peopleThe record was 91000 visitors on October 30 1960 at the football match between Spain and Austria After the death of former Austrian top player and coach Ernst Happel the Prater Stadium was renamed after him in 1992

The Ernst Happel Stadion hosted 7 games of Euro 2008 3 group games of the Austrian team two quarter finals one semi final and the final

The stadium has hosted concerts by many famous artists including ACDC Bon Jovi David Bowie Bruce Springsteen The E Street Band Guns N Roses Michael Jackson Pink Floyd Robert Plant Rihanna The Rolling Stones U2 Kanye West and Robbie Williams among others

A hollow cathode lamp is a light source or radiation source which is used to excite electrons of a metal of interest to a higher energy level Excitation is when an electron in its lowest energy state also known as the ground state undergoes a transition to a higher energy state known as an excited state These transitions can occur through heat electrical energy light particles or a chemical reaction

A HCL consists of an anode and a cathode inside of a glass tube The glass tube is filled with some type of inert gas such as argon or neon with a pressure of around 5 torr It is important that the gas is inert in order to minimize interferences in the output of the data The anode is an electrode in which oxidation takes place Oxidation is the loss of electrons The cathode is an electrode in which reduction takes place Reduction is the gain of electrons The anode is typically constructed of some type of metal such as tungsten and is coated with a material the helps to prevent contamination from the sputtering process described below The cathode is constructed of the pure metal of interest or a mixture of metals containing the metal of interest This mixture of metals is referred to as an alloy It is important that the cathode be stored under a vacuum to avoid any kind of contamination Contamination of the cathode compensates the metal of interests purity and the data obtained for that metal The material of the window is specifically selected in order to get the best transmission of spectral lines for the cathode element

The excitation process of the element of interest takes place through a few steps First the inert gas contained inside of the glass tube is ionized by a voltage Ionization is the process by which neutral atoms are converted to charged species This voltage is applied across the anode and the cathode and generates a current of 5 15 mA This current allows for electrons to move to the anode and cathode If the voltage applied is large enough the ions of the inert gas gather enough energy to remove some of the metal atoms of interest from the surface of the cathode by striking the surface The removal of these atoms produces a cloud around the cathode The process of producing this cloud is called sputtering Some of these metal atoms in the cloud have moved to an excited energy state and as they return to their ground state they emit a specific radiation which is characteristic to the metal of interest The release of this radiation allows for data to be collected and information gathered pertaining to the metal of interest After a period of time the atoms move to the glass walls of the lamp or back to the surface of the cathode

How well the HCL works and how long it lasts is dependent on the care of operation When a high voltage is applied higher currents arise These higher currents allow for more intense data output but at the same time can produce a number of unexcited atoms in the cloud These unexcited atoms can interfere with good output data because they are able to absorb the radiation that is emitted from the excited electrons returning to their ground state This process is called self adsorption The process of self adsorption results in weaker intensities Increasing the current too much can also result in a shorter lifetime of the lamp as well as melt the metal on the cathode thus ruining the lamp

Ernest Dale Tubb was an American country music singer and songwriter Tubb was nicknamed The Texas Troubadour He is probably best known for his hit song Walking the Floor Over You in 1941 which also marked the rise of the honky tonk genre of music He joined the Grand Ole Opry as a member in 1943 He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1965

A photomultiplier tube is a transducer which converts photons into electrons which generate a current and voltage Photomultiplier tubes are used to detect low levels of incident light even as low as a single photon

An incoming photon will strike the photocathode surface of the PMT which will emit electrons These electrons are then accelerated toward additional electrodes by a potential difference of about 90 volts Upon striking this electrode more electrons are emitted This process repeats nine times each time generating more and more electrons This process can generate 106 to 107 electrons for each individual photon These electrons are then collected at the anode where the current and voltage is then measured 

Photomultiplier tubes are highly sensitive and have very quick response times The sensitivity of the PMT can be improved by cooling it to reduce temperature induced noise Photomultiplier tubes must not be exposed to intense light such as the sun or ambient light because the intensity can damage the components 

Photomultiplier tubes are commonly used for analysis techniques as well as medical and research purposes

Gas chromatographymass spectrometry combines the features of gas liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry This makes it possible to identify different substances within a test sample GC MS has many uses include drug detection fire investigation environmental analysis and explosives investigation It can also be used to identify unknown samples GC MS can also be used in airport security to detect substances in luggage or on human beings Additionally GC MS can identify trace elements in deteriorated materials even after the sample fell apart so much that other tests cannot work

GC MS is the best way for forensic experts to identify substances because it is a specific test A specific test positively identifies the actual presence of a particular substance in a given sample A non specific test only says that categories of substances are in the sample Although a non specific test could statistically suggest the identity of the substance this could lead to false positive identification

The first research papers on gas liquid chromatography were published in 1950 Chemists used different detectors to see that compounds were flowing out of the end of the chromatograph Most of the detectors destroyed the compounds because they burned them or ioned them These detectors left chemists guessing the exact identity of each compound in the sample In the 1950s Roland Gohlke and Fred McLafferty developed a new combined machine They used a mass spectrometer as the detector in gas chromatography These early devices were big fragile and originally limited to laboratory settings 

The design was complex The time interval between different compounds flowing out of the chromatograph was hard to control So the mass spectrometer had to finish working on one compound before the next one flowed out of the chromatograph In the early models the measurements from the mass spectrometer was recorded on graph paper Highly trained chemists studied the patterns of peaks to identify each compound By the 1970s analog to digital converters were added to mass spectrometers This allowed computers to store and to interpret the results As computers grew faster and smaller GC MS became faster and spread from laboratories into every day life Today computerized GC MS instruments are widely used in environmental monitoring of water air and soil It is also used in the regulation of agriculture food safety and in the discovery and production of medicine

The development of small computers has helped in the simplification of GC MS machines It also greatly reduced the amount of time it takes to analyze a sample Electronic Associates Inc was a leading US supplier of analog computers In 1964 EAI began development of a computer controlled mass spectrometer under the direction of Robert E Finnigan By 1966 over 500 gas analyzer instruments were sold In 1967 the Finnigan Instrument Corporation was formed In early 1968 delivered the first prototype quadrapole GC MS instruments to Stanford and Purdue University FIC was eventually renamed Finnigan Corporation and went on to establish itself as the worldwide leader in GC MS systems

GC MS can find all of the compounds mixed together in a sample object The operator dissolves the sample in a liquid The operator then injects the liquid into a stream of gas The gas flows through a tube with a special coating Because each compound in the sample sticks to the coating in a different way each compound comes out of the tube at a different time So the coating is used to separate each compound that was mixed together in the sample As each compound comes out at the end of the tube it is ionized and gets an electric charge Most compounds break apart when they are ionized The different pieces fly under a magnet which separates the pieces based on their weight A computer then measures all of the pieces of each compound By comparing the measurements against a computer library of known compounds the computer makes a list of the names of all of the compounds in the sample The computer can also tell how much of each compound was in the sample

The GC MS is made up of two major building blocks the gas chromatograph and the mass spectrometer The gas chromatograph uses a capillary column which depends on the columns dimensions as well as the phase properties The difference in the chemical properties between different molecules in a mixture will separate the molecules as the sample travels the length of the column The molecules take different amounts of time to come out of the gas chromatograph This allows the mass spectrometer downstream to capture ionize accelerate deflect and detect the ionized molecules separately The mass spectrometer does this by breaking each molecule into ionized fragments and detecting these fragments using their mass to charge ratio 

These two machines used together allow a much finer precision of substance identification than either unit used separately It is not possible to make an accurate identification of a particular molecule by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry alone The mass spectrometry process normally requires a very pure sample In the past gas chromatography use other detectors such as a Flame Ionization Detector These detectors cannot separate different molecules that happen to take the same amount of time to travel through the column The co eluting molecules will confuse the computer programs that are reading a single mass spectrum for both molecules

Sometimes two different molecules can also have a similar pattern of ionized fragments in a mass spectrometer Combining the two processes reduces the possibility of error It is extremely unlikely that two different molecules will behave in the same way in both a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer Therefore if a mass spectrum matches the analyte of interest the retention time of that spectrum can be checked against a characteristic GC retention time to increased confidence that the analyte is in the sample

The most common type of MS associated with a GC is the quadrupole mass spectrometer Hewlett Packard markets it under trade name Mass Selective Detector Another relatively common detector is the ion trap mass spectrometer Additionally one may find a magnetic sector mass spectrometer However these particular instruments are expensive and bulky and not typically found in high throughput service laboratories Other detectors are used such as time of flight tandem quadrupoles or in the case of an ion trap MSn The n indicates the number mass spectrometry stages

A mass spectrometer is typically used in one of two ways Full Scan or Selective Ion Monitoring The typical GC MS can work either way alone or both at the same time

When collecting data in the full scan mode a target range of mass fragments is selected and put into the instruments method An example of a typical broad range of mass fragments to monitor would be mz 50 to mz 400 The determination of what range to use is largely set by what one expects being in the sample while being aware of the solvent and other possible interferences If an MS looks for mass fragments with a very low mz it may detect air or other possible interferring factors Using a large scan range decreases the sensitivity of the instrument The machine will perform fewer scans per second because each scan will take more time to detect a wider range of mass fragments

Full scan is useful in determining unknown compounds in a sample It provides more information than SIM when it comes to confirming or resolving compounds in a sample Most instruments are controlled by a computer which operates a computer program called an instrument method The instrument method controls the temperature in the GC the MS scan rate and the range of fragment sizes being detected When a chemist is developing an instrument method the chemist sends test solutions through the GS MS in full scan mode This checks the GC retention time and the mass fragment fingerprint before moving to a SIM instrument method Specialized GC MS instruments such as explosive detectors have an instrument method pre loaded at the factory

In selected ion monitoring the instrument method focuses on certain ion fragments Only those mass fragments are detected by the mass spectrometer The advantages of SIM are that the detection limit is lower since the instrument is only looking at a small number of fragments during each scan More scans can take place each second Since only a few mass fragments of interest are being monitored matrix interferences are typically lower To improve the chances of reading a positive result correctly the ion ratios of the various mass fragments are comparable to a known reference standard

After the molecules travel the length of the column pass through the transfer line and enter into the mass spectrometer they are ionized by various methods Typically only one ionization method being used at any given time Once the sample is fragmented it will then be detected usually by an electron multiplier diode The diode treats the ionized mass fragment like an electrical signal that is then detected

Chemists select an ionization technique separately from choosing Full Scan or SIM monitoring

The most common type of ionization is electron ionization The molecules enter into the MS where they are hit with free electrons emitted from a filament This is like the filament one would find in a standard incandescent light bulb The electrons hit the molecules causing the molecule to fragment in a characteristic way that can be repeated This hard ionization technique results in the creation of more fragments of low mass to charge ratio EI has few if any fragments having a mass that is near the mass of the original molecule Chemists consider hard ionization to be shooting electrons into the sample molecules In contrast soft ionization is placing a charge on the sample molecule by hitting it with an introduced gas The molecular fragmentation pattern depends on the electron energy applied to the system typically 70 eV The use of 70 eV helps to compare the spectra generated from the test sample against known library spectra The software searches the library spectra using a matching algorithm such as Probability Based Matching or dot product matching Many method standardization agencies now control these algorithms and methods to assure their objectivity

In chemical ionization a reagent gas typically methane or ammonia is introduced into the mass spectrometer There are two types of CI positive CI or negative CI Either way the reagent gas will interact with the electrons and analyte and cause a soft ionization of the molecule of interest A softer ionization fragments the molecule to a lower degree than the hard ionization of EI Chemists prefer CI over EI This is because CI produces at least one mass fragment with a weight that is nearly the same as the molecular weight of the analyte of interest

In Positive Chemical Ionization the reagent gas interacts with the target molecule most often with a proton exchange This produces the ion species in relatively high amounts

In Negative Chemical Ionization the reagent gas decreases the impact of the free electrons on the target analyte This decreased energy typically leaves the fragment in great supply

The primary goal of instrument analysis is to measure an amount of substance This is done by comparing the relative concentrations among the atomic masses in the generated mass spectrum Two kinds of analysis are possible comparative and original Comparative analysis essentially compares the given spectrum to a spectrum library to see if its characteristics are present for some known sample in the library This is best performed by a computer because there are many visual distortions that can take place due to variations in scale Computers can also correlate more data to more accurately relate certain data

Another method of analysis measures the peaks in relation to one another In this method the tallest peak is set at 100 The other peaks given a value equal to the ratio of the peak height to the tallest peak height All values above 3 are assigned The total mass of the unknown compound is normally indicated by the parent peak The value of this parent peak can be used to fit with a chemical formula containing the various elements which are believed to be in the compound The isotope pattern in the spectrum is unique for elements that have many isotopes So it can also be used to identify the various elements present This tells the overall chemical formula of the unknown molecule Because a molecules structure and bonds break apart in characteristic ways they can be identified from the difference in peak masses The identified molecule structure must be consistent with the characteristics recorded by GC MS Typically this identification is done automatically by computer programs which come with the instrument Those programs match the spectra against a library of known compounds that have same list of elements which could be present in the sample

A full spectrum analysis considers all the peaks within a spectrum But selective ion monitoring only monitors selected peaks associated with a specific substance Chemists assume that at a given retention time a set of ions is characteristic of a certain compound SIM is a fast and efficient analysis SIM works best when the analyst has previous information about a sample or is only looking for a few specific substances When the amount of information collected about the ions in a given gas chromatographic peak decreases the sensitivity of the analysis increases So SIM analysis allows for a smaller quantity of a compound to be detected and measured But the degree of certainty about the identity of that compound is reduced

When a second phase of mass fragmentation is added for example using a second quadrupole in a quadrupole instrument it is called tandem MS MSMS are good at measuring low levels of target compounds in a sample with a matrix of background compounds that are not of interest

The first quadrupole is connected with a collision cell and another quadrupole Both quadrupoles can be used in scanning or static mode depending on the type of MSMS analysis used Types of analysis include product ion scan precursor ion scan Selected Reaction Monitoring and Neutral Loss Scan For example When Q1 is in static mode and Q3 is in scanning mode one obtains a so called product ion spectrum From this spectrum one can select a prominent product ion which can be the product ion for the chosen precursor ion The pair is called a transition and forms the basis for SRM SRM is highly specific and virtually eliminates matrix background

Many chemists believe that GC MS is the best tool for monitoring organic pollutants in the environment The cost of GC MS equipment has decreased significantly The reliability of GC MS has increased at the same time Both improvements have increased use in environmental studies Some compounds such as certain pesticides and herbicides cannot be identified by GS MS They are too similar to other related compounds But for most organic analysis of environmental samples including many major classes of pesticides GC MS is very sensitive and effective

GC MS can analyze the particles from a human body in order to help link a criminal to a crime The law accepts using GC MS to analyze fire debris In fact the American Society for Testing Materials has a standard for fire debris analysis GCMSMS is especially useful here as samples often contain very complex matrices and results used in court need to be highly accurate

GC MS is used for detection of illegal narcotics and may eventually replace drug sniffing dogs It is also commonly used in forensic toxicology It helps to find drugs andor poisons in biological specimens taken from suspects victims or a dead body

After the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks explosive detection systems have become a part of all US airports These systems run on a host of technologies many of them based on GC MS There are only three manufacturers certified by the FAA to provide these systems The first is Thermo Detection which produces the EGIS a GC MS based line of explosives detectors The second is Barringer Technologies which is now owned by Smiths Detection Systems The third is Ion Track Instruments

Foods and beverages contain numerous aromatic compounds some naturally present in the raw materials and some forming during processing GC MS is extensively used for the analysis of these compounds which include esters fatty acids alcohols aldehydes terpenes etc It is also used to detect and measure contaminants from spoilage or adulteration which may be harmful The contaminants are often controlled by governmental agencies for example pesticides

Several GC MS have left earth Two went to Mars in the Viking program Venera 11 and 12 and Pioneer Venus analysed the atmosphere of Venus with GC MS The Huygens probe of the Cassini Huygens mission landed one GC MS on Saturns largest moon Titan The material in the comet 67PChuryumov Gerasimenko will be analysed by the Rosetta mission with a chiral GC MS in 2014

GC MS are used in newborn screening tests These tests can find dozens of congenital metabolic diseases GC MS can determine compounds in urine even in minor concentration These compounds are normally not present but appear in individuals suffering with metabolic disorders This is an increasingly becoming a common way to diagnose IEM for earlier diagnosis and institution of treatment This eventually leads to a better outcome It is now possible to test a newborn for over 100 genetic metabolic disorders by a urine test at birth based on GC MS

In combination with isotopic labeling of metabolic compounds the GC MS is used for determining metabolic activity Most applications are based on the use of 13C as the labeling and the measurement of 13C 12C ratios with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer A IRMS is an mass spectrometer with a detector designed to measure a few select ions and return values as ratios

Lacey Elizabeth Brown is an American singer songwriter record producer violinist painter model and fashion designer from Amarillo Texas She was the twelfth place finalist on the ninth season of American Idol

Born on August 13 1985 Brown is the daughter of the pastors of Victory Church a local Christian Church in Amarillo There she served as Venue director and taught civics and Christian values to Victorys internship students During her childhood she learned how to play the violin She also spent time in Tulsa Oklahoma where she had Bible schooling Her education includes studying art Her musical influences include folk and country as well as rock music such as Lady Antebellum Kings of Leon Coldplay and U2 apart from Patsy Cline Joni Mitchell Dolly Parton and Pete Yorn

Brown first auditioned for the eighth season of American Idol where she made it into the Top 54 of the Hollywood rounds Brown later auditioned in Orlando Florida with the song Over the Rainbow from The Wizard of Oz by Judy Garland The judges all loved her performance including guest judge Kristin Chenoweth and she made it through to the next round During Hollywood week her performance of What a Wonderful World was featured as a montage for contestants who made it to the Top 24 She performed Landslide on the first night of the semi finals but did not impress the judges The judges did not like her performance of Kiss Me by Sixpence None the Richer during the second week Despite this it was well received by the bands lead singer Leigh Nash Her cover of Brandi Carliles The Story on the final night before the finals was considered to be better Brown eventually made it to the Top 12

Browns performance of Ruby Tuesday by The Rolling Stones was described by the judges as not having energy but Simon Cowell added that there was nothing wrong with her vocals Brown was eliminated from the show on March 17 2010 The song What a Wonderful World was played at the beginning of the episode with a montage of the Top 12s journey setting the tone for her elimination Her elimination caused problems after Ryan Seacrest tweeted the results Angry fans did not watch the show which had the smallest audience among 18 49 year olds for a regularly scheduled in season episode in Idol history

Brown thanked her fans for their support and plans to return to her hometown after doing interviews in New York She says she will try acting as well as a career in music In her final moments on the show she said she might try country music although her MySpace page lists pop and folk as her genres A notable line of Brown in the show was Youve got to take nos and turn them into yeses

After leaving Idol Brown gave several media interviews with Entertainment Weekly USA Today The Los Angeles Times People several Fox affiliates MTV E with Ryan Seacrest on his radio show with Ellen DeGeneres on The Ellen DeGeneres Show along with several in New York including the Wendy Williams Show and The Late Show with David Letterman where she performed What a Wonderful World Among the finalists her closest friends are Paige Miles and Lee DeWyze although she is friends with all of them including Siobhan Magnus and Katie Stevens She said in these interviews that she is planning to continue her career in music but she is also open to any offers that may come to her She now lives in Nashville Tennessee She released an EP entitled Let It Go on May 31 2011 In 2011 Brown signed a management contract with Tracy Lawrence and she will be touring at the CMA Fest in Nashville in June 2011 

The alternative country EP Let It Go with five songs on it was released on May 31 2011 through the independent record label LEB Records Browns voice was described as a mix of sweet yet haunting tones with a hint of Brenda Lee Her writing style was described as pop lyrics resting on a bed of American Bluegrass

The official track listing released through the iTunes Store and Amazoncom on 31 May 2011

Andrea Moda Formula commonly referred to as Andrea Moda was a Formula One team which raced in the 1992 Formula One season It was founded by Andrea Sassetti who owned a shoe maker in Italy In 1991 Sassetti bought the old Coloni F1 team which had failed to get through pre qualifying

The team was excluded from the opening race in South Africa after not paying the required 100000 entry fee for new teams Sassetti argued that the team was a continuation of the Coloni team Even still the car was not ready as the team did not participate in the next race in Mexico Even though the team was entered in the next race in Brazil with drivers Roberto Moreno and Perry McCarthy the cars were still not ready At the fifth race in San Marino the car was finally ready but McCarthy did not receive his Super License which is required to race a F1 car However Moreno finally qualified his car in Monaco only to retire during the race due to an engine problem

In Canada the team did not have engines because Sassetti did not pay the engine supplier Judd the money The team also missed France due to their car being stuck in a blockade by French truck drivers

In August of 1992 the FIA warned the team that they might be excluded from the championship It was a known fact that McCarthy was barely given a chance since the team could not afford to properly run two cars so they mainly worked on Morenos car while McCarthy was only there to meet the rules of having two cars in the race

Finally at the Belgian Grand Prix Sassetti was arrested for forging invoices  The team was not allowed in the paddock at the Italian Grand Prix because the FIA banned the team brought Formula One into disrepute 

The popular separation method called Size Exclusive Chromatography separates components of mixture based on the size Recall a mixture can be composed of many substances each with different physical and chemical properties which can be used to differentiate them SEC essentially allows components that are larger in size to exit the column first while components that are smaller in size will exit the column last 

A typical column used in SEC has two substances called phases that interact with the mixture and these substances help force the separation of the mixture The mobile phase is a solvent which helps carry the mixture down the column and the stationary phase which does not move Unlike other chromatography methods the stationary phase used in SEC does not exploit the polarity of each component It is worth noting there is no chemical interaction between the stationary phase and a component A column could be packed with two types of stationary phase material First the stationary phase could be a porous solid A common porous solid is silica which has a diameter of 5 10m and a pore sizes ranging from 100 1000 Silica provides excellent rigidity and will not move throughout the column Porous solids are also stable at high pressures and temperatures which allows for the use of a vast variety of solvents Unfortunately silica particles have a tendency to allow absorb soluble components and they have the capacity to break down components into atoms For these reasons columns could also be packed with porous gels The structure of gel is vastly different from a porous solid because gels have a polymer like structure Gels have been shown to be more effective than porous solids at allowing components through its pores Gels have pore sizes ranging from 100 100000 So how is it that larger molecules exit the column before smaller molecules 

The porous material will not allow larger molecules to pass so these molecules go to the next pore and again they cannot pass They eventually get to the bottom of the column and exit the column Remember there is volume inside the column that is not inhabited by the stationary phase which allows for the flow of both the mobile phase and the sample These larger molecules then find themselves at the bottom of the column whereas smaller molecules have a longer path to travel Smaller molecules can pass through a pore and then pass through another one The smaller a molecule is the greater the chance is that it can fit into a pore which means the longer it spends inside the column

Notice the graph is logarithmic not linear There at two distinct positions on the curve the exclusion limit and the permeation limit The exclusion limit defines the maximum molecular weight that can enter a pore while the permeation limit signifies the minimum molecular weight to enter a pore The curve itself is called the permeation region and this provides a range of molecular weights which could be found in the experiment  Retention time how long the component spends in the column is plotted against molecular weight The peaks located in Figures 1 and 2 are similar to peaks liquid or gas chromatography readout Normally peaks found in liquid or gas chromatography indicates how many components are in a mixture if the number of components is unknown and the relative amount of each component in the mixture within a given range In the case of SEC these peaks indicate the relative amount of each component within the permeation region  

SEC has several advantages and disadvantages First in SEC the time it takes the mixture to exit the column can be controlled Depending on the chemical characteristics of the mixture and its components the process could be quick or slow Second the peaks are well defined sharp and narrow All characteristics indicate SCE provides good sensitivity Next there is low mass loss since the sample theoretically is not supposed to come interact with the stationary phase Last the stability of the stationary phase allows close packing to provide greater separation of components in the sample 

A clear disadvantage to SEC is with short retention times the peaks overlap and little information could be extracted from such data Resolution must be sacrificed if the process is to be shorter in time SEC does not provide data to distinguish between components of similar molecular mass For example if component A has molecular mass equal to 900 gmol and component B has molecular mass equal to 950 gmol SEC will show one peak in this region and both components will be represented by the same peak To have statistically different peaks there should be a 10 difference between molecular weight Also lumped into this category are enantiomers and diastereomers which are molecules of the same molecular weight but have slightly different structures  Last SEC fails to take into account for a components viscosity or resistance to flow

Thin layer chromatography is a method by which mixtures are separated into their individual components 

TLC is performed on a TLC plate These plates consist of a layer of silica and are usually backed by a thin piece of glass although other materials like plastic may be used The silica coating on the front of the TLC plate is called the stationary phase 

The process of running a TLC experiment starts with placing a small droplet of liquid analyte near the bottom of the TLC plate This is called spotting the TLC plate Very thin glass tubes are commonly used as spotters

Once a plate has been spotted it is placed into a glass container with a small amount of solvent This solvent is called the mobile phase It is important that the height of the solvent is below the height that the compound was spotted on the plate As the solvent moves up the TLC plate by capillary action the compound will also move The compound will be separated into its components based upon each components attraction for the stationary phase versus the mobile phase Components that are attracted to the mobile phase more than they are attracted to the stationary phase will move further up the column Attractive forces are based on polarity differences 

The TLC plate should be removed before the solvent reaches the top of the plate Separated compounds will sometimes be colored but further work is often required for analysis Many compounds will be illuminated when the TLC plate is placed under an ultraviolet lamp TLC plates are also commonly dipped in stains to force a compound to appear on the plate

TLC is commonly used by organic chemists to monitor the progress of reactions The presence of starting material and products may be monitored using a single TLC plate

Based on the results of a TLC experiment a larger volume of mixture may be separated by another technique using a similar solvent system Or a TLC experiment may be repeated using a different solvent Mixtures of solvents may also be used Use of different solvents will affect how well individual components are separated on the TLC plate

Bragg diffraction was proposed by William Lawrence Bragg and William Henry Bragg in 1912 Diffraction occurs when electromagnetic radiation encounters an obstacle and must scatter in various directions Braggs law allows for the angles at which the beam of electromagnetic radiation is scattered when the beam strikes a solid crystalline surface to be known Bragg diffraction utilizes Braggs law to study the diffraction patterns for crystalline solids X ray radiation is typically used when studying diffraction Braggs law is used in X ray diffraction to study the structure of crystalline solids 

Diffraction occurs when a wave runs into an obstacle and must avoid the obstacle Therefore diffraction describes the apparent bending of waves around objects and the spreading of waves when passing through a small hole The pattern in which diffraction occurs is due to constructive and destructive wave interference which leads to either a larger or smaller amplitude wave respectively Diffraction patterns can yield information about the arrangement of the lattice points where diffraction occurs

The use of X rays for the study of crystalline solids is due to the fact that the wavelength of an X ray is on the same order of the distance between lattice planes Therefore X rays will diffract in a crystalline solids The requirements for X ray diffraction are that the spacing between the lattice layers must be the same as the wavelength of the source radiation and that the lattice centers must be highly ordered to produce constructive and destructive interference Constructive interference causes the scattering radiation to be reflected from the crystal lattice and destructive interference causes the scattering radiation to be destroyed Therefore only at lattice points where constructive interference takes place is scattered radiation detected The constructive and destructive interference that results from the diffraction of highly ordered diffraction planes causes highly ordered diffraction patterns that can be used to identify the pattern of the diffraction planes

The Reichshofstadion is a football stadium in Vorarlbergs city Lustenau It is the largest stadium in this federal state of Austria The stadium is the homeground of SC Austria Lustenau but is also used by the second club from Lustenau FC Lustenau 07

The stadium was built from 1952 till 1953 and was in the beginning a multipurpose stadium with a running track During the construction of new stands the track was used so today the stadium is de facto a pure football stadium It is the homeground of both Lustenau clubs in Austrias First league Originally it was the homeground of Austria Lustenau but after the promotion of FC Lustenau to the first league their stadium was not good enough for the league The stadium offers 8 800 places 2126 roofed seats 2390 roofed and 4284 unroofed standing room

On 3 August 2007 the chapel of the stadium was consecrate where fans of Austria Lustenau can merry It is named after Hugo Kleinbrod who cared after the 2 World War for children and orphans

In May 2011 supporters of FC Lustenau coloured the main stand and a cash desk in their club colour blue although they were originally green which is Austrias colour

Billiard Congress of America is a group that organizes for cue sports in the United States It started in 1948 as a non profit trade organizationThe BCA headquarters is in Broomfield Colorado The voting members of the organization are mostly equipment manufacturerscn

The Philippine Commonwealth was the name of the Philippines from 1935 to 1946 when it was still controlled by the United States The Philippine Commonwealth was created by the Tydings McDuffie Act which was approved by the US Congress in 1934 When Manuel L Quezon became president in 1935 he was the first Filipino to head an elected government in the Philippines

The President of Philippine Commonwealth had strong control of the islands and was guided by a Supreme Court The National Assembly or law making part of the government members mostly come from the Nacionalista Party was at first only one but later became two a lower part and a higher part In 1937 the government chose Tagalog the language of Manila as the national language Women were allowed to vote and the economy was strong

The Philippine Commonwealth government was forced out of the country from 19421945 when the Philippines was under Japanese control In 1946 the Philippine Commonwealth ended when the Third Philippines Republic began

The Philippine Commonwealth was also known as the Commonwealth of the Philippines or simply as the Commonwealth It had official names in Malasariling Pamahalan ng Pilipinas and Mancomunidad Filipina The 1935 constitution specifies Philippines as the countrys short form name and uses Philippine Islands only to refer to pre 1935 status and institutions Under the previous regime known most formally as the Territory of the Philippine Islands both terms had official status

The Philippine Commonwealth had its own constitution which remained effective until 1973 and was self governing although foreign policy and military affairs would be under the responsibility of the United States and certain legislation required the approval of the American President

It featured a very strong President a single National Assembly and a Supreme Court all composed entirely of Filipinos as well as an elected Resident Commissioner to the United States House of Representatives An American High Commissioner and an American Military Advisor were also present in the government while a Field Marshall was in charge of the Philippine Army

In 1939 40 after an amendment in the Constitution an upper and lower Congress consisting of a Philippine Senate and of a House of Representatives was restored replacing the National Assembly

The pre 1935 US territorial administration or Insular Government was headed by a governor general who was appointed by the president of the US In December 1932 the US Congress passed the Hare Hawes Cutting Act with the premise of granting Filipinos independence Provisions of the bill included reserving several military and naval bases for the United States as well as imposing tariffs and quotas on Philippine exports It was vetoed by President Herbert Hoover but the American Congress overrode his veto in 1933 and passed the bill The bill however was opposed by the then Philippine Senate President Manuel L Quezon and was also rejected by the Philippine Senate

This led to the creation and passing of a new bill known as Tydings McDuffie Act or Philippine Independence Act which allowed the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines with a 10 year period of peaceful transition to full independence The Commonwealth was officially inaugurated on November 15 1935

A Constitutional Convention was convened in Manila on July 30 1934 On February 8 1935 the 1935 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines was approved by the convention by a vote of 177 to 1 The constitution was approved by President Franklin D Roosevelt on March 23 1935 and ratified by popular vote on May 14 1935

In October 1935 Philippine presidential elections were held Candidates included former president Emilio Aguinaldo the Philippine Independent Church leader Gregorio Aglipay and others Manuel L Quezon and Sergio Osmea of the Nacionalista Party were proclaimed the winners winning the seats of president and vice president respectively

The Commonwealth Government was inaugurated on the morning of November 15 1935 in ceremonies held on the steps of the Old Congress Building in Manila The event was attended by a crowd of around 300000 people

The new government embarked on ambitious nation building policies in preparation for economic and political independence These included national defense greater control over the economy the perfection of democratic institutions reforms in education improvement of transport the promotion of local capital industrialization and the colonization of Mindanao

However uncertainties especially in the diplomatic and military situation in Southeast Asia in the level of US commitment to the future Republic of the Philippines and in the economy due to the Great Depression proved to be major problems The situation was further complicated by the presence of agrarian unrest and of power struggles between Osmea and Quezon especially after Quezon was permitted to be re elected after one six year term

A proper evaluation of the policies effectiveness or failure is difficult due to Japanese invasion and occupation during World War II

Japan launched a surprise attack on the Philippines on December 8 1941 The Philippine Commonwealth government drafted the Philippine Army into the US Army Forces Far East which would resist Japanese occupation Manila was declared an open city to prevent its destruction and it was occupied by the Japanese on January 2 1942 Meanwhile battles against the Japanese continued on the Bataan Peninsula Corregidor and Leyte until the final surrender of United States Philippine forces on May 1942

Quezon and Osmea were escorted by troops from Manila to Corregidor and later they left for Australia and then the US There they set up a government in exile which participated in the Pacific War Council as well as the Declaration by United Nations During this exile Quezon became ill with tuberculosis and later he died of it Osmea replaced him as the president

Meanwhile the Japanese military organized a new government in the Philippines known as the Second Philippine Republic which was headed by president Jos P Laurel This government ended up being very unpopular

The resistance to the Japanese occupation continued in the Philippines This included the Hukbalahap which consisted of 30000 armed people and controlled much of Central Luzon Remnants of the Philippine Army also fought the Japanese through guerrilla warfare and it was successful since all but 12 of the 48 provinces were liberated

The American General Douglas MacArthurs army landed on Leyte on 20 October 1944 and they were all welcomed as liberators along with Philippine Commonwealth troops when other amphibious landings soon followed Fighting continued in remote corners of the Philippines until Japans surrender in August 1945 which was signed on 2 September in Tokyo Bay Estimates for Filipino casualties reached one million and Manila was extensively damaged when certain Japanese forces refused to vacate the city

After the War in the Philippines the Philippine Commonwealth was restored and a one year transitional period in preparation for independence began Elections followed in April 1946 with Manuel Roxas winning as the first president of the independent Republic of the Philippines and Elpidio Quirino winning as vice president In spite of the years of Japanese occupation the Philippines became independent exactly as scheduled a decade before on July 4 1946

The Commonwealth ended when the US recognized Philippine independence on July 4 1946 as scheduled However the economy remained dependent to the US This was due to the Bell Trade Act otherwise known as the Philippine Trade Act which was a precondition for receiving war rehabilitation grants from the United States

At the time tenant farmers held grievances often rooted to debt caused by the sharecropping system as well as by the dramatic increase in population which added economic pressure to the tenant farmers families As a result an agrarian reform program was initiated by the Commonwealth However success of the program was hampered by ongoing clashes between tenants and landowners

An example of these clashes includes one initiated by Benigno Ramos through his Sakdalista movement which advocated tax reductions land reforms the breakup of the large estates or haciendas and the severing of American ties The uprising which occurred in Central Luzon on May 1935 claimed about a hundred lives

Due to the diverse number Philippine languages a program for the development and adoption of a common national language based on the existing native dialects was drafted in the 1935 Philippine constitution The Commonwealth created a Surian ng Wikang Pambansa which was composed of Quezon and six other members from various ethnic groups A deliberation was held and Tagalog was selected as the basis for the national language to be called Pilipino

In 1940 the Commonwealth authorized the creation of a dictionary and grammar book for the language On the same year Commonwealth Act 570 was passed allowing Pilipino to become an official language upon independence

The cash economy of the Commonwealth was mostly agriculture based Products included abaca coconuts and coconut oil sugar and timber Numerous other crops and livestock were grown for local consumption by the Filipino people Other sources for foreign income included the spin off from money spent at the American army navy and air bases on the Philippines such as the naval base at Subic Bay and Clark Air Base both on the island of Luzon

The performance of the economy was initially good despite challenges from various agrarian uprisings Taxes collected from a robust coconut industry helped boost the economy by funding infrastructure and other development projects However growth was halted due to the outbreak of World War II

In 1941 the estimated population of the Philippines reached 17000000 while Manilas population was 684000 The number of Chinese rose to 117000 There were also 30000 Japanese with 20000 living in Davao and 9000 US Mexicans English was spoken by 27 of the population while Spanish was spoken by only 3

The following is the estimated number of speakers of the dominant languages

1 Died due to tuberculosis at Saranac Lake New York End of Commonwealth government independent Republic inaugurated 

In 1935 Quezon won the Philippines first national presidential election under the banner of the Nacionalista Party He obtained nearly 68 of the vote against his two main rivals Emilio Aguinaldo and Bishop Gregorio Aglipay Quezon was inaugurated in November 1935 He is recognized as the second President of the Philippines However in January 2008 Congressman Rodolfo Valencia of Oriental Mindoro filed a bill seeking instead to declare General Miguel Malvar as the second Philippine President having directly succeeded Aguinaldo in 1901

Quezon had originally been barred by the Philippine constitution from seeking re election However in 1940 constitutional amendments were ratified allowing him to seek re election for a fresh term ending in 1943 In the 1941 presidential elections Quezon was re elected over former Senator Juan Sumulong with nearly 82 of the vote

In a notable humanitarian act Quezon in cooperation with US High Commissioner Paul V McNutt facilitated the entry into the Philippines of Jewish refugees fleeing fascist regimes in Europe Quezon was also instrumental in promoting a project to resettle the refugees in Mindanao

Quezon suffered from tuberculosis and spent his last years in a cure cottage in Saranac Lake New York where he died on August 1 1944 He was initially buried in Arlington National Cemetery His body was later carried by the USS Princeton and re interred in Manila at the Manila North Cemetery before being moved to Quezon City within the monument at the Quezon Memorial Circle

Osmea became president of the Commonwealth on Quezons death in 1944 He returned to the Philippines the same year with General Douglas MacArthur and the liberation forces After the war Osmea restored the Commonwealth government and the various executive departments He continued the fight for Philippine independence

For the presidential election of 1946 Osmea refused to campaign saying that the Filipino people knew of his record of 40 years of honest and faithful service Nevertheless he was defeated by Manuel Roxas who won 54 of the vote and became the first president of the independent Republic of the Philippines

Roxas served as the President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines in a brief period from his subsequent election on May 28 1946 to July 4 1946 the scheduled date of the proclamation of Philippine Independence Roxas prepared the groundwork for the advent of a free and independent Philippines assisted by the Philippine Congress with Senator Jose Avelino as the Senate President and Congressman Eugenio Perez as the House of Representatives Speaker On June 3 1946 Roxas appeared for the first time before the joint session of the Congress to deliver his first state of the nation address Among other things he told the members of the Congress the grave problems and difficulties the Philippines are set to face and reports of his special trip to the US the approval for independence

On June 21 he reappeared into another joint session of the Congress and urged the acceptance of two important laws passed by the US Congress on April 30 1946 to the Philippine lands They are the Philippine Rehabilitation Act and the Bell Trade Act or Philippine Trade Act Both recommendations were accepted by the Congress

The Austrian Football Association is the highest body of football in Austria It organizes the football league Austrian Bundesliga the Austrian Cup and the Austrian national team and the same items in womens football It is based in Vienna

In 2010 501685 male and female players are organized into 2256 teams This number makes the FB the largest sport organisation in Austria 

In 1894 the first football club was founded and 10 years later the sterreichischer Fuball Bund Until 1904 the sterreichische Fuball Union was the leading body in Austrian football but it dissolved after the foundation of the FB In 1905 it became a member of FIFA In 1908 the FB was host for the fifth FIFA congress Since 1954 the FB has also been a member of the UEFA

The time before the Second World War was the most successful for the FB Between 1930 and 1933 the so called Wunderteam won 14 matches In 1934 they reached fourth place in the FIFA World Cup The Austrian team won the silver medal in the Olympic football tournament in Berlin Also after the Second World War Austria played in different FIFA World Cups 1954 1958 1978 1982 1990 and 1998 The most successful World Cup was 1954 with third place The last international tournament was the UEFA Euro 2008 which was hosted by Austria and Switzerland

The Casino Stadion Hohe Warte is a footballstadium in Viennas Dbling district It is the homeground of the oldest football club in Austria First Vienna FC 1894 It is also used by the American football team Vienna Vikings

The stadion was opended in 1921 with a match between First Vienna and SC Hakoah Wien The stadium was planed by Eduard Schnecker who was not only a architect but also a notable football defender playing for SK Rapid Wien and the national team With 90 000 visitors it was the largest stadium in Europe at this time The international matches at this time were watched by up to 80 000 visitors Today the capacity is 4 500 because the City closed the natural hills around the stadium for visitors

In the 1920s the stadium was used for open air operas and boxing 1924 the composer Pietro Mascagni conducted the opera Aida by Giuseppe Verdi

Flame Ionization Detectors is a common type detector used in gas chromatography These detectors are best at detecting organic compounds The first flame ionization detector was developed in 1957 in Australia

The purpose of a FID is to detect compounds as they exit out of the gas chromatography column The compounds that are exiting the column are in the gas phase Detection is done by first turning the gas compounds into ions and electrons and then collecting the charged molecules The FID turns compounds into ions and electrons by putting them into a flame The fuel used to make the flame in FIDs is usually made of a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen As these charged materials are collected they make a current which is measured The larger the current the more charged compounds are being collected Currents for FIDs are usually about 10 12 amps and are measured by a high impedance picoammeter

Flame ionization detectors are used most often for organic compounds This is because organic compounds contain lot of carbon atoms which easily turn into ions Reduced carbons make the most ions Other carbons such as alcohols and carbonyls do not make as many ions

Many times organic samples being tested are not pure The samples often contain impurities such as water carbon dioxide sulfur dioxide nitrous oxides and noble gases The FID does not detect these impurities because they do not burn This makes the FID a very useful detector because the samples being tested do not have to be purified before being tested

FID can be used to detect very small amounts of material as small as 10 13 gs It is also accurate over a large range of molecule amounts One problem with FID is that it destroys the sample being tested Any sample used in gas chromatography with an FID cannot be used for other measurements afterwards Also a lot of fuel is required as well as very exact equipment to get exact results

Santiago de Tequila is a Mexican city The town is located in the Mexican state of Jalisco The population of Tequila was 38534 in the 2005 census The town is known for being the birthplace of the spirit beverage known as tequila The popularity and history of the drink made the town of Tequila a World Heritage Site

The Cashpoint Arena is a football stadium in Altach Vorarlberg Austria It is the homeground of SCR Rheindorf Altach a football club playing in Austrian Football First League which is the second level in Austrias football

The stadium was built 198990 and was opened on 1 June 1990 under the name Schnabelholz 1998 the main stand of the stadium was completely roofed After the promotion to the First league a floodlighting was installed After the promotion to the Bundesliga a new stand with 1 800 seats was built because the Bundesliga regulates 3000 seats at least The stadium now offers over 3000 roofed seats 2006 the match versus SK Rapid Wien was visited by 8 900 people which is the record till today 

The stadium offers a unique athmosphere because the visitors are near to the playing field But the stadium is not only used for football but also for open air concerts and other events

Time domain spectroscopy is a type of spectroscopy that measures the power of electromagnetic radiation as a function of time Normal spectroscopy is frequency domain spectroscopy It measures radiation as a function of frequency or wavelength Time domain spectroscopy usually requires the use of Fourier transforms

Spectroscopy done with visible or infrared radiation involves wavelengths of 1012 to 1015 Hz Phototransducers cannot make measurements that quickly What is needed then is a way to make these high frequency signals into low frequency signals For optical spectroscopy the most common way to do this is by using a Michelson interferometer

Monochromatic light traveling through a Michelson interferometer is split into two beams by a beam splitter These beams travel to mirrors reflect and then recombine at the beam splitter One of the mirrors can be moved If the two mirrors are the same distance apart they meet at the beam splitter in phase and show constructive interference As the one mirror is moved the beams become slightly more out of phase When the movable mirror has moved a distance equal to of the lights wavelength the extra distance it travels is the lights wavelength This means that when the two beams combine at the beam splitter they destructively interfere So moving the mirror a total distance of the wavelength of light means the spectra will show one complete cycle One could then plot the power of radiation as a function of distance traveled by the movable mirror However by knowing the speed of the movable mirror the power of radiation can be plotted as a function of time

Most time domain spectroscopy experiments involve broadband radiation To design instruments for these experiments the mirror speed must be constant and the mirror position must be known exactly Also because broadband spectra are complex times in the experiment need to be well defined Specifically the time when measurements start and the interval of measurements need to be well defined To do this spectrometers usually contain multiple interferometers

One interferometer must use a broadband source that will probe the sample This is the interferometer that actually makes the interferogram that will be used by the person doing the experiment A second interferometer uses a laser source so that the light is monochromatic Monochromatic sources will give cosine waves in their interferograms These are then converted to square waves Because the output is a consistent wave it can be used to measure time Specifically every time the wave passes through zero a measurement is made Another interferometer often used has a white light source White light is made of all wavelengths in the visible spectrum As explained above having so many wavelengths mean that destructive interference happens quickly Because the peak at complete constructive interference is so large it can be used to mark the start of the experiment It should also be noted that the movable mirror is the same for all interferometers

Time domain spectroscopy is used very often in infrared spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy It has several advantages over frequency domain spectroscopy In frequency domain experiments each wavelength must be measured one at a time This means scans can take several minutes A single time domain experiment takes no longer than a minute Usually it only takes seconds This means that many scans may be taken for a given sample and that the scans can be averaged So not only is the time domain experiment faster but it can also have a better signal to noise ratio

Gut flora consists of microorganisms that live in the digestive system of animals It is the largest reservoir of human flora 

The human body consisting of about 100 trillion cells carries about ten times as many microorganisms in the intestines The metabolic activities performed by these bacteria resemble those of an organ leading some to call gut flora a forgotten organ It is estimated that these gut flora have around 100 times as many genes in aggregate as there are in the human genome

Bacteria make up most of the flora in the colon and up to 60 of the dry mass of faeces Somewhere between 300 and 1000 different species live in the gut with most estimates at about 500 However it is probable that 99 of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species Fungi and protozoa also make up a part of the gut flora but little is known about their activities

Research suggests that the relationship between gut flora and humans is not merely commensal but rather a symbiotic relationship Though people can survive without gut flora the microorganisms perform a host of useful functions such as fermenting unused energy substrates training the immune system preventing growth of harmful pathogenic bacteria regulating the development of the gut producing vitamins for the host and producing hormones to direct the host to store fats However in some conditions some species can cause disease by producing an infection or increasing cancer risk for the host

Over 99 of the bacteria in the gut are anaerobic but in the cecum aerobic bacteria reach high densities

The traditional view is that no metazoan phylum can break down cellulose by producing the enzyme cellulase Instead herbivores contain in their gut microorganisms which produce cellulase This is important because cellulose is the most common organic compound on Earth About 33 of all plant matter is cellulose Recently evidence has emerged that some animals do produce their own cellulase The question is not yet quite settled

Magnetic quadruples are employed in a variety of different machines and used for different purposes The majority of magnetic quadruples are just a system of four bars arranged parallel to each other 

From the back and front the Magnetic Quadrupole appears to be the four points that create the corners of a square Two of the bars have similar positive potentials and the other two bars have negative potentials 

The applied potentials are created by running current through the four rods Current is proportional to the voltage and resistance by the equation ViR

The resulting applied voltage affects affect the trajectory of ions traveling down the flight path centered between the four rods For ACDC voltages only ions of a certain mass to charge ratio pass through the quadrupole filter and all other ions are thrown out of their original path This happens because the magnetic field created from the applied voltages is not enough to maintain the ions along the path created from the magnetic quadrupole Quadrupoles are used in mass spectrometers A mass spectrum is obtained by monitoring the ions passing through the quadrupole filter as the voltages on the rods are varied A mass spectrum is created by the detector counting the number of ions filtered out and relaying that signal to a data processing unit that converts the signals into quantitative and easily understood data

Quadrupoles are also used in synchrotrons As the beam of particles being acelerated passes through the quadrupole it becomes more narrow and focused

First past the post is a voting system used by some countries to elect their governments In a first past the post system a country is divided into constituencies and in these constituencies people known as candidates who each represent a different political party will stand for election to the countrys parliament In the individual constituencies the candidate who gets the most votes from people wins the race to be elected

Countries using First past the post include the United Kingdom Canada India and partly in the United States

In a first past the post system candidate A wins because he receives more votes than anyone else

UV Visible absorption is a process where a molecule absorbs ultraviolet or visible light that excites electrons This energy causes an electronic transition from a ground state to an excited state

Different molecules will absorb different wavelengths of light The wavelengths of light for UV visible absorption are from about 200 nanometers to 800 nanometers This is a section of the electromagnetic spectrum pictured

Absorption of light starts with energy of a certain wavelength in this UV visible region being exposed to a molecule The lightenergy then excites the ground state outer or valence electrons to an excited state The outcome of this can be measured by a UV visible spectrophotometer The data is shown as a spectrum with absorption versus wavelength This pattern can be used to learn properties of the molecule Only certain molecules can absorb light in this region

Molecules that absorb light at these wavelengths are called chromophores Chromophores are functional groups of a molecule that absorb light in this UV Visible region They are most of the time characterized by delocalized pi electrons Pi electrons refer to a type of bond that occurs between electron orbitals called pi orbitals When many of these pi bonds exist in a molecule this allows electrons to be delocalized or spread out across a molecule An example of this type of molecule is pictured below Many dyes are characterized by these delocalized pi electrons and their color These molecules can be used for pH indicators to determine if a solution is acidic or basic The addition of acid or base disrupts the delocalized pi electrons This disruption causes a color change

A absorption aabsorptivity coefficient bpathlength cconcentration

The components of Beers Law are can be determined by tests They can also be referenced in literature If the absorption is measured by a UV visible spectrophotometer pathlength is related to the sample container used in the test The sample container is made of a material that does not absorb light in this region The thickness of this cuvette is a known value This is the pathlength the light will travel through to reach the sample The molar absorptivity coefficient can be calculated by measuring the absorption of a sample of a known concentration and known pathlength The absorptivity coefficient units are dependent on the pathlength and concentration units Molar absorptivity units are L mol 1 cm 1 when the concentration units are molarity The absorptivity is a measure of how strongly a molecule absorbs light at a particular wavelength Once this constant is determined unknown concentrations can be determined from this relationship

Alexander Tolmer was the man in charge of the South Australian police force Born in England to French parents he studied to be a teacher of languages He joined the army and saw action in Portugal from 18261833 during the civil war Tolmer moved to South Australia in 1836 where Governor George Gawler thought his background in the cavalry would make a the right person to set up a group of mounted police

In 1852 Tolmer became the police commissioner He led a group of police from South Australia to the Victorian gold fields and escorted a load of gold back to Adelaide

In 1856 after a number of small arguments with his offices Tolmer was removed as commissioner He tried farming but this was unsuccessful He tried to lead an exploring group to cross Australia from south to north but this also failed before it left Adelaide He became a ranger for crown lands in 1862 and retired in 1885 He died at Mitcham South Australia on 7 March 1890

The term conversion of units refers to changing an amount of a measurement unit into another unit There are many different systems of units so some conversions can be very complex Most conversions involve a conversion factor and a shift amount to change from a unit x into a unit y by the general equation y mx b That type of conversion is known as a linear transform or a mathematical translation

One of the most common conversions is to change meters into feet by multiplying the amount in meters by about 328 feet per meter

Typically conversion amounts are rounded to the same precision as the original input amount such as 10 meters being 33 feet

In 1919 the Slyes bought a farm in Duck Run located near Lucasville Ohio which is 12 miles north of Portsmouth There they built a six room home But the farm alone could not give a good income for his family so Leorands father Andrew took a job at a shoe factory in Portsmouth He lived there during the week and came back home on the weekends He used to bring gifts for his family after paydays One important gift was a horse on which Leonard learned how to ride a horse

After Leonard comleted his eight grade he studied at High School in McDermott Ohio When he was 17 his family returned to Cincinnati In Cincinnati his father started work at another shoe factory Leonard also wanted to help his family to earn more money So he left high school He started to work with his father at the shoe factory and went to night school Leonard was made laughed at for sleeping in class So he left the night school and never joined again

Leonard and his father did not like their factory jobs In 1929 his older sister Mary went to Lawndale California with her husband Leonard and his father left their shoe factory jobs The family lived with Mary for four months and then cam back to Ohio Soon Leonard got to go to California with Marys husbands father Rest of the family came to California in the spring of 1930

The Slyes took a small house on rent near Mary Leonard and his father very soon found jobs as truck drivers for a highway making project But when they came to work they got to know that their employer had become bankrupt Soon came the years of Great Depression The Slyes were now moving from job to job collecting fruit and living in worker camps One day Andrew Slye got to know about a shoe factory giving jobs in Los Angeles Andrew asked Leonard to join him Leonard used to feel happy playing guitar and singing around campfires So he told his father that he wanted to earn money through music His father allowed him to do so Leonard and his cousin Stanley Slye went to Los Angeles and started to perform as The Slye Brothers

Leonard now came to be known as Len In 1932 he met Lucille Ascolese while on tour The same year a palomino colt was born in Santa Cietro CA The young horse was first named Golden Cloud and later renamed Trigger In May 1933 Len 21 proposed to Lucille 19 through radio Len then went on tour with the O Bar O Cowboys In June 1933 Len met Grace Arline Wilkins at a radio station in New Mexico She gave Len a lemon pie in return of his singing Swiss Yodel on the radio By August 1934 Len and Lucille had separated as she was jealous and tired of being a musicians wife Len and Lucilles divorced on June 8 1936 Len and Grace Arline Wilkins married in Roswell New Mexico on June 11 1936

In 1941 Len and his wife Grace adopted a girl Cheryl Darlene In 1942 they legally changed their names to Roy and Grace Arline Rogers The next year Arline gave birth to a daughter Linda Lou 

According to the religious theories this world is temporary and mortal This world is created for test of the faith of man Every one is under observation by God through His angels One day God who created this world will end it A new permanent life will start after the death However unless the whole world ends the dead people will stay in a medium world between the death and the Day of Judgment called the world of grave where the body will perish but soul will remain After the end of the whole world all the dead bodies will be restored into their previous shapes by the command of God They will be judged by their good and bad actions on the Day of Judgment They will be sent to Paradise a permanent blissful state for His obedient ones or to he Hell a place for punishment for the evil souls

The Lehener Stadion was a former football stadium in Salzburg and between 1971 and 2002 the homeground of SV Austria Salzburg

Due to the fact that SV Austria Salzburg was promoted to the Nationalliga the plan was to build a new stadium In 1966 architect Hanns Wiser made the first sketch of the new venue with 15 000 seats and two roofed stands In 1967 the City decided to build the new stadium in Lehen and to make places for 18 000 spectators The space for the new venue was also before a football groundTogether with Jakob Adlhart Wiser made a new plan and the stadium was built between 1969 and 1971 Because money was short the east stand was designed as standingroom so the capacity could be 18 000 although the building was cheaper The floodlight was opened in 1974 because neighbours took legal action against it

The stadium was opend with a friendly match between SV Asutria Salzburg and the national team of Tunesia In mid 1990s the stadium was to small because Austria Salzburg played international matches and the UEFA licensed it for only 5 300 spectators So Austria Salzburg played the international matches in Viennas Ernst Happel Stadion It was planed to expand the stadium but the city of Salzburg decided to build a new stadium in Wals Siezenheim because the city needed a venue for the UEFA Euro 2008 The last match was held on 4 December 2002 versus SK Sturm Graz

The stadium was demolished in 2006 One part of the former stadium is now used by Salzburgs Citylibrary and a housing project is planed

In the stadium 9 matches of the Austrian nationalteam were held The most memorable was the 90 versus Malta on 30 April 1977 where the young Hans Krankl scored 6 goals But Austria Salzburg played notable matches in the venue for example the 30 victory over Sporting Lissabon in the 199394 UEFA Cup and in the second round of the UEFA Cup 1976 versus Roter Stern Belgrad

The Australian Overland Telegraph Line was a 3200 km telegraph line that joined Darwin with Port Augusta in South Australia Completed in 1872 the Overland Telegraph Line allowed fast communication between Australia and the rest of the world It was one of the great engineering feats of 19th century Australia It followed the route discovered by the explorer John McDouall Stuart in 1862 It was probably the most important milestone in Australias telegraphic history

Because of the limits of technology the telegraph messages could only travel about 300 km along the line Repeater stations were built at regular intervals so that the messages could be resent Some of the stations became the start of cities such as Alice Springs or Tennant Creek while others became forgotten ruins such as the Peake Repeater Station built near Freeling Springs in South Australia

The Warumungu are a group of Indigenous Australians who live in the region of Tennant Creek and Alice Springs in the Northern Territory of Australia as well as small towns in South Australia Many still speak the traditional language and others speak Kriol

In June 1861 explorer John McDouall Stuart who was the first European person to visit the area was attacked by a group of about 30 Warumungu warriors They threw boomerangs at the explorers and then set fire to grass Stuart says in his journal that he and his men fired their guns at the Warumungu but he does not mention if any were wounded or killed The site of the battle has been called Attack Creek Stuart was forced to return to Adelaide The Northern Territory government has built a roadside memorial park near the site on the Stuart Highway

Bryan Gunn used to be a footballer He was a goalkeeper He played for Aberdeen and Hibernian in Scotland but mostly he played for Norwich City He also played a few times for Scotland in the early 1990s

When he finished playing football he had many different jobs at Norwich City working at Carrow Road until he eventually became manager of the team A terrible 7 1 defeat caused him to lose his job and he has since become a businessman

One of Bryan Gunns children died of leukaemia Since then he has raised more than 1000000 to pay for projects to help people with the disease and to try to find a cure for it

Chambers Pillar is a sandstone formation about 160 km south of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory of Australia Erosion by wind and rain has left an isolated pillar of 350 million year old sandstone It stands 50 metres above the surrounding plain

John McDouall Stuart was the first European to see Chambers Pillar reaching the site in April 1860 He named it after James Chambers who had paid for the exploring trip Over the years numerous visitors have added graffiti by carving names in the soft sandstone at the base of the pillar 

Chambers Pillar can only be reached by 4WD track Day tours from Alice Springs are often combined with a trip to Rainbow Valley

A Passion play is a religious drama of medieval origin dealing with the suffering death and Resurrection of Christ Early Passion plays consisted of readings from the Gospel with interpolated poetical sections on the events of Christs Passion and related subjects such as Mary Magdalenes life and repentance the raising of Lazarus the Last Supper and the lament of the Virgin Mary Use of the vernacular in these interpolations led to the development of independent vernacular plays the earliest surviving examples being in German Such plays were at first only preludes to dramatic presentations of the Resurrection The introduction of Satan and thus of introductory representations of the fall of Lucifer and the Fall of man and of scenes from the Old Testament and of the Last Judgment led to development of cyclic plays similar to the Corpus Christi cycles The great Celtic Passion cycles of Cornwall and Brittany and the St Gall Passion play exemplify this type of Passion play

The Tirol plays early formed a separate group representing only scenes from the Passion and Resurrection The Bohemian plays such as the St Eger Passion developed from a simpler version of the Vienna Passion were also distinct in style and incident

The earliest Passion plays of France and Flanders are thought to have their source in a nondramatic narrative poem of the 13th century the Passion des jongleurs These plays became highly elaborated in the course of their development culminating in performances lasting more than a week Confraternities were founded for performance of Passion plays the most famous being the Confrrie de la Passion Passion plays were also performed in Spain Italy and elsewhere with local variations

By the 16th century many of the Passion plays debased by secular influences had degenerated into mere popular entertainments full of crude slapstick and buffoonery Many were forbidden by ecclesiastical authorities and many more were suppressed after the Reformation

The most famous of the Passion plays to survive into the 20th century is that performed at Oberammergau in the Bavarian Alps According to tradition the play has been presented every 10 years since 1634 in fulfillment of a vow made after the village was spared an epidemic of plague except in 1870 during the Franco Prussian War and World War II when religious plays were banned It remains an entirely local production with villagers taking all the parts and singing in the chorus Since 1930 roofed seats have protected the audience from the weather The production runs from May through September Some villagers and some Jewish organizations have protested anti Semitic overtones in the 1860 text Traditional Passion plays have also been revived in villages in the Austrian Tirol In northern Spain during Lent and Holy Week a Catalan Passion play is performed by villagers and in Tegelen in the Netherlands a modern play by the Dutch poet Jacques Scheurs is given every five years

An inductively coupled plasma is a of plasma source Electromagnetic induction creates energy in the source by causing ions to circulate Movement of the ions generates energy in the form of heat

Inductively coupled plasma sources usually use argon as a fuel Unfortunately most ICP sources require at least 5 Lmin of argon This makes inductively coupled plasma a rather expensive source The argon atoms are ionized with a spark from tesla coil These ions will circulate due to the magnetic field to produce heat and high temperatures This will cause additional ions to be formed from the argon fuel After a period of time the torch will reach temperatures between 6 000 and 10 000 Kelvin

The high temperatures produced by ICP make it a popular source for many scientific experiments This source had the advantage of providing strong signals and only small amounts of noise or interference Also the data obtained from experiments using an inductively coupled plasma source is often linear This makes it easy for scientists to determine the amount of something in a sample Some of the most common applications are 

Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy is one of the most common applications of ICP The plasma source is used to heat a sample At high enough temperatures electrons in the sample atoms will gain enough energy to move into an excited state Energy is released in the form of photons when electrons fall from the excited state to a lower energy The lower energy state is usually called the ground state of an atom

The wavelength of the emissions are determined by a detector Most atoms will emit light at different wavelengths so scientists may use this information to identify atoms in a sample The intensity of emission is related to the amount of an atom in the sample Scientist may use the wavelength and intensity to determine both the identity and amount of an atom ICP AES is often used for the detection of toxins such as heavy metals It may also be used for chemical studies

Inductively coupled plasma source may be used for the detection of approximately 60 different elements These include most alkali metals alkaline earth metals metalloids all transition metals and some f block elements

Carl Richard Woese is an American microbiologist and physicist

Woese is famous for defining the Archaea in 1977 He used phylogenetic taxonomy of 16S ribosomal RNA a technique pioneered by him which is now standard practice 

He was also the originator of the RNA world hypothesis in 1977 although not by that name He holds the Stanley O Ikenberry Chair and is professor of microbiology at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign

After defining Archaea as a new domain Woese redrew the taxonomic tree His three domain system is based upon genetic relationships It divides life into 23 main divisions in three domains Bacteria Archaea and Eukarya Archaea are neither bacteria nor eukaryotes Looked at another way they are prokaryotes that are not bacteria

The tree of life shows the diversity of microbes Single celled organisms represent the vast majority of the biospheres diversity This is surprising to some given our familiarity with the larger metazoan world Microbes are responsible for many biochemical cycles and are crucial to the whole biosphere Woeses efforts to clarify the evolution and diversity of microbes was an invaluable service to ecology conservation and evolutionary biology

Todd was born Avrom Hirsch Goldbogen in Minneapolis Minnesota to Chaim Goldbogen and Sophia Hellerman both Polish Jewish immigrants He was one of nine children in a poor family the youngest son and his siblings nicknamed him Toat to mimic his difficulty saying the word coat It was from this nickname that his name Todd was derived

The family later moved to Chicago arriving on the day World War I ended Todd was expelled in the sixth grade for running a game of craps inside the school In high school he produced the school play The Mikado which was considered a hit He eventually dropped out of high school and worked at a variety of jobs including shoe salesman and store window decorator One of his first jobs was as a soda jerk at a drugstore When that drugstore went out of business Todd had learned enough medical knowledge from his work there to be hired at Chicagos Michael Reese Hospital as a type of security guard to stop visitors from bringing in food that was not on each patients diet

At age 17 Todd married Bertha Freshman in Crown Point Indiana on Valentines Day 1927 He had been serious about Bertha since age 14 but needed to develop confidence before even asking her out In 1929 she bore him a son Michael Todd Jr A turning point came for Todd when his father died in 1931 Avrom Goldbogen made the decision to change his name to Michael Todd on the same day Bertha Todd died of a pneumothorax in 1946 in Santa Monica California while undergoing surgery at St Johns Hospital for a damaged tendon in her finger Todd and his wife were separated at the time of her death less than a week before he had filed for divorce The following year Todd married actress Joan Blondell on July 5 1947 They were divorced on June 8 1950 after she alleged that he had abused and extorted her Todds third marriage was to the actress Elizabeth Taylor with whom he had a tempestuous relationship The couple exchanged vows on February 2 1957 Todd was 47 and Taylor was 24 he was her third husband Todd and Taylor had a daughter Elizabeth Frances Todd who was born on August 7 1957

On 22 March 1958 Todds private plane Lucky Liz crashed near Grants New Mexico The plane a twin engine Lockheed Lodestar suffered an engine failure while being flown overloaded in icing conditions The plane was flying at an altitude which was too high to sustain flight with only one working engine under those conditions The plane went out of control and crashed killing all 4 people on board In addition to Todd those who died in the crash were screenwriter and author Art Cohn who was writing Todds biography The Nine Lives of Mike Todd pilot Bill Verner and co pilot Tom Barclay Taylor wanted to fly to New York with her husband but stayed home with a cold after her pleas to come along were overruled by Todd Just hours before the crash Todd described the plane as safe as he phoned friends including Joseph Mankiewicz and Kirk Douglas in an attempt to recruit a gin rummy player for the flight Ah cmon he said Its a good safe plane I wouldnt let it crash Im taking along a picture of Elizabeth and I wouldnt let anything happen to her

His son Mike Jr wanted his fathers body to be cremated after it was identified through dental records and brought to Albuquerque New Mexico but Taylor refused saying he would not want cremation Todd was buried in Forest Park Illinois at Beth Aaron Cemetery in plot 66 which is part of Jewish Waldheim there In his autobiography Eddie Fisher who considered himself to be Todds best friend stated

The remains were desecrated by robbers who broke into Todds coffin looking for a 100000 diamond ring which according to rumor Taylor had placed on her husbands finger prior to his burial The bag containing Todds remains was found under a tree near his burial plot the bag and coffin had been sealed in Albuquerque after Todds remains were identified following the 1958 crash Todds remains were once more identified through dental records and were reburied in a secret location

Todd began his career in the construction business where he made a fortune but later lost it He opened the so called College of Bricklaying of America buying the materials to teach bricklaying on credit The school was forced to shut its doors when the Bricklayers Union did not view the college as an accepted place of study Todd and his brother Frank next opened their own construction company Their company was worth over a million dollars but came to an abrupt halt when its financial backing failed in the wake of the Great Depression Not yet twenty one Todd had lost over a million dollars with the loss of his backer He was now the father of an infant son and had no home for his family 

He later served as a contractor to Hollywood studios and during the 1933 1934 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago he produced an attraction called the Flame Dance In this number gas jets were designed to burn part of a dancers costume off leaving her naked in appearance The act attracted enough attention to bring an offer from the Casino de Paris club in New York City Todd got his first taste of Broadway life with that engagement and was determined to find a way to work there He came up with the idea of producing the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta The Mikado with an all African American cast The Hot Mikado starring Bill Bojangles Robinson opened on Broadway March 23 1939 His Broadway success gave him the nerve to try taking on showman Billy Rose Todd visited Grover Whalen president of the 1939 New York Worlds Fair with a proposal to bring the Broadway show to the Worlds Fair Whelan eager to have the show at the fair covered Todds Broadway early closing costs Rose who had an exclusivity clause in his fair contract met Todd at Lindys where Rose learned his contract covered new forms of entertainment only Todds Mikado dated back to 1885 To avoid any head to head competition Rose quickly agreed to promote Todds production along with his own Todd went on to produce 30 Broadway shows during his career

Todds business career was volatile and failed ventures left him bankrupt many times

In 1945 Todd suggested the idea of holding the Major League Baseball All Star Game in newly liberated Berlin Although baseballs new commissioner Happy Chandler was reportedly intrigued by the idea it was ultimately dismissed as impractical The game was finally cancelled due to wartime travel restrictions
