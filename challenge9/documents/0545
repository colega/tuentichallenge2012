Baking powder is a dry chemical leavening agent used to make baked foods lighter and less dense Baking powder works by making a reaction between an acid and a base which produces carbon dioxide bubbles to make the mixture light It is used when the food should not taste of yeast or when the mixture is not elastic enough to hold bubbles for very long Because carbon dioxide is made faster by baking powder than yeast breads made with it are called quick breads

Most baking powders are made up of an alkaline one or two acid salts and a starch Baking soda is where the carbon dioxide comes from and the acid releases it like this

In professional wrestling a battle royal is a match type in which many wrestlers fight against each other at the same time and wrestlers are eliminated until only one is left That person is then the winner Usually a battle royal begin with 20 wrestlers in the ring who are then eliminated by pushed out of the ring over the top rope and having both feet touch the floor out side the ring A popular example of the battle royal is the Royal Rumble match that is put on yearly in January by World Wrestling Entertainment

The Haber process or the Haber Bosch process is a chemical reaction that uses nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas to create the chemical compound ammonia The Haber process uses temperatures ranging from 400C to 450C under a pressure of 200 atm The Haber process uses a catalyst mostly made up of iron

The Haber process is named after the German scientist Fritz Haber Haber was the first person to successfully complete the process In 1909 Habers process could produce about one cup of ammonia every two hours Carl Bosch helped to develop the Haber process for industry In 1913 the German company BASF started using the Haber process to make ammonia During World War I the Haber process was used to make explosives The Germans kept this a secret until after the war In 1918 Haber won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and in 1931 Bosch also shared a Nobel Prize

The Haber process is still important today because it produces ammonia which is needed for fertilizer Ammonia also can make cleaning supplies which can be used on glass The Haber process produces about 500 million tons of fertilizer every year This fertilizer helps to feed about 40 of the worlds population

The gasses for the Haber process must be prepared before changing them into ammonia After that is done ammonia is created by using magnetite as the catalyst

In this process only about 15 of the nitrogen and hydrogen is changed into ammonia However the unused nitrogen and hydrogen is recycled Overall 98 of nitrogen and hydrogen can be changed into ammonia

A 69 earthquake occurred on March 11 2010 40 kilometers southwest of Pichilemu OHiggins Region Chile A tsunami warning was made by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center Pacific wide although they warned of the possibility of local tsunamis within 100 kilometers of the epicenter

Although news media first reported the earthquake as an aftershock of the February earthquake the initial geological summary given by the United States Geological Survey said it was an independent earthquake Though unchained by the regional stress caused by the February 27 earthquake the March event was not an immediate adjustment to Februarys thrust fault rupture between the Nazca and South American plates but it was caused by normal faulting inside one of those plates However it has not been confidently decided in which plate the earthquake occurred

Within 6 hours 10 aftershocks took place of these 2 were of magnitude 6 or greater and 7 between magnitude 5 and 6

The earthquake took place shortly before the new president Sebastin Piera was sworn in at about 1215 PM local time at the Chilean congress in Valparaso where the shaking was clearly felt The presidents of Bolivia Paraguay and Ecuador were present when the earthquake occurred however the television footage showed that the inauguration was not interrupted

Damages reported by the Chilean news media include a collapsed pedestrian crossing over Chile Highway 5 north of Rancagua The most affected place by the earthquake was Pichilemu the epicentre of the earthquake It destroyed the Ross Park the most of the Agustn Ross Cultural Centre and many houses in Espinillo and Rodeillo

 The May 2 2010 Pichilemu earthquake was a magnitude 60 MW earthquake that struck off Pichilemu Chile at 1052 AM on May 2 2010 at the epicenter at a depth of convert31kmmi0 USGS described that the epicenter was convert70kmmi0 south southwest of San Antonio convert105kmmi0 west Regional capital of Rancagua convert105kmmi0 northwest of Curic and convert140kmmi0 southwest of the Chilean capital of Santiago 

After almost exactly three hours later a second quake occurs in the same area with an intensity of 48 MW 

More than 10 aftershocks were produced in May 2 and 3

Hurricane Vince was an unusual hurricane that began in the northeast Atlantic Ocean It was part of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season The waters where it formed were thought to be too cold for tropical cyclones to exist Vince was the 20th named storm and 12th hurricane of the season

The storm that became Vince started out as an extratropical cyclone It became a subtropical storm on October 8 to the southeast of the Azores The National Hurricane Center did not officially give the storm a name until the next day Vince grew into a hurricane before beginning to weaken at sea On October 11 it made landfall on the Iberian Peninsula in Spain At that time it was a tropical depression It may have been the first storm to hit the area since a hurricane in 1842 Vince died out over Spain However it dropped rain in the country What was left of the storm passed into the Mediterranean Sea

On October 5 a storm now known as the 2005 Azores subtropical storm was absorbed by another low pressure area It then began to develop and become more organized It became a subtropical cyclone early on October 8 The storm was 580 miles southeast of Lajes in the Azores The National Hurricane Center did not name the system Vince at the time because the waters here were thought to be too cold for tropical or subtropical cyclones to exist The storm slowly became more tropical with a warm center It became a tropical storm the next day in water cooler than 24 C colder than the 265 C usually needed for tropical storms

After becoming a tropical storm it had an eye a clear opening at the center of the storm The NHC named it Tropical Storm Vince but at the time it was not known whether Vince was tropical or subtropical A later analysis of the storm found that Vince became tropical before it was given a name The storms eye became more settled and had a diameter of 15 mi The storm also became stronger it reached its highest force on October 9 At the time it had wind speeds of 75 mph a very weak Category 1 hurricane on the SaffirSimpson Hurricane Scale One NHC weather forecaster said that if it looks like a hurricane it probably is despite its environment and unusual location

Hurricane Vince quickly began to weaken because wind shear began to erode it Vince weakened to a tropical storm A type of weather system called a trough moved towards Vince from the northwest It pulled thunderstorms related to Vince away from the storm and its center quickly moved to the east On October 10 two short bursts of thunderstorms surprised forecasters However because the water was so cold the storm kept weakening Vince became weaker as it came closer to the Iberian Peninsula It became a tropical depression on October 11 This was just before it made its landfall in Huelva Spain The fast moving tropical depression quickly died out over land What was left of the cyclone moved across southern Spain It moved into the Mediterranean Sea south of Alicante early on October 12

The Spanish Center for Emergency Coordination declared a rain pre emergency for the province of Castelln They were afraid that Hurricane Vince would bring rains which would flood the area The Instituto Nacional de Meteorologa issued a bulletin It warned of a 40 chance of flooding Four autonomous regions issued flood warnings Canarias issued a wind warning Fishing fleets from Spain off the Andalusian coast went back to port They were hit by the storm while anchored The storm did not hit them in the open ocean

Spain had been fighting a record drought that year They welcomed the rains brought by Vinces remnants In two days the storm brought a lot of rain to the province of A Corua This eased the sinking water levels in the reservoirs But this also caused bad traffic and small floods In Cordoba province the A 303 A 306 and OC 293 roads were slightly flooded The entrance of the University of A Corua was blocked for some time It was blocked by flood waters on October 11 A nearby roundabout was submerged There were limited damages No one died in the storm The highest winds reported on land were 48 mph These winds were reported at Jerez Spain Some ships reported stronger winds The rainfall as a result of the hurricane was like normal rains from temperate systems Only one to two inches of rain fell Using the words of a song in the film My Fair Lady National Hurricane Center forecaster James Franklin in the Tropical Cyclone Report for Vince wrote the rain in Spain was mainly less than 2 inches although 330 inches fell in the plain at Cordoba

Hurricane Vince began in an odd place where tropical cyclones are not usually found However it does not hold any important records Tropical Storm Alberto of the 1988 season formed farther north than any other storm at 415 N Also Hurricane Ginger of the 1967 season formed at 181 W the farthest east of any tropical cyclones Hurricane Vince became a hurricane further east than any known storm at 189 W A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when wind speeds grow higher than convert74mphkmhabbron

The National Hurricane Center said that Vince was the first tropical cyclone known to hit the Iberian Peninsula However some documents claim that the 1842 Spain hurricane struck the Iberian Peninsula on October 29 1842 That hurricane may have been stronger More recently Tropical Storm Grace formed farther north than Vince

When Subtropical Storm Vince began on October 8 it was earliest in a season that the twenty first tropical or subtropical storm formed It was 38 days ahead of the record before that which was set by Tropical Storm 21 of the 1933 season Because Vince did not cause bad damage the World Meteorological Organization did not retire the name Vince It will be on the list of names for the 2011 season

In chemistry Polytetrafluoroethylene is a polymer of tetrafluoroethylene It is a fluoropolymer because the polymerization is based on strong bonds of fluorine and carbon Polytetrafluoroethylene is not very reactive It also repels oil and water It is better known by its trade names Teflon and Gore Tex Teflon is a coating done to frying pans among others Gore Tex is a membrane used in clothing 

To produce Polytetrafluoroethylene Perfluorooctanoic acid is needed Perfluorooctanoic acid is problematic because it is very toxic does not degrade well and may cause cancer The precursors for many chemical weapons are highly corrosive their containers are therefore often treated with Polytetrafluoroethylene For this reason the export of Polytetrafluoroethylene from the European Union may need a special permit 

Teflon is a trade name which is used for the following polymers

Mannerism is a style of art that was created in the Late Renaissance period from about 1520 until about 1600 The Mannerist style of painting or sculpture often shows figures that are elongated and distorted The aim of the Mannerist artist was usually to make art that looked elegant

The Mannerist style began in Italy where the artists were influenced by the figures that Michelangelo painted on the ceiling and in the Last Judgement in the Sistine Chapel During the Renaissance artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael had tried very hard to learn from nature and to paint things in a way that was very realistic These two famous painters both died around 1520 Many artists then decided that they were going to use the art of painting to express themselves They were not going to follow the rules of anatomy and perspective in the way that Leonardo and Raphael did Mannerist paintings are often full of figures that seem to be twisting writhing or fighting The faces of the figures often show strong emotions such as sadness fear hatred or sexual feelings 

Not all the painters who were working during the Mannerist period painted in the Mannerist style Many artists continued to work in the style of the High Renaissance Painters in the Mannerist style were Tintoretto Jacopo Pontormo Agnolo Bronzino Parmigianino and Rosso Fiorentino Giambologna and Benvenuti Cellini were Mannerist sculptors Giulio Romano was a Mannerist architect 

Mannerism spread from Italy to France Germany and Spain One of the most famous Mannerist painters was El Greco who worked in Spain Some other artists who worked in the Mannerist style are the French sculptor Jean Goujon the Dutch painter Abraham Bloemaert and the German painter Bartolomeus Spranger Possibly the strangest paintings from this time were by Giuseppe Arcimboldo who did pictures in which peoples faces seem to be made from fruit flowers fire and even fish

The FischerTropsch process is a set of chemical reactions that turn a mixture of carbon monoxide gas and hydrogen gas into liquid hydrocarbons The F T process has received attention for many different reasons like a way to make diesel low in sulfur

The FischerTropsch process involves a lot of reactions which lead to both wanted and unwanted results The good reactions create chemicals called alkanes Sometimes the gas methane is made but usually people do not want this gas Sometimes different kinds of alcohol are produced in small amounts

To make the gases needed for the F T process it takes many steps For example all chemicals going into the reactor must have all sulfur removed For factories that start out with methane and want to make a liquid hydrocarbon another important reaction is steam reforming which turns the methane into CO and H2 This is the chemical equation for how steam reforming works 

It says 2 molecules of H2O plus 1 molecule of CH4 turns into 1 molecule of CO and 3 molecules of H2

A catalyst is a chemical you add to a process to make it go faster or speed it up Many different catalysts can be used for the FischerTropsch process The most common catalysts are the metals cobalt iron and ruthenium These metals are all transition metals The metal nickel can also be used but this is usually bad If someone uses nickel the reaction usually makes a lot of methane Usually people do not want a lot of methane to be made

Cobalt seems to be the most active catalyst Cobalt catalysts are very good for the Fischer Tropsch process when what you are putting in is natural gas Iron catalysts are better for when the stuff you put in is lower quality such as coal or biomass 

Most metals used for this process stay metal when you add them to the process Iron catalysts are very different Many times iron catalysts change very much and form many chemical phases like various oxides and carbides during the reaction It is important to control all of these reactions of the iron during the process or else the process might not work

Fischer Tropsch catalysts are famous for being very very sensitive to adding a little bit of sulfur A tiny amount of sulfur can mess up the reactions Cobalt is more sensitive to sulfur than iron

High Temperature Fischer Tropsch is operated at temperatures of 330C 350C HTFT uses an iron based catalyst Sasol used HTFT in Coal to Liquid plants Low Temperature Fischer Tropsch is operated at lower temperatures and uses a cobalt based catalyst Shell used LTFT in an integrated Gas to Liquid plant in Bintulu Malaysia

Gasification is turning things into gas Some F T factories that use coal biomass or something else solid to start Before these factories can start the process they must turn the solids into gases like CO H2 and alkanes This process is called gasification The gas collected from coal gasification often has a COH2 ratio of 07 instead of the best ratio of 2 People can adjust this ratio from 07 to 20 using the water gas shift reactionGasification is a dirty and expensive process Coal based FischerTropsch factories are factories that start out with coal use gasification on it then use the gas for the Fischer Tropsch process These factories can produce lots and lots of CO2 A big reason for this is because it takes very much energy to do the gasification process on the coal

The original process was invented by Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch They were working at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in the 1920s when they invented it Since then many changes have been made to make it better The term Fischer Tropsch now is used for many processes that are like the original one Fischer and Tropsch wrote lots of patents like US patent no 1746464 applied 1926 published 1930 It was given to the factories in Germany in 1936 Germany had lots of coal but very little petroleum The F T process lets people change coal into gasoline which is important to run cars and airplanes Because of this the F T process was used by Nazi Germany and Japan during World War II to produce substitute fuels for tanks and cars F T production of fuel was about 9 of German war production of fuels and 25 of the automobile fuel

The United States Bureau of Mines ran a program started by the Synthetic Liquid Fuels Act The Bureau hired seven fuel scientists from Operation Paperclip in a Fischer Tropsch plant in Louisiana Missouri in 1946 Operation Paperclip was a plan to get German scientists to work for the US during World War II

The F T process has been used on by big companies but it is sometimes un popular for many reasons One is that it takes lots of money to buy equipment to get F T factories to work It also take lots of money to keep it running and to fix problems with it Also the cost of petroleum is very hard to predict Usually the factories only make money when they have access to stranded gas Stranded gas is what they call sources of natural gas very far from major cities that takes too much money or resources to pump natural gas to the city If they could just pump it to the city and sell the natural gas they could make much more money the direct sale of natural gas to consumers would become much more profitable Several companies are developing the process to enable practical exploitation of so called stranded gas reserves

The biggest F T factories with the biggest use of F T technology are owned and operated by the company Sasol in South Africa South Africa is a country with lots of coal but not enough oil just like Germany Sasol takes coal and natural gas and uses them for the F T Process They produce many different substitutes for oil products and produce most of the countrys diesel fuel

One of the largest uses of F T technology is in Bintulu Malaysia This Shell factory turns natural gas into low sulfur diesel fuels and food grade wax They make 12000 barrelsday

In October 2006 Finnish paper and pulp manufacturer UPM announced its plans to produce biodiesel by FischerTropsch process It said that it will do this along with the manufacturing processes at its European paper and pulp plants It will use the waste biomass from paper and pulp manufacturing processes as the material to turn into biodiesel

In 2009 chemists working for the US Navy studied Fischer Tropsch for making fuels with hydrogen and electrolyzing seawater This study produced mostly methane gas but the rest were short chain hydrocarbons Further refining of the hydrocarbons produced could lead to making kerosene based jet fuel

The abundance of CO2 makes seawater look like a good different fuel source Scientists at the US Naval Research Laboratory said that although the gas forms only a small proportion of air around 004 per cent ocean water contains about 140 times that concentration

John Brown was an American abolitionist This meant that he wanted to get rid of slavery He believed that it was acceptable to use violence to end slavery

Brown was a white person He strongly believed in Christianity He believed that Christians should treat people the same no matter what color their skin was Many white Christians in America at this time did not agree with this He always tried to make his churches allow African Americans to be members of their churches too

Brown lived mostly in Springfield Massachusetts before moving to the Kansas Territory This would later become the state of Kansas in 1861 Several of his sons were already living there Browns sons wanted his help to fight people from Missouri The people in Missouri wanted slavery to be legal in Kansas On 24 May 1856 Brown and his sons killed five people in Kansas who wanted slavery to be legal They dragged the people out of their homes and killed them with swords This was called the Pottawatomie Massacre Many people in Kansas were shocked and upset about this even including other people who thought slavery was wrong More violent things happened after this Some people started calling the Kansas Territory Bleeding Kansas

In 1859 Brown went to Harpers Ferry Virginia He went there to attack a federal arsenal He was planning on giving the weapons to slaves The slaves would use the weapons to fight against their masters and become free Brown attacked the arsenal in October 1859 His sons and several other men including several black men helped him with the attack His attack did not work He was captured and was executed by hanging on 2 December 1859

People had strong feelings about John Brown Some people thought that he was crazy or evil Other people thought that he was a hero His attack on Harpers Ferry helped lead to the American Civil War The war would start in 1861

She is played by the actress Alexandra Daddario in the movie Percy Jackson the Olympians The Lightning Thief which is based off the first book The Lightning Thief

The writer of the books Rick Riordan was asked in an interview Do you feel those who said the main characters such as Grover and Annabeth are heroes in their own right He answered Annabeth is Percys rational side She can think through things and look at options that sometimes evade Percy in his moments of battle panic This means she can think even when there is a fight going on unlike Percy and can find fixes to problems

Annabeth Chase is the half blood daughter of the Goddess Athena and the mortal man Frederick Chase Being a daughter of Athena who is a virgin she was not physically born but is a literal brain child she was born as a gift to the man her mother loved When she was seven she ran away from home On her journey she met Luke Castellan Thalia Grace and Grover Underwood Together they traveled to Camp Half Blood running from and fighting hordes of monsters When they got to the borders of Camp Half Blood Thalia died fighting monsters so that Luke and Annabeth could safely get into camp She lived at Camp Half Blood for five years prior to Percy Jacksons arrival

It has been shown that Annabeth does not get along with her father and step family According to her her father was not very happy when she first appeared and tends to look at her as a nuisance Her step siblings appear to dislike her and feel afraid of her Her stepmother seems to hate her and feel that she endangers the family by being only half mortal At the end of The Lightning Thief Annabeth returns to her family to see if she can get along with them She is able to stay with them for approximately a year but it is unknown if her feeling towards her family have changed however in The Titans Curse her father and stepmother seem to care for her deeply and her father helps fight off Kronoss army to save Annabeth

Annabeth is a good fighter and has been shown to be able to think on her feet in very hard situations Despite this Annabeth dreams of being an architect and the story has made many references to this In The Lightning Thief she enjoys and quickly becomes addicted to the 3 D holographic SimCity esque game at the Lotus Hotel and Casino and in The Sea of Monsters it was shown that Annabeths greatest dream is to redesign the whole world to make it better make Luke good again and be accepted by her mother and father In The Last Olympian she is granted the status of being the architect of Olympus

Hubris or deadly pride is Annabeths fatal flaw Annabeth thinks that she is able to do anything get her parents back together build great monuments and save Luke as shown in the second book She sometimes even thinks she can rebuild the world into an even better place than the immortals did She also has a deep fear of spiders due to the contest between Athena and Arachne

Annabeth is described as being athletic and having curly blond hair tan skin and steely gray eyes Percy Jackson describes her as cute at first but eventually she becomes seriously beautiful

Annabeth first appears in The Lightning Thief and is twelve years old She was nicknamed Wise Girl by Percy

She first meets Percy Jackson after he was attacked by the Minotaur and makes his way into Half Blood Hill When he first saw her Percy described Annabeth as pretty with blond hair curled like a princesss After Percy heals from the Minotaur attack Annabeth hears that he is to go on a quest and she wants to go along thinking Percy is the one from Chirons prophecy Together she Percy and Grover go searching for Zeuss stolen lightning bolt Throughout the book Annabeth shows her unique intelligence which she inherited from her mother and also her arachnophobia that she shares with all her siblings on her mothers side At the end of the book Annabeth is deeply hurt by Lukes betrayal

Annabeth and Percy are more friendly towards each other than they were in The Lightning Thief Together they journey to the Sea of Monsters to find the Golden Fleece and save Grover from Polyphemus the Cyclops The Golden Fleece is needed to save Camp Half Blood She hears the Sirens song and confirms that her fatal flaw is hubris which means deadly pride On Circes island she gives Percy multivitamins to change him back into a human after being turned into a guinea pig She also learns to accept Tyson Percys young Cyclops half brother after having a bad experience with another Cyclops long ago When they return back to camp she and Percy team up and win the chariot race Her feelings for Percy seem to emerge at the end when she kisses Percy on the cheek after winning the chariot race

Annabeth is kidnapped along with the goddess Artemis and has to be saved by Percy Thalia Grover and the huntresses Zo Nightshade and Bianca di Angelo In a dream Percy has Annabeth is on a mountain and she sees Luke holding up a black roof Annabeth helps him hold it and then Luke slips out from underneath making Annabeth hold it This is later used to trick Artemis into holding the sky as Artemis would not be able to resist helping a maiden Unlike the other books Annabeths role is quite small It is hinted in this book that there will be a romantic future for her and Percy Aphrodite the goddess of love also convinced Percy about his feelings for Annabeth though she also made it even harder for them to fall in love In the end Percy saves both Annabeth and Artemis

By this book Annabeth is fourteen Percy and Annabeth find an entrance into the Labyrinth She realizes that Luke may try to use this entrance to invade Camp

Annabeth leads the quest into the Labyrinth fulfilling one of her ambitions She goes into the Labyrinth with Percy Grover and Tyson to find a way to stop Kronoss evil forces from entering the borders of Camp Half Blood by searching for the Labyrinths inventor Daedalus The prophecy the Oracle gave her appears to have scared her and she refuses to say the last line As they go into the Labyrinth they face many hardships Annabeth faces a Sphinx and finds the riddles not challenging and an insult to her intellect They escape the claws of the Sphinx and continue on to find Hephaestus so he can tell them about where to find Daedalus

As they head towards Hephaestus forge in Mount St Helens they find telekhines there making a weapon for Kronos Percy tells Annabeth to escape while she can She kisses him for luck and they part ways Annabeth believes that he dies when Mount St Helens erupts but this is not the case Percy fell onto the island Ogygia prison of the nymph Calypso a daughter of Atlas When Percy comes back to camp Annabeth is performing a funeral ritual for him When she notices him she hugs him making a scene However when she finds out about Calypso she is very jealous Percy then asks a mortal girl Rachel Elizabeth Dare to help them on their way through the Labyrinth Annabeth becomes very jealous at how close Percy and Rachel are getting The three of them discover Luke who has become Kronoss vessel After a battle Luke is forced back into the Labyrinth leaving two casualties Annabeth refuses to believe that Luke is all bad and gets quite mad at Percy for saying otherwise

After they fulfilled their mission Annabeth and Percy are standing on Half Blood Hill and are matching their goals with the prophecy Annabeth reveals the last line of her prophecy To lose a love to worse than death and is confused not sure about her feelings for Luke or a secret love for Percy

In the final book Annabeth first appears when Percy returns from blowing up Kronoss ship the Princess Andromeda Following his arrival Annabeth helps Percy hear the Great Prophecy Percy bathes in the River Styx and calls Annabeth telling her to meet him in front of the Empire State Building with all the demigods from Camp Half Blood When Annabeth and Percy go to Olympus they meet Hermes to whom Annabeth tries to apologize about Luke turning into Kronos Hermes becomes angry at her and blames her for not saving Luke Hermes leaves and they return to the other campers to defend Manhattan and Mount Olympus In battle Ethan Nakamura attempts to stab Percy in the small of his back his Achilles spot and Annabeth jumps in front of him taking the knife After a few hours of rest Annabeth though still weak from poison goes back into battle Kronos goes to Olympus and Grover Thalia Percy and Annabeth follow him Kronos attacks Percy and Annabeth joins the fight but is knocked out of the fight when Kronos slams her into Athenas throne In the end she saves Percy and Olympus by finally realizing the prophecys true meaning She convinces Percy to give Luke her knife so he can stab himself killing himself and banishing Kronos to Tartarus yet again She is rewarded by the gods who allow her to use her talents as an architect to rebuild Mount Olympus At the end of the book she and Percy share two kisses on Percys birthday August 18 She becomes his girlfriend Annabeth is last seen racing Percy down Half Blood Hill and not looking back

In the film Alexandra Daddario plays Annabeth a warrior at Camp Half Blood with Percy and potential romantic foil In the film trailer Annabeth says to Percy I definitely have strong feelings for you I just havent decided if they are positive or negative yet Another scene shows them leaning in seemingly to kiss It was really a tease which is shown when she surprisingly steals Percys sword from his sheath and at the same time brings her own sword to his throat and saysFirst rule of battle strategy never let your opponent distract you In the film Annabeth is seen with brown straight hair a change from the books description of her She also does not really show much love towards Luke

A key subplot in the series is the relationship between Annabeth Percy and Luke Luke is Annabeths hero and one of her first half blood friends Annabeth likes Percy which she hints at but she still has feelings towards Luke At the end of The Last Olympian Luke shows slight feelings for her sort of like an older brother These feeling are present despite the fact that Luke and Percy are arch enemies and he has attempted to kill Percy many times In The Sea of Monsters it is shown that one of her lifes wishes is to save Luke 

In the beginning of The Lightning Thief Annabeth is shown to dislike Percy when she finds out that Percy is the hero of the prophecy She thinks he is weak and is influenced by the rivalry between her mother Athena and Percys father Poseidon At the very end of The Sea of Monsters Annabeth kisses Percy on the cheek after winning the chariot race In The Titans Curse there are suggestions of some romance between Annabeth and Percy although this is complicated by her lingering feelings towards Luke and the fact that her mother Athena disapproves of her friendship with Percy In The Battle of the Labyrinth Annabeth finally expresses her feelings for Percy by kissing him good luck before vanishing using her Yankees cap When Percy returns she is highly jealous because she knows he has been with the sad but seductive Calypso It is implied that Percy is trying to tell Annabeth about his feelings but Annabeth remains distant due to her lingering feelings towards Luke

In The Last Olympian after the defeat of Kronos and the saving of Lukes soul the romantic relationship between Percy and Annabeth is solidified Annabeth also states Percy looks cute when hes worried when he first checks on her after she took a knife that was meant for him Annabeth tells Luke as he dies that she always saw him as a brother but never loved him Later she and Percy share their third kiss after she tells him that she will never ever make things easy for him He describes it as if his brain felt it was melting through his body But nosy campers snoop on this and throw them into the camp lake Then comes to a fourth kiss underwater in an air bubble made by Percy They are together at the end of the series It is hinted that they might be married one day in the future as Annabeth said she wanted to build something permanent and Percy states that maybe they were getting a good start together

B Allison Gray praises how in Battle of the Labyrinth Percy Jackson and the Olympians Book 4 Riordan successfully conveys Annabeths emotions

The casting for the film has had a different reception On one hand as Ramas SCREEN reports the one thats been causing argument is Alexandra Daddario as Annabeth Chaseapparently some of Ramas SCREEN readers out there did and the comments on her casting were in mixed responseAshley thought Annasophia Robb shouldve played that role meanwhile Kara and Victoria saw Daddario as too old because apparently the character Annabeth Chase in the book is about 12 years old but Lily thought Daddario should be given a chance to prove herself worthy and Joe said that to make this work the movie needs to make her hot athletic with blond hair and grey eyes On the other hand Katey Rich writes that Daddario looks just right for that Hermione esque role of the brainy brunetteDaddario who has been in movies like The Hottest State and the recent Jonas Brothers concert movie may have just signed on for a role that will take over her life and bring her plenty of Emma Watson scaled fame in the process I hope shes got her wizards wand  oh wait I mean mythical god powers  ready for the challenge

As described by the books Percy has green eyes tan skin and black hair In The Lightning Thief Percy is said to not be very athletic but later on he becomes stronger because of his demigod training Percy is described as good looking by Annabeth Chase

Percy is good natured friendly brave and often willing to risk his life to save his friends strangers and even his enemies He is angered by Thalia Grace often because their personalities are the same and they do not get along well together because of that Percy has a sarcastic sense of humor and is funny in his writing 

Percy does not like nicknames or titles being given to him He always tells horses which his father is said to have created not to call him boss or lord whenever they talk to him He is also loyal Percy like most boys his age has trouble talking to girls It is said by Athena that Percys fatal flaw is personal loyalty He will give up anything to save his friends and loved ones Kronos uses this flaw to control him several times in the series such as when his mother is held hostage when Grover is trapped on Polyphemus island and when Annabeth is kidnapped

Thalias tree the magical border of Camp Half Blood has been poisoned Chiron is blamed for the poisoning and is dismissed from camp Tantalus who comes from the Fields of Punishment and cannot have food or water takes the job The only thing able to rid the tree of its poison is the Golden Fleece which is located on the island of Polyphemus in the Sea of Monsters

When they return to the mortal world they send off Clarisse on an airplane to camp alone and Percy Annabeth Grover and Tyson are kidnapped by Luke In a duel with him Percy is nearly killed He is saved by Chiron who is proven innocent and his relatives the Party Ponies When they return to camp the Fleece is put on the tree The Fleece not only revives Thalias tree but Thalia too It turns out that this was actually Kronoss plan done so that he would have another chance to control the prophecy which governs the future of Olympus and the Olympians

At the end Percy and Annabeth win a chariot race and Annabeth kisses Percy on the cheek

In book four the Labyrinth of Daedalus is discovered Camp Half Blood is in danger of being invaded by Kronos army by means of the Labyrinth Chiron sends Annabeth along with Percy Grover and Tyson into the Labyrinth on a quest to find Daedalus In this they hope to use his knowledge to help thwart any attacks that are carried out using the giant underground maze They eventually find Daedalus who has made himself a new body and has disguised himself as the sword play counselor There is a battle as Kronos army attacks Camp Half Blood through the Labyrinth Many are injured and some are left dead Daedalus shows up to help along with his giant pet hellhound Mrs OLeary Daedalus has escaped death for centuries but gives himself over to Nico di Angelo a son of Hades so he can accept his punishment in the Underworld and also so he can see his son Icarus and his nephew Perdix Percy inherits Mrs OLeary they have grown fond of each other Percy and Annabeths relationship starts to take on a new edge to it Annabeth saves Percy several times and kisses him once because she thinks he is going to die She also makes a big scene in front of all the campers when she realized that Percy was alive

The right whales are baleen whales with bow shaped lower jaw and a head that is up to one quarter of the body length The head is hairier than most whales up to 300 hairs are found on the tip of the lower jaw and 100 are on the upper jaw There are also callosities behind the blowhole on the chin above the eyes on the lower lip and on the rostrum 

Right whales are similar to bowhead whales but smaller These whales are rich in blubber and have 2 blowholes The eyes are very small and lips are large Right whales were named by whalers who considered them the right whales to hunt since they were rich in blubber they were easy to catch and they floated after being killed 

Hunters needed the right whales blubber for meat because blubber could be boiled to make oil The right whales name came from hunters who thought that they were the right whales to hunt This was because they had lots of blubber They were also easy to catch and they floated on the surface of the water after being killed Because of these things right whales are the most endangered of the great whales

The poverty line which is also sometimes called the poverty threshold in a country is the smallest amount of money that a family can make and still buy what it needs to buy In the United States the poverty line is different depending on how many people there are in a family so the poverty line will be higher in a family with eight people than in a family with three people  This is because it costs more money to buy food and other supplies in a family with more people

Taquera is a Spanish word meaning taco shop In some places means a restaurant specializing in burritos although tacos and other Mexican dishes are often served as well The first taqueras were people in stalls on the streets but now many taqueras have moved into buildings and become restaurants

The Second Fleet is the name of the second group of ships sent with settlers convicts and supplies to colony at Sydney Cove in Port Jackson Australia There were six ships in the fleet one Royal Navy Escort four convict ships and a supply ship 

The ships were meant to sail to Australia together and get to Sydney Cove in 1789 However the escort ship was wrecked on the way and did not arrive and one convict ship was delayed and arrived two months after the other ships

Unlike the First Fleet where great efforts were taken to keep the convicts healthy the Second Fleet was run by private businesses who kept the convicts in horrific conditions When they got to Sydney the sick convicts were a drain on the already struggling colony 

The Lady Juliana sailed before the other convict ships and is not always counted as part of the Second Fleet The supply ship Justinian did not sail with the convict ships and arrived before them HMS Guardian set out before the convict ships but struck ice after leaving the Cape of Good Hope went back to southern Africa and was wrecked on the coast

The Surprize Neptune and Scarborough were sent by the firm Camden Calvert King They had agreed to transport clothe and feed the convicts for a fee of 17 7s 6d per head This fee was paid whether the convicts landed dead or alive This firm had previously been in the business of taking slaves to North America The only government people on the ship were the naval agent Lieutenant John Shapcote and the Captain of the Guard all other crew were supplied by the firm 

The Second Fleet left England on 19 January 1790 with 1006 convicts They made only one stop on the way at the Cape of Good Hope Here 20 male convicts survivors from Guardian were taken on board The three ships made a faster trip than the First Fleet arriving at Port Jackson in the last week of June 1790 This was three weeks after Lady Juliana and one week after the supply ship Justinian

The trip was fast but the rate of people dying was the highest in the history of transportation to Australia Of the 1026 convicts who left 267 died during the voyage 

On Neptune the convicts were not given enough food they were kept tied up with chains and rarely let up onto the deck Many of them got scurvy On Scarborough they were fed but a reported mutiny attempt led to the convicts being kept locked up below the deck

Captain William Hill Captain of the guard later wrote that the ships captains did not feed the convicts so that they could sell the food in another country They wanted the convicts to die quickly so that they did not have to waste the food on them and could keep it for sale later

When they got to Sydney the half naked convicts were lying without bedding too ill to move Those unable to walk were thrown over the side All were covered with lice At least 486 of the convicts were sick 47 of those who had left England The others were described as lean and emaciated and showing more horrid spectacles than had ever been witnessed in this country

Among the people on the Second Fleet were DArcy Wentworth and his convict mistress Catherine Crowley on Neptune and John Macarthur then a young lieutenant in the New South Wales Corps and his wife Elizabeth on Scarborough Macarthurs eldest son Edward Macarthur who came with his parents on the Neptune and Scarborough is believed to be the only person who sailed in the Second Fleet of whom we have a photograph He was also the last survivor of the voyage

When news of the horrors of the Second Fleet reached England both the public and government were shocked An enquiry was held but no attempt was made to arrest Donald Traill captain of Neptune He had been described as an insane sadist The government did not charge him the other captains or the firm of contractors They had already been contracted by the government to prepare the Third Fleet for sailing to Port Jackson in 1791

Traill and his Chief Mate William Ellerington were privately put in court for the murder of an un named convict seaman Andrew Anderson and John Joseph cook But after a trial lasting three hours before Sir James Marriott in the Admiralty Court the jury set both men free without troubling the Judge to sum up the evidence

Ancient Roman culture grew through the almost 1200 years of Romes broken wikt linkcivilizationcivilization The Romans had broken wikt linkconquerconquered many different peoples and brought back from their wars many things from each land Their way of life was a mix of many cultures influences and religions Architecture painting sculpture laws and literature grew quickly on a high level Children slaves and Christians were treated differently by different rulers However they were often treated badly

There were four classes of people in Rome the aristocrats the equestrians the common citizens and the slaves The aristocrat class had about 300 families mostly senators The aristocrat class was very powerful The equestrians were merchants government builders and bankers who were rich The common citizens were farmers industrial workers and the city broken wikt linkmobmob Slaves had to work hard and were usually released when they became old Some slaves were trained to be gladiators for people to watch Other slaves worked in rich homes as doorkeepers litter bearers messengers or servants Some Greek slaves were teachers Some slaves were killed on the spot for entertainment

Many old religious philosophies were given up by the rich The poor who couldnt give enough to the gods liked the Oriental religion because it said that there was endless life Most Romans still worshiped many gods For example they worshiped Mars the god of War Jupiter the god of the sky Ceres the goddess of grain and Janus the god of the city gate Festivals were held in honor of the gods Each house had an altar where they worshipped their gods

At the time of the birth of Jesus the Roman Empire ruled the entire Mediterranean land Jesus taught to forgive enemies do good to everyone to be pure and to worship God only Because Christians worshipped only God and did not join in the festivals to other gods Romans thought they were broken wikt linkunpatrioticunpatriotic Many Christians were crucified

However Christianity still spread in the Roman Empire In Rome many poor people believed in Christianity However Christians were punished by Rome Roman people used to see elephant and lions fight for fun After that Christians were made to join in the fights However when Constantine became emperor he said that he had seen a vision of the cross and would help the Christians He also said the crucifixion was not allowed anymore Constantine became a Christian a few days before he died in AD 337

In the Imperial Age the poorer Roman houses were built of sun dried brick These houses only had one room In this one room the family slept ate and had visitors In the richer homes statutes and paintings were shown Small rooms were used as living and dining places In the center there was a court with a garden It was decorated with fountains plants and flowers Floors were often made of mosaics tiles or marble with lots of different colors Some walls were painted Dishes were made of pottery or glass There was plumbing in some houses and in the public baths and a sewer system was used Hot air warmed the house from a heating system Many rich Romans had two houses one in the town and one in the country

Poor people lived in buildings where the top floors were for the poorest Sometimes they could have as many as 200 steps to reach them Many fires happened Buckets of water were used to put out fires though many times it did not work

Poor people ate vegetables fish salt cheese fruits nuts and olive oil Meat especially beef was usually not eaten Breakfast was usually not eaten and for lunch leftovers were used Rich people ate dinner before four in the afternoon They usually ate from three to ten hours Hands were washed between the courses One emperor served 22 courses at his dinner parties If visitors were invited to dinner slaves were sent to bring them on time because water clocks did not always work the same People enjoyed eating grapes for dessert At first cold clams and oysters used to be eaten for dessert but later people ate them at the beginning of a meal instead

The public baths were used not only for bathing Besides the hot water rooms and cold water rooms there were gardens stadiums art galleries libraries and places to eat There were even underground passageways to get to places more easily broken wikt linkaqueductAqueducts fed water for the baths They were so well built that some are still used The Romans were very proud of their aqueducts They thought it was better than the useless Egyptian pyramids

Big ships called quinqueremes had 300 people to row with oars It could travel 100 miles a day Trade paths were protected for some things the ships carried were pearls pepper cotton cinnamon and silk A pound of silk at that time cost a pound of gold

The Romans learned both the Greek and Latin languages They also were taught speech making philosphy and a little science Some rich boys were sent to Athens to learn and a few slaves were educated In 168 BC Polybius a prisoner was brought to Rome He wrote a history of how Carthage was destroyed in 40 volumes The Latin language in which the Romans wrote was used for a thousand years Out of Latin came Portuguese Spanish French and Italian Latin was used for medicine and science words

Roman literature was much influenced by Greek literature Some of the best known examples are the Aeneid by Virgil Plutarchs Lives of Famous Men and Odes by Horace

The Romans built great roads and bridges They wrote plays and kept the Phoenician alphabet The Romans were usually practical and kept the Grecian culture alive Many of the aqueducts they made are still there and used Rome also made the first hospitals in the Western World They also had the first system of state medicine for poor people

The Romans music was an important part of their lives They were influenced by Greek music However they were not religious like Greek music They only had one melody What the Romans sang simply followed the natural melody of the song

Lagersttte is a German word for places of exceptional fossil preservation Adolf Seilacher coined the term in 1970 to describe sites like Solnhofen which yielded the most exceptional fossils

Extra special sites are called Konservat Lagersttten These are deposits known for the exceptional preservation of fine details There skeletons are mostly articulated and the soft parts are preserved as impressions or casts This is caused by anoxic conditions which suppressed common bacterial decomposition long enough for the initial casts of soft body parts to register

In Lagersttten the normal processses of decay after death were less active or halted as sediment was deposited This allowed the preservation of soft parts and exceptional detail Conditions were varied and involved some of these

In these conditions which are exceptional scavengers burrowers and bacteria are eliminated or reduced Then the normal processes of deposition and fossilisation produces strata containing exceptional fossils

Most of what we know about the details of extinct life comes from these exceptional sites The soft bodied Ediacaran biota the fins of ichthyosaurs the fur and wing structure of pterosaurs the feathers on Mesozoic dinosaurs and birds are all discoveries made on fossils from Lagersttten Also these sites do preserve much of the fauna and flora of the time and place That permits reconstruction of its ecology

 Short list of Lagersttten  There are about 50 sites which have been described as Lagersttten

The Post Impressionists were several artists of the late 19th century who saw the work of the French Impressionist painters and were influenced by them Their art styles grew out of the style called Impressionism The word Post means after so Post Impressionist painting came after Impressionist painting 

The main Post Impressionist painters were Paul Cezanne Paul Gauguin Vincent van Gogh Henri Toulouse Lautrec and Georges Seurat The Post Impressionist painters lived in France and knew each other but they did not work together as a group in the way that some of the Impressionists did They all painted in ways that were quite different to each other The Post Impressionists led the way for other artists to experiment and develop all the different styles of Modern Art in the 20th century 

The term Post Impressionists was first used in 1910 by an English art critic Roger Fry who organized an exhibition in London called Manet and the Post Impressionists The exhibition had works by Edouard Manet who by that time was a well known Impressionist painter as well as pictures by artists who were not well known Cezanne Gauguin Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque Picasso and Braque are not now remembered as Post Impressionists they are thought of as Cubists

Artists 

Influence The Post Impressionist painters all experimented in different ways with the ideas of the Impressionists Most of the important art movements of the twentieth century developed out of their work Even though the Post Impressionist painters were not well known in their lifetimes they became so famous that in the 21st century their paintings sell for millions of dollars

In his prime Lasker was one of the most dominant champions and he is generally regarded as one of the strongest players ever He finally lost the title to Capablanca in 1921

Lasker demanded high fees for playing matches and tournaments which aroused some criticism He had seen how Steinitzs life had ended in poverty and was determined to avoid this fate 

The conditions which Lasker demanded for World Championship matches in the last ten years of his reign were controversial and prompted attempts to define rules for championship matches

Lasker was also a talented mathematician and his PhD thesis is regarded as one of the foundations of modern algebra He was a first class contract bridge player and wrote about this and other games including Go and his own invention Lasca

Emanuel Lasker was the son of a Jewish cantor At the age of eleven he was sent to Berlin to study mathematics where he lived with his brother Berthold eight years his senior who taught him how to play chess To supplement their income Emanuel Lasker played chess and card games for small stakes especially at the Caf Kaiserhof

In 1890 he finished third in Graz then shared first prize with his brother Berthold in a tournament in Berlin In spring 1892 he won two tournaments in London the second and stronger of these without losing a game At New York 1893 he won all thirteen games one of the few times in chess history that a player has achieved a perfect score in a significant tournamentp81 

His record in matches was equally impressive at Berlin in 1890 he drew a short play off match against his brother Berthold and won all his other matches from 1889 to 1893 mostly against top class opponents Curt von Bardeleben 1889 Jacques Mieses 1889 Henry Edward Bird 1890 Berthold Englisch 1890 Joseph Henry Blackburne 1892 without losing a game Jackson Showalter 18921893 and Celso Golmayo Zpide 1893 

In 1892 Lasker founded the first of his chess magazines The London Chess Fortnightly which was published from August 15 1892 to July 30 1893 In the second quarter of 1893 there was a gap of ten weeks between issues allegedly because of problems with the printer Shortly after its last issue Lasker traveled to the USA where he spent the next two years

Lasker challenged Siegbert Tarrasch who had won three consecutive international tournaments to a match Tarrasch haughtily declined stating that Lasker should first prove his mettle by attempting to win one or two major international eventsp31

Rebuffed by Tarrasch Lasker challenged the reigning World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz to a match for the titlep31 Initially Lasker wanted to play for US 5000 a side but the final figure was 2000 The final combined stake of 4000 would be worth over 495000 at 2006 values 

The match was played in 1894 at venues in New York Philadelphia and Montreal Steinitz had previously declared he would win without doubt so it came as a shock when Lasker won the first game Steinitz responded by winning the second and was able to maintain the balance through the sixth However Lasker won all the games from the seventh to the eleventh and Steinitz asked for a weeks rest When the match resumed Steinitz looked in better shape and won the 13th and 14th games Lasker struck back in the 15th and 16th and Steinitz was unable to compensate for his losses in the middle of the match Hence Lasker won convincingly with ten wins five losses and four draws Lasker thus became the second recognized World Chess Champion and confirmed his title by beating Steinitz even more convincingly in their re match in 18961897

Lasker won first prizes at very strong tournaments in St Petersburg 18951896 Nuremberg 1896 London 1899 Paris 1900 As time passed there arose two great players Akiba Rubinstein and Capablanca Both deserved a match for the world championship but as it turned out the chance came to another fine player Carl Schlechter

Lasker arranged the World Chess Championship match against Schlechter in JanuaryFebruary 1910 Schlechter was a modest man who was generally unlikely to win the major chess tournaments by his peaceful inclination his lack of aggressiveness and his willingness to accept most draw offers from his opponentsp404 

The conditions of the match are still debateable because they were never publishedp357 Some claim that Schlechter accepted especially unfavourable conditions Giffard says he would need to finish two points ahead of Lasker to be declared the winner of the match and he would need to win a revenge match to be declared World Championp404 This opinion is not proven

The match was originally meant to consist of 30 games but when it became obvious that there were insufficient funds the number of games was reduced to ten

In the fifth game Lasker had a big advantage but made a mistake which cost him the game Schlechter was now a point ahead The score before the last game was 54 for Schlechter In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win and took a clear advantage but he missed a win on his 35th move and finished by losingp406 Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion

At St Petersburg 1914 he overcame a 1 point deficit to finish ahead of the rising stars Capablanca and Alexander Alekhine

In January 1920 Lasker and Jos Ral Capablanca signed an agreement to play a World Championship match in 1921 noting that Capablanca was not free to play in 1920 

The match was played in MarchApril 1921 After four draws the fifth game saw Lasker blunder with Black in an equal ending Capablancas solid style allowed him to easily draw the next four games without taking any risks In the tenth game Lasker as White failed to create the necessary activity and Capablanca reached a superior ending which he duly won The eleventh and fourteenth games were also won by Capablanca and Lasker resigned the match

Some commentators attributed the result to Laskers being in mysteriously poor form On the other hand Vladimir Kramnik thought that Lasker played quite well and the match was an even and fascinating fight until Lasker blundered in the last game and explained that Capablanca was twenty years younger a slightly stronger player and had more recent competitive practice

After winning the New York 1924 chess tournament and finishing second at Moscow in 1925 he effectively retired from serious chess

In 1926 Lasker wrote Lehrbuch des Schachspiels which he re wrote in English in 1927 as Laskers Manual of Chess He also wrote books on other games of mental skill Encyclopedia of games and Das verstndige Kartenspiel both of which posed a problem in the mathematical analysis of card games Brettspiele der Vlker which includes 30 pages about Go and a section about a game he had invented in 1911 Lasca and Das Bridgespiel Lasker became an expert bridge player representing Germany at international events in the early 1930s and a registered teacher of the Culbertson system 

In October 1928 Emanuel Laskers brother Berthold diedp266

In spring 1933 Adolf Hitler started a campaign of discrimination and intimidation against Jews depriving them of their property and citizenship Lasker and his wife Martha who were both Jewish were forced to leave Germany in the same yearp268 p218 After a stay in England in 1935 they were invited to live in the USSR by Nikolai Krylenko the Commissar of Justice who was responsible for the Moscow show trials and in his other capacity as Sports Minister was an enthusiastic supporter of chess In the USSR Lasker renounced his German citizenship and received Soviet citizenship He took up residence in Moscow and was given a post at Moscows Institute for Mathematics and a post of trainer of the USSR national team Lasker returned to competitive chess to make some money finishing fifth in Zrich 1934 third in Moscow 1935 behind Mikhail Botvinnik and Salo Flohr and ahead of Capablanca and other masters sixth in Moscow 1936 and seventh equal in Nottingham 1936 His performance in Moscow 1935 at age 66 was hailed as a biological miracle

Stalins Great Purge started at about the same time the Laskers arrived in the USSR In August 1937 Martha and Emanuel Lasker decided to leave the Soviet Union and they moved via the Netherlands to the United States in October 1937

In the following year Emanuel Laskers patron Krylenko was purged by Stalin Lasker tried to support himself by giving chess and bridge lectures and exhibitions as he was now too old for serious competition In 1940 he published his last book The community of the future in which he proposed solutions for serious political problems including anti Semitism and unemployment Lasker died of a kidney infection in New York on 11 January 1941 at the age of 72

A computer algebra system is a computer program that helps people with mathematics and algebra It manipulates mathematical equations and expressions containing numbers and symbols called variables which stand for known or unknown values that can be solved for or replaced with any value A CAS might be used for symbolic integration or differentiation simplification of an expression optimizing and finding minimums and maximums etc

Computer algebra systems can be special purpose focusing on only a few types of symbolic math to very large general purpose programs that do almost everything The results output by a good computer algebra system are often exact simple and generalized to work in all possible cases Computer programs do have bugs so important results should always be verified for correctness

Modern computer algebra systems often include extensive numeric capabilities for convenience and which fit together with its symbolic abilities Numeric domains supported typically include real complex interval rational and algebraic numbers Usually floating point arithmetic is available to use if desired because the arithmetic is done by most computer hardware very quickly

Epistaxis is when blood comes out of the nose It is more commonly known as a nosebleed More people have nosebleeds in dry areas or in the winter Even though nosebleeds can seem scary they are usually not serious or life threatening Most nosebleeds happen in the front of the nose and these are called anterior nosebleeds Sometimes people get nosebleeds in the back of their noses called posterior nosebleeds These are more serious and somebody who has one may have to go to the hospital

Many people tilt their heads back during a nosebleed but this is actually not safe because it can make blood go down their throats and make them choke or get sick Instead the best way to deal with a nosebleed is to tilt ones head forward and pinch the bottom of their nose between ones nostrils with a wet piece of tissue paper

There are two species of Corroboree Frog the Southern Corroboree Frog Pseudophryne corroboree and the Northern Corroboree Frog Pseudophryne pengilleyi The Southern Corroboree Frog is a very small frog with warning colouration It has black and yellow stripes sometimes with a greenish tinge It is one of the brightest frogs in the world 

It only lives in an area of about convert10km2mi20lkonabbron in the Kosciusko National Park in south east Australia Scientists believe that the total population of Corroboree Frogs is less than 250 Numbers of the frog have dropped by 80 in the last ten years and so the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources have listed the Southern Corroboree Frog as being a critically endangered species 

The Southern Corroboree Frog only lives in a small area in the Kosciusko National Park It mainly lives in Snow Gum forest and Sphagnum swamps These places are very cold because the Corroboree Frog only lives in areas higher than convert1000mft0lkonabbron above sea level They breed in small ponds and wetlands during the summer months

The Southern Corroboree Frog has a very distinctive pattern of black with bright yellow stripes They are very small only around convert25mmin0lkonabbron long when fully grown The female frog is usually larger than the male and can be as big as convert30mmin0lkoffabbronThey mainly eat bugs like ants beetles and mites They are quite different from most other frogs because they have a very different breeding cycle Most frogs breed in spring but these frogs only breed in summer in January and February when they use the wet areas to dig small holes for their mating and nesting They only lay between 16 40 eggs The eggs hatch 4 6 months later when water levels rise and flood the nests The frogs live as tadpoles for another 6 8 months They change into frogs at the start of summer in December They become sexually active after another two years The frogs are not known to survive a second breeding season

Corroboree frogs are the first vertebrates discovered that are able to produce their own poisonous alkaloids as opposed to obtaining it via diet as many other frogs do The alkaloid is secreted from the skin as a defence against predation and potentially against skin infections by microbes The unique alkaloid produced has is called pseudo phrynamine

The Southern Corroboree Frog is Australias most endangered frog Scientists have not discovered a reason for the drop in frog numbers There are a range of problems that affect the area that they live in Increased access by people with four wheel drive vehicles and the development of ski resorts are destroying their habitat Global warming is also a big problem for them because they are used to the cold Global warming may shorten the frogs breeding time during winter and also destroy their snowy habitat Holes in the ozone layer may also be a problem because when there are holes in the ozone it means that more sun rays hit the ground and so there is less snow Disease from funguses can kill lots of the frogs Erosion and pollution of waterways in which they breed can kill the frogs eggs They are also affected by wild pigs which destroy the wetlands

The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service are now breeding the frogs in laboratories and then releasing them into the wild when they are fully grown After the bushfires in the summer of 2002 and 2003 all the eggs in the wild were collected and taken to the Melbourne Zoo for hatching

The State Library of Victoria is the main library of the state of Victoria Australia The library is in the capital city of Victoria Melbourne It is on Swanston Street in the northern centre of the central business district The library holds over 15 million books and 16000 serials Special books in the library include the diaries of the citys founders John Batman and John Pascoe Fawkner and Captain James Cook

In 1853 the decision to build a state library was the idea of the Lieutenant Governor Charles La Trobe and Sir Redmond Barry A competition was held to choose a person to design the new building local architect Joseph Reed who later designed the Melbourne Town Hall and the Royal Exhibition Building won the competition

On 3 July 1854 the new Governor Sir Charles Hotham laid the foundation stone of both the new library and the University of Melbourne The library opened in 1856 with a collection of 3800 books chosen by Sir Redmond the President of Trustees Augustus H Tulk the first librarian was started work three months after the opening

The first reading room was the Queens Reading Room now called Queens Hall which opened in 1859 Temporary buildings built in 1866 for the Intercolonial Exhibition were used until 1909 when work began on a new building to mark the librarys Jubilee This new building was the famous Domed Reading Room which opened in 1913 designed by Norman G Peebles 

Plans for the rebuilding were cut back as there was not enough money for the original design A new building for the museum was built after World War 1 in a plain classical style

The reading domes original high windows were changed and covered in copper sheets in 1959 because water was getting into the building 

The library was also home to the States Art Gallery and Museum until the National Gallery of Victoria moved to St Kilda Road in the late 1960s The new Melbourne Museum was built in the Carlton Gardens in the 1990s

The library underwent a lot of rebuilding between 1990 and 2004 designed by architects Ancher Mortlock Woolley The project cost about AU200 million The reading room closed in 1999 to allow for renovation during which domes windows were put back The renamed La Trobe Reading Room reopened in 2003

The rebuilt library includes a number of exhibition spaces which are used for the permanent exhibitions The Mirror of the World Books and Ideas and The Changing Face of Victoria there is also a display from the Pictures Collection in the Cowen Gallery The State Library of Victoria is one of the largest exhibiting libraries in the world

The grassy lawn in front of the librarys grand entrance on Swanston Street is a popular lunch spot for the citys workers and students at the nearby RMIT University When the library was built there was a wooden picket fence around the building In the 1870s a new wrought iron fence and gates were built The space was opened when this fence was taken away in 1939 

A number of statues are in the entrance area

On Sundays between 230pm and 530pm a speakers forum takes place in front of the library where people take turns in speaking on various subjects

The landmark Domed Reading Room which opened in 1913 and was designed by Norman G Peebles Its octagonal space was designed to hold over a million books and up to 500 readers It is 3475 m in both diameter and height and its oculus is nearly 5 m wide The dome was the largest of its type in the world on completion 

In 1965 the La Trobe Building was opened to hold the Librarys collection of Australian items This has now been moved into the La Trobe Reading Room

The library has a large world class collection of books periodicals recordings and other materials about art music and the performing arts

The library has a chess room that houses a wide range of materials on the history study and practice of chess It contains a collection of items from the Anderson Chess Collection one of the three largest public chess collections in the world In addition to bookshelves containing a large range of books and magazines about chess the room has game tables with chessboards and pieces There are also glass cabinets with historical chess items The room is meant for both reading playing and studying

Baking is a skill or way of cooking food in an oven Sometimes though baking can also be done in hot ashes or hot stones It is used for making bread cakes pastries pies broken wikt linktarttarts cookies and much more Such foods made by baking are called baked goods The ingredients used in baking include flour water leavening agents shortening eggs milk and sugars These are all mixed together to create dough or batter which is then put into a pan or a sheet and heated Leavening agents produce gas that becomes trapped in the dough This makes it rise Shortening makes doughs more easily workable and the bread that comes out in the end more soft and tender Egg whites are used to help make a light airy broken wikt linktexturetexture

Baked goods are sold at a bakery A person who makes baked goods as a job is called a baker It is also used for making baked potatoes baked apples baked beans some broken wikt linkcasserolecasseroles and pasta dishes such as broken wikt linklasagnalasagna and various other foods such as the pretzel

In ancient history the first baking happened when humans took wild grass grains and soaked them in water Then they mixed everything together and also mashed it After that this mixture was poured onto a flat hot rock and roasted on hot broken wikt linkembersembers This new way of making bread was much easier than the other ways of doing so This was because now bread could be made anytime if only there was fire Around 2500 BC it shows that the Egyptians had bread and may have learned how to make it from the Babylonians Also the Greeks around 400 BC wrote information that showed that broken wikt linktortetortes with patterns and honey was included in Greek food Dispyrus another type of baked good was also made by the Greeks around that time It was popular Dispyrus was a donut like bread made from flour and honey and shaped in a ring Soaked in wine it was eaten when hot The first proof of stone ovens was in Italy where they made pizza and pasta

Baking was very popular in the Roman Empire In about 300 BC the pastry cook became a special job for Romans Romans loved pastry which was often cooked for large parties Baking became so popular during the Roman Empire that someone who could think of a new kind of pastry was given an award Around 1 AD there were more than 300 pastry chefs in Rome and it was written

Eventually because of Rome the art of baking became known in Europe It later spread to the eastern parts of Asia too Bakers sometimes bake goods at home and then sell them in the streets In London chefs sold their baked goods from handcarts In Paris the first caf of baked goods was made Baking became a real art in the world Cakes can be actually mixed in just a few minutes with only a small bit of skill needed and it can be lifted fresh from the oven in less than 30 minutes A basic loaf of bread may take slightly longer time but it does not demand a lot of time from the cook

Capablanca was a child prodigy with an astonishing natural talent for the game He grew up into a cultured and charming man whom the Cuban government made its roving ambassador at large He was a media celebrity his travels round the world were reported in newspapers radio and film newsreels In his lifetime he was probably the Cuban best known to the rest of the world

In December 1921 shortly after becoming World Champion Capablanca married Gloria Simoni Betancourt They had a son Jos Ral Jr in 1923 and a daughter Gloria in 1925 According to Capablancas second wife Olga his first marriage broke down fairly soon

Jos Ral Capablanca was the second surviving son of an army officer According to Capablanca he learned the rules of the game at the age of four by watching his father play pointed out an illegal move by his father and then beat his father twice At the age of eight he was taken to Havana Chess Club which had hosted many important contests but on the advice of a doctor he was not allowed to play frequently 

Between November and December 1901 he narrowly beat the Cuban Chess Champion Juan Corzo in a match However in April 1902 he only came fourth out of six in the National Championship losing both his games against Corzo In 1905 Capablanca passed with ease the entrance examinations for Columbia University in New York City He wished to play for Columbias strong baseball team and soon was selected as shortstop on the freshman team In the same year he joined the Manhattan Chess Club and was soon recognized as the clubs strongest player He was particularly dominant in rapid chess winning a tournament ahead of the reigning World Chess Champion Emanuel Lasker in 1906 In 1908 he left the university to concentrate on chess

The San Sebastian tournament of 1911 was one of the strongest five tournaments held up to that time as all the worlds leading players competed except the World Champion Lasker who was inactive in serious play at the time At the beginning of the tournament Ossip Bernstein and Aron Nimzowitsch objected to Capablancas presence because he had not fulfilled the entry condition of winning at least third prize in two master tournaments Capablanca won brilliantly against Bernstein in the very first round and more simply against Nimzowitsch He astounded the chess world by taking first place with a score of six wins one loss and seven draws ahead of Akiba Rubinstein Milan Vidmar Frank Marshall Carl Schlechter and Siegbert Tarrasch His loss against Rubinstein was one of the most brilliant achievements of the latters career Capablanca was now recognized as a serious contender for the world championshipp33

In 1911 Capablanca challenged Emanuel Lasker for the World Chess Championship Lasker accepted his challenge while proposing seventeen conditions for the match Capablanca objected to some of the conditions which significantly favored Lasker and the match did not take placep67 

In September 1913 Capablanca secured a job in the Cuban Foreign Office which made him financially secure throughout his life He had no specific duties but was expected to act as a kind of ambassador at large a well known figure who would put Cuba on the map wherever he travelledp58

The St Petersburg 1914 chess tournament was the first in which Capablanca played World Champion Emanuel Lasker under normal tournament conditions The St Petersburg event was arranged in an unusual way after a preliminary single round all play all tournament of eleven players the top five were to play a second stage in a double round format with scores from the preliminary tournament carried forward to the second contest Capablanca placed first in the preliminary tournament 1 points ahead of Lasker who was out of practice and made a shaky start Despite a determined effort by Lasker Capablanca still seemed on course for ultimate victory However in their second game of the final Lasker reduced Capablanca to a helpless position and Capablanca was so shaken by this that he blundered away his next game to Tarrasch Lasker thus finished half a point ahead of Capablanca and 3 ahead of Alekhine Alekhine commented

After the breakdown of his attempt to negotiate a title match in 1911 Capablanca drafted rules for the conduct of future challenges which were agreed by the other top players at the 1914 Saint Petersburg tournament including Lasker and approved at the Mannheim Congress later that year The main points were the champion must be prepared to defend his title once a year the match should be won by the first player to win six or eight games whichever the champion preferred and the stake should be at least 1000

In January 1920 Emanuel Lasker and Capablanca signed an agreement to play a World Championship match in 1921 The match was played in MarchApril 1921 Lasker resigned it after just fourteen games having lost four games and won none Vladimir Kramnik thought that Lasker played quite well and the match was an even and fascinating fight until Lasker blundered in the last game Kramniks explanation was that Capablanca was twenty years younger a slightly stronger player and had more recent competitive practice

Capablanca came second at the New York 1924 tournament 1 points behind Emanuel Lasker though two ahead of third placed Alekhine with the score of 1420 Capablancas defeat at the hands of Richard Reti in the fifth round was his first in serious competition in eight years He made another bad start at the Moscow 1925 chess tournament and could only fight back to third place two points behind Bogolyubov and point behind Emanuel Lasker

A group of Argentinian businessmen backed by a guarantee from the president of Argentina promised the funds for a World Championship match between Capablanca and Alekhine in 1927 In the New York 1927 chess tournament six of the worlds strongest masters played each other four times the others being Alekhine Rudolf Spielmann Milan Vidmar Nimzovich and Marshall lacking Bogolyubov and Lasker Before the tournament Capablanca diffidently wrote that he had more experience but less power than in 1911 that he had peaked in 1919 and that some of his competitors had become stronger in the meantime In the event he finished undefeated winning the mini matches with each of his rivals 2 points ahead of second place Alekhine and won the best game prize for a win over Spielmann

Since Capablanca had won the New York 1927 tournament overwhelmingly and had never lost a game to Alekhine he was regarded by most pundits as the clear favorite in their 1927 World Chess Championship match However Alekhine won the match played at Buenos Aires by 6 wins 3 losses and 25 draws the longest World Championship match until the World Chess Championship 198485 between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov Alekhines victory surprised almost the entire chess world 

After Capablancas death Alekhine expressed surprise at his own victory since in 1927 he had not thought he was superior to Capablanca and he suggested that Capablanca had been over confident Capablanca entered the match with no technical or physical preparation while Alekhine got himself into good physical condition and had thoroughly studied Capablancas play According to Kasparov Alekhines research uncovered many small inaccuracies which occurred because Capablanca was unwilling to concentrate intensely Vladimir Kramnik commented that this was the first contest in which Capablanca had no easy wins Ludk Pachman suggested that Capablanca who was unused to losing games or to any other type of setback became depressed over his unnecessary loss of the eleventh game a long gruelling endgame featuring errors by both players

Immediately after winning the match Alekhine announced that he was willing to give Capablanca a return match on the same terms that Capablanca had required as champion the challenger must provide a stake of US 10000 of which more than half would go to the defending champion even if he was defeated

Negotiations for a return match dragged on for several years often breaking down when agreement seemed in sight Their relationship became bitter and Alekhine demanded much higher appearance fees for tournaments in which Capablanca also played

Capablanca finished fourth one point behind the joint winners at Moscow in 1935 Emanuel Laskers third place at the age of 66 was widely admired The following year Capablanca won an even stronger tournament in Moscow one point ahead of Botvinnik and 3 ahead of Salo Flohr who took third place A month later he shared first place with Botvinnik at Nottingham with a mark of losing only to Flohr Alekhine came sixth These 1936 tournaments the last of Laskers life were the only ones in which Capablanca finished ahead of Lasker

During these triumphs Capablanca began to experience debilitating symptoms of hypertension and could only finish seventh of the eight players at the 1938 AVRO tournament an lite contest designed to select a challenger for Alekhines world title Capablancas high blood pressure was not correctly diagnosed and treated until after the AVRO tournament and caused him to lose his train of thought towards the end of playing sessions

The Battle of Salamis was a battle between an Alliance of Greek city states and the Achaemenid Empire of Persia It happened in September 480 BC in the straits between the mainland and Salamis Island It was part of the Greco Persian Wars

Although heavily outnumbered the Greek Allies were persuaded by the Athenian general Themistocles to bring the Persian fleet to battle again The Persian king Xerxes was also anxious for a decisive battle 

The Persian navy sailed into the Straits of Salamis and tried to block both entrances In the cramped conditions of the Straits the great Persian numbers were an active hindrance as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganised Seizing the opportunity the Greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory sinking or capturing at least 200 Persian ships

As a result Xerxes retreated to Asia with much of his army leaving Mardonius to complete the conquest of Greece However the following year the rest of the Persian army was decisively beaten at the Battle of Plataea and the Persian navy at the Battle of Mycale Afterwards the Persians made no more attempts to conquer the Greek mainland These battles of Salamis and Plataea mark a turning point in the Greco Persian wars from then on the Greek cities would take the offensive

The Sparrowhawk is a small bird of prey in the family Accipitridae It has a wide distrution in Eurasia and north Africa 

The adult male Sparrowhawk has a blue grey back and wings His chest and belly have thin orange stripes Female and young Sparrowhawks have brown backs and wings with thin brown stripes The female is up to 25 larger than the male This is one of the biggest size differences in any bird species 

The Sparrowhawk eats mostly small birds which live in woodland It can be seen in any habitat and often hunts birds in town and city gardens Male Sparrowhawks eat smaller birds like tits finches and sparrows Females eat bigger birds like thrushes and starlings They can kill birds weighing more than convert500goz

The Sparrowhawk is seen in Europe parts of Asia and parts of Africa Birds that breed in the north migrate south for winter Birds that live further south stay there or fly shorter distances

Sparrowhawks build a nest in woodland The nest is up to 60 cm wide and made from twigs The female lays four or five eggs with pale blue shells The chicks hatch after 33 days and leave the nest after another 24 to 28 days

The proportion of young Sparrowhawks which survive to one year old is 34 More young males die than young females 69 of adults survive from one year to the next The average lifespan is four years 

The number of Sparrowhawks decreased in Europe in the 1950s Chemicals to kill unwanted insects were put on seeds before they were planted Small birds ate the seeds and then Sparrowhawks ate the small birds The amount of chemicals in the food chain increased This affected the Sparrowhawks Some were poisoned and others laid eggs with shells that were too thin The shells broke before the chicks hatched The pesticides were banned and the Sparrowhawk population increased again It is now one of the commonest birds of prey in Europe 

The Sparrowhawks hunting behaviour means people who own homing pigeons or keep birds for food may dislike it Some people also blame the Sparrowhawk for decreases in the numbers of smaller birds Scientists have found that increased numbers of Sparrowhawks did not reduce the numbers of birds living in farmland and woodland in the 1960s Research in Scotland found that less than 1 of homing pigeons that died were killed by Sparrowhawks

People have used the Sparrowhawk for falconry for more than 500 years It is difficult to train but brave The Sparrowhawk features in some old German myths It is mentioned in a play by William Shakespeare and a poem by Ted Hughes

The Sparrowhawk is a small bird of prey with short broad wings and a long tail These adaptations help it to fly between trees Females can be up to 25 larger than males and can be twice as heavy When females are larger than males it is called reverse sexual dimorphism It is unusual in higher vertebrates but typical in birds of prey The size difference is biggest in birds of prey which hunt other birds

The adult male is convert2934cminabbron long from beak to tail with a wingspan of convert5964cminabbron He weighs convert110196gozabbron The male has a slate grey back and wings His chest and belly have thin red stripes but they can look orange from a distance his eyes are orange yellow or orange red 

FileAccipiter nisus 9194JPGthumb200pxThe yellow eye of this young male Sparrowhawk may turn orangeThe female is much larger convert3541cminabbron long with a wingspan of convert6780cminabbron She weighs convert185342gozabbron The female has dark brown or grey brown back and wings and brown stripes on her chest and belly Her eyes are bright yellow to orange 

Young Sparrowhawks have a brown back and wings with rust coloured edges to the feathers They have bigger brown stripes and spots on their chest and belly and pale yellow eyes 

The Sparrowhawks pale underparts and darker back and wings are an example of countershading This colouration counteracts the effect of light coming from above and helps to make the bird less visible In fact countershading is seen in most animals including the Peregrine Falcon the Merlin and other Accipiters The Soparrowhawks stripes are typical of markings on birds of prey which live in woodland 

Sparrowhawks fly in a pattern described as flap flap glide The glide means that the flight has an up and down pattern In Great Britain Sparrowhawks living further north have longer wings than birds in the south The Sparrowhawk has a small hooked beak It is used for removing the feathers of its prey The Sparrowhawks long legs and toes help it to catch and eat birds Its middle toe is very long and is used to grab things

Most Sparrowhawks live for around four years 34 of young birds survive to be one year old 69 of adults survive from one year to the next The oldest known wild Sparrowhawk lived for more than 20 years

Young Sparrowhawks weigh less than adults They are especially light in the two months after leaving the nest There is probably a high death rate at this time particularly for males This may be because the smaller males catch smaller food They cannot catch some of the bigger prey that females can This means they need to eat more often A female Sparrowhawk of average weight can survive for seven days without eating A male can survive only four days

The Sparrowhawk is part of the family Accipitridae and the genus Accipiter Some English people used to call the Sparrowhawk the Blue Hawk because of the males colour Other old names include Spar Hawk Spur Hawk and Stone Falcon

The Swedish biology scientist Carolus Linnaeus was the first person to describe the Sparrowhawk He called it Falco nisus in 1758 The French naturalist Mathurin Jacques Brisson moved it into the Accipiter genus in 1760

The current scientific name comes from the Latin words accipiter and nisus 

The Sparrowhawk forms a superspecies with the Rufous chested Sparrowhawk of eastern and southern Africa and possibly the Madagascar Sparrowhawk Eurasian Sparrowhawks look slightly different in different parts of their range Birds in the eastern part of the range are larger and paler Six subspecies of Sparrowhawk are generally recognised

Lady Delacour is a bel esprit who Belinda at first thinks the most agreeableno that is too feeble an expressionthe most fascinating person she had ever beheld Later however after Belinda hears about her sad life she feels sorry for her Belinda is very kind to Lady Delacour who begins to like her Through Belindas gentleness Lady Delacour begins to change She becomes more caring for her husband and daughter Helena However Lady Delacours sudden untrue jealousy towards Belinda and makes her move to the Percivals house where Helena is staying at Later Lady Delacour finds out that she was completely wrong and had misunderstood Belindas good intentions She becomes very ill and begs for Belinda to forgiver her and come back Belinda accepting her apology comes and now Lady Delacour does everything Belinda advises her to do and makes up with her husband revealing to him how she is ill that she had been hiding from everybody except herself and Belinda and her maid Lord Delacour feels worried for her when he hears this She takes a surgery and is told that she is actually not ill at all The bad doctor she had been going to had given her the wrong medicines and therefore made her sick Joyfully she decides to be a good wife a sweet friend and a kind mother She ends the book by saying while laughing Now Lady Delacour to show that she is reformed comes forward to address the audience with a morala moralyes

Our tale contains a moral and no doubt You all have wit enough to find it out

Her strong character and the very important part she plays in the book make some people think the title should be her name instead of Belindas

Belinda Portman is a young lady She is about seventeen years old She is handsome graceful sprightly and highly accomplished She has good skills but is unused to thinking for herself for her aunt orders her to do everything Belinda is innocent and loving and loves Clarence Hervey though she does not even admit it to herself Mr Vincent and Sir Philip both want to marry her She is very forgiving as seen when she forgives Lady Delacour but has good self control over her feelings for example she does not blush later when people talk about Clarence Hervey and is not shaken by Mrs Freke when she said she would be her enemy

Clarence Hervey is a clever and witty young man who is gallant and is as Belinda said at first a most uncommonly pleasing young man He is shown to have a warm heart for he asks Lady Delacour to make his peace with Belinda after he spoke badly about her He admires Lady Delacour and tries to change her But after that he begins to like Belinda However he had been secretly taking care of another girl Virginia and now thinking that he must marry Virginia he tries to forget about Belinda But later Virginia shows him that she loves somebody else So he tells Belinda that he loves her and they marry

Lady Anne Percival is very different from Lady Delacour She is a gentle motherly reasonable lady Belinda later also tells Mr Vincent when he compares Lady Anne Percival and Lady Delacour I have never seen any woman who would not suffer by a comparison with Lady Anne Percival She loves literature and that makes her a good wife to Mr Percival She is kind and motherly and loves Helena like her daughter She also treats Belinda kindly and thinks carefully before she judges people She wished for Belinda to marry Mr Vincent At first Lady Delacour did not like her feeling jealous and thinking that Helena liked Lady Anne Percival better than her However later at the end it is guessed that she becomes good friends with Lady Anne Percival

The Axolotl Ambystoma mexicanum is the best known of the Mexican mole salamanders it belongs to the Tiger Salamander complex The Axolotl shows neoteny the larvae do not undergo metamorphosis so the adults stay aquatic with external gills 

The species evolved in the lake underlying Mexico City Axolotls are used a lot in scientific research because they can broken wikt linkregenerateregenerate most body parts are easy to breed and have large embryos 

Axolotls are closely related to waterdogs the larval stage of the closely related Tiger Salamanders Ambystoma tigrinum and Ambystoma mavortium These are common in much of North America and also sometimes become neotenic The mudpuppies Necturus are fully aquatic salamanders which are not closely related to the axolotl but bear a superficial resemblance

Wild axolotls are now near extinction due to population growth in Mexico City and the polluted waters of the lake Non native fish such as African tilapia and Asian carp have also recently been introduced to the waters These new fish have been eating the axolotls young as well as its primary source of food The axolotl is currently on the IUCN Red List of threatened species

Compared with land dwelling salamanders the sexually mature adult Axolotl is a chimera of larval and adult tissues A mutation in hormone production slows the development of the non sexual tissues compared to the gonads So it ends up as an adult which looks like a larva except that it is sexually mature This is an example of heterochrony or neoteny

Poison gas is any gas that is also a poison Poison gases can kill or injure a person if present in a high enough concentration There is a diverse range of different poison gases and each has unique properties Many toxic liquids are also volatile and their vapors are poison gas Poison gas can refer to poisons in chemical weapons but most of them are in fact liquids for example mustard gas and VX are viscous liquids that are dispersed into fine mists

In small amounts corrosive poison gases usually cause irritation and may have a smell but this is not universal There are several gases that can kill insidiously without a warning smell or irritation

All gases other than oxygen can displace air and cause death by asphyxiation This does not make them poison gases Nitrogen and carbon dioxide are two common examples This has to be taken into account in handling of any compressed or liquified gas Gases can be also dangerous because they are flammable

Poison gases can cause injury more readily than condensed poisons because they diffuse in the air exposing skin and are easily breathed in Immediate contact with corrosive gas leads to chemical burns of the skin and lungs When absorbed into the inside of the human body and into the blood either by breathing in or through skin several poison gases cause a poisoning In a poisoning medical help is often necessary simply removing the victim from the gas is not enough to prevent symptoms

Poison gases are used in industry as chemical reagents The chemical reactions they can be used for are more important than their toxicity Today chemists try to avoid the use of poisonous gases but it is often not possible Examples of large volume industrial poisonous gases are hydrogen sulfide cracked from oil chlorine in diverse chemical uses and to disinfect drinking water and ammonia which is a valuable fertilizer into itself and can be converted into a range of other fertilizers in addition to chemical uses

Some fumigants are also poison gases for example phosphine which is used to kill pests living in grains The advantage of a gas is that it evaporates after use so that if food is treated with gas there is no need to rinse it to remove the poison

Haydns Symphony No 98 which had both trumpet and timpani is known as the first symphony that anyone had written in that key Actually his brother Michael Haydn had written one earlier However Joseph Haydn still gets credit for writing the timpani part at actual pitch with an F major key signature something that made things easier and made more sense

Five of Mozarts piano concerti are in B flat major

G minor is a minor scale based on G

Its relative major is B flat major G minor is one of two flat key signatures that needs a sharp for the seventh note

During the Baroque period music in G minor was usually written with a one flat key signature

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart thought that G minor was the most suitable key for showing sadness and tragedy and many of his minor key works are in G minor such as the Piano Quartet No 1 and the String Quintet in G minor G minor is the only minor key he used as a main key for his numbered symphonies In the Classical period symphonies in G minor almost always used four horns two in G and two in B flat alto G minor symphonies like Mozarts No 25 often used E flat major for the slow movement including Haydns No 39 and Vanhals G minor symphony from before 1771

See also List of symphonies in G minor

D major is a major scale based on D Its key signature has two sharps Its relative minor is B minor

D major is good for violin music because of the structure of the instrument which has its four strings tuned to G D A E The open strings resonate with the D string producing a special rich sound

Because of this many classical composers chose to write violin concertos in D major Examples include Mozarts Ludwig van Beethovens Paganinis Brahmss Tchaikovskys Prokofievs Stravinskys and Korngolds

It is also suitable for guitar music with drop tuning for the lowest string making two Ds as open strings

For some beginning wind instrument students however D major is not a very good key because it transposes to E major for B flat instruments E major has four sharps which is harder for new learners to play

Still the clarinet in B flat is often used for music in D major It is probably the key with the most sharps that it can play well However when some composers write a piece in D minor with B flat clarinets they change to clarinets in A if the music changes to D major

Most tin whistles are in D because they are often used in music with fiddles

In the Baroque period D major was seen as the key of glory so many trumpet pieces were in D major Examples include concertos by Fasch Gross Molter Leopold Mozart Telemann and Giuseppe Torelli sonatas by Corelli Franceschini Purcell Torelli and The Trumpet Shall Sound and the Hallelujah chorus from Handels Messiah

After the valve trumpet was invented composers began to write for trumpet in keys with more flats so Haydn wrote his famous trumpet concerto in the key of E flat major

23 of Haydns 104 symphonies are in D major making it the most often used main key of his symphonies A great number of Mozarts unnumbered symphonies are in D major namely K 66c 8173 9773m 9573n 120111a and 161163141a The symphony came from the overture and D major was by far the most common key for overtures in the second half of the eighteenth century

Scriabin saw D major as golden in color and when he talked to Rimsky Korsakov he gave an example from one of Rimsky Korsakovs own operas where a character sang in D major about gold

B minor is a minor scale based on B The harmonic minor raises the A to Amusicsharp Its key signature has two sharps

Its relative major is D major and its parallel major is B major

In Baroque times people thought that B minor was the key of passive suffering Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart said that it was a key that was complaining gently and quietly something that matches Bachs use of the key in the St Johns Passion By Beethovens time B minor had changed in peoples minds Francesco Galeazzi wrote that B minor was not suitable for music in good taste and Beethoven labelled a B minor melodic idea in one of his sketchbooks as a black key The chord was famously used as the first chord in Pink Floyds 1979 hit Comfortably Numb commonly renowned to be a very emotional and melancholic songCitation neededdateNovember 2009 The second movement of Rodrigos Concierto de Aranjuez one of the most famous compositions for the classical guitar is in B minor

It is a common key used in rock folk country and other guitarist based styles because a guitar is naturally tuned so that all the open strings are notes in B minor

C minor is a minor scale based on C The harmonic minor raises the Bmusicflat to BmusicnaturalIts key signature has three flats When written in jazz notation its short form is Cm

Its relative major is E flat major and its parallel major is C major

In the Baroque period music in C minor was usually written with a two flat key signature When this music is printed today sometimes it is still printed in the same way

Mozart wrote two piano concertos in a minor key and one of them is in C minor No 24 K 491

C minor has had the meaning of heroic struggle from Beethovens time One of the most famous pieces in this key is his Symphony No 5 The fact that Brahmss Symphony No 1 is also in C minor helped it get its nickname as Beethovens Tenth Three of Anton Bruckners ten numbered symphonies are in C minor

There are not as many symphonies in A major as in D major or G major but more than other sharp keys Beethovens Symphony No 7 Bruckners Symphony No 6 and Mendelssohns Symphony No 4 are almost all the symphonies in this key in the Romantic era Mozarts Clarinet Concerto and Clarinet Quintet are both in A major Mozart used clarinets in A major often

In chamber music A major is used a lot Johannes Brahms Csar Franck and Gabriel Faur wrote violin sonatas in A major Peter Cropper said that A major is the fullest sounding key for the violin when he was talking about Beethovens Kreutzer Sonata 

According to Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart A major is a key that is good for declarations of innocent love hope of seeing ones beloved again when parting youthful cheerfulness and trust in God

When music for orchestra is in A major the timpani are normally set to A and E a fifth apart In most other keys they are set a fourth apart

F sharp minor is a minor scale based on F sharp Its key signature has three sharps

Very few symphonies are written in this key Haydns Farewell Symphony is one famous example George Frederick Bristow and Dora Pejaevi also wrote symphonies in this key

Many piano pieces have been written in F sharp minor Mozarts only composition in this key is the second movement to his Piano Concerto No 23 in A major 2 of Chopins 52 mazurkas and 1 of his nocturnes are in this key though he seems to have liked the related key C sharp minor better Scriabins Piano Sonata No 3 is also in this key and the 3rd movement of Beethovens Hammerklavier Piano Sonata is too

Both Regers and Tippetts second string quartets are in this key and so is Shostakovichs seventh string quartet

Amusicflat major or A flat major is a major scale that starts on A flat

Its relative minor is F minor and its parallel minor is A flat minor

This is a very peaceful key It was used often by Franz Schubert Twenty four of Frdric Chopins piano pieces are in A flat major more than any other key

Charles Marie Widor considered A flat major to be the second best key for flute music

Beethoven chose A flat major as the key of the slow movement for most of his C minor works This was also followed by Antonn Dvok in his only C minor symphony and Anton Bruckner in his first two C minor symphonies Since A flat major was not often chosen as the main key for orchestral music of the 18th century passages or movements in the key often kept the timpani tuned the same way as they were in the movement before it For example Beethovens Symphony No 5 in C minor has the timpani set to C and G for the first movement With hand tuned timpani there is no time to retune the timpani to A flat and E flat for the slow second movement in A flat In Bruckners Symphony No 1 in C minor however the timpani are retuned between the first movement in C minor and the following in A flat major

Edward Elgars Symphony No 1 in A flat major is probably the best known symphony in that key Arnold Baxs last symphony is also in the same key A flat major is the major key with the most flats that Domenico Scarlatti used in his keyboard sonatas though he used it only twice in K 127 and K 130 Felix Mendelssohn and John Field each wrote one piano concerto in A flat

F minor is a minor scale based on F The harmonic minor raises the Emusicflat to Emusicnatural Its key signature has four flats

Its relative major is A flat major and its parallel major is F major

In the Baroque period music in F minor was usually written with a three flat key signature Some modern printings of such music keeps it written that way

E major is a major scale with a base note of E Its key signature has four sharps Its relative minor is C sharp minor

Symphonies in E major are quite rare 

E major is hard for wind instruments to play It is quite good for violin because two of the open strings are A and E the tonic and subdominant Other orchestral string instruments can play well in it and it is also good for the guitar When writing in E major clarinets in A should be used instead of clarinets in B flat to make it easier to play This is because clarinets are transposing instruments

The bells of the Clock Tower in Londons Palace of Westminster are tuned to the key of E major

C sharp minor or Cmusicsharp minor is a minor scale based on Cmusicsharp Its key signature has four sharps

Its relative major is E major and its parallel major is C sharp major

There are very few symphonies written in this key One of them is by Joseph Martin Kraus but he later rewrote it in C minor Another two are Mahlers Symphony No 5 and Prokofievs Symphony No 7 Shostakovichs Violin Concerto No 2 is also in C sharp minor

This key occurs more often in piano music Domenico Scarlatti wrotetwo keyboard sonatas in C sharp minor K 246 and K 247 But after Beethovens famous Moonlight Sonata the key became more popular for piano Beethoven used this key again in the outer movements of his String Quartet No 14 However Johannes Brahms rewrote his C sharp minor Piano Quartet to be published as Piano Quartet No 3 in C minor Op 60 One of the most famous pieces in this key is Chopins Fantaisie Impromptu Other works include Chopins Nocturnes No 7 and No 20 and his Raindrop Prelude in D flat major Another very famous example of a work in C sharp minor is Rachmaninoffs Prelude in C sharp minor

Bmusicflat minor or B flat minor is a minor scale based on B flat Its key signature has five flats

Its relative major is D flat major and its parallel major is B flat major Its enharmonic equivalent is A sharp minor

B flat minor is often seen as a dark key Tchaikovsky said that the oboe solo in B flat minor in the second movement of his Symphony No 4 was the feeling that you get when you are all alone

The old valveless horn could not play easily in B flat minor In fact the only example found in 18th century music is a modulation in the first minuet of Franz Krommers Concertino in D major Opus 80

B major is a major scale based on B Its key signature has five sharps

B majors relative minor is G sharp minor its parallel minor is B minor and its enharmonic equivalent is C flat major

The key signature for B major is the least sharp key signature with three lines of sharps In the treble clef putting the sharp for A where it looks like it should be next to the sharp for G would mean that a ledger line would have to be used In the bass clef it would be possible to do this without a ledger line but because sight reading is easier when both staves look the same it is not usually done in piano music In the alto clef used in orchestral music the B major key signature is usually written in just two lines of sharps

Although B major is usually thought of as a far away key because it has many sharps and is quite far from C major in the circle of fifths Frdric Chopin thought that it was the easiest scale of all to play as its black notes fit the natural positions of the fingers well Because of this it was often the first scale he taught to beginning piano students leaving the scale of C major till last because he thought it was the hardest to play

While B major is not too difficult to play on keyboard instruments and guitar the key of C flat major is easier when writing music for the harp as it is that instruments home key

G sharp minor is a minor scale based on Gmusicsharp For the harmonic minor the Fmusicsharp is raised to Fmusicdoublesharp

Its key signature has five sharps

Its relative major is B major

The melodic and harmonic versions of the scale are written in with accidentals as necessary

G sharp minor is usually not used in orchestral music except to modulate but it is more common in keyboard music like Scriabins sonatas For orchestration of piano music sometimes the music is transposed to G minor or A minor If G sharp minor must be used B flat wind instruments should have their part written in B flat minor not A sharp minor 

In a few scores 5 sharp key signatures in the bass clef are written with the sharp for the A on the top line

G flat major is a major scale based on G flat Its key signature has six flats

Its relative minor is E flat minor and its parallel minor is G flat minor

Its enharmonic equivalent is F sharp major whose key signature also has six accidentals In writing music in E major for B flat instruments it is preferable to use a G flat rather an F sharp key signature

G flat major is sometimes used as a main key for piano works such as the impromptus of Chopin and Schubert but rarely for orchestra

Austrian composer Gustav Mahler liked to use G flat major in his symphonies

Emusicflat minor or E flat minor is a minor scale based on E flat Its key signature has six sharps

Its relative major is G flat major and its parallel major is E flat major Its enharmonic equivalent is D sharp minor 

This key is not used much in orchestral music and usually only to modulate It is used in some keyboard pieces and has been most popular in Russian pieces If piano music in this key must be arranged for orchestra some people recommend transposing it into D minor or E minor 

In book 1 of the Well Tempered Clavier by Johann Sebastian Bach Prelude No 8 is written in E flat minor while the following Fugue is written in D sharp minor In book 2 both movements are in D sharp minor 

One of the few symphonies written in this key is Prokofievs Symphony No 6 A few other Soviet composers also wrote symphonies in this key such as Eshpai Janis Ivanovs Ovchinnikov and Myaskovsky Rachmaninovs Elegie Op 3 No 1 is in E flat minor as is his Etudes Tableaux Op 39 5 These pieces are noted for being dark and mysterious a mood this key has This mood is shown even in the later jazz music Round Midnight and Take Five which are also in the key

The second movement to Gustav Mahlers Eighth Symphony has a long orchestral and choral introduction in E flat minor The dark orchestral introduction to Beethovens only oratorio Christ on the Mount of Olives is also in this key

F sharp major is a major scale based on F sharp Its key signature has six sharps 

This key is not used often in orchestral music except to modulate It is used more often in piano music like Scriabins sonatas When piano music in this key needs to be arranged for orchestra sometimes it is better to change it to F or G major If F sharp major needs to be used transposing instruments in B flat should have their music written in A flat major not G sharp major

The Presentation of the Rose scene in Act Two of Richard Strausss opera Der Rosenkavalier is written in F sharp major F sharp major is the key of Beethovens Piano Sonata Op 78 of Chopins Barcarolle of Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody No 2 of Mahlers unfinished Tenth Symphony Erich Korngolds Symphony Op 40 and Scriabins Fourth Sonata

E flat minor is its enharmonic equivalent Its relative major is F sharp major and its parallel major is D sharp major This is usually replaced by E flat major because D sharp major contains nine sharps and is not normally used

Since D sharp minor and its enharmonic equivalent both have key signatures of six accidentals neither one is clearly used instead of the other For example using the melodic minor version of D sharp minor on the harp is very difficult The B pedal can be set to the sharp position but there is no double sharp position to set the C pedal at In Book I of The Well Tempered Clavier Bach chose to write the eighth prelude in E flat minor but the accompanying fugue in D sharp minor

Music written in this key is considered very difficult to read which means that little music was written mainly in this key in the Classical era E flat minor is easier for many brass instruments and woodwinds

The most famous work in this key is Scriabins famous Etude Op 8 No 12 Russian composer Lyapunov must also have liked the key because he wrote the second etude of his Op 11 set in the key and also fifteen years later his Variations on a Russian Theme Op 49 His early Piano Concerto No 1 Op 4 was also in the enharmonic key of E flat minor

In a few scores 6 sharp key signatures in the bass clef are written with the sharp for the A on the top line This is not done often because it is different from the treble clef

This key is not used often in orchestral music but is used more in keyboard music When arranging this piano music for orchestra some people recommend transposing the music to D minor or E minor If D sharp minor must be used B flat wind instruments should have their parts written in F minor rather than E sharp minor

A flat minor is a minor scale starting on Amusicflat Its key signature has seven flats

Its relative major is C flat major and its parallel major is A flat major Its enharmonic equivalent is G sharp minor

A flat minor is rarely used as the main key of a piece of music More often pieces in a minor mode that have Amusicflat as the tonic are written in the enharmonic key G sharp minor because it has a simpler key signature Because of this there are few works in A flat minor

In some scores the Amusicflat minor key signature in the bass clef is written with the flat for the F on the second line from the top

In classical music 

Cmusicsharp major is a major scale based on Cmusicsharp Its key signature has seven sharps

When a harp is tuned to C sharp major it has all its pedals in the bottom position Because all the strings are made shorter in this way it makes it less resonant

Most composers prefer to use the enharmonic equivalent D flat major because it has just five flats However Johann Sebastian Bach actually chose C sharp major for Prelude and Fugue No 3 in both books of the Well Tempered Clavier In Hungarian Rhapsody No 6 Franz Liszt changes key from D flat major to C sharp major near the beginning of the piece Maurice Ravel used C sharp major as the tonic key of Ondine from his piano suite Gaspard de la nuit 

Louis Vierne used C sharp major in the final piece of Messe solennelle

A sharp minor or Amusicsharp minor is a minor scale based on A sharp Its key signature has seven sharps

Its relative major is C sharp major Its parallel major is A sharp major This is usually replaced by B flat major because A sharp major has 10 sharps Exceptions include Chopins Polonaise Fantaisie in A flat major Op 61 which has a short passage of about 6 bars actually written in A sharp major putting in the necessary double sharps as accidentals This is part of a theme in B major which modulates to A sharp major for a little while

A sharp minor has the enharmonic equivalent of B flat minor This is often used in most musical compositions instead of A sharp minor because A sharp minor is not a useful key for compositions and is one of the least used minor keys in music However there were some composers in the past that have composed music in this key Christian Heinrich Rinck wrote his Prelude No 16 from Op 15 in A sharp minor

F flat major is a major scale based on F flat Its key signature has eight flats

Its relative minor is D flat minor and its parallel minor is F flat minor usually replaced by E minor 

Part of Richard Strauss Metamorphosen uses F flat major which one commentator has called a bitter enharmonic parody of the earlier manifestations of E major in the piece

To make reading and writing music easier F flat major is usually written as its enharmonic equivalent of E major

Because it has so many flats Dmusicflat minor is usually written as its enharmonic equivalent of Cmusicsharp minor For example Mahlers thematic motif der kleine Appell from his Fourth and Fifth Symphonies is written in Dmusicflat minor in Symphony No4 but in his Symphony No 5 it is in Cmusicsharp minor In the Adagio of his Symphony No 9 a solo bassoon theme appears first in Dmusicflat minor but comes back two more times notated in Cmusicsharp minor The Adagio of Bruckners Symphony No 8 also has phrases that are tonally in Dmusicflat minor but written as Cmusicsharp minor

G sharp major is a major scale based on the musical note G sharp Its key signature has six sharps and one double sharp

To make reading easier G sharp major is usually written as its enharmonic equivalent of A flat major However it does appear as a secondary key area in several works in sharp keys for example in the Prelude and Fugue in C sharp major from Bachs Well Tempered Klavier Book 1 The G sharp minor Prelude and Fugue from the same set end with a Picardy third in G sharp major G sharp major is used for a short time in several of Chopins nocturnes in C sharp minor 

E sharp minor is a minor scale based on the musical note E Its key signature has six sharps and one double sharp

E sharp minor is usually written as its enharmonic equivalent F minor

In music flat or Bemolle means lower in pitch In music notation flat means lower in pitch by a semitone and has the symbol The Unicode character musicflat is the flat sign Its HTML entity is 

Under twelve tone equal temperament C flat is the same as or enharmonically equivalent to B natural and G flat is the same as F sharp 

Double flats also exist which look like musicdouble flat and lower a note by two semitones or a whole step Sometimes you will encounter half or three quarter flats The Unicode character x1D12B represents the double flat sign

A triple flat can be found but it is very rare It lowers a note three semitones 

The note A flat is shown in musical notation in Figure 1 together with A double flat An A and an A flat

In tuning flat can also mean slightly lower in pitch If the same note is played on two instruments at the same time the lower pitched one is flat compared to the higher pitched one

A half flat showing quarter tones is sometimes shown with a flat with a slash or a reversed flat sign A three quarter flat is represented by a half flat and a regular flat

In music sharp or Diese means higher in pitch In musical notation sharp means higher in pitch by a semitone and looks like this

Under twelve tone equal temperament B sharp for instance is enharmonically equivalent to C natural and G sharp is enharmonically equivalent to A flat 

Double sharps also exist these have the symbol Musicdoublesharp and raise a note by two semitones or a whole step Less often there are half or three quarter sharps

Although very rare and used only in modern classical music a triple sharp can sometimes be found This raises a note by three semitones

The Circle of fifths tells you how many sharps are in a key signature

In tuning sharp can also mean slightly higher in pitch If the same note is played on two instruments and one is slightly higher it is too sharp compared to the other

In Unicode the sharp symbol is at code point U266F Its HTML entity is The double sharp symbol is at U1D12A Some fonts do not show these symbols

In music theory theoretical keys or impossible keys are keys with key signatures that make writing in them very hard because they contain one or more double flats or double sharps

Double flats and double sharps are used in music as accidentals but they are never placed in the key signature because it would make reading the key signature very difficult 

For example the key of DMusicflat minor is not usually used to write music down because its key signature would contain a BMusicdoubleflat An equal tempered scale of DMusicflat minor has exactly the same notes as the CMusicsharp minor scale Key pairs like this are called enharmonically equivalent So the theoretical key of DMusicflat minor is usually written with the key signature of CMusicsharp minor

A piece of Western music usually has a home key and a passage within it may modulate to another key which is usually closely related to the home key When the key is near the top of the circle the writing of both keys is easy a small number of extra sharps or flats is added But if the home key is near the bottom of the circle enharmonic equivalence may need to be used because simply adding accidentals will result in a key with too many accidentals to be easy to play or write in

In each of the bottom three places on the circle of fifths the two enharmonic equivalents can both be written without double sharps or double flats and so do not classify as theoretical keys

But when a relative key is on the opposite side of the circle from its home key then in theory modulating to that key would involve adding so many sharps or flats that double sharps and double flats would have to be written in the key signature The following six keys would require one two or three double sharps or double flats 

For example if a piece in E major were to modulate up a fifth to B major which is next to it on the circle and on the same side of the circle the notation is clear and simple an extra sharp is added to make five sharps If it was modulated again it would become FMusicsharp major written with six sharps The next modulation to CMusicsharp has seven sharps But the next modulation would be to a theoretical key of GMusicsharp which would need an eighth sharp for the previous FMusicsharp note to become FMusicdoublesharp in the key signature To avoid theoretical keys the new section would usually be written in the enharmonically equivalent key signature of AMusicflat major

David who was fourteen years old at this time finally answered to challenge He was skilled on use of sling and he found out a way how he could win him He accurately slung a stone on Goliaths forehead just below his helmet The stone knocked Goliath out David then ran to unconscious Goliath pulled his sword off the scabbard and cut his head off Seeing a fourteen year old boy killing their champion the Philistine army demoralized

The Dead Sea Scrolls say Goliaths height was a more credible four cubits and a span in modern measurements 202 cm At the era when mans average height was some 160 cm he would still have looked like a giant

Kpolnsnyk is a village in Fejr county Hungary

The excavations in the surroundings reveled bronzeage artefacts proving that the area was already populated in ancient time The name of the settlement originates from the name of the Nyk tribe the first residents belonged probably to a subgroup of the tribe When Istvn I defeated Koppny Nyk became a land of the queen The name of the settlement is mentioned first in 1193 as Neck Later the names Kpolns Nyk Kposzts Nyk and Fertf Nyk are used the mention this rather insignificant place located between Buda and Fehrvr to the south of the commercial route As a border village Kpolnsnyk suffered from double taxation during the Turkish occupation therefore the population of the village decreased considerably it even turned uninhabited during the Turkish camping of 1543 The inhabitants returned to the village in 1772 During the 19th century Upper and Lower Nyk were differentiated even after 1861 when the Southem Railway was built It is mentioned as an independent village first in 1871 to which Pettend was attached in 1898 Mihly Vrsmarty was born here The present appearance of the village was formed in the 1930s when it became a commercial and service background for the booming tourism of the Lake Velencei The phone system the gendarme patrol local medical care the railway station and the mill were established in this period The settlement suffered serious injuries in World War II when the majority of the population also died The village also behind in development compared to other settlements of the region and became a part of Velence by the 1970s Kpolnsnyk declared its independence in 1990 and has gone though considerable development since then It once again became the background for the tourism of Lake Velencei where commercial service facilities are established and the infrastructure is developing rapidly

Areopagitica is a book written by English poet John Milton in 1644 He wrote it to protest against censorship Its full title is Areopagitica A speech of Mr John Milton for the liberty of unlicensed printing to the Parliament of England Today his book is called a tract In the tract Milton tries to defend the freedom of expression Today many people see it as one of the best defenses of the freedom of press ever written

The tract is named after a speech by Isocrates a Greek orator of the 5th century The Areopagus is a hill in Athens where many councils and tribunals were held Isocrates wanted to restore one of these tribunals when he wrote the speech In the speechMilton argued that the Licensing Order of 1643 should be abolished censorship had not been part of Greek or Roman societies Milton uses many passages from the Bible to strengthen his argument Milton had been censored himself when he tried to publish tracts which were in favor of allowing people to get divorced 

In Areopagitica Milton argues that the status that was there before had worked best By this law all publications needed an authors name or that of a publisher According to Milton it is easy to find the authors or the publishers with this system So if anything libelous is published the books can still be destroyed after the fact

Defamation is saying or writing something about another person that hurts their reputation Usually when people use the word defamation it means that the statement is not true In this case it is against the law A statement that is defamation is called defamatory

In order to be defamatory a statement has to claim to be a fact instead of an opinion For example saying Mr Jones is mean cannot be defamatory because it is someones opinion However if someone says Mr Jones steals candy from children then the statement is defamatory if it is not true because it would be a fact not an opinion

If a defamatory statement is written such as in a book or in a newspaper it is called libel If it is spoken out loud it is called slander Somebody who is the victim of defamation can sue the person who wrote or said it

Defamation laws are not the same in every country In most countries the burden of proof is on the person claiming that somebody is defaming them This means they have to prove that what somebody saying about them is false However in England it is the other way around If somebody claims that a statement is defamation the person who made the statement has to prove the statement is true

Rachel Louise Carson was an American marine biologist and nature writer whose writings are credited with advancing the global environmental movement

Carson started her career as a biologist in the US Bureau of Fisheries and became a full time nature writer in the 1950s Her widely praised 1951 bestseller The Sea Around Us won her financial security and recognition as a gifted writer Her next book The Edge of the Sea and the republished version of her first book Under the Sea Wind were also bestsellers Together her sea trilogy explores the whole of ocean life from the shores to the surface to the deep sea

In the late 1950s Carson turned her attention to conservation and the environmental problems caused by synthetic pesticides The result was Silent Spring which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented portion of the American public Silent Spring spurred a reversal in national pesticide policyleading to a nationwide ban on DDT and other pesticidesand the grassroots environmental movement the book inspired led to the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency After her death Carson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Jimmy Carter

Early life and education Rachel Carson was born on May 27 1907 on a small family farm near Springdale Pennsylvania just up the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh Carson was an avid reader and from a remarkably young age a talented writer She also spent a lot of time exploring around her convert65acrehasingon farm She began writing stories at age eight and had her first story published at age eleven She especially enjoyed the St Nicholas Magazinethe works of Beatrix Potter and the novels of Gene Stratton Porter and in her teen years Herman Melville Joseph Conrad and Robert Louis Stevenson The natural world particularly the ocean was the common thread of her favorite literature Carson attended Springdales small school through tenth grade then completed high school in nearby Parnassus Pennsylvania graduating in 1925 at the top of her class of forty four students

At the Pennsylvania College for Women as in high school Carson was somewhat of a loner She originally studied English but switched her major to biology in January 1928 though she continued contributing to the schools student newspaper and literary supplement Though admitted to graduate standing at Johns Hopkins University in 1928 she was forced to remain at the Pennsylvania College for Women for her senior year due to financial difficulties she graduated magna cum laude in 1929 After a summer course at the Marine Biological Laboratory she continued her studies in zoology and genetics at Johns Hopkins in the fall of 1929

After her first year of graduate school Carson became a part time student taking an assistantship in Raymond Pearls laboratory where she worked with rats and Drosophila to earn money for tuition After false starts with pit vipers and squirrels she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the pronephros in fish She earned a masters degree in zoology in June 1932 She had intended to continue for a doctorate but in 1934 Carson was forced to leave Johns Hopkins to search for a full time teaching position to help support her family In 1935 her father died suddenly leaving Carson to care for her aging mother and making the financial situation even more critical At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker she settled for a temporary position with the US Bureau of Fisheries writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled Romance Under the Waters The series of fifty two seven minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and in the work of the bureaua task the several writers before Carson had not managed Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the Chesapeake Bay based on her research for the series to local newspapers and magazines

Carsons supervisor pleased with the success of the radio series asked her to write the introduction to a public brochure about the fisheries bureau he also worked to secure her the first full time position that became available Sitting for the civil service exam she outscored all other applicants and in 1936 became only the second woman to be hired by the Bureau of Fisheries for a full time professional position as a junior aquatic biologist

Heterochrony is any change in the timing of development in an animal or plant It is a key concept in developmental biology and evolution introduced by Ernst Haeckel in 1875 It applies to the time a trait appears in the growth of an organism or to the timing of gene expression in developmentp203

Its importance in biology is to explain the way closely related animals may come to have quite large differences in shape and size whilst nevetheless having a rather similar genome The main components are the time a process starts and stops in development and the rate at which the process works 

In his book Embryos and evolution Gavin de Beer stressed the importance of heterochrony and especially paedomorphosis in evolution Changes to the genes which control timing in development can produce quite striking changes in the adult de Beer also conceived the idea of clandestine evolution which helped to explain the sudden changes in the fossil record which were apparently at odds with Darwins gradual theory of evolution If a novelty were to evolve gradually in an animals juvenile form then its development would not appear in the fossil record at all Then if the species were to undergo neoteny the feature would appear suddenly in the fossil record despite having evolved gradually Stephen Jay Gould commented on this book

Sir Gavin Rylands de Beer FRS was a British evolutionary embryologist He was Director of the London Natural History Museum President of the Linnean Society and received the Royal Societys Darwin Medal for his studies on evolution

In the First World War he served in the Grenadier Guards Later he taught at Oxford University zoology department In 1938 he was made Reader in Embryology at University College London During the Second World War de Beer again served with the Grenadier Guards reaching the rank of temporary lieutenant colonel He worked in military intelligence propaganda and psychological warfare Also during the war in 1940 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society

In 1945 de Beer became Professor of Zoology and was from 1946 to 1949 President of the Linnean Society Then he was Director of the British Museum from 1950 until his retirement in 1960 He was knighted in 1954 and awarded the Darwin Medal of the Royal Society in 1957

de Beer wrote 25 books of which these are still noteworthy

In 1989 Selena Y Los Dinos signed with CAPITOLEMI Latin to begin recording her debut album with them Before recording the album Selena recorded three unreleased demo tracks Where Did The Feeling Go Is It The Beat and Only Love to show record executives at CAPITOLEMI that she had crossover potential The company later denied the offerings and instead told Selena that she needed a larger fan base Selena then began recording the why she had when she was in the Tejano music market The song My Love was written by Selena and samples from contemporary pop influences Other songs such as Sukiyaki mame Quireme and the cumbia Besitos played a pivotal role in how Selena mixed rhythm and sound which became her trademark Also this was the first album to use the Selena logo to help draw focus on Selena though they remained under the Selena Y Los Dinos name Though originally released on LP and cassette this album would be the first to be released on Compact Disc

The 20 Years Of Music edition for the Selena album was released in 2002 as part of a nine disc set of Selenas main studio albums with EMI Latin The exectuive producer was Jorge A Pino The re issue producer was Guillermo J Page For the Spoken Liner Notes the Producer was Selenas sister Suzette Quitanilla and was recorded at Q Zone Studios in Corpus Christi Texas Brian Red Moore recorded the sessions The art direction was done by Lisette Lorenzo and the art and design were done by Lisy in Grafika Miami Florida The re mastering was done by Miami Tape Inc All photographs were taken by Ramon Hernandez and Hernando Abilez

The songs My Love and Sukiyaki were recorded and mixed at Sunrise Studios in Houston Texas by Manny Guerra

Ven Conmigo was the third album released by rising Latina superstar Selena on November 12 1990 for the CAPITOLEMI Latin label This album was the first to market Selena as a solo artist no longer identifying her albums with Selena Y Los Dinos though they were still very much a part of the mix The album itself sold 50000 units in America and was certified Gold by the RIAA Another 242802 copies were sold on Amazoncom verifed from their sellers rank

The group re recorded La Tracalera a cover version of a song by the original Dinos as well as Aunque No Salga El Sol which they had originally recorded in 1984 The song Baila Esta Cumbia was an instant hit in the US and later crossed over to Mexico Ven Conmigo was the groups first Gold album

The village of Nadap lies on the eastern slopes of Velencei Hills it is a well oriented self contained settlement with charming rural atmosphere It is only two kilometers both from the recreation facilities of Lake Velencei and from the M7 motorway therefore it is easily accessible from Budapest and from Szkesfehrvr too Each house in the settlement has a great panorama

The settlements around Lake Velencei are overwhelmed with the spirit of Mihly Vrsmarty Nadap is not different either the poet was baptised in the village on 3 December 1800 The baptistery is still in the church today The inhabitants of the village expressed their admiration for the memory of the poet with a sculpture erected in the Millenium Park Nadap also hosts a key cartographical and architectural specialty it is the home of the etalon for measuring heights in Hungary called Nadapi szintezsi sjegy

Pzmnd is located in the easternmost part of Velencei Hills at the foot of Zsid Hill

Archaeological artefacts prove that the village was already been populated the in Iron Age The name of the village comes from the period when the State was founded the area was probably awarded as a gift to Knight Pzmny to function as a summer residence Little is known about the history of the settlement in the Middle Ages One thing is sure when the Turks were expelled from Hungary the fleeing troops slaughtered the families living here destroyed the Romanesque church and set the village on fire At the beginning of the 18th century Tt people were settled in the area the village was even called Tt Pzmnd for some time The inhabitants of the village declared themselves Hungarians already in the 19th century but their Slovakian roots are still noticeable in their conventions

He was an electrical engineer one of the few chess masters who achieved distinction in another career while playing top class competitive chess 

Botvinnik was the first world class player to develop within the Soviet Union This put him under some political pressure but also gave him considerable influence within Soviet chess He played a major role in the design of the World Chess Championship system after World War II After his retirement as a player he coached a few select pupils They included three future World Champions Anatoly Karpov Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik

Mikhail Moiseyevich Botvinnik was born near St Petersburg into a Jewish family His father was a dental technician and a cantor in the local synagogue His mother was a dentist which allowed the family to live outside the Pale of Settlement to which most Jews in Russia were restricted at the time As a result Mikhail Botvinnik grew up in Saint Petersburgs Nevsky Prospekt 

His father forbade the speaking of Yiddish at home and Mikhail and his older brother Issy attended Soviet schools Mikhail Botvinnik later said I am a Jew by blood Russian by culture Soviet by upbringingp178 

To test the strength of Soviet chess masters Nikolai Krylenko organized the Moscow 1925 chess tournament On a rest day during the event world champion Jos Ral Capablanca gave a simultaneous exhibition in Leningrad Botvinnik was selected as one of his opponents and won their game 

Botvinnik was admitted in 1928 to Leningrad Universitys Mathematics Department In January 1929 he played for Leningrad in the student team chess championship against Moscow Leningrad won and the team manager got Botvinnik a transfer to the Polytechnics Electromechanical Department

His early progress was fairly rapid He won the Leningrad Masters tournament in 1930 with 68 following this up the next year by winning the Championship of Leningrad by 2 points over former Soviet champion Peter Romanovsky

In 1931 at the age of 20 Botvinnik won his first Soviet Championship in Moscow scoring 13 out of 17 In late summer 1931 he graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering In 1933 he repeated his Soviet Championship win in his home city of Leningrad with 1419 

Soon afterwards Ilyin Genevsky one of the older masters and a member of the Soviet embassy in Prague arranged a match between Salo Flohr and Botvinnik Botvinnik fell two games behind by the end of the first six played in Moscow However aided by his old friend Viacheslav Ragozin and coach Abram Model he levelled the score in Leningrad and the match was drawn When describing the post match party Botvinnik wrote that at the time he danced the foxtrot and charleston to a professional standard 

In his first tournament outside the USSR the Hastings International Chess Congress 193435 Botvinnik achieved only a tie for 5th 6th places with 59 He wrote that in London after the tournament Emanuel Lasker said his arrival only two hours before the first round began was a serious mistake and that he should have allowed ten days for acclimatization Botvinnik wrote that he did not make this mistake again 

Botvinnik came first equal with Flohr point ahead of Lasker and one point ahead of Jos Ral Capablanca in Moscows second International Tournament held in 1935 After consulting Capablanca and Lasker Krylenko proposed to award Botvinnik the title grandmaster but Botvinnik objected that titles were not the point However he accepted a free car and a 67 increase in his postgraduate study grant both provided by the Peoples Commissariat of Heavy Industry 

An even stronger double round tournament was played in Moscow in June 1936 and Botvinnik finished second one point behind Capablanca and 2 ahead of Flohr 

In early winter 1936 Botvinnik was invited to play in a tournament at Nottingham England Krylenko authorized his participation and although his Soviet rivals forecast disaster for him he scored an undefeated shared first place with Capablanca point ahead of the then World Champion Max Euwe and rising American stars Reuben Fine and Samuel Reshevsky and 1 point ahead of ex champion Alexander Alekhine This was the first tournament victory by a Soviet master outside his own country When the result reached Russia Krylenko drafted a letter to be sent in Botvinniks name to Stalin On returning to Russia Botvinnik discovered he had been awarded the Mark of Honour Later in 1937 Botvinnik drew a match of thirteen games against Grigory Levenfish 

Botvinnik won further Soviet Championship titles in 1939 1944 1945 and 1952 bringing his total to six  a record he shares with Mikhail Tal In 1945 he dominated the tournament scoring 1517 in 1952 he tied with Mark Taimanov and won the play off match

Botvinnik influenced the design of the system which would be used for World Championship competition from 1948 to 1963 Viktor Baturinsky wrote Now came Botvinniks turn to defend his title in accordance with the new qualifying system which he himself had outlined in 1946 

On the basis of his strong results during and just after World War II Botvinnik was one of five players to contest the World Chess Championship 1948 which was held at The Hague and Moscow He won the tournament convincingly with a score of 1420 three points clear becoming the sixth World Champion Botvinnik then held the title with two brief interruptions for the next fifteen years during which he played seven world championship matches 

Botvinnik played no formal competitive games after winning the 1948 match tournament until he defended his title In 1951 he drew with David Bronstein over 24 games in Moscow 5 14 5 keeping the world title He struggled to draw this match with Bronstein and had weak tournament results Botvinnik did not play in the Soviet team that won the 1952 Chess Olympiad in Helsinki the players voted for the line up and placed Botvinnik on second board with Keres on top board Botvinnik protested and refused to play Keres playing record from 1950 to early 1952 had been outstanding

In 1954 he drew with Vasily Smyslov over 24 games at Moscow 7 10 7 again retaining the title In 1957 he lost to Smyslov by 912 in Moscow but the rules then in force allowed him a rematch without having to go through the Candidates Tournament and in 1958 he won the rematch in Moscow Smyslov said his health was poor during the return match In 1960 Botvinnik was convincingly beaten 8 12 at Moscow by Tal now 23 years old but again exercised his right to a rematch in 1961 and won by 138 in Moscow Botvinniks play was better than in the 1960 match mainly due to thorough preparation Botvinnik changed his style in the rematch avoiding the tactical complications in which Tal excelled and aiming for closed positions and endgames where Tals technique was not outstanding Also Tals health was variable Finally in 1963 he lost the title to Tigran Petrosian by 9 12 in Moscow FIDE had by then changed the rules and he was not allowed a rematch The rematch rule had been nicknamed the Botvinnik rule because he twice benefited from it

In 1970 Botvinnik retired from competitive chess and he worked on chess playing software There was no significant result from this but his work as a coach to top young players bore fruit

Hate speech is communicating in a way that is meant to offend and hurt somebody It is usually based on a factor such as somebodys race gender ethnic group sexual orientation gender identity or religion Some places have laws that make it illegal to use hate speech Countries such as Canada France and Germany have stricter laws against hate speech than the United States where hate speech is usually legal because its Constitution says that people have freedom of speech But hate speech is a inciting of discrimination and sometimes a cause of bullying or hate crime and Article 7 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms that all are protected from such a inciting

Earthquake engineering is the study of the behavior of building structures subject to earthquake impacts It is a subset of civil engineering

The main goals of earthquake engineering are 

A properly engineered structure does not necessarily have to be extremely strong or expensive 

The most powerful and affordable tools of earthquake engineering are vibration control technologies and in particular base isolation

To test seismic performance of a building structure with experiments it is may be put on a shake table that behaves like the earth shaking The earliest shake table experiments were performed more than a century ago 

Tsunami or a chain of fast moving waves in the ocean caused mostly by powerful earthquakes is a very serious challenge for peoples safety and for tsunami protection of buildings and civil infrastructure Those waves can flood coastal areas destroy houses and even swipe away whole towns

Though tsunami can not be prevented there are warning systems developed recently which warn the population before the big waves reach the land to let them enough time to rush to safety

Numerical weather prediction is the way weather forecasts are made This is done using computer models of the atmosphere Such models describe the current weather conditions and how they change over time using equations Using the current weather conditions the equations can be solved or approximated to tell what the weather will be like in the near future The relevant physical parameters such as pressure temperature the direction and the sped of the wind are taken to be functions of time These are modelled with a system of partial differential equations This is a dynamic system that is solved numerically Most of these equations are implemented using FORTRAN The equations are approximated Since this takes a lot of computing power or time supercomputers are used for this task most of the time 

The atmosphere is modelled as a fluid The basic idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time The equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics can then be used to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future

The results are usually too inaccurate to be used for predicting the weather at any place For this reason meteorologists check the values and compare them to historical data In other words they use the data to help produce the weather forecast

Model Output Statistics is a statistical model that was developed in the 1960s and 1970s It uses regression analysis for a fully automated forecast With it historical data is analysed automatically One of its applications is called Direct Model Output MOS uses both historical data and statistical modeling Predictions beyond about six hours are unreliable 

Another well known model is called Global Forecast System which is run by the US weather service NOAA It gives a forecast four times a day Since the information is free the GFS is often used especially by smaller weather stations

The atmosphere is a chaotic system A small change of the input values does not necessarily lead to a small change of the output This is due to the equations of fluid dynamics that are involved These equations involved are solved or approximated once with the parameters that were observed This is done several times more with parameters that are based on the observed values but which have been changed slightly Because the computing power is limited the resolution of such a model is more coarse Once all the calculations are finished they are compared to one another Calculated results that are similar indicate that the prognosis is relatively good In some cases this means that it is possible to accurately predict the weather for a time of about ten days in other cases a prediction over even a few days may be difficult

Paul Bunyan is a fictional giant lumberjack James MacGillivray wrote about Bunyan in 1910 which is the earliest writing about Bunyan that we know about A few years later in 1916 William Laughead was writing an advertisement and decided to use Bunyan in what he was writing and decided to make him a giant 

James Stevens wrote a book called Paul Bunyan in 1925 This book said that French Canadians people made up the Paul Bunyan stories during the Papineau Rebellion of 1837 when they were fighting against England This would explain why Paul Bunyans last name is Bunyan because Bunyan sounds like the French Canadian slang word Bonyenne which is something that they might say when they are surprised like how people who speak English might say Good Grief or My Goodness People told other people stories about Bunyan and the stories would change a little bit as they spread from person to person Often Paul Bunyan is shown in pictures with a giant blue ox named Babe Historians think that Babe was not created until the 20th century for advertising

According to legend when Bunyan was born it took three storks to carry him When he became older he broke every window in the house when he clapped or laughed When he was seven months old he sawed the legs off his parents bed in the middle of the night Paul and his friend Babe the Blue Ox dug the Grand Canyon when Paul was carrying his axe and dragging it behind him Babe Bunyans friend was a large and very strong animal 

Many different towns say that they are the home of Bunyan Some of these towns are in Minnesota Michigan and Wisconsin although there are towns in other states too

In the town of Kelliher Minnesota there is a park called Paul Bunyan Memorial Park where there is a grave site that says that Paul Bunyan is buried there

The List of Japanese era names is a traditional calendar system which began during the reign of Emperor Ktoku in the 7th century This calendar has been in use in Japan since the beginning of the 8th century

The historical Japanese calendar system defines and parses time in terms of ordinal numbers

Each new lit year name was usually started soon after the beginning of the reign of a new emperor Era names were also changed due to other events

The first day of the gannen started whenever the emperor decided This first year continued until the next lunar new year which is understood to be the start of the nengs second year 

To change a Japanese year to a Western or Gregorian calendar year find the first year of the neng When found subtract 1 and add the number of the Japanese year For example the 23rd year of the Shwa era would be 1948

Base isolation is a collection of a buildings units resting on its foundation to provide separation of the building from shaking ground thus improving seismic performance

Base isolation system consists of isolation units with or without isolation components where

1 Isolation units are the basic elements of base isolation system which provide the mentioned separation effect to a building structure

2 Isolation components are the connections between isolation units and other parts of the building having no separation effect of their own

In earthquake engineering vibration control is a set of technical means for decreasing seismic loads and improving seismic performance of building structures

All vibration control devices may be classified as passive active or hybrid The first kind is the simplest one and therefore widespread Passive control devices represent different types of base isolators and seismic dampers

Base isolators restrict penetration of potentially damaging seismic waves into a building structure while dampers decrease destructive effect of those waves

The daughter of a Czech father and British mother Vera Menchik was born in Moscow In the aftermath of World War I and the Russian Revolution her family moved to England in 1921 Her father taught her chess when she was nine and in the year of her arrival in England at the age of fifteen she won the British girls championship The following year she became a pupil of Gza Marczy the leading Hungarian grandmaster at the time 

She won the first Womens World Championship in 1927 and successfully defended her title six times in every other championship in her lifetime and only lost one game while winning 78 and drawing four games These were all play all tournaments mostly run alonside Chess Olympiads London 1927 Hamburg 1930 Prague 1931 Folkestone 1933 Warsaw 1935  Stockholm 1937 Buenos Aires 1939

In addition Menchik won two matches against her rival Sonja Graf for the Womens World Champion title at Rotterdam 1934 and at Semmering 1937

Starting in 1929 she participated in a number of Hastings international tournaments When the same year she entered the tournament in Carlsbad Viennese master Albert Becker ridiculed her entry by suggesting that any player whom Menchik defeated in tournament play should be granted membership into the Vera Menchik Club In the tournament Becker himself became the first member of the club In addition to Becker the Vera Menchik Club eventually included grandmasters such as Max Euwe Mir Sultan Khan Samuel Reshevsky Friedrich Smisch Lajos Steiner and virtually every leading British player of the day

Menchiks greatest success at international tournaments was at Ramsgate 1929 when she finished tied for second with Akiba Rubinstein just half a point behind former World Champion Jos Ral Capablanca and ahead of her teacher Gza Marczy In 1934 she finished third at Maribor ahead of Rudolph Spielmann and Milan Vidmar In 1942 she won a match against international master Jacques Mieses 

Vera was a professional player From the late 1920s she was the manager and house professional of the Empire Chess Club which was situated on the top floor of Whiteleys store in Queensway West London In 1939 she was appointed to the new National Chess Centrep256 

In 1937 at the age of 31 Vera Menchik married RHS Stevenson 28 years her senior who was a leading chess organiser and patron Vera Menchiks younger sister Olga was also a tournament chess player In 1944 in World War II with 38 year old Vera still womens world champion the two sisters and their mother were killed by a V 1 rocket which destroyed their home

The history of chess spans some 1500 years The game originated in northern India in the 6th century AD and spread to Persia When the Arabs conquered Persia chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently through the Moorish conquest of Spain spread to Southern Europe 

The precursors of chess originated in northern India during the Gupta empire where its early form in the 6th century was known as Chaturanga This translates as the four divisions meaning infantry cavalry elephantry and chariotry represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn knight bishop and rook respectivelyp173 p74 

In Sassanid Persia around 600 the name became Chatrang and the rules were developed further and players started calling Shh when threatening the opponents king and Shh mt when the king could not escape from attack These exclamations persisted in chess as it traveled to other lands The following table provides a glimpse of the changes in the names and character of chess pieces as they passed from one culture to another from India through Persia to Europep221

The game was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names in Arabic mt or mta means died is dead In Arabic the game became Shatranj In all other languages the name of the game is derived either from shatranj or from shah

The game reached Western Europe and Russia by at least three routes the earliest being in the 9th century By the year 1000 it had spread throughout Europe Introduced into the Iberian Peninsula by the Moors in the 10th century it was described in a famous 13th century manuscript covering shatranj backgammon and dice named the Libro de los juegos

Buddhist pilgrims Silk Road traders and others carried it to the Far East where it was transformed into a game often played on the intersection of the lines of the board rather than within the squares Chinese chess and Shogi are the most important of the oriental chess variants However it was the changes made in medieval Europe which led to our modern gamep71

The game of chess is really two games There is the original Indo Arabic game and there is the modern game usually called international chess The transition between the two happened during the change from the medieval world to the modern world in the Europe of the later 15th century In fact the new game of chess was one of the early topics chosen for the new technology of printing

The game could be won by 1 Mating the king 2 By giving stalemate 3 By capturing all the opponents pieces This kept down the number of draws

In Europe some of the pieces got new names

About 500 years after chess first reached Europe after some smaller experiments there were big changes in the way the pieces moved The effect was to make the start of the game run faster and get the opposing pieces in contact sooner The changes were

These changes made most of the older chess culture obsolete The slow development in the openings was replaced by gambits and rapid attacks The relative values of the pieces are changedp228 The game can now only be won by mate or resignation by one of the players Originally this was not seen as a problem but as technique improved so did the number of draws This became a matter for discussion in the early 20th century The limited number of ways to win changed what players needed to win in the endgame many endgames which could be won with the old rules now were drawn

The first printed work on chess to survive to the present day is Luis de Lucenas Arte de axedres printed in Salamanca Spain It can be dated to 1496 or 1497p73 It presents a number of chess problems some of which are in the old rules some in the new rules This suggests that the transition is not quite complete and some readers might not know about the new rules By 1512 when Damiano published his Questo libro e da imparare giocare a scachi in Rome it only included problems with the new rules and does not mention the medieval game The same applies to the Gottingen manuscript probably written in Spain or Portugal Though it has been claimed to be earlier its content suggests it was not written before 1500p74 England and Germany received the reformed game by 1530 After that the old game was effectively dead at any rate in Europe A version of the old game survived in India until recently

Modern chess theory was slow in developing After the new moves of the pieces players spent their time playing gambits and trying to mate each other The games of Gioacchino Greco clearly show this The first ideas as to how to win indirectly positionally started with Philidor Modern chess has a lot of indirect manoevering of a kind the old Arabic players would have understood They could not attack directly because their Alfil and Firzn had such limited moves

One interesting fact is that the Arabs divided their game into the same three stages which we do today opening middlegame and endgamep234

At the start of a game the Arabic masters took a number of moves before the pieces were in contact with the other side

The table based roughly on square control suggests the modern game deploys about 20 more force on the board than the older game However this understates the case since the table does not allow for castling nor the initial optional double move of the pawn Also the pawn promotion to the new queen is hugely significant when it takes place No exact value can be placed on these elements but perhaps the modern game makes use of up to a third more force than in the original game

Single pieces found in archaeology are seldom taken as chessmen they are much more likely to be general art objects Groups of small objects are more likely chessmen if there are of more than two types Many board games have used two kinds of pieces but only chess uses six different kinds A dig might not turn up all six forms but more than two is indicative of chess If the forms have characteristic chess figures this is even more convincing

The evidence from archaeology comes mostly from the discovery of early chess sets and also from rock art carvings and paintings on rock 

The earliest chessmen found are the Afrosiab collection In 1977 the Uzbekistan Academy of Archaeology conducted a dig at Afrosiab near Samarkandp15p58 Samarkand is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world and at times it has been one of the greatest cities of Central Asia Samarkand is on the trade route between China and the Mediterranean and so it is a logical place for a trader to store some of his precious goods

The Afrosiab finds include seven chess pieces They are heavily worn but they include two foot soldiers with shields and short swords a war elephant with chain armour and a rider in full battle dress a visier with two horses with armed rider two mounted riders with sword and shield and the Shah on a three horse chariot holding a mace like symbol of power That is five out of the six types of piece and completely convincing as a chess set The rukh is also known it features a three horse chariot with two men one driving and the other armed with sword and shieldp6162 

This group is dated to the 7th8th centuries and probably come from the end of the Sassanid Empire just before the Arabic conquest They are representational meaning they are small carvings of war men and equipment Later Arabic sets became abstract shapes in accordance with their religious teaching

Wolfgang Wagner was a German opera director He was the grandson of the opera composer Richard Wagner and great grandson of the composer Franz Liszt For 42 years he was director of the Bayreuth Festival which was created by Richard Wagner for the performances of his operas At first he was director together with his brother Wieland After Wieland died he continued to be director until he retired in 2008 He tried to get rid of the festivals Nazi past and put on productions which were very symbolic using lighting effects instead of complicated scenery and heavy costumes

Wagner was born in Bayreuth His mother Winifred Wagner was English She married Richard Wagners son Siegfried who was much older than she was Although Siegfried was gay they had two sons and two daughters

When Siegfried died in 1930 Winifred took over the running of the festival She was friends with Adolf Hitler who often came to the performances Hitler became a family friend The children called him Uncle Adolf or Uncle Wolf When World War II started Wieland did not have to fight in the army because Hitler said he was too important for German culture However Wolfgang had to fight and he was wounded in Poland but got better He started to produce operas in Berlin Hitler liked him but he never joined the Nazi party

During the war a lot of Bayreuth buildings were damaged but not the theatre The Americans used it for religious services After the war Winifred was not allowed to run the opera house because of her Nazi past but Wieland became director and Wolfgang looked after the money The two brothers started the festival again in 1951 They formed the orchestra again and invited Hans Knappertsbusch and Herbert von Karajan to conduct They deliberately avoided using lots of scenery and made use of symbolic ideas especially lighting

When Wieland died in 1966 Wolfgang was the only director He continued the modern ideas of his brother using very simple staging techniques The production of Wagners Ring Cycle in 1976 by the opera director Patrice Chreau was particularly important Many people loved it others disagreed with it The production of the Ring Cycle in 1983 by Peter Hall conducted by Georg Solti celebrated the 100th birthday of Richard Wagner People argued about this production too Since then many famous people have visited the festival including the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the German President Horst Khler In 1982 Grace Bumbry was the first black person to sing at the festival she sang the part of Venus in Tannhuser Some of the audience thought this was shocking but she sang so beautifully that everyone applauded for 30 minutes She had to take 42 curtain calls

Wolfgang married twice His first wife was Ellen Drexel He had two children by this marriage He argued with them His son did not like the familys past Nazi connections and the daughter Eva argued about the control of the festival Wolfgang later married Gudrun Mack with whom he had a daughter Katharina Eva and Katharina now run the festival

Wolfgang died aged 90 in Bayreuth in 2010

The Kojiki and Nihon Shoki record that Ank was the second son of Emperor Ingy 

Some accounts report that Ank murdered his own father

Very little is known about the events of Anks life and reign Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch Emperor Kimmei 

It is believed that Ank was murdered in the third year of his reign

This emperors official name after his death was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Ank 

According to the Imperial Household Agency the emperors final resting place is in an earthen tumulus This emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine which is associated with the burial mound

Building code is a set of rules on a building design construction testing inspections and maintenance to protect public health safety and welfare Building codes are usually created or enforced by the government who may inspect buildings to make sure they follow the rules 

A building code may provide rules for many different things The building may need to follow rules about providing parking or affecting traffic There will be rules about making the building safe during disasters such as fires earthquakes and tornadoes 

The rules used on a specific building may be very different depending on where the building is and what it is used for For example a house will have extra rules about making sure people can live there while a hotel will have extra rules about fire exits Many public buildings have a maximum occupancy for some rooms which is how many people may be allowed into that room at once

Any building code has either some minimum requirements for seismic loads or some seismic performance rules 

Seismic design is based on procedures meant to protect structures that may experience earthquake impact However a design which blindly follows seismic code rules does not guarantee safety against collapse or serious damage 

Supply side economics is a theory that if taxes were cut on the wealthiest people in society the wealthy would use their extra money to invest in the economy but if taxes were increased the wealthy would leave the country and invest somewhere else where the tax rates are lower People who support supply side economics believe that taxes punished productivity and if they were lowered people would produce more goods and services Many supporters of supply side economics also support things such as limited government spending low inflation and regulating the economy less One supporter of supply side economics was Karl Marx

Economist Arthur Laffer supported supply side economics with a theory called a Laffer Curve The theory stated that government will get no money if taxes were too high nobody would pay them and that the government would not get enough money if taxes were too low The theory also stated that if taxes were too high the economy would be less productive and it would give the government less money and that if taxes were low the economy would be productive and the government would get more money 

Supply side economics was used while Ronald Reagan was president during the 1980s Income taxes on the wealthiest Americans were cut from 70 to 50 to 28 during his two terms Also capital gains taxes were cut Supporters of supply side economics mention that that those tax cuts have resulted in economic recovery during the 1980s and the strong economic boom in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century

Critics of supply side economics call it trickle down economics and they have also called it voodoo economics Many critics say that supply side economic policies are bad because it results in a bigger gap between the rich and the poor They also criticize that the reduction in taxes results in cutting programs for the poor people who need it Other critics point out that large supply cuts tax cuts in combination with increases on military spending has resulted in the government being in a large amount of debt

If they dont read about these things here they no doubt can look on the regular Wikipedia or elsewhere on the Internet While my personal preference is that children learn about the facts of life from their parents I know not all children will and I think its far better that they read about it in a clinical academic setting than start Googling and ending up any number of other places on the Internet I might add too that the goal of Wikipedia is to provide information it is not up to us what others do with that information Kansan 0252 25 March 2010

UserPurplebackpack89 has raised the suggestion of a censorship warning template and I think that this is a good idea worthy of branching off into a new discussion Twinkle already has a built in warning for removal of content or templates but that is more for deleting an entire article randomly I also suggest that we write a page that states that Wikipedia is not censored and link to that page within the warning Kansan 1729 27 March 2010

Seismic design rests on authorized engineering procedures principles and criteria meant to design or retrofit structures subject to earthquake exposure Those criteria are consistent just with the contemporary state of the knowledge about building structures Therefore the building design which blindly follows some seismic code regulations does not guarantee safety against collapse or serious damage 

The price of poor seismic design may be enormous Nevertheless seismic design has always been a trial and error process no matter it was based upon physical laws or empirical knowledge

Seismic performance is an execution of a building structures ability to sustain its due functions such as safety and serviceability at and after a particular earthquake A structure is normally considered safe if it does not endanger the lives and wellbeing of those in or around it by partially or completely collapsing A structure may be considered serviceable if it is able to fulfill its operational functions for which it was designedFileUN headquarters Haiti after 2010 earthquakejpgthumbThe UN headquarters in Haiti after the earthquake of 2010 

Ancient builders believed that earthquakes were a result of wrath of gods and therefore could not be resisted by humans 

Nowadays the peoples attitude has changed dramatically though seismic loads sometimes exceed ability of a structure to resist them without being broken partially or completely 

Philidor was probably the best chessplayer of his time and a notable composer of light operatic music He was born into a family of musicians who served at the French court He became the author of a book on chess which influenced players for many yearsp303p15

His family name had once been Duncan until they came from Scotland to Brittany Danican was then their family name Then after their appointment to the court of King Louis XIII in the 17th century they adopted the name Philidor as a tribute to an Italian court musician called Filidori Young Philidor was trained in music from an early age and learnt chess from musicians in intervals between musical numbers He turned out to be equally good at both activities though initially the music came first

Philidor took chess lessons from the leading French master of the time du Kermeur Sire de Lgall After three years he was on equal terms In 1746 he found himself in Rotterdam without money after a tour had ended in the death of a young girl harpsichord player He started to play chess for money and came to London in 1747 to play a match against the strongest English player whom he beat Thus started his new life He played chess in London and wrote light operatic scores for the Comdie Franaise in Paris

Philidor started playing regularly about 1740 at the Parisian Caf de la Rgence It was there that he played with a friend from New England Mr Benjamin Franklin 

At 21 Philidor met the Syrian Philip Stamma of Aleppo who was a translator and chess player of note Philidor won by 81 At 29 he defeated his tutor Lgall in a match Unfortunately none of these games survive though we do have a number of games from his later career In 1744 as a teenager he could play two games of chess simultaneously blindfold and in Berlin he played three games withought sight of the board He gave these exhibitions many times This was thought to be a marvel though it had been done before by an Italian priest Saccherip45 

In 1749 he published a book on chess which was to make his name The first edition in French included a subscription list of prosperous sponsors such as the Earl of Sandwich and the Duke of Cumberland An edition in English Chess analysed came out in 1750 He revised and extended the book twice in 1777 and 1790

Over the years the book was a steady success By 1871 it had gone through about 70 editions and had been translated into English German Russian and Italian Eventually it went through over a hundred editions in ten languagesp17 

As one commentator said

Philidors motto Les pions sont de lme du jeu is a saying which is still taught to young players today It sums up the idea that the pawn skeleton gives the game its long term structure and influences how a game proceeds

Philidors book was the first that gave detailed annotations on how to play the middlegame that presented chess strategy as a whole and that presented the concepts of the blockade prophylaxis positional sacrifice and mobility of the pawn formation

Philidor also studied chess endgames and the book gives generally accurate information about them An important chess endgame position that he wrote about is called the Philidor position

He gave his name to one of the basic chess openings Philidors defence 

Philidor was now received into fashionable society in France and England He took his mistress with him to Prussia then back to England Later in 1760 he married a singer and had seven childrenp304 Philidor played chess at the Caf de la Rgence in Paris and at the Salopian Coffee house and at Parsloes chess club in London

Philidors contemporaries had some difficulty believing he could be so good at two such different arts but he was His work on comic opera excelled He wrote 25 such works four with collaborators His Tom Jones was regarded as the finest work in the theatre His Ernelinda Princess of Norway so pleased Louis XV that he gave Philidor a pension of 25 louis dor from his own pursep304 The English however ignored his music and after 1892 he never returned home The French Revolution made his connection with royalty a danger

Philidor died in 1795 and the Comdie Franaise held a benefit concert for his widow

Voodoo economics is a negative term which critics use to criticize supply side economics

The term origininated from George HW Bush who criticized Ronald Reagans plan for the economy during the Republican Party presidential primaries 1980 Reagans attitude towards the Federal Government Budget was to drastically reduce taxes  primarily for the wealthy  while greatly increasing spending  primarily for the military Bush Sr and others recognized that this could not possibly produce a balanced budget and would result in great national debt Therefore George Bush Sr labeled Reagans monetary policy as Voodoo economics

Reagan was an adherent to a policy known as supply side economics which argues that economic growth can be most effectively created using incentives for people to produce goods and services such as adjusting income tax and capital gains tax rates Accordingly Reagan promised an economic revival that would affect all sectors of the population He said that cutting tax rates would actually increase tax revenues because the lower rates would cause people to work harder as they would be able to keep more of their money Reagan also called for a drastic cut in big government programs and pledged to deliver a balanced budget for the first time since 1969 In the primaries Bush famously called Reagans economic policy voodoo economics because it promised to lower taxes and increase revenues at the same time

Of course Reagan was elected president in 1980 with George Bush Sr as his Vice President In his eight years as President Reagan would fulfill his campaign promises of lowering taxes  primarily on the wealthy  and greatly increasing spending  primarily on the military Like Bush Sr had recognized before Reagan captured the White House this would lead to large Federal Budget deficits In 1989 when George Bush Sr became the 41st US President this great national debtbudget deficit had to be dealt with Even though Bush Sr famously pledged during the 1988 Presidential Election Read my lips no new taxes after gaining the White House he was forced to renege on that pledge and raise taxes This is one of the reasons that led to Bush Sr not winning reelection in 1992    

A silent majority is a large group of people who support something but choose not to express their opinions publicly

This term was made popular by US President Richard Nixon in a speech he gave on November 3 1969 about the Vietnam War Nixon said And so tonight to you the great silent majority of my fellow Americans I ask for your support The opposite of the silent majority were a noisy minority a small group of people who Nixon said tried to get their way by holding demonstrations in the streets

During WWII many German citizens claimed they had no idea of what was happening with the concentration camps However many citizens felt opposed but did not stand up and fight them

In the physical sciences mass and weight are different Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in the body while weight is a measure of the force on the object caused by a gravitational field 

This means the mass of an object will remain at wherever it is on the earths surface but if it is moved from the equator to the North Pole its weight will grow by 05 because of the increase in the earths gravitational field

Mass to the general means of how heavy something is However mass is really an inertial property that is the tendency of an object to remain at constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside force According to Newtons second law of motion as expressed in the formula an object with a mass m of one kilogram will accelerate a at one meter per second per second when acted upon by a force F of one newton

By the age of twenty two he was already one of the strongest grandmasters During the 1920s he was one of the hypermoderns and won many tournaments In 1927 he became World Champion by beating Capablanca The match of 34 games was the longest world championship match held until 1985

In the early 1930s Alekhine dominated tournament play and won top class tournaments by large margins He also played first board for France in four Chess Olympiads winning prizes in each His tournament record became less good from the mid 1930s onwards alcoholism is often blamed for this Although Alekhine offered Capablanca a rematch on the same terms that Capablanca had set for him negotiations dragged on for years It became clear that Alekhine would never let the match take place Meanwhile he defended his title with ease against Bogolyubov in 1929 and 1934 

Alekhine was defeated by Euwe in 1935 but regained his crown in the 1937 rematch His tournament record was now uneven and rising stars threatened his title Negotiations for a title match were halted by the start of World War II in 1939

Alekhine was known for his attacking style he was good at turning an initiative into a win He was the first world champion to work hard on opening theory Alekhine was the first to be a full time dedicated professional of the modern type He said he spent eight hours a day studying the game and produced many innovations in chess openings 

Alekhine was declared an Enemy of the Soviet Union after making anti Bolshevik statements in 1927 However after his death the Soviet chess leaders called him one of the founders of the Soviet School of Chess He is still highly regarded as a chess writer His finest works were his collections of his own games which influenced many players

Alekhine was a brilliant player with a poor character Not everyone liked his personal character but all admired his chess geniusp7 That he sometimes lied and was often half drunk is mentioned by all his biographers He married a Russian baroness in 1920 which legitimised their seven year old daughter The following year he married a Swiss woman and obtained permission to leave Russia This marriage which was probably bigamous broke up soon after Later he married twice more He settled in Paris becoming a naturalised French citizen He studied law at the Sorbonne and claimed to have got a doctorate there in 1925 he was known widely as Dr Alekhine Researchers have failed to find any trace of this in the records of the Sorbonnep69 Having at last won the world title Alekhine used every device to avoid giving Capablanca a return match He remarked to a friend Somehow the match will never take placep8 

Alekhine stayed in Nazi occupied Europe during the war where he played in tournaments organised by the Nazis Anti Semitic articles appeared under his name Although he later claimed they were forged by the Nazis the original manuscripts in his hand were found amongst his last wifes effects when she diedp309313 Whether Alekhine was personally anti semitic is not so clear He had good relationships with some Jewish chess players and his fourth wife was Jewish Negotiations with Mikhail Botvinnik for a world title match were proceeding in 1946 when Alekhine died in Portugal It is not too callous to say that he was fortunate to have died at that time Feeling was very strong in France against those who came under suspicion of collaboration with the enemyp75

Alekine wrote over twenty books on chess Some of the best known are

A smoke bomb or smoke grenade is a bomb that produces a cloud of smoke It can be used as a toy to make large clouds of colored smoke It is normally used in the military though Smoke bombs are used to hide positions and objects from sight behind a thick cloud of smoke Armies also use smoke grenades to hide soldiers from the enemy Smoke grenades can be used to mark a spot on the ground Smoke bombs can be thrown or shot They normally contain a powdered chemical that is ignited It produces a large cloud of smoke quickly Then something else starts burning keeping the smoke cloud thick

Elevated building foundation is a kind of seismic base isolation technology which is made a major part of a building superstructure It is made to protect the buildings superstructure against damage from the shaking caused by an earthquake

This goal can be met with the right building materials size and setup of EBF for the building site and local soil conditions

As a result of multiple wave reflections and diffractions as well as energy dissipation of the seismic waves as they move up through the EBF any movement of seismic wave energy into the building superstructure will be decreased which will lower seismic loads and improve seismic performance of the structure 

In other words the building does not shake as much because it is sitting on the elevated building foundation and will probably take less damage from the earthquake

Seismic load is one of the basic concepts of earthquake engineering which means application of an earthquake generated agitation to a building structure or its model It happens at contact surfaces of a structure either with the ground or with adjacent structures or with gravity waves from tsunami

Seismic loading depends primarily on

Billy Budd is an opera by Benjamin Britten It was first performed at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden London on 1 December 1951 It is based on the short novel Billy Budd by Herman Melville The libretto for the opera was written by EMForster and Eric Crozier

Britten originally wanted the part of Billy Budd to be sung by Geraint Evans but Evans found that the notes were too high for his voice so he sang a different role and the role of Billy Budd was sung by Theodor Uppman The first performance was a great success

In the original version the opera had four acts but in 1960 Britten made some changes to the opera making the story fit into two acts Not everybody agrees about which version is the better one

Famous baritones who have sung the role of Billy Budd include Thomas Allen Simon Keenlyside Richard Stilwell and Thomas Hampson There are no women in the opera at all

The story takes place on board the battleship HMS Indomitable in 1797 during the French Revolutionary Wars There is a short prologue at the beginning and an epilogue at the end during which the old captain is thinking back about the story which happened many years earlier The rest of the opera tells that story

Captain Vere an old man is thinking back on his life and his time in the navy  He thinks about what happened to Billy Budd some years earlier and he feels sad because he was not able to save him

The crew of the Indomitable are working on deck There is a new man working there He slips and bumps into an officer The novice is cruelly flogged for this At the same another crew member comes with three new young men who have been pressed into coming to work on the ship One of these three men is Billy Budd

Billy Budd is very happy at his new job He does realize how cruelly he is going to be treated The man in charge of the crew is Claggart He is the Master at Arms and he is very cruel He says he thinks Billy Budd is a fine young man although he has a stammer Billy happily says goodbye to the ship he used to work on called Rights of Man He does not see the irony in that ships name  Claggart does not like Billys attitude and tells Squeak to watch him carefully

The Novice comes back from his flogging He is in such pain that he cannot walk Billy is shocked but thinks he himself will not be treated like that so long as he obeys the ships rules

Dansker tells the new men that Captain Veres nickname is Starry Vere Billy thinks that he must be a good man and swears loyalty to him although he has not seen him yet In the four act version Captain Vere comes on deck and encourages the men to do well in battle

In his cabin Captain Vere talks with his officers about the French revolution They talk about the mutinees that have happened in the British Navy The officers say that Billy might cause trouble but Vere thinks his men are all good

When Billy finds Squeak looking through his belongings he becomes angry and his stammer gets worse He knocks Squeak to the ground Claggart seems to be on Billys side so he is not punished However Claggart wants to be evil to Billy He gives some money to the Novice and tells him he should persuade Billy to start a mutiny and that he should give Billy the money as a bribe The Novice does not dare to refuse  Billy refuses the bribe and thinks he will be rewarded but Dansker warns him that Claggart is dangerous Billy is too nave to understand what Dansker is saying  They sing a duet in which Billy sings how wonderful life is on the ship and Dansker is trying to warn Billy about Claggart Jemmy legs is down on you

Claggart begins to tell Vere that Billy could cause trouble but is interrupted when a French ship is seen The Indomitable attacks but loses sight of the enemy in the mist Claggart returns and tells Vere that Billy poses a threat of mutiny Vere does not believe him and sends for Billy so that Claggart may talk to him

Later in Veres cabin Claggart repeats the false charge in Billys presence Once again Billy begins to stammer because he is so angry Unable to speak he hits Claggart and kills him The Captain has to get the officers together They decide Billy is guilty and sentence him to be hanged Billy begs Vere to save him and the officers ask him what they should do but Vere stays silent He goes into the cabin where Billy is being held The music suggests that the captain is telling Billy about his death sentence

Dansker brings Billy a drink He tells him that the crew are willing to mutiny for his sake but Billy accepts his fate In the early morning the crew gather on deck and Billy is executed Just before he dies he praises Vere singing Starry Vere God Bless you and the rest of the crew echo his words

Vere as an old man remembers Billys burial at sea He thinks about how the young man had blessed him as he died and he realizes that this was real goodness Vere is now at peace with himself The orchestra stops playing and Veres voice is heard as the lights fade

Samarkand is a famous city It is the second largest city in Uzbekistan and the capital of Samarqand Province 

The city is on the old Silk Road between China and the West and is an Islamic centre for scholarly study In the 14th century it became the capital of the empire of Timur and is the site of his mausoleum the Gur e Amir The Bibi Khanym Mosque remains one of the citys most famous landmarks The Registan was the ancient centre of the city 

In 2001 UNESCO added the 2750 year old city to its World Heritage Site list as Samarkand Crossroads of Cultures

Samarkand is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world prospering from its location on the trade route between China and the Mediterranean At times Samarkand has been one of the greatest cities of Central Asia

Founded circa 700 BC by the Persians Samarkand has been one of the main centres of Persian civilization from its early days Alexander the Great conquered it in 329BC 

At the start of the 8th century Samarkand came under Arab control Under Abbasid rule the legend goes the secret of papermaking was obtained from two Chinese prisoners in 751 This led to the first paper mill in the Islamic world being founded in Samarkand The invention then spread to the rest of the Islamic world and from there to Europe

Samarkand was sacked by the Mongols under Genghis Khan in 1220 Some of the people survived but later Samarkand suffered at least one other Mongol sack The town took many decades to recover from these disasters In The Travels of Marco Polo where Polo records his journey along the Silk Road Samarkand is described as a a very large and splendid city He also writes about a Christian church in Samarkand which miraculously remained standing after a portion of its central supporting column was removed

In 1370 Timur the Lame or Tamerlane decided to make Samarkand the capital of his empire which extended from India to Turkey During the next 35 years he built a new city and populated it with artisans and craftsmen from all of the places he had conquered Timur gained a reputation as a patron of the arts and Samarkand grew to have a population of about 150000 

In 1499 the Uzbek Turks took control of Samarkand They moved the capital to Bukhara and Samarkand went into decline The city came under Russian rule in 1868 The Russian section of the city was built after this point largely to the west of the old city

The city later became the capital of the Samarkand Oblast of Russian Turkestan and grew in importance still further when the Trans Caspian railway reached the city in 1888 It became the capital of the Uzbek SSR in 1925 before being replaced by Tashkent in 1930

Seismic performance analysis or seismic analysis is an intellectual tool of earthquake engineering which breaks the complex topic into smaller parts to gain a better understanding of seismic performance of building and non building structures or their models 

 In general seismic analysis is based on the methods of structural dynamics For decades the most prominent instrument of seismic analysis has been the earthquake response spectrum method which also contributed to the proposed building codes concept of today 

However those response spectra are good mostly for single degree of freedom systems Numerical step by step integration applied with the charts of seismic performance seems to be a more effective method of analysis for multi degree of freedom structural systems at severe process of earthquake excitation

Japanese American internment happened during World War II when the United States government forced about 110000 Japanese Americans to leave their homes and live in internment camps These were like prisons Many of those who were sent to internment camps had been born in the United States

On December 7 1941 Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and declared war on the United States Many Americans were angry and some blamed all Japanese people for what had happened at Pearl Harbor They spread rumors that some Japanese people knew about the attack ahead of time and had helped the Japanese military The FBI and other parts of the United States government knew that these rumors were false but did not say anything

Japanese Americans began to feel that other Americans were becoming upset with them For example John Hughes a man who read the news on the radio in Los Angeles California spent about a month saying negative things about Japanese Americans There were reports of businesses that had anti Japanese signs such as a barber shop with a sign saying Free shaves for Japs and not responsible for accidents and a funeral home with a sign saying Id rather do business with a Jap than an American

In February 1942 President Franklin D Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 This order said that people who lived in some parts of the country could be taken out of those areas for any reason While the order did not use the exact words Japanese Americans people knew that those were the people who would be taken out of those areas Most of these areas were in the western United States This was where most Japanese Americans lived at that time Many were in the state of California However in the state of Hawaii hardly any Japanese Americans were interned The large number of Japanese living there would have made it almost impossible 

In order to prevent Japanese Americans from leaving these areas on their own the government stopped many of them from taking money out of their bank accounts This made it harder for them to move Japanese Americans were given only 48 hours to leave for internment camps in other states They were only allowed to carry one bag with them and could not bring radios or cameras

The internment camps were surrounded by barbed wire They were also guarded by soldiers who waited in watchtowers holding guns Some people were shot For example James Wakasa who stepped outside the barbed wire fence was shot and killed The guard who shot him said that Wakasa was trying to escape but the Japanese Americans in the camp did not believe the guard Most of the camps were many miles inland from the coast and often in rural areas Many of the camps were in the desert which was uncomfortable for many of the Japanese Americans who were not used to that type of climate This also meant that even if somebody escaped there would be nowhere for them to go In the camps people had to stand in line to eat or to go to the bathroom

One famous camp was Manzanar which was in California Many Japanese from Los Angeles and San Francisco were sent there Other camps included Poston in Arizona and Minidoka in Idaho There were a few camps outside of the western US such as Jerome in Arkansas Japanese were often crowded into small spaces such as race tracks before being sent to the camps 

By 1943 the government allowed some Japanese Americans to leave the camps to work or go to school but it would not let them return to the West Coast Some Japanese soldiers were even allowed to serve as soldiers in the US Army and many served with honor in Europe In 1944 the United States government said that it would stop putting Japanese Americans in internment camps The people who were placed in the camps were given 25 and a bus ticket home However it would take more than 40 years for the government to apologize to Japanese Americans for what had happened In 1988 the government said it was sorry and paid money to people who had been sent to internment camps

Hominid is a novel by Austrian writer Klaus Ebner The story takes place millions of years ago and tells some days in the life of a group of hominids who live in Central Africa The book was published by the Viennese publisher FZA Verlag in October 2008 

Hominid takes place several million years ago in the Central African region between rainforest and savanna The main characters are australopithecus afarenses a hominid mostly living on trees that existed before the use of tools and fire The story is told in the first person by the main character Pitar In thinking about his social and natural environment Pitar decides to lead his family to civilization Hence I decided to shed some light on the darkness to light a candle following the motto Let there be light and so on His linguistic knowledge thoughts and sayings are those of modern man including a big knowledge about history politics philosophy and literature Several comments made by Pitar about a particular object that has not been invented or developed yet add to the funniness of the scenario Pitars close friends are Carpediem who says Latin phrases and quotes the writers of Classical Antiquity and Lao who often refers to Chinese philosophy

Although it is difficult to convince the other characters to follow him Pitar manages to persuade the patriarchal leader of the clan Costello who has taken over leadership from Thorn who had died shortly before The group builds windbreaks so that they may descend more often from the trees which has a higher risk of being attacked by wild animals on the ground Costello and Re are rivals Re not only questions the leading abilities of Costello but also wants to possess Costellos females To calm down the arising quarrel Pitar tries to found a parliament in order to settle conflicts peacefully Whereas Costello thinks the parliament would be a forum in which he can strengthen his power quoting from famous speeches by Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln the other members ruin the idea because they have no discipline and feel indifferent

One of the subplots of the novel shows the love between Pitar and Maluma a female member of the group Costello pretends the group of females would be his personal harem but when Maluma falls in love with Pitar she breaks off her relationship with the leader On each day the characters discover new things On the seventh day everyone is exhausted from their work and needs rest However the calm is broken by the attack of a saber toothed cat Several members of the family are killed including Costello which allows Re to come to power Pitar and Maluma decide to leave the group saying We should leave in time leave Re and his new Reich which when Im taking into account Thorns previous reign would be the Third over here Pitar and Maluma leave toward the savanna in a move that remembers both the expulsion from paradise and the Out of Africa theory

The novel has seven chapters Day 1 to Day 7 with the action of each chapter taking place on consecutive days The chapter titles refer to the seven days of the biblical Creation Only odd numbered chapters tell the love story Writer Karin Gayer mentions in her review that the love story of Pitar and Maluma and its positioning within the text offers a second interpretation of the beginning and the end

In conversation with the Viennese regional leader of publisher Arovell Ebner talked about the hidden meanings of his characters names

The idea to give prehistoric characters present day knowledge and a modern language already arose in 2006 Since the author believed that this topic would not be enough for a longer novel he did not continue working on it at first The final impulse came with the literature prize Wiener Werkstattpreis in February 2008 The publication of a book offered by publisher FZA was an integral part of the award and the publisher limited this book to 100 pages For this purpose Ebner wrote and finalized his story and published the book in October of the same year Publisher FZA introduced the work to the public in Vienna

Heinz Gerstinger means the book would be a history of the awakening of the spirit of mankind The author has the events glided into the playful by his gently irony Several reviewers underline the novels ironic and satirical aspect The names of the characters Latin quotations and idioms add to this as much as the parallelism between the seven days of Creation and scientific hominization Ingrid Reichel points out the perfect publication date just in time for the 150th anniversary of Charles Darwins evolution theory Like other reviewers who had written about Ebners earlier books she underlines the complex use of a detail rich language which is steeped in subtle insensitive humor

The many expressions in foreign languages mostly in Latin are untranslated in the first edition In her review Ingrid Reichel invites the publisher to add a glossary to a new edition The author published such a glossary on his own website

Despite many clear allusions to several world religions Ingrid Reichel says that the novel is a book for readers with humor for reasoners for darwinists on no account for creationists to a lesser extent for people of faith but rather for atheists and fundamentalists drop out entirely Another aspect is identified by Karin Gayer when mentioning the parallel evolution of the patriarchal hierarchy in the storys society and the social matriarchy the first resembling Chimpanzee communities and the second those of Bonobos In addition she points out the strength of the women characters With regard to these underlying comparisons she says On another level we are struck by the permanent verbal mix of the ape like and the human a combination which leaves us pensive and asks the legitimate question where we who consider ourselves sapiens in a double sense should finally classify man

Impressment was the act of forcing men to serve in the navy People who were pressed to join the navy were usually young men They would be attacked by naval officers and forced onto the war ships where they were made to work Their families would probably never know where they had been taken

Impressment was also called the Press or press ganged The people who took the young men were the the press gang It was a very normal practice in the Royal Navy during the 17th 18th and early 19th centuries Many people protested saying that it should be stopped but the Royal Navy said it was a good way to get sailors who were needed to defend their country

Nave is a French word which is used in English to mean that someone is very simple and does not understand about the dangers around them Someone who is nave does not have enough experience of life to know about things he or she ought to know Very often they may be very trusting not realizing that some people in the world are evil

The word is sometimes spelt in English without the French double dot on the letter i naive  It is an adjective The noun is naivet but is sometimes spelt navety in English It is similar in meaning to the word innocent but it is always bad to be naive whereas it can be nice to be innocent like a child because then there are no worries 

The word naive is used in other special ways in the arts and sciences It often means lack of experience but it does not necessarily mean it in a critical way

Strength training is the use of resistance to muscular contraction to build the physical strength and endurance There are many different methods of strength training the most common being the weightgravity training and the training with the help of resistive equipment

When properly performed strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well being including increased bone muscle tendon and ligament strength improved joint function reduced potential for injury increased bone density a temporary increase in metabolism improved cardiac function

Training commonly uses the technique of progressively increasing the force output of the muscle through incremental increases of weight elastic tension or other resistance and uses a variety of exercises and types of training equipment to target specific muscle groups Strength training is primarily an anaerobic activity

Strength training differs from bodybuilding weightlifting powerlifting and strongman which are sports rather than forms of exercise although training for them totally depends on strength training Many other sports use strength training as a part of their training regimen notably football lacrosse basketball hockey and track and field

Some samples of strength training exercises in a gym are presented in the picture gallery below FileUPSTREAM FITNESS 10jpg FileUPSTREAM FITNESS 7jpg FileUPSTREAM FITNESS 9jpg FileWPSgif 

The basic principles of strength training involve a number of repetitions sets tempo exercises and force to cause desired changes in strength endurance size or shape by overloading of a group of muscles Specific combination of reps sets exercises resistance and force depend on the purpose of the individual performing the exercise sets with fewer reps can be performed using more force but have a reduced impact on endurance

Already in 1848 there had been plans for a German national library After the restauration they were not followed any longer The stock of books already in existence was stored at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg In 1912 the town of Leipzig seat of the annual Leipzig Book Fair the kingdom of Saxony and the Brsenverein der Deutschen Buchhndler agreed to found a German National Library located in Leipzig Starting January 1 1913 all publications in German language were systematically collected In the same year Dr Gustav Wahl was elected as the first director In 1946 Dr Georg Kurt Schauer Heinrich Cobet Vittorio Klostermann and Professor Hanns Wilhelm Eppelsheimer director of the Frankfurt University Library initiated the re foundation of a German archive library based in Frankfurt am Main The federal state representatives of the book trade in the American zone agreed to the proposal The city of Frankfurt agreed to support the planned archive library with personnel and financial resources The US military government gave its approval The Library began its work in the tobacco room of the former Rothschild library which served the bombed university library as accommodation As a result there are two libraries in Germany which assume the duties and function of a national library for the later GDR and the Federal Republic of Germany respectively Two national bibliographic catalogues appear which are almost identical in content

In July 2000 the DMA also assumed the role as repository for GEMA Gesellschaft fr musikalische Auffhrungs und mechanische Vervielfltigungsrechte a German music copyright organization Since then music publishers only have to submit copies to DMA which covers both national archiving and copyright registration The 210000 works of printed music previously held by GEMA were transferred to DMA

With the unification of Germany on 3 October 1990 the Deutsche Bcherei Leipzig and the Deutsche Bibliothek Frankfurt am Main were merged in the new institution Die Deutsche Bibliothek The Law regarding the German National Library came into force on 29 June 2006 The expansion of the collection brief to include online publications set the course for collecting cataloguing and storing such publications as part of Germanys cultural heritage The Librarys highest management body the Administrative Council was expanded to include two MPs from the Bundestag The law also changed the name of the library and its buildings in Leipzig Frankfurt am Main and Berlin into Deutsche Nationalbibliothek

The Deutsche Musikarchiv Berlin is the central collection of printed and recorded music and the music bibliographic information centre for Germany It is a federal agency founded in 1970 with the task to collect all music published in the country Its precursor was the Deutsche Musik Phonothek Situated in Berlins Lichterfelde the DMA constitutes a department of the German National Library The DMA is planned to move to Leipzig to be housed in an extension of the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek in Leipzig Construction work began in 2006 and is to be completed in 2009 Publishers of printed and recorded music in Germany are required by law to deliver two copies of every edition to the archive One copy is kept at the DMA in Berlin the second is deposited in the music collection of the Deutsche Nationalbibliothek in Leipzig

In linguistics intonation is variation of pitch while speaking which is not used to distinguish words Intonation and stress are two main elements of linguistic prosody

All languages use pitch semantically that is as intonation for instance for emphasis to convey surprise or irony or to pose a question Tonal languages such as Chinese and Hausa use pitch to distinguish words in addition to intonation 

Rising intonation means the pitch of the voice increases over time falling intonation means that the pitch decreases with time A dipping intonation falls and then rises whereas a peaking intonation rises and then falls

The classic example of intonation is the question statement distinction For example northeastern American English like very many languages has a rising intonation for echo or declarative questions and a falling intonation for wh questions and statements Yes or no questions often have a rising end but not always Some languages like Chikasaw and kalaallisut have the opposite pattern rising for statements and falling with questions

Dialects of British and Irish English vary substantially with rises on many statements in urban Belfast and falls on most questions in urban Leeds

In the International Phonetic Alphabet global rising and falling intonation are marked with a diagonal arrow rising left to right and falling left to right respectively These may be written as part of a syllable or separated with a space when they have a broader scope

Here the rising pitch on street indicates that the question hinges on that word on where he found it not whether he found it 

Here as is common with wh questions there is a rising intonation on the question word and a falling intonation at the end of the question

Absurdism is a kind of philosophy Proponents of absurdism are known as absurdists and they hold that there is an essential absurdity in the nature of the human condition  that we are both constantly looking for meaning and also completely unable to find it 

Absurdists most notably Albert Camus believe that there are a number of reactions that human beings have when they realise this fundamental absurdity One is suicide  which is when a human being sees the only solution to the problem of their absurd existence as putting an end to their experience of it The next reaction is the taking up of faith in some higher meaning in the face of a lack of any apparent meaning in the universe The final reaction is an acceptance of the absurd coupled with a continuing effort to attempt to surmount it Camus believed that a human being could achieve happiness by finding meaning in their relationship with the absurdity of their existence

The two most notable absurdist philosophers were Sren Kierkegaard and Albert Camus

Tropical Storm Grace was an unusual tropical cyclone that formed in the Atlantic Ocean It was the 7th named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season Grace began over the Azores on October 4 and had wind speeds of 65 mph However the storm did not last very long and cold water temperatures caused it to weaken The storm died out on October 6 over England The storm was farther north and east in the Atlantic than most tropical storms 

Grace had only minor effects on land While it was passing through the Azores islands near the storm felt strong winds and some rain In Portugal the storm partly caused heavy rain that caused flooding What was left of Tropical Storm Grace hit parts of Ireland and the United Kingdom In this area convert2inmmabbron of rain fell and winds became strong although there was no bad damage

Tropical Storm Grace came from a large extratropical cyclone that formed on September 27 2009 to the east of Newfoundland It began to show signs of becoming a tropical cyclone By October 1 convection began to form near the center of the storm The next day the convection began to disappear and the National Hurricane Center stopped watching it The storm moved in a loop near the Azores for the next two days During October 4 convection formed again near the center of the storm It became a tropical storm near So Miguel Island However the NHC first thought it did not become a tropical storm until later

The NHC named the storm Grace at 1100 AST on October 4 It was the seventh named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season The storm had some strong convection and an eye like feature Grace was over waters that are normally too cold for tropical storms to exist However because there was not much wind shear it was able to stay together Grace moved towards the northeast The storm became slightly stronger as it moved over colder waters Winds in the storm were estimated at 70 mph early on October 5 However the NHC found later that Graces highest winds were actually a little weaker at 65 mph 

A large cyclone near Grace caused the storm to weaken By this time the storm was over convert18CFabbron waters likely stopping further strengthening Early on October 6 Grace merged with a weather front over the northeastern Atlantic Ocean Just before this the lowest air pressure in the storm was recorded at 986 mbar What was left of Grace continued for about 18 hours before dissipating in the Celtic Sea early on October 7 Although the NHC officially called Grace a tropical storm the French meteorological service said it should not have been called a tropical cyclone They argued that the formation of Grace was more like a non tropical storm than a tropical one

When Grace was over the Azores a few islands had light rain and high winds Wind gusts reached convert44mphkmhabbron on Ponta Delgada On October 6 the storms rainbands caused heavy rain and strong winds in parts of Portugal This flooded some streets In the mountains wind gusts may have been stronger than convert80kmhmphabbron

Because the storm was moving so fast when it reached the United Kingdom the rain was not heavy In Ireland convert118inmmabbron of rain fell in the city of Cork Winds in the city were convert23mphkmhabbron Rainfall in the country peaked at convert48mminabbron in Wexford The strongest winds were Force 8 on the Beaufort scale meaning gale force Near the coast of Wales a buoy recorded winds of convert41mphkmhabbron as strong as a small tropical storm Late on October 6 Grace moved over Wales bringing heavy rain and high winds A ship called the Cap Castillo recorded winds of convert45mphkmhabbron on October 5 At that time the ship was about convert110mikmabbron south of the storms center 

In real time Grace was not named as a tropical storm until it reached the latitude 412N This would have been the second farthest north that a tropical storm formed in the Atlantic Only Tropical Storm Alberto of 1988 had formed farther north However at the end of hurricane season it was found that Grace actually became a tropical storm 12 hours earlier than people first thought As a result it formed at 385N which is further south However the storms location was still unusual

The NHC said that the formation of Grace was not predicted by meteorologists The first mention of the low pressure area that became Grace said it would not become a tropical or subtropical storm For three days it was not mentioned in the NHCs tropical weather outlooks until just before it became a tropical cyclone The lack of forecasts was blamed on the storms unusual location

Weight training is a common type of strength training It uses the force of gravity in the form of weighted bars dumbbells or weight stacks to oppose the force generated by muscles Weight training uses a variety of specialized equipment to target specific muscle groups and types of movement

Weight training may differ from bodybuilding Olympic weightlifting powerlifting which are rather sports than forms of physical fitness exercises Weight training however is often a part of the athletes training regimen

Although weight training is similar to bodybuilding they have different objectives Bodybuilders use weight training to improve their body image by developing their muscles for size shape and symmetry regardless of any increase in strength for competition in bodybuilding contests they train to maximize their muscular size and develop extremely low levels of body fat In contrast many weight trainers train to improve their strength and anaerobic endurance while not giving special attention to reducing body fat far below normal

Weight training is a safe form of exercise when the movements are slow controlled and carefully defined However as with any form of exercise improper execution and the failure to take appropriate precautions can result in injury See also Squat

Weight training strengthens bones helping to prevent bone loss and osteoporosis By increasing muscular strength and improving balance weight training can reduce falls by elderly persons as well

Gang members often use graffiti to tell other gangs that an area is part of their territory and that other gangs should stay away Graffiti is also used to send other messages Members of a gang often dress similarly or have the same tattoos

Staunton ran a chess column in the Illustrated London News from 1845 to his death in 1874 He edited the Chess Players Chronicle the first important chess magazine in Englishp297 from 1841 to 1854 He won matches against all the top players of the 1840s 

In 1847 he entered a parallel career as a Shakespearean scholar Ill health and his two writing careers led him to give up competitive chess after 1851 In 1858 attempts were made to organise a match between Staunton and Morphy but they failed Morphys biographer alleged that Staunton misled Morphy to avoid the match but Staunton said he had retired from serious play

Stauntons understanding of positional play was far ahead of his rivals His chess articles and books were widely read and encouraged the development of chess His Chess Players Handbook was a standard text book for decades He played and popularised two of the most important modern openings the Sicilian Defence and the English Opening Staunton was a controversial figure in his time and his chess writings could be spiteful There is no doubt that he was the supreme figure in the chess world of the mid 19th century His books and his writing for newspapers and magazines had world wide influence

Nothing is known about his early life It is not even known whether Howard Staunton was his name at birth Stauntons birth certificate has never been found he claimed 1810 as his year of birth His parents and his place of birth are unknown 

On 23 July 1849 Staunton married Frances Carpenter Nethersole who had eight children by a previous marriage

In 1849 Nathaniel Cook registered a chess set design and Jaques of London got the manufacturing rights Staunton advertised the new set in his Illustrated London News chess column pointing out that the pieces were easily identifiable very stable and good looking At the start the label for each box was signed by Staunton in ink later his signature was printed on the Jacques label He got a royalty on every set sold The design became popular and Staunton pattern sets been the standard for competitive events ever since

Staunton was twenty six when he took a serious interest in chess In 1838 he played many games with Captain Evans the inventor of the Evans Gambit and also lost a match against the German chess writer Aaron Alexandre He had improved sufficiently by 1840 to win a match against the German master HW Popert From May to December 1840 Staunton edited a chess column for the New Court Gazette He then became chess editor of the magazine British Miscellany and his chess column developed into a separate magazine the Chess Players Chronicle which Staunton owned and edited until the early 1850s

Early in 1843 Staunton prevailed in a long series of games against John Cochrane a strong player A little later that year he lost a short match in London against the visiting French player Saint Amant who was the best French player at that time

Staunton challenged Saint Amant to a longer match to be played in Paris at the Caf de la Rgence for a stake of 100 Staunton took Thomas Worrall and Harry Wilson to Paris as his assistants this is the first known case where seconds were used in a chess match Staunton gained a seven game lead but then struggled to keep it before winning the match 13 8 in December 1843

Saint Amant wanted a third match but Staunton was initially unwilling as he had developed heart trouble during the second match After a long difficult negotiation which he reported in the Chess Players Chronicle Staunton went to Paris intending to start their third match in October 1844 but he caught pneumonia while traveling and almost died the match was postponed and never took place

Several modern commentators regard Staunton as de facto World Champion after his match victory over Saint Amant although that title did not yet formally exist

Reluctant closed as demoted Id been deliberately avoiding closing this in the hope that all the problems would be resolved however its now been sat without edits for five days and has already had an additional week since the original closure with my delay effectively giving it a double extension and then some If an article cannot be saved in four weeks then its probably best to demote it and work it back up from the bottom unfortunately Furthermore it sets an unfair precedent to be double and triple extending articles in the hope of keeping them when we have the time limit there for a reason We shouldnt be highlighting articles of sub standard quality and it is better to have fewer articles of best quality than lots of articles that just dont cut the grade Cheers Goblin 1522 3 June 2011 I PeterSymonds

Comment if the community believe that demoting a VGA to a GA should be allowable then the community should act like grown ups and discuss it Lets not forget that VGA and GA articles have different criteria and in each case articles should be scrutinised against them Also dont forget that renominating a newly demoted VGA back to GA is simply a matter of getting on with it and doing it If its such an obvious answer its only two weeks ago from being promoted up to GA Unless the PAD process incorporates a check against GA criteria demoting to basic article is the only answer If the community disagree with this then get on with it and discuss it change policy change guideline whatever Lets make SEWP a better place more dynamic more responsive to common complaints Lets ensure the quality of our GAs and VGAs remains paramount Lets not dig at people like BG7 who simply identify poor quality existing VGAGA and then demote because the community is too lacklustre to do anything about it If anyone wants the system to change lets talk about it The Rambling Man 1830 23 June 2011

The English Opening is a chess opening for players with the white pieces It has become the third most popular opening move after 1e4 and 1d4 The opening was developed by the English master Howard Staunton and played in his match against Saint Amantp124

As a first move this may transpose back to a QP opening 1c4 Nf6 2d4 That would not be an English opening The English is a system of development flexible but including some or all of these moves

1c4 Nf6 2Nc3 g6 3g3 Bg7 4Bg2 0 0 5d3 d6 6Nf3 e5 70 0 Nc6 8Rb1 a5 9a3 h6 10b4 axb4 11axb4 Be6 12b5 This sequence shows the system fully in operation White operates in the centre and Q side Black operates more on the K side

1c4 e5 2g3 Nf6 3Bg2 d5 4cxd5 Nxd5 5Nf3 Nc6 6d3 This has the character of a Sicilian Defence reversed

1c4 Nf6 2Nc3 e6 3e4 d5 4cxd5 exd5 5e5 Here 5d4 5Ne4 and 5Nfd7 are most often played This is a quite different line where the two sides clash early in the centre Since White does not have to play 3e4 he could avoid this line

Each of these lines has its own distinct character and needs to be learnt by the player

Tigran Petrosian was World Chess Champion from 1963 to 1969 He was born to Armenian parents and brought up in the capital of Armenia Yerevanp103 Before his chess career he was a street cleaner

Petrosian got the USSR national master title in 1947 and his chess improved rapidly when he moved to Moscow that year By coming second in the 1951 USSR championship he qualified for the FIDE Interzonal tournament in Stockholm next year There he qualified for the World Championship Candidates tournament in Zurich 1953 He came fifth and was awarded the title of International Grandmasterp299

Years followed when he made no visible progress and others had the chance to challenge for the world title Vasily Smyslov and Mikhail Tal both won the world title yet lost it back to Botvinnik in return matches At last in 1962 Tigran won the Candidates tournament and became the new challenger to Botvinnik Petrosian also won the very strong Soviet Championship four times in 1959 1961 1969 and 1975p118

Before the title match started FIDE changed the rules so that somebody who lost the world championship in a match would not automatically get a return match The rule that allowed for return matches had been criticised for giving Botvinnik too great an advantage over his rivals 

In the match Petrosian started shakily losing the first game and just escaping with a draw in the second game From then on he was in control and won the match by 5 2 15 In 1966 he defended the title against Boris Spassky and won 1211 The victory was rather more emphatic than the score suggests In 1969 Spassky was again the challenger and this time Petrosian lost 1012 

Petrosian played in every world championship cycle from 1951 to 1980 when he lost a quarter final match against his old enemy Viktor Korchnoi

Petrosians record in Chess Olympiads was unsurpassed He played for the USSR in nine Olympiads and this is a summary of his overall results 79 1 50p1568

Petrosian was one of those players who set out to stifle the opponents chances before they take action themselves He was a student of Nimzovichs ideas of prophylaxis Capablanca was another such player but his chess was pure and simple Petrosians was profound and complex He has been much admired by grandmasters but was not so popular with lesser players Like Capablanca he was somewhat lazy and did not strive to win every game At his peak he was the best player in the world at manoeuvring in complex positions and an outstanding endgame playerp300

A line item veto is the power of the president to reject certain individual parts of a piece of legislation without rejecting the whole thing

In the United States almost all governors are able to use the line item veto Currently the president of the United States is not able to use the line item veto President Bill Clinton was given the line item veto for a few years until the US Supreme Court said that it was unconstitutional

People who like the line item veto say that it is good because it allows the president to remove unimportant waste from important legislation For example it would be too dangerous to completely veto big pieces of legislation but with the line item veto the president can choose to keep the good parts of the bill and reject the bad parts of the bill

People who do not like the line item veto say that it is bad because it gives the president too much power over Congress and believe that it goes against the checks and balances created by the US Constitution Other criticisms include the possibility that the presidents individual vetoes of line items make the bill different than what Congress voted for

Milton Friedman was an American economist who believed in monetarism Monetarism is the theory that how much money the government prints each year has a huge effect on the economy He supports the government printing the same low rate of money each year rather than a different amount each year

During the 1970s Milton Friedmans idea of monetarism gained popularity and he became an economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan

Friedman believed that the government control over the economy should be limited He supported cutting taxes lowering government spending getting rid of government rules that limited the economy and letting parents choose which school their taxes paid for His political views were libertarian He was against forcing people to join the army and said that getting rid of the United States policy of doing that was the thing he was most proud of doing

Throughout several decades Friedman made many documentaries books and interviews to express his views to the public The main books he wrote were Capitalism and Freedom and Free to Choose

An electron configuration is the arrangement of electrons within an atom The electron configuration describes where the electrons are inside orbitals The structure of the Periodic table of elements is partly based on electron configuration

There are four kinds of electron configurations s p d and f orbitals S orbitals are roughly sphere shaped p orbitals are shaped like a dumbbell d orbitals are usually shaped like a four leaf clover and f orbitals form a mathematically complex shape An atom can have more than one orbital in fact all except hydrogen do Similarly atoms can have more than one of each kind of orbital

Marie Byrd Land is a part of Antarctica It is between the Ross Ice Shelf and the Ross Sea to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the north It goes towards the east to a line between the head of the Ross Ice Shelf and Eights Coast It stretches between 158W and 10324W The area between the Rockefeller Plateau and Eights Coast is included This is because Rear Admiral Richard E Byrd had an important role in its exploration Admiral Byrd named the territory in 1929 It was in honour of his wife He applied the name to the territory that was explored in that year

The area is very broken wikt linkremoteremote even for Antarctica Because of this most of it has not been claimed by any country The territory is not a nation itself Because of this it is the largest single unclaimed territory on Earth Together with Eights Coast immediately to the east of Marie Byrd Land it has an area of 1610000 km

In 1939 US President Franklin D Roosevelt told members of an Antarctic expedition to claim some Antarctic territory Members of this expedition and later ones seemed to do so but no official claims were made before 1959 when the Antarctic Treaty System was set up Some maps in the United States have shown this as US territory The Defense Department of the US Government has also said that there was a solid basis for a claim for the territory This was because of the activities there before 1959 

The portion west of 150W is part of Ross Dependency

There are five areas which are listed from west to east

The 18761877 Constantinople Conference of the Great Powers was held in Istanbul from 23 December 1876 until 20 January 1877 Following the Herzegovinian Rebellion started in 1875 and the Bulgarian Uprising in April 1876 the Great Powers agreed on a project for political reforms both in Bosnia and in the Ottoman territories with a majority Bulgarian population

The Great Powers were represented at the conference respectively by

Of these Lord Salisbury Count de Chaudordy and Baron von Calice were Ambassadors Plenipotentiary to the conference while Count Ignatyev Sir Henry Elliot Count de Bourgoing Baron von Werther Count Zichy and Count Corti were the resident Ambassadors of their countries in Constantinople

The US Consul General in Constantinople Eugene Schuyler also took an active part in drafting the conference decisions

The Ottoman Empire was represented at the conference by

Mithat Pasha was the Grand Vizier and Saffet Pasha the Foreign Minister of Turkey Although the Turkish representatives participated in the plenaries of the conference they were not invited to the preceding working sessions at which the Great Powers negotiated their agreement

Lord Salisbury and Count Ignatyev played a leading role in the process Ignatyev was trying to dispel British misgivings about Russias assumed role of a protector of the Orthodox Slavs being but a disguise of its drive to take over the Bosporus and Constantinople itself and thus as Prime Minister Disraeli feared potentially threaten the vital Mediterranean routes to British India On his part Salisbury saw the conference as a promising opportunity for mapping out a comprehensive deal with Russia over their conflicting territorial ambitions in Central Asia

The conference envisaged the creation of an autonomous province including Bosnia and most of Herzegovina while a southern part of the latter was to be ceded to Montenegro

The Great Powers agreed on a substantial Bulgarian autonomy to take the form of two new Ottoman provinces established for the purpose Eastern with capital Tarnovo and Western with capital Sofia

The conference determined that as of the late 19th century the Bulgarian ethnic territories within the Ottoman Empire extended to the Danube Delta in the northeast Kastoria in the southwest Kirklareli and Edirne in the southeast and Ni in the northwest These territories were to be incorporated into the two Bulgarian autonomous provinces as follows

The Great Powers elaborated in detail the constitutional legislative executive defense and law enforcement arrangements cantonal administrative system taxation international supervision etc for the proposed autonomous provinces

The agreed decisions of the six Great Powers were formally handed over to the Ottoman Government on 23 December 1876 dismissing the opening Turkish suggestions that the Conferences mission might have been obviated by a new Ottoman Constitution approved by Sultan Abdul Hamid II that same day In the subsequent conference plenary sessions Turkey submitted objections and alternative reform proposals that were rejected by the Great Powers and attempts to bridge the gap did not succeed Eventually on 18 January 1877 Grand Vizier Mithat Pasha announced the definitive refusal of Turkey to accept the conference decisions

The failure of the Ottoman Government to implement the decisions of the Constantinople Conference triggered the 18771878 Russo Turkish War depriving at the same time Turkey in contrast to the preceding 18531856 Crimean War from Western support

Tsarigrad Peak in Imeon Range on Smith Island in the South Shetland Islands Antarctica is named after the conference

Anne of Denmark was queen consort of Scotland England and Ireland She was the wife of King James VI and I

Anne the second daughter of King Frederick II of Denmark married James in 1589 when she was 14 She gave birth to three children who lived to become adults One of these children was the future Charles I She often used Scottish politics when she fought with James about her son Prince Henry She also used them in her arguments about his treatment of her friend Beatrix Ruthven Anne seems to have loved James at first However they later became cooler towards one another and lived separately However though they both had respect and even some love for one another

In England Anne was more interested in art than politics She built a beautiful and culturally rich court of her own After 1612 she became ill and later stopped being in the center of court life She was said to have died a Protestant However some proof suggests that she may have been a Catholic at some time in her life

Historians have often thought of Anne as a queen who was light selfish and not very important Recently however many people point out Annes independence and importance as an encourager of the arts in the Jacobean age

Anne was born on 12 December 1574 at the castle of Skanderborg Her birth came as a blow to her father King Frederick II of Denmark who had been hoping for a son Annes mother Sophie of Mecklenburg Gstrow however was only 17 Three years later she did give birth to a son He was the future Christian IV of Denmark

Anne was sent with her older sister Elizabeth to Gstrow in Germany She was to be raised there by her grandparents on her mothers side They were the Duke and Duchess of Mecklenburg This was because the Danish court was very wild at this time King Frederick was famous for heavy eating and much drinking He was also unfaithful to the Queen Compared to this in Gstrow Anne enjoyed a quiet and stable life in her early years Christian was also sent to be brought up at Gstrow However two years later in 1579 the Rigsraad or Danish Privy Council successfully asked him to move to Denmark Anne and Elizabeth came back with him

Anne enjoyed a close and happy family education in Denmark This was mostly because of Queen Sophie She took care of the children herself when they were ill A great number of people from all over Europe wanted to marry Anne and her older sister Among these people were James VI of Scotland He liked Denmark because he thought of it as a kingdom with good religion and a good trading partner Scottish ambassadors had at first tried to make him marry the oldest daughter However Frederick betrothed Elizabeth to Henry Julius Duke of Brunswick He promised the Scots instead that for the second daughter Anna if the King did like her he should have her

Sophies position became harder after Fredericks death in 1588 She had to join in a power struggle with the Rigsraad for control of King Christian However she worked harder than Frederick in making people marry She was able to overcome difficult points about the dowry and the position of Orkney She sealed the agreement by July 1589 Anne seems to have been very excited about the match On 28 July 1589 the English spy Thomas Fowler said that Anne was greatly in love with James He said that it were death to her to have it broken off He added that she proved her love in a great number of ways However Fowler also suggested that James did not return Annes love and he liked men better than women This would not have been told to the 14 year old Princess At this time she was faithfully embroidering shirts for her fianc Meanwhile 300 tailors worked on making her wedding dress

Even if these rumors were true James needed a royal marriage This was because he needed to keep up the Stuart line God is my witness he explained I could have abstained longer than the weal of my country could have permitted had not my long delay bred in the breasts of many a great jealousy of my inability as if I were a barren stock On 20 August 1589 Anne and James were married separately but to one another This is called a proxy marriage Their marriage took place in Kronborg Castle The ceremony ended with Jamess representative George Keith 5th Earl Marischal sitting next to Anne on the bridal bed

Henry Frederick Prince of Wales was the oldest son of King James I VI and Anne of Denmark His name comes from grandfathers Henry Stuart Lord Darnley and Frederick II of Denmark

Prince Henry was widely seen as a bright heir to his fathers throne However he died before his father because of typhoid fever Because of this the English and Scottish thrones power went to his younger brother Charles

Lots of places in the Colony of Virginia were named in honor of Prince Henry before and after his death

He was born at Stirling Castle and became Duke of Rothesay Earl of Carrick Baron of Renfrew Lord of the Isles and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland when he was born His father made Alexander Erskine Earl of Mar take care of him He did not let his mother take care of him This was because James worried that the mothers slight liking for Catholicism might have some effect on the son Although this made lots of fights between Anna and James Henry was kept under the care of Mars family until 1603 This was when James became King of England and his family moved south

Sir George Lauder of The Bass was his teacher until he went to England Sir George was a Privy Counsellor described as the Kings familiar councillor and he was also taught in music by Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger

The title role in a play or an opera is the role which is also the title of the play or opera We say that the actor singer or dancer who performs that part has the title role For example in the opera Carmen by Georges Bizet the part played by the girl called Carmen is the title role We may say that a singer took the title role in the opera Carmen That means that she sang the part of Carmen in the opera

The title role is not necessarily the most important role in the play or opera although it often is

A few other well known examples in which the performance is named after one of the characters include the operas Aida Madame Butterfly and Peter Grimes the ballets Copplia or Petrushka or the plays Othello or Hamlet

A character actor is an actor who plays a particular kind of character in a play or in a film opera or ballet The character actor is not the main part He is not the lover or hero He has a character which helps to support the main characters and therefore the story

Character roles may be roles such as the faithful servant the maid the villain the mother in law the priest etc They may or may not be comic characters

For example in The Wizard of Oz the main character is Dorothy The Scarecrow the Lion and the Tin Man are character roles

Some actors or singers prefer character roles to main roles It may be because this kind or role suits their personality or their singing voice Some people nearly always play the same kind of character role We say that people like that are typecast Some actors are happy to remain typecast Others may wish to broaden their repertoire and take on different roles

Giulio Caccini also known as Giulio Romano was an Italian composer and singer He lived at the very end of Renaissance period and the beginning of the Baroque period It was the time when opera was starting and he was one of the first composers to write an opera His son Francesca Caccini also became a composer

By 1579 Caccini was singing at the Medici court He was a tenor and he was able to accompany himself on the viol or the archlute he sang at weddings and other important occasions He worked closely with the Florentine Camerata a famous group of people who met at the home of Count Giovanni de Bardi and tried to bring the tradition of Greek dramatic music back to life They liked monody which means a tune with a simple accompaniment This was different from polyphony in which several things are being sung at once Monody made it easy to tell a story because the words could be heard clearly This was necessary for opera where it became heard in a simple form called recitative

Caccini went to Rome but in Rome the musicians were not so interested in change

Caccini often got involved in arguments because he was envious and jealous He often got people into trouble and he rushed his own opera Euridice into print before Peris opera on the same subject could be published while telling his own singers not to have anything to do with Peris opera

He died in Florence and is buried in the church of St Annunziata

Prince of Orange is a title of nobility

The title is used by members of the House of Orange Nassau as heirs to the crown of the Netherlands It also used by members of the House of Hohenzollern At the moment the title is used by Prince Willem Alexander of the Netherlands Georg Friedrich Prince of Prussia and Guy Marquis de Mailly Nesl Prince dOrange

The title was at first related to a self ruling state called the Principality of Orange It lies in the south of what we now call France The land was the property of the house of Orange and from 1544 of the house of Orange Nassau 

The last of the original princes Ren of Nassau left the principality to his cousin William the Silent after he died William the Silent was not related to the original house of Orange but was the legal heir

In a war in 1673 Louis XIV of France took over the lands of the principality and added them to his own royal domain This was part of the war against the stadtholder William III of Orange Louis XIV then gave the principality to Louis of Mailly Nesles marquis of Nesles a very remote relation of the original princes of OrangeCitation neededdateJuly 2008 His descendant still claims the title today In 1714 Louis XIV allowed Prince Louis Armand of Bourbon Conti to use the land of the Principality to make money Prince Louis Armand died in 1727 and the principality was merged in the Crown in 1731

William III died without legitimate children This meant that the principality was seen as inherited by his closest cognate relative on the basis of the testament of Frederic Henry Frederick I of Prussia Citation neededdateJuly 2008 He handed over the principalitys lands but not the title to France in 1713 France supported his claim In this way the territory of the principality was no longer a separate state but became a part of France Through the Treaty of Utrecht A new Principality of Orange was created by the King of Prussia as part of the duchy of GelderlandCitation neededdateJuly 2008 The kings of Prussia and the German emperors styled themselves Princes of Orange till 1918

John William Friso of Nassau was chosen as the heir to the princes of Orange in the Netherlands by the last will of William III John William Friso was also related to William the Silent through the female line Several of his descendants became stadtholders They claim the principality of Orange on the basis of agnatic inheritance Citation neededdateJuly 2008 This way of inheriting is similar to the way William the Silent inherited from his cousin Ren The claim to the title is also on basis of the testament of Philips William Maurice and William III Although they claimed the title Prince of Orange France never allowed them to obtain anything of the lands of the principality itself It is from this tradition that later stadtholders of the Netherlands and the present day royal family of the Netherlands also hold the title

Until 1340 it was customary for all sons of the prince of Orange to inherit the title Only the direct line of descent to Raimond V is shown here

As personal title of nobility

As royal title for the heir apparent

The Invitation to William was a letter sent by seven famous Englishmen They were later named the Immortal Seven They sent this letter to William III Prince of Orange received by him on 30 June 1688 In England a Catholic male heir to the throne James Francis Edward Stuart had been born The letter asked William to force the ruling king his father in law James II of England to make Williams Protestant wife Mary Jamess oldest daughter the heir This might possibly be done by saying that the newborn Prince of Wales was not really James son 

The letter told William that if he were to land in England with a small army they would rise up and support him The Invitation shortly told him about their complaints against King James They said that the Kings son was not really the Kings son and that the English people generally believed him to be false They complained that William had sent a letter to James broken wikt linkcongratulationscongratulating him with the birth of his son It was carried to William in The Hague by Rear Admiral Arthur Herbert disguised as a common sailor It was read by a secret code 

The invitation made William decide to carry out his existing plans to land with a large Dutch army This ended in the Glorious Revolution during which James was taken off king and replaced by William and Mary as joint rulers

Lady Anne Hyde Duchess of York was the first wife of James Duke of York She was also and the mother of two queens Mary II of England and Scotland and Anne of Great Britain

She was born on 12 March 1638 or 22 March 1638 at Windsor Berkshire of the Hyde family

The royal family for some time remained in exile after the English Civil War Annes father served as the Royalist chief adviser to the future King Charles II of England Jamess older brother Anne was Maid of Honour to Mary Princess Royal and Princess of Orange sister of Charles and James It was during this time that James seduced Anne while she was in his sisters service and Charles forced James to marry Anne He said that her strong character would be a good influence on his weak willed brother

The couple went through an official marriage ceremony on 3 September 1660 in London following the English Restoration of the monarchy Anne was not a beautiful woman In fact Samuel Pepys slights her as being quite plain However the French Ambassador described her as having courage cleverness and energy almost worthy of a Kings blood

Wilhelm Steinitz was an Austrian chess grandmaster who emigrated first to London then to the USA 

He was the first undisputed World Chess Champion and held it from 1886 to 1894 

Steinitz won the title by beating Johannes Zukertort in a match in 1886 He lost it to Emanuel Lasker in 1894 He also lost a rematch with Lasker in 1897

Born a Jew in Bohemia Steinitz studied mathematics at the Vienna Polytecnic and won the Vienna chess championship in 1861 with a score of 3132 After playing in the London 1862 tournament he stayed in London as a professional player in clubs and coffee houses He won a series of matches against all the best English and other players living in London This established him as one of the best player in the world

Steinitz beat Adolf Anderssen in 1866 and some think he should be regarded as world champion from this date 

Apart from the chess this match was a landmark in chess organisation It was the first event to be timed by clocksp82 The time for each move was recorded by hand The totals for each player could then be added This was the first practical step taken to make sure each player had the same total thinking time available It had always been a problem that some players took much longer than others unfairly so Timimg also helped to keep the total time for play within bounds Eventually special chess clocks were designed and the idea has spread to other two person games such as Go

Steinitz beat Johannes Zukertort in 1872 and again later in 1886 This last match all agree was for the world championship Zukertort was a brilliant and boastful player who was also resident in London for many years Both the men wrote for chess magazines and there was a good deal of rivalry 

Steinitz did not win a really strong tournament until London 1872 and did not finish above Andersson until Vienna 1873 He came equal first at Vienna 1882 and second in London 1883 both top class events In general his tournament play was not so outstanding as his match play In match play he was the best of his day he won 24 matches running until Lasker beat himp396

As a younger man Steinitz played in the all out attacking style that was common in the 1860s Later he developed a new positional style of play and demonstrated that it was superior to the previous style His new style was controversial and some even branded it as cowardly Some of Steinitzs games showed that it could also set up attacks as ferocious as those of the old school 

Steinitz was argumentative and was often in disputes with other chess writers He was a prolific writer in chess magazines and defended his ideas vigorously The debate was bitter and sometimes abusive it became known as the Ink War By the early 1890s Steinitz approach was more widely accepted and the next generation of top players acknowledged their debt to him especially his successor as world champion Emanuel Lasker

Lasker summed up the new style as 

Steinitz left England for the United States in 1886 and became an American citizen in 1888 

He was given an enthusiastic reception played several exhibitions many casual games a match for stakes of 50 with a wealthy amateur and slightly more serious matches with New World professionals The match with the Cuban champion Celso Golmayo Zpide was abandoned when Steinitz was leading His hosts even arranged a visit to New Orleans where Paul Morphy lived

While based in New York he played matches against Zukertort twice against Russias Mikhail Chigorin Isidor Gunsberg Finally there were the two losing matches against Emanuel Lasker These were all for the world championship There were also a dozen matches against lesser masters including four against JH Blackburne the leading English professional

The book of the Hastings 1895 chess tournament written collectively by the players described Steinitz as follows

Steinitz died in poverty having spent some of his last years in a New York mental institution His second wife and their two young children survived him and a fund of 1050 was raised to help them

Steinitz is the name of several noted people

In statistics a confidence interval is a measurement of how good or how accurate a certain parameter is Statistics is concerned with estimating values In the case of confidence intervals an interval is given instead of a single parameter together with a likelihood that the observed value will be in the interval The likelihood that the parameter will be in the interval given is called confidence level Very often this is given at a percentage The confidence interval is always given together with the confidence level People may speak about the 95 confidence interval The end points of the confidence interval are referred to as confidence limits For a given estimation procedure in a given situation the higher the confidence level the wider the confidence interval will be

The calculation of a confidence interval generally requires assumptions about the nature of the estimation process it is primarily a parametric method One common assumption is that the distribution of the population from which the sample came is normal As such confidence intervals as discussed below are not robust statistics though changes can be made to add robustness

The term confidence has a different meaning in statistics than it has in common use This often confuses people and is one of the critiques to the concept of confidence intervals If they are used by other people than statisticians the term confidence is misleading 

In common usage a claim to 95 confidence in something is normally taken as indicating virtual certainty In statistics a claim to 95 confidence simply means that the researcher has seen something occur that only happens one time in twenty or less If one were to roll two dice and get double six few would claim this as proof that the dice were fixed although statistically speaking one could have 97 confidence that they were Similarly the finding of a statistical link at 95 confidence is not proof nor even very good evidence that there is any real connection between the things linked

When a study involves multiple statistical tests some laymen assume that the confidence associated with each test is the confidence one should have in the results of the study itself In fact the results of all the statistical tests done during a study must be judged as a whole in order to determine what confidence one may place in the positive links it produces For example say a study is conducted which involves 40 statistical tests at 95 confidence and which produces 3 positive results Each test has a 5 chance of producing a false positive so such a study will produce 3 false positives about two times in three The confidence one can therefore have that any of the studys positive conclusions are correct is only about 32 well below the 95 the researchers have set as their standard of acceptance

A machine fills cups with margarine For the example the machine is adjusted so that the content of the cups is 250 g of margarine As the machine cannot fill every cup with exactly 250 g the content added to individual cups shows some variation and is considered a random variable X This variation is assumed to be normally distributed around the desired average of 250 g with a standard deviation of 25 g To determine if the machine is adequately calibrated a sample of n 25 cups of margarine is chosen at random and the cups are weighed The weights of margarine are X1 X25 a random sample from X

If we take another sample of 25 cups we could easily expect to find values like 2504 or 2511 grams A sample mean value of 280 grams however would be extremely rare if the mean content of the cups is in fact close to 250g There is a whole interval around the observed value 2502 of the sample mean within which if the whole population mean actually takes a value in this range the observed data would not be considered particularly unusual Such an interval is called a confidence interval for the parameter How do we calculate such an interval The endpoints of the interval have to be calculated from the sample so they are statistics functions of the sample X1 X25 and hence random variables themselves

As the desired value 250 of is within the resulted confidence interval there is no reason to believe the machine is wrongly calibrated

The calculated interval has fixed endpoints where might be in between Thus this event has probability either 0 or 1 We cannot say with probability the parameter lies in the confidence interval We only know that by repetition in 100 of the cases will be in the calculated interval In 100 of the cases however it does not And unfortunately we do not know in which of the cases this happens Thats why we say with confidence level 100  lies in the confidence interval

The figure on the right shows 50 realisations of a confidence interval for a given population mean If we randomly choose one realisation the probability is 95 we end up having chosen an interval that contains the parameter however we may be unlucky and have picked the wrong one Well never know we are stuck with our interval

A number of narrow tramway tracks were built in the mine area Adelong is one of the only two gold mining areas in New South Wales known to have used a steam locomotive on its tramways

During the gold rush many Chinese people worked in the mines Many died and were buried in a special part of the Adelong cemetery The Chinese part of the cemetery was destroyed in the early 1900s One or two old Chinese and Indian people still lived in Adelong in the 1950s A small town Cornishtown was about a mile west of Adelong till the 1940s

Xiphactinus was a large 45 to 5 m long predatory bony fish that lived in the Western Interior Sea over what is now the middle of North America during the Late Cretaceous Skeletal remains of Xiphactinus have come from Kansas Alabama and Georgia in the United States as well as Europe and Australia

Above all else Xiphactinus was a great swimmer able to speed towards or away from virtually anything else in the seas of the time It may have been able to leap above the waves at times to help dislodge parasites from its skin It was not however immune from attack If injured its large size meant it was easy to spot and could become prey for sharks

Chess and computers have been connected since the earliest days of the computer In the 19th century Charles Babbage had thought of the ideap87 and in modern times Alan Turing the mathematician and Bletchley Park codebreaker put some thought into the idea He was not a very good chess player but was one of the creators of the first British computer He is also credited with the creation of Computer science

There are two types of chess programs One plays against a human opponent the other helps the user become a better player The two types can be made to work together though they have different functions and work in different ways

Chess engines are computer systems that can play chess games against human opponents Many have been created they can play at master level though their processes are quite different from those of a human beingp87 The best engines on the fastest computers have won matches against both Kasparov and Kramnik but the software can be used at an easier level for a learner

Competitions are run by putting engines against each other and the results are published There is a World Computer Chess Championship in which the details of the rules may determine which software wins Software may also be rated on other scales such as ease of usage

Fritz is a German chess program by Frans Morsch and Mathias Feist published by ChessBase It is the current market leader There is also a different kind of Fritz called Deep Fritz that is made for multi processing The latest kinds of the consumer products are Deep Fritz 12 and Fritz 12 They came with reviews by Josh Waitzkin who said that Fritz is like a woman that you cant get with It just drives you to think in ways youve never thought before

Shredder is a leading engine It is also owned by ChessBase It comes in various forms Shredder 12 Deep Shredder 12 Shredder Classic It has a reputation of being hard

Chess databases do not actually play They give access to the recorded history of master chess There are two components First there is the software which lets one search and organise the database material Then there is the actual database typically one to four million games

In practice databases are used for two purposes First for a player to train hisher ability at specific openings Second to look up specific opponents to see what they play and prepare against them beforehand

The existence of chess databases is one way that young players can achieve mastery at an early age

ChessBase is the biggest database and widely used by masters Although it can be used online most users download the software and data onto their laptop Then they take the laptop to tournaments to help prepare for games Players may not use computers or any other aid during games but much preparation goes on behind the scenes ChessBase has to be purchased and it is not cheap

This is a Dutch magazine for advanced players which runs an on line database called NicBase as part of its services NicBase is free and has over a million games

Chessgamescom runs an on line database of games It is partly free but requires registration Full access to all its facilities is by a fairly modest subscription It has over half a million games on its database

There are websites which a player can join and play on line In this case the subscriber will play against other subscribers not a computer All standards of players are amongst the members and various events are on offer at different rates of play The two leaders in this market are

Chess notation is a method for writing down chess moves It is compulsory for payers in competitions to do this The system must have these elements the move number the piece moved the square it starts from the square it goes to and other relevant information such as captures and castlesp275 There are other notations for recording positions

There have been ways of describing moves from quite early on Manuscripts with move descriptions are known in Arabic and from Europep275 These early notations are usually quite cumbersome The pawn of the king forward two housesp229 469 848 This kind of notation is called descriptive In a descriptive notation each player describes squares from his own point of view eg 1 PK4 PK4 A notation which uses labels for the ranks and files is called algebraic In this notation a square has only one label eg 1 e4 e5

The moves of a chess game are written down by using a special notationArticle 8 and Appendix E Usually algebraic chess notation is used In algebraic notation each square has one and only one name Here moves are written in the format of abbreviation of the piece moved file where it moved rank where it moved For example Qg5 means queen moves to the g file and 5th rank If there are two pieces of the same type that can move to the same square one more letter or number is added to show the file or rank from which the piece moved eg Ngf3 means knight from the g file moves to the square f3 The letter P showing a pawn is not used so that e4 means pawn moves to the square e4

If the piece makes a capture x is written before the square in which the capturing piece lands on Example Bxf3 means bishop captures on f3 When a pawn makes a capture the file from which the Pawn left is used in place of a piece initial For example exd5 means pawn captures on d5

If a pawn moves to its eighth rank getting a promotion the piece chosen is written after the move for example e1Q or e1Q Castling is written by the special notations 00 for kingside castling and 000 for queenside A move which places the opponents king in check normally has the notation added Checkmate can be written as or At the end of the game 10 means White won 01 means Black won and  is a draw

Chess moves can also be shown with punctuation marks and other annotation symbols For example means a good move means a very good move means a bad move a very bad move a creative move that may be good and a doubtful move For example one kind of a simple trap known as the Scholars mate as in the diagram to the right may be recorded in full notation

1 e2 e4 e7 e5 2 Qd1 h5 Nc8 c6 3 Bf1 c4 Ng8 f6 4 Qh5xf7 10

Here is a famous short game in the more usual short notation

This is algebraic notation with little figurines instead of initial letters for the pieces Figurine notation is used in print and computer chess Since it avoids initial letters for pieces it is more international

In addition to the Forsyth notation positions may be recorded in this simple fashion

Rubinstein was Jewish and his family planned for him to become a rabbi However he did not finish his studies and chose to devote himself to chess entirely The decision came in 1903 after he won fifth place at a tournament in Kiev He learned to play chess when he was 16 and played with the strong master Gersz Salwe in d 

Rubinsteins best period was from 1907 to 1912 It began with his win at Karlovy Vary in 1907 and a shared win at St Petersburg in the same year It closed in a string of wins in 1912 He won five consecutive major tournaments that year San Sebastian Pieany Breslau Warsaw and Vilniusp79 Some believe that he was better than World Champion Emanuel Lasker at this time Ratings from Chessmetrics support this conclusion placing him as world 1 between mid 1912 and mid 1914 Others believe he was not quite so strong as Lasker and was eclipsed by Jos Ral Capablanca after 1911

Rubinstein was never given a chance to play Lasker for the world chess championship he was unable to raise enough money to meet Laskers financial demands In the 1909 St Petersburg tournament he had tied with Lasker and won his individual encounter with him However he had a poor result at St Petersburg tournament 1914 not reaching the final pool of five players A match with Lasker was arranged for October 1914 but it never took place because of the outbreak of World War I

After the war Rubinstein was still an elite grandmaster but his results lacked their previous formidable consistency Nevertheless he won at Vienna in 1922 ahead of future world champion Alexander Alekhine and was the leader of the Polish team that won the Chess Olympiad at Hamburg in 1930 with a superb record of thirteen wins and four draws A year later he won an Olympic silver 

After 1932 he withdrew from tournament play mostly because his symptoms of schizophrenia prevented normal life He suffered from a fear of people and society He lived then in a sanitorium and later rejoined his family 

Rubinstein lived on for almost 30 years afterwards He left behind no literary works but a great heritage in his games During World War II he was placed in an asylum One account says that when the Nazis eventually arrived to haul the aged Jewish grandmaster from his asylum to the death camps he was so patently insane that they abandoned the attempt

He was one of the earliest chess players to take the endgame into account when choosing and playing the opening He was exceptionally talented in the endgame particularly in rook endings where he broke new ground Silman ranks him as one of the five best endgame players of all time and a master of rook endgames

He originated the Rubinstein System against the Tarrasch variation of the Queens Gambit declined 1d4 d5 2Nf3 c5 3c4 e6 4cxd5 exd5 5Nc3 Nc6 6g3 Nf6 7Bg2 cxd4 8Nxd4 Qb6 He is also credited with inventing the Meran variation which stems from the Slav defence

Today he certainly has no shortage of lines named for him 1d4 Nf6 2c4 e6 3Nc3 Bb4 4e3 is the Rubinstein variation of the Nimzo Indian defence

The Rubinstein Trap a trap in the Queens Gambit declined is named after him because he fell into it twice One version of the trap runs 1d4 d5 2c4 e6 3Nc3 Nf6 4cxd5 exd5 5Bg5 Be7 6e3 0 0 7Nf3 Nbd7 8Bd3 c6 100 0 Re8 11Rc1 h6 12 Bf4 Nh5 13 Nxd5 Now 13cxd5 is met by 14Bc7 winning the queen while 13Nxf4 14Nxf4 leaves White a pawn ahead 

The Rubinstein Memorial tournament in his honor has been held annually since 1963 in Polanica Zdroj with a glittering list of top flight winners

The reception history of Jane Austen shows how Austens works at first having modest fame became wildly popular Her books are both the subject of great study and the center of various fan culture Jane Austen the writer of such works as Pride and Prejudice and Emma has become one of the most famous novelists in the English language

During her lifetime Austens books did not make her very famous Like a great number of women writers at that time she chose to publish her books secretly Only among people in the aristocracy her writing was an open secret At the time they were published Austens works were thought fashionable by members of high society However they received only a few good reviews By the mid nineteenth century her works were respected by people who were learned in literature They thought that liking her works was a sign that they were clever In 1870 her nephew published Memoir of Jane Austen This showed her to a wider public as dear quiet aunt Jane After this her works were published again in popular editions By the twentieth century lots of groups had formed Some praised her and some defended her from the broken wikt linkteemteeming masses However they all claimed to be true Janeites or people who really appreciated Austen

Early in the twentieth century scholars made a collection of her works But it was not until the 1940s that Austen was widely accepted as a great English novelist In the second half of the twentieth century people began studying Austen more and more and in different ways For example they studied her works artistically ideologically and historically The university English departments began developing in the first half of the twentieth century As they grew criticism of Austen split into remarkable high culture and popular culture trends In the late twentieth century fans made Jane Austen societies and clubs They praised Austen her time and her works In the early twenty first century Austen fans support an industry of printed sequels and prequels They also support Austens work in television and film

Jane Austen lived her entire life as part of a large and close family Her family was in the lower part of the English gentry Her familys steady support was very important to Austens development as a writer For example Austen read her first drafts of all of her books to her family In this way she received encouragement and help In fact it was her father who first tried to put her book in print Austens training as a writer lasted from when she was a teenager until she was about 35 During this time she experimented with different literary forms This included the epistolary novel which she tried and did not like She wrote and revised three important novels and began a fourth When Sense and Sensibility Pride and Prejudice Mansfield Park and Emma came out in print she became a successful writer

However novel writing was not easy for women in the early nineteenth century This was because it made them famous It also made people think them broken wikt linkunfeminineunfeminine So like a great number of other female writers Austen published her books secretly In time though her writing became an open secret among the aristocracy In one of her visits to London the Prince Regent invited her to his home His librarian showed her around and said that the Regent liked her books very much The librarian added that if Miss Austen had any other Novel forthcoming she was quite at liberty to broken wikt linkdedicationdedicate it to the Prince Austen did not like the prince who spent a lot of money She did not want to follow this suggestion However her friends persuaded her to follow it Therefore Emma was dedicated to him Austen refused the librarians suggestion after that to write a historical romance for the princes daughters marriage

In the last year of her life Austen revised Northanger Abbey and wrote Persuasion She also began another novel which was later titled Sanditon She could not finish it before her death Austen did not have time to see Northanger Abbey or Persuasion through the press However her family published them as one book after she died Her brother Henry included a Biographical Notice of the Author This short biography made people think of Austen as a quiet aunt who wrote in her free time Neither the hope of fame nor profit mixed with her early motives So much did she broken wikt linkshrinkshrink from broken wikt linknotorietynotoriety that no accumulation of fame would have induced her had she lived to affix her name to any productions of her pen in public she turned away from any allusion to the character of an authoress However Austen shows excitement in her letters about getting her books in print She was also interested in how much money the books would make Austen was a professional writer

Austens works are noted for their realism biting social commentary and clever use of free indirect speech They are also remarkable for their burlesque and irony They criticize the novels of sensibility of the second half of the eighteenth century They are part of the change to nineteenth century realism As Susan Gubar and Sandra Gilbert explain Austen laughed at love at first sight the primacy of passion over all other emotions andor duties the broken wikt linkchivalrychivalric broken wikt linkexploitexploits of the hero the broken wikt linkvulnerablevulnerable sensitivity of the heroine the lovers proclaimed indifference to financial considerations and the cruel broken wikt linkcruditycrudity of parents Austens stories though comic focus on the way women depend on marriage to secure social standing and economic security She was also concerned with moral problems like Samuel Johnson who strongly influenced her

Austens books quickly became fashionable Aristocrats who liked to set the fashion and taste of the day especially liked them Henrietta Ponsonby Countess of Bessborough wrote about Sense and Sensibility in a letter to a friend She said it is a clever novel  tho it ends stupidly I was much amused by it The 15 year old daughter of the Prince Regent Princess Charlotte Augusta compared herself to Marianne Dashwood She remarked I think Marianne me are very like in disposition that certainly I am not so good the same broken wikt linkimprudenceimprudence tc Pride and Prejudice was enjoyed by Richard Sheridan a person who wrote plays He told a friend to buy it immediately for it was one of the cleverest things he had ever read Anne Milbanke future wife of Lord Byron wrote that I have finished the Novel called Pride and Prejudice which I think a very superior work She added that is the most probable fiction I have ever read and had become at present the fashionable novel The Dowager Lady Vernon told a friend that Mansfield Park was not much of a novel more the history of a family party in the country very natural Lady Anne Romilly told her friend the writer Maria Edgeworth that Mansfield Park has been pretty generally admired here Edgeworth later said that we have been much entertained with Mansfield Park

High society liked and approved of Austens novels However they received few reviews while she was alive There were two for Sense and Sensibility Pride and Prejudice received three Mansfield Park received none There were seven for Emma Most of the reviews were short careful and approving They mostly focused on the moral lessons of her books Brian Southam writes about these reviewers their job was merely to provide brief notices extended with quotations for the benefit of women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in knowing whether they would like a book for its story its characters and moral 

Famous writer Walter Scott wrote the longest and deepest of these reviews He was asked by publisher John Murray to review Emma Emma had come out in print in the March 1816 issue of the Quarterly Review Using the review as a way to praise the novel Scott praised Austens works He praised her ability to copy from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life and presenting to the reader a correct and striking broken wikt linkrepresentationrepresentation of that which is daily taking place around him Modern Austen scholar William Galperin has noted that unlike some of Austens lay readers who recognized her divergence from realistic practice as it had been prescribed and defined at the time Walter Scott may well have been the first to install Austen as the realist par excellence Scott wrote in his private journal in 1826 about Austen This later became a widely quoted comparison Also read again and for the third time at least Miss Austens very finely written novel of Pride and Prejudice That young lady had a talent for describing the broken wikt linkinvolvementinvolvement and feelings and characters of ordinary life which is to me the most wonderful I ever met with The Big Bow wow strain I can do myself like any now going but the exquisite touch which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and the sentiment is denied to me What a pity such a gifted creature died so early 

Northanger Abbey and Persuasion were published together in December 1817 They were reviewed in the British Critic in March 1818 and in the Edinburgh Review and Literary Miscellany in May 1818 The reviewer for the British Critic felt that Austens great use of realism was proof of a limited imagination The reviewer for the Edinburgh Review thought differently He praised Austen for her broken wikt linkexhaustlessexhaustless invention He was also pleased with Austens stories because they mixed familiar scenes with surprising twists Austen scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not know what to make of her works For example they wrongly understood her use of irony Reviewers thought Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice were stories of virtue overcoming vice

In the Quarterly Review in 1821 another review came out Richard Whately was an English writer and theologican He published the most serious early review of Austens work Whately compared Austen and great writers such as Homer and Shakespeare with favor He praised the dramatic quality of her stories He also said that the novel was a real respectable genre of literature He argued that imaginative literature especially broken wikt linknarrativenarrative was very valuable He even said they were more important than history or biography When it was well done as Austens works were Whately said that novels wrote about human experience that the reader could learn from In other words he believed that it was moral Whately also addressed Austens position as a female writer He wrote we suspect one of Miss Austins sic great merits in our eyes to be the insight she gives us into the peculiarities of female characters Her heroines are what one knows women must be though one never can get them to acknowledge it No better criticism of Austen was put in print until the late nineteenth century Whately and Scott had begun the Victorian eras view of Austen

Austen had a great number of readers who liked and respected her in the nineteenth century According to critic Ian Watt they liked her scrupulous fidelity to ordinary social experience However Austens works were not exactly what her Romantic and Victorian British audience liked They wished for powerful emotion be authenticated by an egregious display of sound and color in the writing Victorian critics and audiences liked the work of writers like Charles Dickens and George Eliot Compared to them Austens works seemed narrow and quiet Austens works were put in print again beginning in late 1832 or early 1833 Richard Bentley printed them in the Standard Novels series and remained in print for a long time after that However they were not bestsellers Southam describes her reading public between 1821 and 1870 as minute beside the known audience for Dickens and his contemporaries

The people who read Austen saw themselves as clever readers They were the broken wikt linkcultivationcultured few This became a well known theme of Austen criticism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries George Henry Lewes was a philosopher and literary critic He spoke about this theme in a series of articles in the 1840s and 1850s The Novels of Jane Austen was put in print in Blackwoods Magazine in 1859 In there Lewes praised Austens books for the economy of art the easy adaptation of means to ends with no aid from superfluous elements He also compared her to Shakespeare He argued that Austen was not good at making up plots However he still enjoyed the dramatic quality of her works He said The readers pulse never throbs his curiosity is never intense but his interest never wanes for a moment The action begins the people speak feel and act everything that is said felt or done tends towards the entanglement or disentanglement of the plot and we are almost made actors as well as spectators of the little drama

Writer Charlotte Bront liked Austens writing because they were truthful about everyday life However Bront called her only shrewd and observant She said there was not enough passion in her work To Bront Austens work seemed formal and narrow In a letter written to GH Lewes in 1848 Bront said that she did not like Pride and Prejudice She said

Soon after Austens works were printed in Britain they appeared in some European countries They began appearing in 1813 with a French translation of Pride and Prejudice It was quickly followed by German Dutch and Swedish editions They were not always easy to get in Europe Austen was not well known in Russia The first Russian translation of an Austen novel did not appear until 1967 Austens works were translated into various European languages However Europeans did not see her works as part of the English novel tradition This was partly because of the changes made by translators They put in sentimentalism into Austens works They also failed to put in her humor and irony Therefore European readers more often thought of Walter Scotts style as the English novel

The great changes made by her translators made the Continent receive Austen differently than in Britain For example the French writer Isabelle de Montolieu translated several of Austens novels into the French sentimental novel In Montolieus Pride and Prejudice broken wikt linklivelinesslively conversations between Elizabeth and Darcy were replaced by calm proper ones In Jane Austens work Elizabeth said that she has always seen a great similarity in the turn of their minds She says this is because they are unwilling to speak unless they expect to say something that will amaze the whole room However this becomes Moi je garde le silence parce que je ne sais que dire et vous parce que vous aiguisez vos traits pour parler avec effet Cossy and Saglia explained the equality of mind which Elizabeth takes for granted is denied and gender distinction introduced Austens works were seen in France as part of a sentimental tradition Because of this people were more interested in the works of French realists like Stendhal Balzac and Flaubert Austen was also treated as a romantic writer in Germany

For years people thought the same of Austen as Scott and Whately Only a few people actually read her novels In 1870 the first important Austen biography A Memoir of Jane Austen was written by Jane Austens nephew James Edward Austen Leigh and printed This changed the way people thought of Austen When it came out in print Austens popularity and critical standing increased greatly The Memoir made people think of an untrained writer who wrote broken wikt linkmasterpiecemasterpieces People thought Austen was a quiet middle aged unmarried aunt This made them feel that her works were safe for respectable Victorian families to read The Memoir made Austens books be printed again in great numbers The first popular editions came out in 1883 They were a cheap series printed by Routledge This was followed by editions with pictures collectors sets and scholarly editions However critics still said that only people who could really understand the deep meaning of Austens books should read them However after the Memoir was printed much more criticism about Austen was printed More came out in two years than had come out in the last 50 years

In 1913 William Austen Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen Leigh printed a family biography It was titled Jane Austen Her Life and LettersA Family Record William and Arthur were both part of the Austen family It was based mostly on family papers and letters It is described by Austen biographer Park Honan as broken wikt linkaccuracyaccurate staid broken wikt linkreliabilityreliable and at times vivid and suggestive The authors moved away from the sentimental tone of the Memoir However they did not go much beyond the family records and traditions they always had Therefore their book offers only facts It does not offer much interpretation

In the last part of the nineteenth century the first critical books about Austens works were printed In 1890 Godwin Smith printed the Life of Jane Austen This began a fresh phase in the critical broken wikt linkheritageheritage This began formal criticism People began focusing on Austen as a writer and analyzing the ways that made her writing special Southam said that there was much more Austen criticism around 1780 He also said that the reviews became better However he was troubled at the certain uniformity in them We see the novels praised for their elegance of form and their surface finish for the realism of their fictional world the variety and vitality of their characters for their pervasive humour and for their gentle and undogmatic morality and its unsermonising delivery The novels are prized for their perfection Yet it is seen to be a narrow perfection achieved within the bounds of domestic comedy Richard Simpson Margaret Oliphant and Leslie Stephen were some of the best reviewers In a review of the Memoir Simpson said Austen was a serious but ironic critic of English society He began two interpretative themes using humor to criticize society and irony as a means of moral study He continued Lewess comparison to Shakespeare and wrote that Austen began by being an ironical critic she manifested her judgment not by direct censure but by the indirect method of imitating and exaggerating the faults of her models Criticism humour irony the judgment not of one that gives sentence but of the mimic who quizzes while he mocks are her characteristics 

Simpsons essay was not well known It did not a lot of influence until Lionel Trilling quoted it in 1957 Margaret Oliphant was another important writer whose criticism of Austen did not have much influence She described Austen as armed with a fine vein of feminine cynicism full of subtle power keenness finesse and self restraint with an exquisite sense of the ridiculous a fine stinging yet soft voiced contempt whose works are very calm and cold and keen This kind of criticism was not fully developed until the 1970s This was when feminist literary criticism began

Austens works had been in print in the United States from 1832 However it was only after 1870 that Americans began seriously considering Austens works As Southam says for American literary nationalists Jane Austens cultivated scene was too broken wikt linkpalepallid too constrained too refined too downright unheroic Austen was not democratic enough for Americans Also her books did not have the frontier themes that often came out in American literature The way Americans thought about Austen was represented in an argument between William Dean Howells and Mark Twain Through his essays Howells helped make Austen much more popular Twain however used Austen to argue against the Anglophile tradition in America In his book Following the Equator Twain described the library on his ship Jane Austens books are absent from this library Just that one omission alone would make a fairly good library out of a library that hadnt a book in it

The Encyclopdia Britannicas changed the way they described Austen as she became more and more popular The eighth edition called her an elegant novelist The ninth edition praised her as one of the most distinguished modern British novelists Austen novels began to be studied at universities Her works also began to come out in histories of the English novel Most people still thought of her as dear aunt Jane the way she was first presented in the Memoir Howells had made this picture of Austen famous by his essays in the Harpers Magazine Writer and critic Leslie Stephen described a mania for Austen that grew in the 1880s as Austenolatry It was only after the the Memoir was printed that readers grew to like Austen as a person Until then literary elites had said their enjoyment of Austen showed how clever they were However around the 1990s they grew troubled at how popular Austens works became They began calling themselves Janeites They wanted to show that they were different from the people who they thought did not understand Austen properly

American novelist Henry James liked Austen Once he said she was as great as Shakespeare Cervantes and Henry Fieldingthe fine painters of life But James thought Austen was an unconscious artist who was instinctive and charming In 1905 James said he did not like the public interest in Austen He said it was more than Austens intrinsic merit and interest deserved James said that this was mostly because of the stiff breeze of the commercial the special bookselling spirits the body of publishers editors illustrators producers of the pleasant twaddle of magazines who have found their dear our dear everybodys dear Jane to their material purpose to pretty reproduction in every variety of what is called tasteful and in what seemingly proves to be salable form

Reginald Farrer a British travel writer did not like the sentimental image of Aunt Jane Instead he wanted to study Austens fiction in a new way In 1917 he published a long essay in the Quarterly Review Jane Austen scholar A Walton Litz called it the best single introduction to her works Southam calls it as a Janeite piece without the worship Farrer claimed that Jane Austen was not unconscious He said that she was a writer of great concentration and a sharp critic of her society He called her radiant and remorseless dispassionate yet pitiless with the steely quality the incurable rigor of her judgment Farrer was one of the first critics who saw Austen as a broken wikt linksubversivesubversive writer

The light of Austen scholarship was beginning to shine through several important early works These works helped Austen become well accepted in the broken wikt linkacademyacademy The first was Oxford Shakespearean scholar Andrew Cecil Bradleys 1911 essay This essay was generally regarded as the starting point for the serious academic approach to Jane Austen Bradley pointed out Austens ties to eighteenth century critic and writer Samuel Johnson He argued that she was a moralist as well as a humorist According to Southam this argument was totally original Bradley separated Austens works into early and late novels Scholars still separate Austens works as Bradley did today The second original early twentieth century critic of Austen was R W Chapman His edition of Austens works was the first scholarly edition of the works of any English novelist The Chapman edition has been the basis for all editions of Austens works after that

After Bradley and Chapman Austen scholarship grew very quickly in the 1920s British writer E M Forster pointed out Austens works for his idea of the round character It was with the 1939 publication of Mary Lascelles Jane Austen and Her Artthe first full scale historical and scholarly study of Austenthat the academic study of her works matured Lascelles included a short essay about her a study of the books Austen read and their influence on her writing and a study of Austens style and narrative art Lascelles felt that critics before her had all worked in a way so small that the reader does not see how they have reached their conclusions until he has patiently found his own way to them She wished to study all of Austens works style and techniques together Critics after Lascelles agreed that she studied them well Lascelles was interested in Austens connection to Samuel Johnson and her desire to discuss morality through fiction In this she was much like Bradley before her But around this time some fans of Austen began to worry that her works were being enjoyed by only a few people They were fearful that Austen was being criticized only by academics This was an argument that continued to the beginning of the twenty first century

Mid century revisionist views started to become popular and scholars began studying Austen more sceptically D W Harding adding to Farrer wrote an essay called Regulated Hatred An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen He argued that Austen did not support societys customs and that her irony was not funny but bitter He also claimed that Austen wanted to show the faults of the society she wrote about Through her use of irony Austen tried to protect herself as an artist and a person from the behavior and practices she disliked Almost at the same time British critic Q D Leavis printed Critical Theory of Jane Austens Writing in Scrutiny in the early 1940s In there Leavis argued that Austen was a professional not an amateur writer Hardings and Leaviss articles were followed by Jane Austen Irony as Defense and Discovery This was written by Martin Mudrick who saw Austen as lonely defensive and critical of her society He carefully described the connection between Austens attitude towards the literature of her time and how she used irony to show the difference of how society was and how she thought it could be An important British critic F R Leavis said in The Great Tradition that Austen was one of the great writers of English fiction Ian Watt agreed and helped shape the arguments about the genre of the novel The revisionist views and Leaviss words helped Austen to have a great reputation among academics They agreed that she combined Henry Fieldings and Samuel Richardsons qualities of interiority and irony realism and satire to form an author superior to both

After the Second World War people began studying Austen more deeply and in different ways A great number of people have studied Austen as a political writer Critic Gary Kelly explains Some see her as a political conservative because she seems to defend the established social order Others see her as sympathetic to radical politics that challenged the established order especially in the form of patriarchy some critics see Austens novels as complex criticizing aspects of the social order but supporting broken wikt linksteadystability and an open class hierarchy In Jane Austen and the War of Ideas perhaps the most important of these works Marilyn Butler argues that Austen was greatly influenced by the principal moral and political arguments of her time and that she had a partisan firmly conservative and Christian position in these arguments Alistair M Duckworth in The Improvement of the Estate A Study of Jane Austens Novels argues that Austen used the concept of the estate to symbolise all that was important about English society which should be conserved improved and passed down to future generations As Rajeswari Rajan notes the idea of a political Austen is no longer seriously challenged The questions scholars now study include the Revolution war nationalism empire class improvement of the estate the clergy town versus country abolition the professions female emancipation whether her politics were Tory Whig or radical whether she was a conservative or a revolutionary or occupied a reformist position between these extremes

In the 1970s and 1980s Austen studies was influenced by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubars The Madwoman in the Attic The Madwoman in the Attic explores the explosive anger of nineteenth century female English writers under their decorous surfaces This work together with other feminist criticism of Austen has made people see her as a woman writer The interest these critics showed in Austen made people discover and study other women writers in Austens time Also when Julia Prewitt Browns Jane Austens Novels Social Change and Literary Form Margaret Kirkhams Jane Austen Feminism and Fiction and Claudia L Johnsons Jane Austen Women Politics and the Novel were printed scholars were no longer able to argue that Austen was firmly apolitical or even conservative Kirkham for example said that Austens thought and that of Mary Wollstonecraft were quite similar She called them both Enlightenment feminists Johnson also places Austen in an eighteenth century political tradition However she notes the influence Austen received from the political novels of the 1790s written by women

In the late 1980s 1990s and 2000s ideological postcolonial and Marxist criticism dominated Austen studies Generating heated debate Edward Said devoted a chapter of his book Culture and Imperialism to Mansfield Park arguing that the peripheral position of Antigua and the issue of slavery demonstrated that colonial oppression was an unspoken assumption of English society during the early nineteenth century In Jane Austen and the Body The Picture of Health John Wiltshire explored the preoccupation with illness and health of Austens characters Wiltshire addressed current theories of the body as sexuality and more broadly how culture is inscribed on the representation of the body There has also been a return to considerations of aesthetics with D A Millers Jane Austen or The Secret of Style which connects artistic concerns with queer theory

Chess openings are listed and classified according to their first few moves There are some interesting statistics on the frequency of chess openings from chess data bases

These statistics show a movement away from symmetrical defences to asymetrical defences In particlular in reply to to 1e4 the Sicilian and French defences and to 1d4 the Indian defences Also particularly amongst strong players an increased use of the English Opening for White

There is no opening book for beginners The reason is that some degree of understanding is needed before the details of an opening can be grasped Books like the following show complete games with elementary explanations of the moves

None of these are suitable for beginners but might be used by chess teachers and players of intermediate strength Tip for teachers always check with book reviews

Unclaimed territory formally correct terra nullius is a word from International law It is used to talk about land which has never been under the rule of any state It can also be that the previous owner has given up their ownership This can be done either implicitly or explicitly There is also the term No mans land but it may have a slightly different meaning Rule over terra nullius can be obtained by occupying the territory

Two territories that are currently terra nullius are Bir Tawil between Egypt and Sudan and Marie Byrd Land in Antarctica

The Free State is a province of South Africa Its capital is Bloemfontein which is also South Africas judicial capital The current borders of the province date from 1994 when the Bantustans were destroyed and were put into the provinces of South Africa It is also the only one of the older provinces of South Africa not to undergo border changes not counting the incorporation of Bantustans

Bir Tawil or Bir Tawl is a small convert2060km0abbron area It is along the border between Egypt and Sudan It is claimed by neither country right now It is sometimes given the name the Land of the Vidya The longer side is in the north of the area It runs along the 22 north circle of latitude 

The administrative boundary of Sudan and Egypt was made in 1902 Their political boundary was set in 1899 It was set as the 22 north circle of latitude This area lies south of the 22 parallel East to west the area is between convert46kmmi long in the south It is convert95kmmi long in the north It is between convert26kmmi and convert31kmmi wide north to south It is also convert2060km2sqmiabbron in size 

The Bir Tawil area came under Egyptian administration in 1902 This was because it was grazing land of the Ababda tribe based near Aswan Egypt At the same time the Halaib Triangle north of latitude 22 north and northeast of the area came under Sudanese administration This was because the tribes of this area were based in Sudan The two triangles border at one point a quadripoint

In 1899 the Anglo Egyptian Condominium Agreement for Sudan set the border between the territories at the 22nd parallel At that time the United Kingdom ruled the area In 1902 the UK drew a separate administrative boundary Using this boundary a triangle of land north of the parallel was placed under Sudanese administration It was because its inhabitants were closer to Khartoum than Cairo both geographically and culturally The area was ruled by the British Governor in Khartoum

Egypt claims the original border from 1899 the 22 north circle of latitude This would place the Halaib Triangle within Egypt and the Bir Tawil area within Sudan Sudan claims the administrative border of 1902 This would put Halaib within Sudan and Bir Tawil within Egypt As a result both states claim the Halaib Triangle Neither state claims the much less valuable Bir Tawil area which is only a tenth the size and is landlocked There is no basis in international law for Sudan or Egypt to claim both territories It would also be difficult for any other state to claim the area This is because only Sudan or Egypt border the land As a result Bir Tawil is one of the few land areas of the world which is not claimed by any state

In the north of the area is the mountain Jabal Tawil It has a height of 459 meters In the east is Jabal ajar az Zarq It has a height of 662 meters

In the south is the Wadi Tawil near Nogaem Valley

Tarrasch was born in Breslau in Prussian Silesia He left in 1880 to study medicine and qualified as a physician He lived most of his life in Nuremberg Bavaria and later in Munich Tarrasch was born Jewish and converted to Christianity in 1909 He was a patriotic German who lost a son in World War I but he faced antisemitism in the early stages of Nazism

Tarrasch won more strong tournaments in the 1890s than any other player and drew a 22 game match against Mikhail Chigorin the leading Russian player Tarrasch was also an influential chess writer who summarised the chess ideas of the 1890s It was his ideas against which the hypermoderns reacted in the early 1920sp411

Occupied with his profession Tarrasch did not challenge Steinitz and turned down the young Emanuel Laskers request for a match This turned out to be a mistake for Lasker then challended Steinitz and won the world chess championship Later Tarrasch unsuccessfully challenged Lasker for the world championship in 1908 He was by then past his best though he continued to play in tournaments for many years His best result in later years was to reach the final pool in the strong St Petersburg 1914 tournament He came fourth behind Lasker Capablanca and Alekhine

Tarrasch was a highly esteemed chess writer His Dreihundert Schachpartien was a landmark it was the first best game collection with in depth annotations The notes were readable and could be understood by ordinary players This led to his being described as the praeceptor mundi which is Latin for teacher of the world The book was called by the American grandmaster Reuben Fine One of the monuments of our gamefw

Tarrasch regularly wrote tournament reports and notes for games in the Deutsch Schachzeitung the German language chess magazine These annotations were read throughout the world since that was the leading chess magazine of the day

Kwanzaa is a week long celebration held in the United States to honor universal African heritage and culture People light a kinara and give each other gifts It takes place from December 26 to January 1 every year It was created by Maulana Karenga and was first celebrated in 1966  1967 Non African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa The holiday greeting is Joyous Kwanzaa

Kwanzaa is a celebration that started in the black nationalist movement of the 1960s It was created as a way to help African Americans reconnect with their African cultural and historical heritage 

The name Kwanzaa comes from the Swahili phrase matunda ya kwanza meaning first fruits of the harvest 

During the early years of Kwanzaa Karenga said that it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas that Jesus was psychotic and that Christianity was a white religion that black people should shun However as Kwanzaa became more popular Karenga changed his position so that practicing Christians could also feel included He stated in the 1997 Kwanzaa A Celebration of Family Community and Culture Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday

Many Christian African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas

Kwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa or Nguzo Saba Karenga said that this is a communitarian African philosophy It consists of what Karenga called the best of African thought and practice in constant exchange with the world These seven principles comprise Kawaida a Swahili term for tradition and reason Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the following principles as follows

Kwanzaa symbols include a decorative mat on which other symbols are placed corn and other crops a candle holder with seven candles called a kinara a communal cup for pouring libations gifts a poster of the seven principles and a black red and green flag The symbols were designed to convey the seven principles

During Kwanzaa families also decorate their households with objects of art They use colorful African cloth such as kente especially the wearing of kaftans by women Fresh fruits that represent African idealism are also used It is normal to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors Libations are shared generally with a common chalice Kikombe cha Umoja passed around to all people present A Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections libations a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness reflection on the Pan African colors a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history a candle lighting ritual artistic performance and finally a feast The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is Habari Gani which is Swahili for Whats the News

Cultural exhibitions include the Spirit of Kwanzaa an annual celebration held at the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts featuring interpretive dance African dance song and poetry

Interventional radiology is defined as the branch of medicine that diagnoses and treats a wide range of diseases using actions that are performed through the skin or carried out with the least damage by x rays sonography and so on

Some of these procedures are done only for diagnostic purposes while others are done for treatment purposes Images are used to direct these procedures which are usually done with needles or other tiny instruments like small tubes called catheters The images provide road maps that allow the Interventional Radiologist to guide these instruments through the body to the areas containing diseases

Chess Olympiads are chess events open to all national teams They have been run since 1927 by the world chess organisation FIDE Since 1950 they have been run every two years Earlier events were all play all Then as numbers grew a system of qualifying sections were used In recent times the format has been a Swiss system This in chess terms is a method whereby opponents are chosen each round to have similar scores It has been widely used for individual tournaments 

Chess is a recognized sport by the International Olympic Committee with FIDE being the recognized International Sports Federation for chess since June 1999 As a member of the International Olympic Committee FIDE adheres to its rules including controversially having doping tests The prospects of chess becoming an Olympic sporting event at some future date remain unclear The naming of FIDEs team championship as the Chess Olympiad is of historical origin and implies no connection between this event and the Olympic Games

 In 1936 FIDE refused its approval on grounds of Nazi anti semitism however the organisers accepted Jewish players and many did play in the event

 In 1976 the USSR and other communist countries did not compete for political reasons

A Bayesian network is a kind of graph which is used to model events that cannot be observed This can then be used for inference The graph that is used is directed and does not contain any cycles The nodes of the graph represent random variables If two nodes are connected by an edge it has an associated probability that it will transmit from one node to the other

Bayesian networks are mainly used in the field of machine learning They have been used where information needs to be classified Examples are image document or speech recognition and information retrieval

It is based on Reverend Thomas Bayes discovery in the 1740s called Bayes theorem

The term Bayesian networks was made by Judea Pearl in 1985 to emphasize three aspects

In the late 1980s the seminal texts Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems and Probabilistic Reasoning in Expert Systems summarized the properties of Bayesian networks and helped to establish Bayesian networks as a field of study 

Informal variants of such networks were first used by legal scholar John Henry Wigmore in the form of Wigmore charts to analyse trial evidence in 1913Rp66 76dateMay 2009 Another variant called path diagrams was developed by the geneticist Sewall Wright and used in social and behavioral sciences

Animals that reproduce sexually use sexual intercourse to have offspring or massive squirting orgasms Sometimes sexual intercourse is called coitus or copulation and is more casually known as having sex or sleeping together In sexual intercourse the male reproductive organ enters the female reproductive tract The two animals may be of opposite sexes or they may be hermaphroditic as is the case with snails

Sexual intercourse between animals other than humans is often called mating Most animals only mate when the female is at the point of estrus which is the most fertile period of time in its reproductive cycle 

In certain animals sexual intercourse is not only used for reproduction but has taken other functions as well These animals include bonobos dolphins and chimpanzees which also have sexual intercourse even when the female is not in estrus and to engage in sex acts with same sex partners In most instances humans have sex primarily for pleasure This behavior in the above mentioned animals is also presumed to be for pleasure which in turn strengthens social bonds

Humans sometimes engage in behaviours that do not include the penetration of sexual organs such as oral intercourse or anal intercourse or by non sexual organs These behaviours are sometimes included in the definition of sexual intercourse 

Sexual intercourse with a partner of the same sex is called homosexual sex

Forcing someone to have sex who does not want to called rape is a serious crime in many countries

Sexual intercourse is the natural and most common way to make a baby It involves a man and woman having sex without birth control until the man ejaculates or releases semen from his penis into the womans vagina The semen containing sperm moves to the Fallopian tubes and if it finds an ovum on its way it will try to fertilize it If this works the now fertilized ovum sticks to the side of the uterus and the woman becomes pregnant The fertilized ovum then develops into a human Medically it is called a pregnancy until birth

Certain species of animals also have sex for other purposes than to bear offspring These include Humans bonobos chimpanzees and dolphins These species also are among those known to engage in homosexual behaviors In both humans and bonobos the female has a relatively concealed ovulation Neither male or female partners commonly know whether she is fertile at any given moment One reason for this may be that sex partners of these species form strong emotional bonds The partners come together for more than just sexual intercourse In the case of humans long term partnership is more important than immediate sexual reproduction

Humans bonobos and dolphins show cooperative behaviour In many cases this behaviour has shown better results than what an individual can achieve alone In these animals the use of sex has evolved beyond reproduction and has taken additional social functions Sex reinforces intimate social bonds between individuals Overall such cooperation also benefits each member of the group in that they are better able to survive

In humans sexual intercourse seems to serve three types of purposeswhich do not exclude one another

In the late 20th century very effective forms of contraception were developed allowing a man and women to help prevent a baby from being made One type of contraception is a condom This is a piece of rubber that covers the penis that a man can wear during intercourse which stops the mans semen from going into the womans vagina This does not always work though because the condom will rip or tear Another well known type of contraception is called the Pill which a woman takes every day When a woman is on the Pill she and her partner may have sex any time they wish with very little chance of making a baby Contraception allows people to keep sex for fun separate from sex to make children For example a fertile couple may use contraception to experience sexual pleasure At the same time this experience may strengthen their relationship and a stronger relationship may mean that they will better be able to raise children in the future

Who people like to have sex with depends on their sexuality Men who like to have sex with women and women who like to have sex with men are heterosexual or straight Men who only like to have sex with other men and women who only like to have sex with other women are homosexual or gay A different word to describe a woman who only likes to have sex with other women is lesbian Some people like both men and women which is called being bisexual

Some diseases can be caught by having sex These diseases are called sexually transmitted infections

Some examples of STIs include chlamydia syphilis and gonorrhoea A virus called HIV causes AIDS which cannot be cured and can lead to death

Using Latex condoms or oral dams reduce the chance that a few types of diseases will be passed on but it not entirely effective for all STIs Birth control can prevent pregnancy but wont prevent sexual infections

Some STIs can also be spread in ways other than having sex For example herpes simplex and hepatitis B could be caught by a virgin without having sex but can also be caught through sex Some types of STIs can spread from contact between the genitals mouth anus skin eyes and infected surfaces this depends a lot on the type of STI and how it spreads Some common diseases like HPV can cause warts and cancer in the genitals or anus or throat

There exists an HPV vaccine that prevents some sexually transmitted strains of HPV however the vaccine only works if you get vaccinated before becoming infected The vaccine is approved of for both men and women but is often not required in the US due to politics

There are many other kinds of sex Two of them are oral sex and anal sex

Oral sex is when one partner uses the tongue mouth or throat to excite the other partners sex organs

Slang for oral sex is common in Western cultures for example going down on giving a blowjob or giving head The technical term for oral sex is fellatio if performed on a male and cunnilingus if performed on a female When a man performs fellatio on himself it is called autofellatio

People can get sexually transmitted infections from oral sex such as herpesHIV and even oral cancer

Anal sex is when an erect penis or other device made for sexual pleasure is inserted into the sexual partners anus Anal sex with a female does not lead to pregnancy by itself however semen can leak out of the anus and enter into the vagina and pregnancy may rarely occur Anal sex can still pass sexually transmitted diseases from one partner to another It can also be very unhealthy for the body because the skin around the anus can tear bleed and get infected with bacteria For safety and pleasure partners often use a condoms female condoms andor lubrication

A painful sexual act is a condition of repeated or persistent genital pain before during or after sexual intercourse due to physical psychogenic and emotional causes Doctors call the condition as dyspareunia It occurs in women and men The condition affects up to one fifth of women at some point in their lives

Gerontology is the study of the social psychological and biological aspects of aging It is distinguished from geriatrics which is the branch of medicine that studies the disease of the elderly 

Gerontology includes these and other endeavors

Biogerontology is the subfield of gerontology dedicated to studying the biological processes of aging It includes Biomedical gerontology also known as experimental gerontology and life extension is a sub discipline of biogerontology that endeavors to slow prevent and even reverse aging in both humans and animals Curing age related diseases is one approach and slowing down the underlying processes of aging with the help of physical exercises is another Most life extensionists believe the human life span can be altered within the 21st century

Morphy was a Creole of mixed inheritance He was born in New Orleans Louisiana to a father of Portuguese Irish and Spanish ancestry and a mother who was a French Creole His father was a lawyer and his mother was musically talented Morphy grew up in an atmosphere of culture where chess and music were the typical highlights of a Sunday home gatheringp11

Morphy taught himself and by nine he was good by the standards of the local players At 12 he defeated the Hungarian professional Lwenthal in three casual games Then he played little chess until he had qualified in law in April 1857 He then entered the first American Chess Congress in New York and won it easily Next he accepted an invitation to play in a tournament in Birmingham England That started his famous European tour He beat everyone of note in England though Staunton avoided a match

In Paris he beat Harrwitz the house professional at the Caf de la Rgencep128 He then won easily against Anderssen who was a bit out of practice One of his feats was simultaneous play against five strong players winning two drawing two and losing one In summary he proved he was the best at that time On his return home he toured the East Coast cities accepting testimonials banquets and applause He wrote a chess column for a year in the New York Ledger in 185960 

Quick and simple development leading to a direct attack that was Morphys method His openings were first rate for their time He brought off some outstanding combinations and sacrifices and his best games are still a model for young players His games mark the high point of the romantic movement in chess where players would play all out for direct attacks This style was later squashed by better defensive technique especially for the black side in the openings Out of this came Dr Tarraschs classical principles and the idea that no game can be lost without a mistake being made The chess of the 1890s came to look quite different from Morphys games partly because he had forced players to think more clearly about what they were doing

Morphy soon gave up chess but his law practice was disrupted by the American Civil War He was opposed to secession and did not serve in the Confederate Army Morphy traveled to Havana and to Paris where he had a married sister but refused invitations to play in public His law practice never took off and he never worked or played chess again The last years of his life were marred by mental illness bordering on paranoiaChapter 24 He suffered from distrust obsessions and delusions and showed erratic behavior

Morphy died at 47 in his bathtub perhaps of a stroke He was the first of several great American players to have a short chess career Pillsbury died young reputedly of syphilis and Bobby Fischer like Morphy stopped voluntarily while still a young man Fischer showed symptoms of mental illness of a similar kind to Morphysp66

The word longevity is sometimes used as a synonym for life expectancy or to connote long life especially when it concerns someone or something lasting longer than expected

Longevity usually includes thinking about methods to extend life Longevity has been a topic not only for the scientific community but also for writers of science fiction and utopian novels

Longevity stories are cultural traditions and lore about exceptional human longevity with or without eternal youth These stories include sincere beliefs of claims of extreme age Each category of belief is based on a different motivation for claiming exceptional age

Stories of exaggerated longevity have been around since the earliest civilizations The first longevity narratives were probably the patriarchalmatriarchal claims which are often an attempt to link humans to the gods or to God due to fuller life In some religious traditions there are claims that if one follows a certain philosophy or practice one can become immortal or at least live to an extreme age

Fountain of Youth narratives describe some natural source that provides healing and particularly longevity and youthful health An extension and adaptation of the fountain of youth concept is the idea that a particular place rather than a substance carries what is needed to attain extreme age and that a person seeking extreme longevity needs to move to a special district

The US Census Bureau predicts that life expectancy in the United States will be in the mid 80s by 2050 and will top out eventually in the low 90s barring major scientific advances that can change the rate of human aging itself as opposed to merely treating the effects of aging as is done today The Census Bureau also predicted that the United States would have 53 million people aged over 100 in 2100 The United Nations has also made projections far out into the future up to 2300 at which point it projects that life expectancies in most developed countries will be between 100 and 106 years and still rising though more and more slowly than before However the UN has warned that these projections are uncertain and caution that any change or advancement in medical technology could invalidate their projections 



Judit and her two sisters were educated at home by their father She always preferred playing in the open events making it clear from the start that she wanted to become the true world chess champion regardless of gender This considerably annoyed the Hungarian Chess Federation which had visions of winning the Womens World Championship after decades of Soviet domination Paid substantial appearance fees by the Hungarian Chess Federationp106 the family did play in two female only events The Hungarians won the Womens Chess Olympiads with a team packed with Polgrs in 1988 and 1990p106 156 Zsuzsa Judit Sofia and Ildiko Madl were the team which pushed the Soviet Union into second place for the first time 

In 1994 Judit suffered a controversial defeat at the hands of then world champion Garry Kasparov the highest rated chessplayer of all time Kasparov changed his mind after making a losing move and then made another move instead According to chess rules once a player has released a piece she cannot make a different move so Kasparov should have been made to play his original move However Polgr did not challenge this because she says there were no witnesses and an arbiter was not around She was also unaware at the time that the re move was caught on tape by a television crew The tournament director was criticised for not forfeiting Kasparov when the videotape evidence was made available to him

In the event Polgar has not reached the top of the game and now is the mother of two children Nevertheless she has broken the gender barrier in chess she has proved that a woman can reach the top ten Her sister Susan Polgar who now lives in the USA did become Womens World Champion and also a full Grandmaster

Sorai rejected the moral ways of Song Confucianism and looked at the older works instead He argued that allowing human emotions to express themselves was important For this reason he tried to strengthen the position that Chinese literature had in Japan Sorai had a large following with his teachings and created the Sorai school which would become an influential force in Japanese Confucian scholarship

Sorai was born the second son of a samurai who served as the personal physician of Tokugawa Tsunayoshi Tsunayoshi would become the fifth shogun Sorai studied the Zhu Xi version of Song Confucianism and by 1690 he became a private teacher of Chinese classics In 1696 he started serving Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu a senior councilor to Tsunayoshi Tsunayoshi died in 1709 At that time Sorai stopped using the teachings of Zhu Xi and started to develop his own philosophy and school Sorai is credited with the creation of k shgi an unusual form of chess

Sorai wrote many influential works where he showed what he thought were the two basic problems of the philosophy of Song Confucianism The first was with the bakufu domain system which by the eighteenth century was in trouble Sorai doubted that it was enough that each person wanted to find their ethical good He argued that solving the political crisis of the time required more than perfecting moral character He also saw that the Chinese sage kings were not only concerned with morality but also with government itself The second point where Sorai disagreed with Song Confucianism was that he felt it was putting too much emphasis on morality and that it repressed human nature because human nature was based on emotion 

He felt that these weaknesses were not weaknesses of Confucianism in his view Song Confucianists interpreted the classic works of the Four Books and the Five Classics the wrong way In Soraius view they did this because they did not know the old words Sorai consulted the ancient works to get more reliable knowledge He stated that the ultimate form of scholarly knowledge was history For him these works were the best source even though the present was constantly changing Sorai thought that study of philosophy began with the study of language In this he was highly influenced by the Ancient Rhetoric school of the Ming period This movement saw the Qin and Han periods as the model for prose and the Tang period as a model for poetry The Sorai school introduced in Selections of Tang Poetry to Japan where it became very popular This work is thought to have been edited by Li Panlong who was a founder of the Ancient Rhetoric school As a result of this Sorais school is also known as the Ancient Rhetoric school today Sorais school saw Selections of Tang Poetry mainly as a means of accessing the Five Classics In this viewpoint it was different from other Confucianist schools Sorai would also accuse other Confucianists in Japan such as Hayashi Razan of relying too heavily on Song sources such as Zhu Xi

Sorai also did not agree with other teachings of Song Confucianism One was that the Way was not a predetermined principle of the universe but rather an establishment of men the ancient sages had described it in the Confucianist classic works These provided for the Way which was divided by rites and music The rites gave social order and music gave inspiration for the heart In this it directly allowed for the flow of human emotions something that the moralist philosophy of Song Confucianism did not agree with Sorai argued for the opposite and wanted people to be enriched through music and poetry He taught that literature should be cared for because it was an important part of human expression As a result Chinese writing began to thrive in Japan and became an accepted art form In this way several great writers of Chinese composition of that time were followers of his school

Sorai was a supporter of the samurai class While most old institution decline because of leadership problems the samurai he felt were best able to solve this problem with a system of rewards and punishment Sorai also saw problems with the merchant class at the time he accused them of conspiring to lock prices He did not support the lower classes either though He argued What possible value can there be for the common people to overreach their proper station in life and study such books as the Confucian classics

Master Sorais Teachings is a record of Sorais teaching and his exchanges with his students The text was edited by his own students and contained their questions followed by his answers The work was not released until 1724 but it is thought to have actually been written around 1720 In it he writes that literature is not so much intended for instruction in morality or governance rather it simply allows humans emotions to flow From this answers to the former topics may be found While Sorai sought to redefine the sources of Tokugawa legitimacy his purpose was clearly to strengthen the authority of the Tokugawa shogunate

Some scholars criticised Sorais work and found his teaching was impractical Goi Ransh believed that Sorai was motivated to surpass It Jinsai another leading Confucianist Goi thought that Sorai had used Its arguments to the level of absurdity Goi felt that Sorais teachings would cause a lot of damage to moral philosophy if they were followed Another scholar critical of Sorais teachings was Nakai Chikuzan who was also familiar with Gois opposition to Ogy Sorai Goi wrote his opposition to Sorai in his essay Hi Butsu hen This essay was written in the 1730s but not published until 1766 The published essay had been edited by Chikuzan and his brother Nakai later wrote his own highly emotional response to Sorais beliefs in his work Hi Ch In this work he rejected the idea that individuals could not improve themselves through moral choices He also claimed individuals were able judge if external ideas and actions were true or just Denial of these morals he felt would leave only rites and rules to be followed

Mercantilism is the name given to a number of economic systems that were present in most parts of Europe between the 16th and the 18th century The term was first used by Marquis de Mirabeau in 1763 Adam Smith made it known to a wider audience in 1766 At that time absolutism was the main form of government in Europe These regimes needed money to finance a large military as well as many people that worked in the government The monarchs and princes also needed money in order to finance their lifestyle These governments were also very nationalistic For this reason mercantilism is seen as a form of economic nationalism that holds that the prosperity of a nation is dependent upon its supply of capital and that the global volume of international trade is unchangeable Economic assets are represented by bullion held by the state which is best increased through a positive balance of trade with other nations

The theory assumes that wealth and monetary assets are identical Mercantilism suggests that the ruling government should advance these goals by playing a protectionist role in the economy by encouraging exports and discouraging imports notably through the use of tariffs and subsidies The theory dominated Western European economic policies from the 16th to the late 18th century

Maimonides was a doctor by profession Maimonides was one of the most important Jewish philosophers of the Middle Ages He tried to show that the philosophy of the ancient Greek thinker Aristotle and Judaism supported each other

Maimonides main philosophical work was called The Guide for the Perplexed He wrote it in Arabic by 1190 It has ideas from Aristotles writings The Guide influenced Christian Aristotelian theologians for example Thomas Aquinas In 1168 Maimonides finished a commentary to the Mishnah the written version of traditional Jewish oral law Maimonides completed these books called Mishneh Torah in about 1178 They one of the most important collections of Jewish laws 

When Maimonides was thirteen years old the Almohads took over Cordoba The Almohads were Muslims who were taking over parts of Europe at the time They forced all non Muslims to leave change their religion to Islam or be killed This forced Maimonides family to leave Cordoba They spent twelve years traveling and looking for a home During these years he wrote the commentary on the Mishnah Finally his family settled in Cairo Egypt In 1166 Maimonides father died and his brother drowned on a shipwreck in the Indian Ocean 

By this time Maimonides was a very popular Jewish leader He helped the Jewish community in Cairo Egypt He lived there for the last part of his life and taught and wrote about Judaism He died in Cairo on December 13 1204

Francis Harry Compton Crick OM FRS was a British physicist and biologist

He is one of those who worked out the structure of DNA Using X ray crystallography results from Maurice Wilkins biophysics team at Kings College London Crick and James Watson discovered that DNA has what is called a double helix structure 

This means that there are two spirals in DNA that have information DNA is the basis of heredity for almost all forms of life today

Crick Watson and Wilkins won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1962 Their work sparked a huge amount of research in molecular and cell biology and as a result many subsequent Nobel awards have been made

During the mid to late 1950s Crick helped sort out the way proteins are synthesized In 1958 Cricks listed all the key features of the protein synthesis process

The adaptor molecules were eventually shown to be tRNAs and the catalytic ribonucleic protein complexes became known as ribosomes An important step was later realization that the messenger RNA was not the same as the ribosomal RNA 

The next fundamental question was the exact nature of the genetic code In his 1958 article Crick speculated as had others that a triplet of nucleotides could code for an amino acid Crick also used the term central dogma to summarize an idea that implies that genetic information flow between macromolecules would be essentially one way

In his thinking about the processes linking DNA genes to proteins Crick made clear the distinction between the materials involved the energy required and the information flow Crick was focused on this third component and it became the organizing principle of what became known as molecular biology 

In the final phase of his career Crick and Christof Koch published a series of articles on consciousness

Crick decided to focus his work on how the brain generates visual awareness within a few hundred milliseconds of viewing a scene Cricks book The Astonishing Hypothesis made the argument that neuroscience now had the tools required to begin a scientific study of how brains produce conscious experiences

The Francis Crick Institute is a planned 660000000 biomedical research centre to be located in London The Francis Crick Institute is a partnership between Cancer Research UK Imperial College London Kings College London the Medical Research Council University College London and the Wellcome Trust Once completed in 2015 it will be the biggest centre for biomedical research and innovation in Europe

Motion blindness is a medical condition where a person cannot see objects that are moving even though they can see the objects that do not move The condition seems to be very rare and related to the nerves It may also be psychological There is currently no treatment for this condition A lot of information about this condition comes from different case studies done between 1913 and 2003 Most of what is known is from a single patient called LM LM was a 43 year old woman who was treated in a hospital in 1978 after she had suffered a stroke 

Currently motion blindness is thought to be caused by a change to the regions of the brain that are responsible for sight This change is usually a result of damage done to the brain and affects the way the brain decodes visual information It is possible that only visual motion processing is affected because this is done in a separate area of the brain which is different from the area that does motion processing in general The same can happen to the perception of color that is the patient can have a form of color blindness which is known as achromatopsia Unlike most other forms of color blindness which are caused by changes in the eye this one is caused by changes in the brain 

People who suffer from motion blindness have normal vision They can see different objects sharply can tell the distance between them and they see the different colors the objects might have This applies to shapes objects and faces They do however not see the objects move Besides simple perception akinetopsia also disturbs motoric tasks which rely on visual perception such as reaching for objects and catching objects When doing tasks feedback of ones own motion appears to be important

Patients with akinetopsia have problems with many tasks in their daily life One patient LM described pouring a cup of tea or coffee difficult because the fluid appeared to be frozen like a glacier She did not know when to stop pouring because she could not perceive the movement of the fluid rising LM and other patients have also complained of having trouble following conversations because lip movements and changing facial expressions were missed LM stated she felt insecure when more than two people were walking around in a room people were suddenly here or there but I have not seen them moving LM and others have described crossing the street and driving cars to also be of great difficulty

Currently three conditions are known that cause motion blindness

The Battles of Lexington and Concord were the first battles of the American Revolutionary War They were between British soldiers who wanted to take away the colonists weapons and arrest John Hancock and Samuel Adams and American colonists They were fought in towns outside Boston Massachusetts

The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as traditional until the reign of Emperor Kammu who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty

Sushun had one Empress and two Imperial children

The emperors first minister was his powerful uncle Soga no Umako Sushun planned to remove the head of the Soga clan from his office When the plan was discovered Umako ordered someone to murder Sushun In the early history of Japan this is the second time that an emperor is murdered

This emperors official name after his death was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Sushun 

According to the Imperial Household Agency the emperors final resting place is in an earthen tumulus Sushun is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine which is associated with the burial mound

No 3 Fighter Sector was a Royal Australian Air Force unit during World War Two No 3FS was responsible for fighter aircraft control and coordination for the Townsville region 3FS would collect all of the intelligence information from the various DF stations and VAOC posts decide on the what needed to be done and then tell the fighter or bomber squadrons to respond 3FS was in telephone and radio contact with all of the anti aircraft searchlight RDF and HFDF stations in the Townsville area

It was first set up at Townsville Grammar School on 25 February 1942 The Womens Auxiliary Australian Air Force members of 3FS lived at St Annes Girls School Townsville In 1942 a new headquarters for No 3FS was built at Wulguru Townsville The site was a proper military camp site with its own power house barracks kitchens toilets and recreation hall There were as many as 62 different buildings in 3FS HQ The camp was on the side of a hill near Mt Stuart on the west side of the road to Charters Towers It can still be seen today on the hill on the opposite side of the Stuart Shopping Centre

No 3FS was renamed 103 Fighter Control Unit on 7 March 1944 The Stuart complex was complete and ready to use on 20 December 1944 The main operations building was a bunker made of 30 centimetre thick reinforced concrete designed to withstand a direct bomb hit It had a mezzanine floor and was air conditioned 3 Fighter Sector Headquarters had 32 rooms in the large rectangular concrete building with walls forming various passageways The building still stands today and is 60 by 42 feet All air raid warnings were started from this bunker by red yellow and white flares There was also HQ located in North Ward Townsville 103 FCU was disbanded in Townsville on 21 January 1945

After the war the buildings were used to house new migrants to Australia The buildings were still furnished at the time In 1961 it was purchased by James Cook University of Queensland and was used as a temporary accommodation for students while their residential halls were being built The bunker itself still had its communication and signals equipment A few years later the inside of the bunker was destroyed by fire In 1971 the rest of the buildings were demolished The site is now owned by the Department of Environment and Resources

In 1999 a group of people had been raising money and getting the right equipment to fix this bunker after it was burned and destroyed by fire They wanted to turn it into a museum The Department of Environment and Resources have said that the building is not safe In 2009 the bunker was fenced off 

Many people in Townsville believe that the bunker may still have ammunition and chemical weapons left over from the war They also think that the bunker is part of a network of tunnels built during the war in the hills around Townsville The Department of Defence has said that neither of these claims are true

The Mariinsky Theatre is a famous theatre of opera and ballet in Saint Petersburg Russia It was opened in 1860 and soon became the most important theatre for opera and ballet in Russia Many great operas and ballets of the 19th century were first performed there including the greatest stage works by Tchaikovsky Mussorgsky and Rimsky Korsakov

The Mariinsky Theatre is home to the Mariinsky Ballet Mariinsky Opera and Mariinsky Orchestra The conductor Valery Gergiev has been the general director there since 1988

The theatre is named after Empress Maria Alexandrovna wife of Tsar Alexander II There is a bust of the Empress in the main entrance hall The theatres name has changed several times during its history because of different political parties that were in power

The theatre building is commonly called the Mariinsky Theatre The companies that use it have kept the famous Kirov name which it got during the Soviet period in honour of the murdered Leningrad Communist Party leader Sergey Kirov

The first ballet groups to perform in St Petersburg were Italian ballet dancers in the early 18th century Catherine the Great wanted a Russian theatre to be built It was built in 1783 It was called Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre The building we see today dates from 1860 It opened with a performance of Glinkas opera A Life for the Tsar It was called the Mariinsky Theatre named after the Empress Maria Alexandrovna The great choreographer Marius Petipa put on the first performances of many famous ballets such as Tchaikovskys The Sleeping Beauty in 1890 The Nutcracker in 1892 Alexander Glazunovs ballet Raymonda in 1898 and an updated version of Tchaikovskys Swan Lake in 1895

When the theatre became the main home of the Imperial Ballet and Opera in 1886 the theatre was improved Many operas were performed there including first performances of Mussorgskys Boris Godunov Rimsky Korsakovs The Golden Cockerel Tchaikovskys The Queen of Spades and Iolanthe Prokofievs Romeo and Juliet and Cinderella and Khachaturians Spartacus were also produced there

The imperial and Soviet theater was the home of many great impresarios conductors and musicians The Vaganova Academy of Russia Ballet the ballet school of the Mariinksy Theatre started the careers of Mathilde Kschessinskaya Olga Preobrajenskaya Anna Pavlova Tamara Karsavina Vaslav Nijinsky Marina Semenova George Balanchine Galina Ulanova Rudolf Nureyev Natalia Makarova Mikhail Baryshnikov Irina Kolpakova Galina Mezentseva Altynai Asylmuratova and in more recent times famous dancers like Ulyana Lopatkina Diana Vishneva and Svetlana Zakharova

Yuri Temirkanov was Principal Conductor from 1976 to 1988 He conducted many modern and classical operas  Since 1988 Valery Gergiev has brought even more fame to the theatre It has now got links with many of the worlds great opera houses including the Royal Opera House Covent Garden the Metropolitan Opera the Opra Bastille La Scala La Fenice the Tel Aviv Opera the Washington National Opera and the San Francisco Opera Today the Opera Company regularly tours to most of these cities

The Port of Hull is a major sea port in the city of Kingston upon Hull East Riding of Yorkshire England The port is located on the River Humber which leads to the North Sea Around one million passengers use the port to get to Rotterdam The Netherlands and Zeebrugge Belgium The port is used for the import of timber in the United Kingdom The port has its own goods railway which is used to transport cargo inland

The remaining docks are only the larger ones in the East of the city Until the 1960s there were some in the city centre such as Humber Dock which became Hull Marina and Junction Dock which is now the site of Princes Quay shopping centre The Old Dock was filled in and is now Queens Gardens St Andrews Dock was closed off and silted up the Victoria Dock closed in the 1980s and is now a housing estate the Railway Dock closed in the 1960s and was later used as an extension to the Hull Marina

The Albert and William Wright Dock is still used for cargo The fishing industry has also been moved there The Alexandra Dock closed in the 1980s but soon reopened It is now also used for cargo The King George and Queen Elizabeth Docks are used for passengers

The Saint Petersburg Conservatory is a famous music school in Saint Petersburg Russia Its full name is NA Rimsky Korsakov Saint Petersburg State Conservatory In 2004 the conservatory had around 275 teaching members and 1400 students

The conservatory was founded in 1862 by the Russian pianist and composer Anton Rubinstein When he resigned in 1867 he was followed by Nikolai Zaremba The great composer Rimsky Korsakov joined the teaching staff in 1871 The conservatory was named after him in 1944 

In 1887 Rubinstein returned to the Conservatory to try to improve it Students who were not very good had to leave and he also got rid of some of the professors and made the entrance examinations harder He resigned again in 1891

The building we see today was built in the 1890s where the Bolshoi Theatre of Saint Petersburg had stood It still has the grand staircase and landing from that historic theatre As the city changed its name in the 20th century the conservatory was renamed Petrograd Conservatory and then the Leningrad Conservatory

Today it is a famous Russian composition school whose graduates have included great composers such as Pyotr Tchaikovsky Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich During the 1960s Shostakovich taught at the conservatory which made it even more famous

Tal played in 21 Soviet championships winning it six times a record only equalled by Botvinnik He was a member of eight Soviet teams which won the gold medal in chess Olympiads He won the individual gold medal five times

He holds the records for both the first and second longest unbeaten streaks in competitive chess historyp43 Many authorities consider him to have been the greatest attacking player of all time

Tal won the strong 1958 Interzonal tournament and the Candidates tournament in Yugoslavia 1959 In the Candidates he finished first with 2028 points ahead of Paul Keres with 185 followed by Tigran Petrosian Vasily Smyslov Bobby Fischer Svetozar Gligori Fririk lafsson and Pal Benko Tal he won all four individual games against Fischer and took 3 points out of 4 from each of Gligori Olafsson and Benko This shows his complete dominance over the less strong players

In 1960 at the age of 23 Tal defeated Mikhail Botvinnik in the Moscow World Championship match by 12585 This made him the youngest ever world champion a record later broken by Garry Kasparov Botvinnik who had never faced Tal before won the return match against Tal in 1961 by 138 Between the matches Botvinnik thoroughly analyzed Tals style and turned most of the return matchs games into close manoeuvres and endgames rather than the complicated tactical meles which were Tals preference

Tals short reign atop the chess world made him one of the two so called winter kings who interrupted Botvinniks long reign from 1948 to 1963

Tal played in a total of six Candidates tournaments and match cycles though he never again earned the right to play for the world title In 1962 at Curaao he had serious health problems having undergone a major operation shortly before the tournament and had to withdraw three quarters of the way through scoring just seven points from 21 games 

Poor health was part of his life Tal was an alcoholic and a chain smokerp409 At 23 he had a diseased kidney and his health became uncertain He recovered much of his form when after some years the kidney was removed

Eleven years after he lost the world championship he had a record sequence of results From July 1972 to April 1973 Tal played 86 consecutive games without a loss Between 23 October 1973 and 16 October 1974 he played 95 consecutive games without a loss shattering his previous record These are the two longest unbeaten streaks in modern chess history

Tal was a charming and brilliant man who was always willing to talk about chess with players of all standards His early death was much mourned though it was not unexpected The Mikhail Tal Memorial tournament is held in Moscow each year since 2006 to honour his memory

The extent of Tals alcoholism was quite astonishing Vlastimil Hort the top Czech player of the 1960s and 70s has given a vivid account Hort played at the Moscow tournament of 1963 which had many of the top Russians When he was due to play Tal his opponent showed up very late and drunk He almost fell asleep at the board Tal staggered away from the board and returned with shaking hands and unable light a cigarette Hort later finds out that Tal had been grabbed by other Russians and doused with cold water Tal still managed to draw the game

Tal was an outstanding commentator on his games These have been translated into English

The Game port is a port that is present on some PC hardware and hardware similar to it This port lets the connection of analog devices used to control computer games such as joysticks In most relevant hardware designs for personal computers in 2010 the port is an integrated component on the sound card another IO card or the motherboard itself Starting with Windows Vista Microsoft no longer supports this port with drivers from the Operating System but third party drivers are still available There are also drivers that allow to map the game port to an USB device 

Unlike most other ports present on the PC the Game port is an analog port This means that signal first needs to be changed to digital form a task which is usually done by an analog to digital converter In the early days most joystick designs were digital which made them easier to build and cheaper The game port has a 15 pin DSUB interface most home computers that used digital joysticks had a 9 pin one This made existing joysticks incompatible with the new interface 

Digital joysticks are easy for programmers to access The signal is already digital and only gets transferred to the PC Analog signals are much harder to use they need careful software interrupt driven programming Interrupts use the main CPU of the system Digital circuits can use Transistortransistor logic which does not use the CPU

The usual implementation of a game port uses a capacitor and a simple voltage comparator Both together form a sort of simple ramp compare ADC This system is polled periodically and reset at precise moments to read an input This must be done more than 30 times every second to provide a responsive game input The actual acquisition frequency and value usually depend on the joysticks resistance inside noise CPU speed and the total joystick capacitors RC time constant

Its analog nature has also been the cause of a great number of problems One problem was that all kinds of joysticks needed calibration This was true even for arcade style ones The reason for this was that no game controller and no joystick produced the same measurements each time These depended on the exact way acquisition was made Some of the worse designs even depended on the speed of the CPU Also all kinds of PC game ports suffer from electrical noise

The calibration procedure is still needed at some point even under modern operating systems such as Windows XP Usually it consists of moving the joystick around all of its axes to measure the maximum axis excursion values no matter if the joystick uses analog signals or digital signals USB joysticks on the other hand do not need calibration This is because USB sends digital signals

In the days of DOS every game using the game port had to do its own calibration often each time the game started and some poorly coded calibration routines even failed to work consistently and properly rendering some joysticks unusable with some games With Windows XP only one calibration per joystick is enough which is thought valid until the joystick is unplugged

Certain applications and games are able to use some analog joysticks even without explicit calibration under certain restricted conditions A system of a joystic and game port that is not calibrated can give a direction at best It can not give an intensity For this setup an analog joystick can be self calibrated just by leaving the joystick in the middle position and taking a measurement and then using some arbitrary or adaptive threshold to detect movement and excursion from the middle position The limitation of this method is that the reading of the same joystick over the same game port can change over time and some joysticks cannot work at all with this method Also the joystick must be in the middle position at least once when the implicit self calibration takes place even if this is not directly stated

Microsoft declared it would no longer include support for game ports in operating systems beginning with MS Windows XP Professional x64 edition reasoning that USB based gaming equipment had become more common This leaves game port support up to the manufacturer of the device the game port ships on

Some advanced game port joysticks supports more than 4 buttons but typically require a special device driver for the additional buttons to work properly since the game port does not have actual hardware support for more than 4 distinct buttons 

This can be overcome by using pins and input meant for the second joystick using some normally unused pins or changing the joysticks circuits to read a 4 bit state code from the four button inputs thus giving up to 16 button combinations or a combination of both techniques

High end game port joysticks such as the Microsoft SideWinder rely on multiplexing a proprietary data stream through the 4 standard button inputs and sometimes through the unused pins achieving full support for a rather high number of buttons while special features such as daisy chaining multiple joysticks force feedback or joystick programming become possible in some cases

The obvious drawback is the need for a special device driver to interpret the joystick input and making its use time consuming and operating system dependent while the joystick is usually unusable without a special driver

Some hardware and DIY enthusiasts have found ways to connect a wide array of input devices to the game port and even found other applications for it such as voltage or current measurement or simple interfacing and data acquisition

The original game port design by IBM initially allowed four analog axes and four buttons on one port allowing two joysticks or four paddles to be connected although this required a special Y splitter cable and is not fully supported by some combined midigame ports usually found on sound cards

Some poorly implemented game ports did not fully support either 4 axes or 4 buttons making only the use of a single 2 axis and 2 button joystick possible

The 15 pin game port is no longer provided on presently manufactured PCsCitation neededdateFebruary 2010 though adapters exist that allow older joysticks and controllers to connect via USB However Microsofts Vista operating system natively lacks all game port support even for USB adaptersCitation neededdateFebruary 2010

Game ports use DA 15 connectors Since the game port moved from dedicated expansion cards to sound cards about 1990 these connectors usually double as connectors for MIDI instruments two of the redundant 5V and GND pins of the original standard were rededicated to MIDI input and output to make this possible To use a game port with MIDI instruments one requires a cable with a male and a female DA 15 and two male 5 pin DIN connectors The drivers and hardware for the game port midi capabilities are based around the now standard Roland MPU 401 MIDI interface and support most MPU 401 standard applications for Windows and DOS The official proper design for a game port MIDI adapter can be found at this MIDI page

A Clinical trial is one of the steps needed to introduce a new drug or therapy Depending on the drug either volunteers or patients suffering from a disease or condition are enrolled in a study In general a number of the people taking part will receive the real drug or a good treatment and the rest of the people will receive a treatment or drug that has no effect called a placebo These tests are statistical tests

Examples of study designs

Clinical trials were first introduced in Avicennas The Canon of Medicine in 1025 AD where he laid down rules for the experimental use and testing of drugs He wrote a precise guide for practical experimentation in the process of discovering and proving the effectiveness of medical drugs and substances He laid out the following rules and principles for testing the effectiveness of new drugs and medications which still form the basis of modern clinical trials

One of the most famous clinical trials was James Linds demonstration in 1747 that citrus fruits cure scurvy He compared the effects of various different acidic substances ranging from vinegar to cider on groups of afflicted sailors and found that the group who were given oranges and lemons had largely recovered from scurvy after 6 days

Frederick Akbar Mahomed who worked at Guys Hospital in London made substantial contributions to the process of clinical trials during his detailed clinical studies where he separated chronic nephritis with secondary hypertension from what we now term essential hypertension He also founded the Collective Investigation Record for the British Medical Association this organization collected data from physicians practicing outside the hospital setting and was the precursor of modern collaborative clinical trials

Paul Keres was an Estonian chess grandmaster From about 1937 to 1962 he was one of the top four players in the world

Keres narrowly missed a chance at a World Chess Championship match on five occasionsp197 He came equal first in the 1938 AVRO tournament which led to negotiations for a world championship match with Alexander Alekhine but the match never took place due to World War II Instead he played a 14 game match with ex World Champion Max Euwe in the Netherlands December 1939 January 1940 Keres won a hard fought struggle by 7565 This was a superb achievement not only was Euwe a former World Champion but he had enormous experience at match play far more than Keres 

Estonia had enjoyed independence after World War I but was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 Keres came second to Botvinnik in the 1941 LeningradMoscow Absolute Championship of the USSR Soon Estonia was annexed again this time by the Nazi forces After the war it was seized again by the Soviet Union

After the war he took part in the 1948 World Championship match tournament of five top players which decided the successor to Alekhine This was won by Botvinnik and Keres came equal third with Reshevsky He was then the runner up in the Candidates tournament on four consecutive occasions 1953 1956 1959 and 1962 Keres won the USSR championship three times in 1947 1950 and 1951 The latter was probably the strongest ever Soviet championship it had ten other players who had played in Candidates tournaments three of whom won the world title

Keres played for the USSR in seven successive Chess Olympiads wining seven team medals and five individual board medals Due to these and other strong results many commentators consider Keres to be the strongest player never to become World Chess Champion He was nicknamed The Crown Prince of Chessp198

Keres was always a man and never missed the opportunity to say he was an Estonian not a Russian When he played at the annual Hastings tournament in 195455 a KGB man sat on a chair outside his room at night He was there to prevent the grandmaster being disturbed Pauls demeanor at the board was always totally calm From looking at him you couldnt tell how much time he had left or what kind of position he had He had mastered the art of self control and his nickname amongst other players was Old Stoneface 

Botvinnik thought his death was the greatest loss suffered by chess since the death of Alekhine In his opinion Keres failed to reach the top because of a tendency to fade somewhat at decisive moments in the strugglep198 A rumour that the Soviets had persuaded him to lose deliberately to Botvinnik in the 1948 World Championship has no evidence to back it up 

Keres memorial tournaments are held in Tallinn every two years

Anne of Austria Anne dAutriche in French was Queen consort of France and Navarre She also acted as a regent for her son Louis XIV of France During her regency Cardinal Mazarin served as Frances chief minister

The birth of Anne of Austria was at Benavente Palace in Valladolid Spain She came into the world just five days before her future husband Louis XIII She was baptized Ana Mara Mauricia She was the oldest daughter of Habsburg parents Philip III of Spain and Margaret of Austria She was called the Infanta of Spain and of Portugal Archduchess of Austria Princess of Burgundy and of the Low Countries Annes mother died early at the Valladolid She died after giving birth to a third daughter Marguerite Anne was 11 years old when she was betrothed to Louis XIII Her father Philip gave her a dowry of 500000 crowns He also gave her a great number of beautiful jewels They had some fears that Louis XIII would die early Annes father said that if this happened Anne must return to Spain with her dowry jewels and wardrobe Shortly after on November 1615 Anne and Louis were married separately but to one another This is called a proxy marriage They were both 14 years old

Louiss mother Marie de Medici continued to be the Queen of France She did not discuss things with her daughter in law Anne with her Spanish ladies in waiting continued to live according to Spanish custom She failed to improve her French

The duc de Luynes tried to make the queen and king closer He sent away the Spanish ladies and hired French ones instead Some of the more famous ones are the princesse de Conti and Marie de Rohan Montbazon the duchesse de Chevreuse She was his wife He also organized court events that would bring the queen and king together more happily Anne began to dress in the French manner

However a number of wretched miscarriages again made their relations cold On 14 March 1622 while playing with her ladies Anne fell on the stairs She suffered her second miscarriage Louis angrily blamed her He was also upset with Mme de Luynes for not being careful enough After this the King grew to dislike the influence the duchesse de Luynes had over Anne He disliked the duchesse even more when Luynes died Anne remained without a child for 16 more years

Through his life Louis had a cool behavior towards Anne He was always fearful that his wife had a great passion for the interests of Spain In 1625 the English George Villiers 1st duke of Buckingham shocked the French court by admitting his passion for Anne Madame de Motteville said that if a respectable woman could love a man other than her husband it would have been Buckingham

Surprisingly while there was such a strain between Anne and Louis at this time Anne suddenly had a baby Suspicious people suggested that Cardinal Richelieu was the childs parent Another more likely suggestion was that there was one night with a storm that stopped Louis from going to Saint Maur and made him sleep with the queen instead This was the night of 5 December 1637 However the official newspaper the Gazette de France does not mention if they slept in the same room

A royal birthing bed was made ready It was three feet wide and had two long sticks made of wood for Anne to hold while she was giving birth to her baby On 4 Saturday September Anne finally went into labor She gave birth in the sight of the court This was so that if her child was a boy it would not be changed for a girl or a living baby to a dead one The child was safely delivered The Gazette de France called it a marvel when it was least expected and Anne had a son for the first time in 22 years

The queens joy in Louis was very great One of her servants said She takes great joy in playing with him it is her great pleasure in life There are a great number of suggestions as why she did not show such a great love for Monsieur her second son

Almost exactly two years after Louis Anne had another son Philippe He was born on 22 September 1640 He was known as Monsieur This was the official title for the kings second son

It is said that Anne of Austria died from breast cancer in a convent Her lady in waiting Madame de Motteville wrote the story of the queens life in her Mmoires dAnne dAutriche

Death of a Salesman is a 1949 tragedy play which was written by Arthur Miller 

Willy Loman  Willy is the main character of the play He is 63 years old and he is a terrible salesman He has a flawed vision of the American Dream that if someone is well liked they can succeed He often cannot tell the difference between fantasy and reality He does not like change and he often day dreams about the past He tries several times to kill himself so that the insurance money can go to his children

Linda Loman  The wife of Willy She gives the family strong emotional support during the tough times when the family needs it the most She defends her husband Willy when her children start complaining about him 

Biff Loman  Biff is the 34 year old son of Willy and Linda He was well liked during high school but he did not graduate During high school he developed a habit of stealing things which would later get him fired from several jobs Biff eventually realizes that Willys vision of the American Dream is wrong and he often argues against him He wants to go out west to Texas and start a farm

Harold Loman  Harold is usually called by his nickname Happy the word happy is used with sarcasm Happy has always lived in the shadow of his older brother Biff who was more popular and likable than he is His parents usually do not pay attention to him and act like he is invisible Happy believes in Willys incorrect vision of the American Dream and is at risk of becoming just like his father 

The Woman  The woman is Willys mistress While Biff and Happy were in high school Willy Loman cheated on his wife and had a relationship with the woman

Charley  Charley is one of Willys only true friends Charley offers Willy a job but Willy refuses He felt bad for Willys bad financial situation so he gives Willy money each week that Willy pretends is his pay

Bernard  Bernard is the son of Charley While Bernard was in high school Willy made fun of him for studying too hard and said that he was liked but not well liked  Bernard became a successful lawyer who got to argue a case in front of the US Supreme Court

Ben  Ben is Willys brother who passed away Willy in his daydreams sees Ben as a person who entered the jungles of Africa at age 17 and came out of Africa as a very rich man

The theme of Death of a Salesman is Millers criticism of capitalism and he tries to express that the American Dream does not happen to everybody He also tries to express that being well liked is not enough to succeed because success requires skill also

Ditheism is the doctrine or belief that there are two independent divine beings or eternal principles one good and the other evil Examples of ditheism include Zoroastrianism Wicca and Marcionism It is the same as bitheism duotheism and sometimes dualism

The continuum hypothesis is a hypothesis that there is no set that is both bigger than that of the natural numbers and smaller than that of the real numbers Georg Cantor stated this hypothesis in 1877

There are infinitely many natural numbers the cardinality of the set of natural numbers is infinite This is also true for the set of real numbers but there are more real numbers than natural numbers We say that the natural numbers have infinite cardinality and the real numbers have infinite cardinality but the cardinality of the real numbers is greater than the cardinality of the natural numbers

This hypothesis is the first problem on the list of 23 problems David Hilbert published in 1900 Kurt Gdel showed in 1939 that the hypothesis cannot be falsified using ZermeloFraenkel set theory The ZermeloFraenkel set theory is the set theory commonly used in mathematics Paul Cohen showed in the 1960s that the Zermelo Fraenkel set theory cannot be use to prove the continuum hypothesis either For this Cohen was awarded the Fields medal

 Flexibility training refers to developing a wide range of movement in a joint or series of joints that is attainable in a momentary effort with the help of a partner or a piece of equipment Human flexibility is not the same in all joints Thus some easily perform longitudinal splits but are very hard in transversal ones Flexibility in some joints can be increased to a certain degree by stretching

Flexibility training has long been underestimated and perhaps overlooked by health care professionals Quality of life is considerably enhanced by improving and maintaining a good range of motion in the joints

The Fountainhead is a fiction book written by Ayn Rand The book was first printed in 1943

The book is split into four parts named after a person in the story These are the parts

The book starts in 1922 in a fictional university called Stanton The first character you meet in the book is Howard Roark He has just been expelled from Americas best college for architects Stanton He is expelled because he only wants to design modern buildings that are creative but his professors want him to design old buildings

Howard believes that buildings can be beautiful on their own and they dont need to have lots of extra things added He thinks that you can build a house out of glass concrete and steel and it will be beautiful Rand wanted Roark to think this because she wanted the reader to know that new and creative ideas are good and traditions are silly

Roarks roommate Peter Keating is given an award when he graduates He graduates just after Roark is expelled Keating is offered a job in New York at Francon Heyer a firm that makes traditional buildings

Roark leaves college and goes to New York so he can find Henry Cameron his hero and the architect who invented Skyscrapers He gets a job at Camerons firm because Cameron thinks he has potential

Roark works at Camerons office designing buildings and not earning a lot of money while Keating becomes rich because he designs traditional buildings for millionaires who dont have any idea how beautiful modern buildings can be

Keating also meets his old girlfriend Catherine Halsey She is a shy girl and wrongly thinks she will become happy by spending all her time helping others instead of being creative Catherine also tells Keating that her Uncle is Ellsworth Toohey a respected writer for a Wynand newspaper called the Banner Keating wants to meet Toohey because he is an architecture expert and can get Keating new jobs and more money But Keating doesnt want to meet Toohey until he is more famous so that he can impress Toohey 

In the novel Keeting is always trying to impress others because he cares what other people think and he is angry when he comes second

At the same time Roark loses his job with Cameron because Cameron becomes very ill and has to retire Roark goes and finds new jobs but is always turned down because he is too original Keating wants Roark to work for him so that he can steal some of Roarks ideas Keating decides to help Roark because Roark has finished some of his projects at college and at Francon Heyer

Roark works for Francon Heyer for a few days but when he asks if he can do a building in a modern style he is told he has to leave or design the building in an old fashion style He leaves and goes to many other firms He eventually works for John Eric Snyte an architect who hires Roark because Snyte likes to mix different styles

A famous writer Austin Heller comes to Snyte and asks for a house Snyte gives all the architects a job of designing the house and then he mixes all the sketches Heller says he only likes the modern parts and Roark tears up the drawings telling Heller that wants to design the house on his own Snyte fires Roark but it is too late because Heller has accepted the deal and Roark is allowed to design the house on his own

Christian IV was the king of Denmark Norway from 1588 until his death He had a rule of more than 59 years Because of this he has the longest rule of all the kings of Denmark He is sometimes referred to as Christian Firtal in Denmark and Christian Kvart or Quart in Norway

Christian was the son of Frederick II king of Denmark Norway and Sofie of Mecklenburg Schwerin He was born at Frederiksborg castle in 1577 He succeeded the throne at 11 when his father died on 4 April 1588 While he was still growing up chancellor Niels Kaas and the Rigsraadet council served as helpers of the royal power He received a good education He was a strong willed and clever student At the age of 18 Christian became king on 17 August 1596

Sex determination is a process of development by which the sex of an individual is settled Sex is a method of reproduction which is widespread among living things It requires two individuals of the same species 

Usually the sexes are separate Sex may be determined in one of two ways

Where both sexes occur on the same individual that individual is an hermaphrodite Hermaphrodite systems can be found in some animals for example snails and in most flowering plants

For many species sex is determined by environmental factors experienced during development Many reptiles have temperature dependent sex determination The temperature embryos experience during their development determines the sex of the organism In some turtles for example males are produced at lower incubation temperatures than females this difference in critical temperatures can be as little as 1 2C

Many fish change sex over the course of their life This phenomenon is called sequential hermaphroditism In clownfish smaller fish are male and the dominant and largest fish in a group becomes female In many wrasse the opposite is truemost fish are female at birth and become male when they reach a certain size Sequential hermaphrodites may produce both types of gametes over the course of their lifetime but at any given point they are either female or male

In some ferns the default sex is hermaphrodite but ferns which grow in soil that has previously supported hermaphrodites are influenced by hormones remaining to develop as male

The most usual way to determine sex is by genes That way an organisms sex is determined by the genome it gets The alleles that influence sexual development may or may not be on the same chromosome If they are that chromosome is called a sex chromosome and the genes on it are called sex linked Sex is determined either by the fact that there is a sex chromosome or by the number of them Because genetic sex determination is determined by matching chromosomes there are usually the same number of male and female offspring

Humans and other mammals have an XY sex determination system the Y chromosome carries factors responsible for male development The default sex in the absence of a Y chromosome is female XX mammals are female and XY are male XY sex determination is also found in other organisms including the common fruit fly and some plants In some cases including in the fruit fly it is the number of X chromosomes that determines sex rather than the presence of a Y chromosome

Birds have a system that works the other way round It is called ZW sex determination system The W chromosome has factors for female development By default the organism will be male In this case ZZ individuals are male and ZW are female The majority of butterflies and moths also have a ZW sex determination system In both XY and ZW sex determination systems the sex chromosome carrying the critical factors is often significantly smaller carrying little more than the genes necessary for triggering the development of a given sex

Many insects use a sex determination system based on the number of sex chromosomes This is called XXXO sex determinationthe O indicates the absence of the sex chromosome All other chromosomes in these organisms are diploid but organisms may inherit one or two X chromosomes In field crickets for example insects with a single X chromosome develop as male while those with two develop as female In the nematode C elegans most worms are self fertilizing XX hermaphrodites but occasionally abnormalities in chromosome inheritance regularly give rise to individuals with only one X chromosomethese XO individuals are fertile males

Other insects including honey bees and ants use a haploid diploid sex determination system In this case diploid individuals are generally female and haploid individuals are male This sex determination system results in a highly biased sex ratio as the sex of offspring is determined by fertilization rather than the assortment of chromosomes during meiosis

Sometimes an organism develops the appearance of both males and females It is then an intersex and is rare Even though such organisms may be called hermaphrodites this is not correct because in intersex individuals either the male or the female aspect is sterile

The systems in questions are made of two types of components One component is connected to the phone network and usually called base station The other component is a mobile handset To be able to communicate each handset must be registered with the base station Once this is done they are able to communicate and be used as normal cordless phones 

DECT uses a frequency band that is reserved for voice transmissions called Unlicensed Personal Communications Services In Europe Asia Australia New Zealand and South America the frequency band from 1880 MHz to 1900 MMHz is used In the United States the band is 1920 1930 MHzTo be sold in the US only small changes need to be made to DECT equipment These channels are reserved exclusively for voice communication applications and therefore are less likely to experience interference from other wireless devices such as baby monitors and wireless networks 

A newer standard that is similar to DECT is called CAT iq

The DECT standard fully specifies how a portable unit such as a cordless telephone can access a fixed network using radio waves It is different from other standards like GSM in that it does not say how the fixed network is made The communication with the fixed network is done through a base station which is called Radio Fixed Part and terminates the radio waves The base station then uses a gateway to connect the calls to the fixed network In most cases the connection will be to the telephone network Certain units also allow a connection to newer technologies such as Voice over IP Some baby phones also use DECT technology Such baby phones do not have a gateway

Many PABX systems installed in offices have a part that is capable of doing DECT Many system vendors now also offer broken wikt linkhybridhybrid systems where communication with voice over IP or with the classical phone network are possible In such systems the communication with the handsets is done using DECT and the PABX is capable of doing SIP Some vendors propose WLAN based solutions to connect the handsets but this solution is often more complex than using DECT

DECT has different profiles A domesic DECT Generic Access Profile system typically has the following abilities

Other interoperability profiles exist in the DECT suite of standards and in particular the DPRS bring together a number of prior interoperability profiles for the use of DECT as a wireless LAN and wireless internet access service With good range dedicated spectrum high interference immunity open interoperability and data speeds of around 500 kbits DECT appeared at one time to be a superior alternative to Wi Fi The protocol capabilities built into the DECT networking protocol standards were particularly good at supporting fast roaming in the public space between hotspots operated by competing but connected providers The first DECT product to reach the market Olivettis Net3 was a wireless LAN and German firms Dosch Amand and Hoeft Wessel built niche businesses on the supply of data transmission systems based on DECT

However the timing of the availability of DECT in the mid 1990s was too early to find wide application for wireless data outside niche industrial applications Whilst contemporary providers of Wi Fi struggled with the same issues providers of DECT retreated to the more immediately lucrative market for cordless telephones A key weakness was also the inaccessibility of the US market due to FCC spectrum restrictions at that time By the time mass applications for wireless Internet had emerged and the US had opened up to DECT well into the new century the industry had moved far ahead in terms of performance and DECTs time as a wireless data transport was past

Ironically the failure of DECT as a data protocol became a strength when DECT 60 phones finally appeared in the US in late 2005 By this time the ISM bands had become crowded in the US especially the 24 GHz band which is used by both the most common variants of Wi Fi 80211b and 80211g and many cordless phones thus interference between unlicensed devices has become common in these bands However because Wi Fi does not operate in the UPCS band and DECT devices negotiate with each other for the available spectrum not only are DECT 60 phones immune from this type of interference their operation does not impair other nearby devices operating on the same frequency which is a common issue with 24 GHz cordless phonesCitation neededdateApril 2009

DECT operates in the 1880 1900 MHz band and defines ten channels from 1881792 MHz to 1897344 MHz with a band gap of 1728 kHz Each base station frame provides 12 duplex speech channel with each time slot occupying any of channel DECT operates in multicarrierTDMATDD structure DECT also provides Frequency hopping spread spectrum over TDMATDD structure If frequency hopping is avoided then each base station can provide up to 120 channels in the DECT spectrum before frequency reuse Each time slot can be assigned to a different channel in order to exploit advantages of frequency hopping and avoid interference from other users in asynchronous fashionCitation neededdateOctober 2008

Italian conquest of British Somaliland was an Italian campaign during WWII against the British Empire It was the only Italian victory against the Allies without help from Germany

When Italy declared war in May 1940 the Italian troops were not prepared for a prolonged war in Eastern Africa As a consequence Mussolini ordered only some limited aggressive actions to capture territory along the borders of Kenya Egypt and Sudan 

In June 1940 Amedeo Duke of Aosta the Governor General of Italian East Africa convinced the Italian Supreme Command to plan a campaign to conquer a British colony British Somaliland The King of Italy Victor Emmanuel III and Mussolini agreed and at the beginning of August the campaign was ready to start

The Italian force attacking British Somaliland in August 1940 was commanded by General Guglielmo Nasi and included five colonial brigades three Blackshirt battalions and three bands of native troops The Italians had the 2nd Light Tank Company and the 322nd Medium Tank Company artillery and most important superior air support The Italians numbered about 4800 and about 30000 native troops

The Italians were opposed by a British contingent of about 4000 soldiers consisting of the Somaliland Camel Corps elements of the 2nd Battalion Kings African Rifles and the 1st Battalion Northern Rhodesian Regiment the 3rd Battalion 15th Punjab Regiment and the 2nd Battalion Black Watch

In the early hours of 3 August 1940 the Italian army crossed the border between Italian East Africa and British Somaliland

The Italians attacked with military columns in three directions to the north toward the port of Zeila to the center toward Adadlek and to the south toward Odweina 

On 5 August the port of Zeila was occupied after heavy fighting and every possibility of help from French Somaliland for the retreating British was cut The northern Italian column then proceeded south along the coast and occupied the village of Bulhar

The Italian central column commanded by Lieutenant General Carlo De Simone faced more difficulties because of the mountainous terrain and was stopped by the English at the Karrin Pass before Hargeisa 

Colonel Arthur Reginald Chater used his camel corps to skirmish with and screen against the advancing Italians as the other British and Commonwealth forces pulled back towards Tug Argan

On 6 August within three days of the invasion the towns of Zeila and Hargeisa were taken by the Italians Odweina fell the following day and the Italian central and eastern columns combined to launch attacks against the main British and Commonwealth positions at Tug Argan 

On 7 August the British and Commonwealth forces in British Somaliland received reinforcements with the arrival of the 1st Battalion 2nd Punjab Regiment On 11 August a new commander Major General Alfred Godwin Austen reached Tug Argan 

The defensive positions of the British army were centered around six hills overlooking the only road toward Berbera On 11 August an Italian brigade commanded by De Simone attacked the hill defended by the 3rd Battalion 15th Punjab Regiment and captured it with heavy casualties The British launched two unsuccessful counterattacks but the next day were forced to abandon two other nearby hills

On 14 August the Italians began to encircle the British defenders from their eastern positions and the defenders situation started to look critical

After three days of battle early on 15 August Godwin Austen concluded that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile He contacted the British Middle East Command headquarters in Cairo Egypt and requested and received permission to withdraw his forces from British Somaliland 

The determined effort of the Black Watch battalion which covered the retreat allowed the entire British and Commonwealth contingent to withdraw to Berbera with minimal losses 

Whilst the British made their fighting retreat to Berbera the British Royal Navy had constructed an all tide jetty and had commenced evacuating civilian and administrative officials The two main Italian columns were united at the village of La Farruk approximately 30 km south of Berbera

From Bulhar the third Italian column reached the area of Berbera on 14 August but the British defenders were able to hold them off On 16 August they started to embark troops onto the waiting ships and had completed the evacuation by the afternoon of the following day departing for Aden in the Arabian peninsula They had little interference in this operation as a result of a fierce bayonet charge against the Italians by the Black Watch at Barkasan The Somaliland Camel Corps rather than evacuate was disbanded and dispersed

On 19 August the Italians took control of Berbera and then moved down the coast to complete their conquest of British Somaliland The British colony was annexed by Mussolini to the Italian Empire in Italian East Africa

According to Italian historians during the campaign to conquer British Somaliland the casualties were 250 for the British army and 205 for the Italian 

But according to the British account of events total British casualties were 158 and Italian losses were estimated at between ten and twenty times higher

This campaign in Somaliland was like all the others of the Axis it initially started with a victory then after a period of time finished with a complete defeat But in the specific case of the Italian conquest of British Somaliland the defeat was followed by nearly two years of Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia 

British Somaliland remained part of the Italian East Africa until March 1941 when the 1st2nd Punjab Regiment and the 3rd15th Punjab Regiment returned from Aden to re occupy the territory 

GENETIC Genetic Engineering Genetic engineering or genetic modification refers to the process of manipulating the characteristics and functions of the original genes of an organism The objective of this process is to introduce new physiological and physical features or characteristics A gene is a basic constituent unit of any organism It is a locatable region of a genome which contains the whole hereditary information of the organism A gene corresponds to a unit of inheritance It is a segment of the DNA which determines the special features or functions of the organism Genetic engineering meddles with the organisms natural reproductive process whether sexual or asexual It gives it a new direction which is different from its natural disposition and development The process involves the isolation and manipulation of the genes by introducing the new DNA into the cells DNA is a blue print of the individual characteristics of an organism The information stored in the DNA controls the management of biochemical process of each organism The life development and unique characteristics of the organism depend upon on its own DNA The aims of the study development and practice of genetic engineering are noble and beneficial for mankind Genetic engineering may help make crops resistant to herbicides used to kill the unwanted plants and weeds which obstruct their full growth Though some herbicides are selective and kill only the specifically targeted unwanted plants there are others which are non selective and besides killing the useless and obstructive weeds kill any plants they come in contact thus killing the plants which are sought to be protected The domain of genetic engineering can extend from plants to cover both the animal and human life It can for example hybridize the production of the animals and promote the growth of healthy species of milk producing animals stronger and healthier horses cows and bullocks which can better withstand the wear and tear of life Recreation of vital human organs to replace the sick and missing ones is another example of how genetic engineering can prove beneficial to human beings The possibilities of the scope of genetic engineering are limitless and the horizon is widening with every day of research Genetic engineering like many other branches of science for example nuclear science can be used nobly and ignobly The human genome project to categorize all the genes in the human species is a remarkable effort to determine the complete structure of the deoxyribonucleic acid the human genetic material and understand its functions This research in human genetics aims at determining why the human being resemble or differ from each other On the other hand genetic engineering can also be misused by mutilating the beautiful creation of God by launching for example Nazi style schemes for population control or produce a biological devastation through bungling with man made viruses Cloning is one such example how genetic engineering can be beneficial as well as detrimental Molecular biologists have discovered numerous enzymes which can alter the structure of the DNA in living organisms Using them the scientists can cut the specific genes from the DNA and build customized DNA With this knowledge they can alter the genes of living organisms For example the biological engineers have been able to change the growth patterns of tomatoes Tomatoes are sensitive to frost that shortens their life span Fish on the other hand thrive in the cold and chilly water Scientists found out the gene in fish that resists the cold and transferred it to tomatoes thereby immunizing them against the frosty cold and prolonging their growing season There are innumerable such projects that are creating new strains in the agricultural areas which have great economic potential Genetic engineering can boost the growth and yield of a variety food crops pulses and cereals  and alleviate the problems of food shortage and  mitigate the suffering of the starving millions across the world

Shen Bao was a newspaper published in Shanghai China It was published between April 30 1872 and May 27 1949 making it the longest running for any newspaper in China The name has also been transliterated as Shun Pao or Shen pao In English the newspaper was usually called Shanghai News The name is short for Shenjiang Xinbao Shenjiang is a short form of Chunsheng jiang the old name for the Huangpu River 

The paper was started by Ernest Major in 1872 Major was a British businessman Shen Bao was one of the first modern Chinese newspapers Major returned to England in 1899 and the newspaper was reorganised to be Major Company Limited According to Zhou Major was different from other foreign newspapers in two areas From the start he made it clear that the newspaper would be for Chinese readers and not for foreigners He therefore picked those news and issues that would be interesting to Chinese Secondly he made Chinese compradors responsible for running the business and he had Chinese editors select the news and write the editorials He was very successful The Chinese compradors used their ties with the community raised the circulation and obtained advertisements This made the paper cheaper than those of the competition The Chinese editors knew what their readers wanted to read about 

Shen Bao played an important role and helped form public opinion at the end of the 19th century The paper ran a campaign against hiring young women as waitresses in opium dens According to the campaign this made it difficult to distinguish between what could be tolerated and what could not because it implicitly said these women would also provide sex services in the dens Most of the dens with this practice were in the French Concession The campaign said that one of the reasons this problem existed was that there were foreigners in Shanghai There was an uproar and the practice was banned in reality little was done to eradicate it though 

The newspaper was innovative It used new printing technologies sent a military correspondent to cover the Sino French War in Vietnam in 1884 and used vernacular Quickly it got the reputation of being one of the best newspapers in China It was bought by a Chinese in 1909 In the early 20th century it had a circulation of 30000 copies a day 9000 of them in Shanhai and the rest was for other parts of China By the early 1920s its circulation was 50000 by the end of the decade 100000 and by the mid 1930s 150000

The papers offices were in the International Settlement about a block away from the Central Police Station At first the paper had eight pages with news essays and advertisements as well as imperial decrees and memorials Because the editorial policies followed the principle of reporting whatever possible and letting the readers determine the truth many interesting but unfounded rumors were often included as news After 1905 it increased its size to twenty pages 

Shen Bao was founded as a commercial newspaper Politically it was conservative for the first three decades and supported the Qing government In 1905 it started to change its orientation On New Years Day it quoted Liang Qichaos constitutionalist slogans In 1907 the paper was sold to Xi Zipei Xi Zipei used to be a comprador of the paper Xi Zipei was influenced by Zhang Jian The paper changed and became quite liberal and strongly supported the constitutional movement It had the following sections editorials international news domestical news local news industry and trade law and society sports and education literature and art and advertisements In addition to reporting important political news stories it had many special columns and supplements such as ziyou tan automobile education and life In 1912 control was transferred to Shi Liangcai In the 1930s Shi was a strong supporter of the Human Rights Defence Alliance established by Madam Soong Qing LingSoong Qing Ling was the second wife of revolutionary leader Dr Sun Yat sen with Cai Yuanpei and Lu Xun

In 1934 the newspaper made the government angry because it had a strong attitude against the Japanese On November 13 Shih Liang tsai its owner and editor in chief was mysteriously assassinated on the Shanghai Hangchow Highway responsibility for his murder has been laid at the feet of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics Chiang Kai sheks much feared secret police In 1938 with the city under Japanese control Norwood Francis Allman an American lawyer who had been US Consul in Shanghai in the early 1920s was asked by the papers Chinese owners to take over as editor Time wrote in 1940 A fluent Chinese linguist Allman reads every story that goes into Shun Pao writes editorials corrects editorials written by staff members He serves without pay The paper was on bad terms with the Japanese and in 1940 a Chinese assistant editor was killed and his head left on the street as a warning to journalists During World War II the paper passed into the hands of collaborators with the Japanese occupation but after the war Pan Gongzhan an influential Kuomintang party official who had been an editor on the paper in the late 1920s became its publisher and Chen Shuny its chief editor In May 1949 the Peoples Liberation Army took Shanghai and shut down the newspaper was

There is a complete collection of the papers issues in the Shanghai Library

Evacuation is a term that comes from Latin language Literally it means emptying Most of the time it means that people leave an area or a zone because of an imminent danger or threat Evacuations are planned and people should leave the zone of danger according to the plan The causes for evacuations can be natural disasters such as flooding or volcano eruptions or they can be man made ones like a bomb in a building a fire on a train in a tunnel or an industrial accident

The French defence is a chess opening one of the asymmetric replies to 1e4 namely 1e6 It is the third most popular reply to 1e4 Often Black plays more actively on the queenside while White plays more actively on the kingside 

A problem that Black often has in the French defence is finding a way for his light squared bishop to become active Although this is true it may not matter if Black knows what he is doing The defence has a reputation for reliability and has been played by many great players and has featured in several world championship matches 

Typical examples go 

1e4 e6 2d4 d5 3Nd2 c5 4exd5 exd5 5Nf3 Nc6 6Bb5 Bd6 7dxc5 Bxc5 80 0 Ne7 and so on This line is quiet and mostly about the centre

1e4 e6 2d4 d5 3Nc3 Bb4 4e5 c5 5a3 Bxc3 6bxc3 Ne7 7Qg4 Qc7 8Qxg7 Rg8 9Qxh7 cxd4 10Ne2 and so on The play in lines like this is strongly asymmetric White owns the kingside and Black owns the queenside

The Nimzo Indian defence is a popular chess opening with these initial moves 1d4 Nf6 2c4 e6 3Nc3 Bb4 The basic idea is for Black to challenge for control of the central square e4 This comes at the cost of exchanging his Bb4 for the white Nc3 when White plays a3 The opening is named after Aaron Nimzovich who developed and promoted it Initially a hypermodern opening it usually transposes into classical form as black occupies central squares by c5 and d5

The white central pawns are under restraint Much preparation is needed before they can move forward

The pound force or simply pound is a unit of force The pound force is about equal to the gravitational force applied on a mass of one pound on the surface of Earth Since the 18th century the unit has been used in low precision measurements In the 20th century people needed a more precise definition An official value for acceleration due to gravity was needed Today as decided by the General Conference on Weights and Measures standard gravity is usually taken to be 980665 ms2

Long ton is the name for the unit called the ton in the avoirdupois or Imperial system of measurements as used in the United Kingdom and several other Commonwealth countries It has been mostly replaced by the tonne and in the United States by the short ton It is equal to convert2240lbkg7lkon or convert35cuftm311 of salt water with a density of 64 lbft3 It has some limited use in the United States most commonly in measuring the displacement of ships and was the unit recommended for warships by international agreements between the world wars for example battleships were limited to 35000 long tons

Opium poppy Papaver somniferum var album is a species of plant Opium and poppy seeds can be taken from them A great number of opiates for example morphine thebaine codeine papaverine and noscapine are made from opium The Latin name means the sleep bringing poppy white form Some of these opiates make people feel sleepy

The poppy is the only species of Papaveraceae that is an agricultural crop grown so much Other species Papaver rhoeas and Papaver argemone are important agricultural weeds They may be wrongly thought of as the crop

The plant itself is also used as a decoration It has been known as the common garden poppy It is widely grown as an ornamental flower in Europe North America South America and Asia

Poppy seeds of Papaver somniferum are important as food It is where poppyseed oil a healthy useful oil comes from It is also where poppy seeds come from The seeds have very little broken wikt linkopiateopiates The oil that comes from them has even less

The Opium Wars were two wars between China and Western countries The first was between Great Britain and China The Second Opium War was from 1856 to 1860 The Second Opium War was also known as the Arrow War or Anglo French War in China Early in the 19th century British merchants began secretly taking opium into China They wanted to balance their purchases of tea for export to Britain In 1839 China said that opium was not allowed They destroyed at Guangzhou much opium that they had taken from British merchants Great Britian sent gunboats to attack Chinese coastal cities China was not developed in modern weapons They were defeated China was forced to sign the Treaty of Nanjing and the British Supplementary Treaty of the Bogue

The wars were about many other things than opium They were also about opening China to European and American trade and colonizations 

The British merchants began selling opium to China At that time opium was growing in India Opium is an addictive drug It is sometimes used to treat disease However opium can also be used as a drug that changes the users state of mind Usually this makes the user feel for a short time that they are happy and peaceful Opium had been used in China for a long time before the British came mostly to treat disease When the British began importing large amounts of the drug Chinese began using opium for its mind changing effect More and more people grew addicted to opium So the British were able to import more and more opium By selling this drug the British slowly began to make more money on their exports to China than they spent on their imports of Chinese goods British exports of opium to China increased greatly They went from an estimated 15 tons in 1730 to 75 tons in 1773 Opium was shipped in over two thousand chests Every chest had 140 pounds of opium inside Opium is a naturally occurring substance found in the seeds of the opium poppy Opium which contains morphine is extracted from the poppy seeds and used to produce heroin Heroin is an illegal highly addictive drug and its use is a serious problem in America It is both the most abused and the most rapidly acting of the opiates

Seismometer or seismograph is an instrument that measures motions of the ground including those generated by earthquakes nuclear explosions and other sources Records of seismic waves called seismograms allow to map the interior of the Earth and locate and measure the size of those different sources

The word derives from the Greek seisms a shaking or quake from the verb se to shake and mtron measure

Dew is a thin film of water that has condensed on the surface of objects near the ground in the morning or evening These objects cool in the night When they cool the thin layer of air around them cools too This makes some water vapor condense on the object The condensation happens because the air is able to hold less water when it is cooled The temperature when condensation begins is called the dew point If the dew point temperature becomes lower than 32 F the dew turns into frost Most people agree that the water in the dew comes from the atmosphere However some studies suggest that it also comes up through the soil and then condenses on the ground This happens though only when conditions are right

Dew forms best when the atmosphere is clean the air is calm and there is not much wind It does not always form in the night and outdoors though They also work when eyeglasses get steamy in warm wet rooms Dew may also happen in industrial processes However people use the word condensation more often than dew

The Taiping Rebellion was a civil war in China from 1850 to 1864 It was led by Hong Xiuquan The Taiping Rebellion was against the ruling Qing Dynasty About 20 million people died Most of them were civilians

Hong established the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom When it was most powerful it had about 30 million people joining in it The rebels tried to change society Troops were nicknamed the Long hair

Hung Xiuquan was a clever student He wanted to go into government service He studied hard and would probably have passed the government tests However he discovered that the officials in charge expected broken wikt linkbribebribes Hungs family was poor at this time and did not have any money Their family was loyal to the old Ming dynasty and decided that his failure was because of the corrupt Manchu dynasty Soon after Hung became seriously ill In a fever Hung saw himself in the Thirty third Heaven He said that he saw a man called the Venerable in Years The Venerable in Years gave Hung a sword and told him to destroy the demon worshipers who had rebelled against the Venerable in Years With the help of the Venerable in Yearss son Hung saw himself doing battle against the demon forces Shortly after he became healthy again Hung read the Old Testament and believed it showed his vision was right He felt that he had met with God and that God had chosen him for a son

Hung wanted to know more about Christianity The missionaries he met disagreed with Hungs vision They did not agree that he was the brother of Jesus Hung left them and decided to make his own cult In Hungs cult God was the Father Christ was the Son and Elder Brother and Hung was the Younger Brother He called the New Testament the Former Testament He called his own ideas the New Testament Hungs friend Yang Xiuqing used to sell firewood Yang claimed to be able to act as a voice of God to direct the people and gain political power

Polgar and her two younger sisters Judit and Sofia were part of an educational experiment carried out by their father Lszl Polgr He and his wife Klara educated their three daughters at home with chess as the specialist subject 

In January 1991 Polgar became the third woman to earn the Grandmaster title Much is made by her supporters of the fact that Polgar had got the three GM norms and a rating over 2500 Nona Gaprindashvili was awarded the Grandmaster title in 1978 mainly as a result of winning Lone Pine International 1977 but she did not quite make the usual 24 games required at that time Maia Chiburdanidze was awarded the GM title in 1984 for winning at New Delhi and for beating Nona Gaprindashvili and two others in matches for the Womens World Chess Championship However before Polgar reached the title Chiburdanidze had more than achieved the traditional GM qualifications by her performances at Banja Luka and Bilbao 

Polgar had tended to avoid women only tournaments but she abandoned this when she entered the 1993 cycle for the Womens World Championship She became the Womens World Champion at her second attempt in 1996 Two years later her title defense against Xie Jun of China was scheduled to take place in November 1998 However Polgar requested a postponement because she was pregnant and also FIDE had been unable to find a satisfactory sponsor Ultimately in 1999 a match was arranged but under conditions to which Polgar objected firstly because she had recently had a child and had not had sufficient time to recuperate and secondly because the match was to be held entirely in China the home country of her challenger She also wanted a significantly larger prize fund

When Polgar refused to play under these conditions FIDE declared that she had forfeited the title and instead organized a match between Xie Jun and Alisa Galliamova for the Womens World Chess Championship which was won by Xie Jun Polgar sued in the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne Switzerland for monetary damages and the restoration of her title In March 2001 the case was settled with Polgar withdrawing her claims and FIDE agreeing to pay Polgars attorneys fees in the amount of 25000 Since Xie Jun had already been crowned Womens World Champion FIDE could not restore the title to Polgar Polgar has not participated in subsequent Womens World Championship cycles

Paid substantial appearance fees by the Hungarian Chess Federationp106 the family did play together in two female only events The Hungarians won the Womens Chess Olympiads with a team packed with Polgrs in 1988 and 1990p106 156 Zsuzsa Judit Sofia and Ildiko Madl were the team which pushed the Soviet Union into second place for the first time 

The United States Chess Federation named Polgar Grandmaster of the Year in 2003 the first time a woman has won that honor In that same year Polgar also became the first woman to win the US Open Blitz Championship against a field which included seven grandmasters She won that title again in 2005 and in 2006

She helped train and played the top board for the United States womens team at the 2004 Chess Olympiad held in October in Majorca Spain Overall the team won the silver medal and Polgar won an individual gold medal This was not her first Olympiad she has a total of ten Olympiad Medals She has played 56 games in the Olympiads never losing a single game

The Boeing X 37 Advanced Technology Demonstrator is an unpiloted demonstration spaceplane that is intended to test future spaceflight technologies while in orbit and during atmospheric reentry It is a reusable robotic spacecraft based on the smaller X 40 The X 37 began as a NASA project in 1999 then was transferred to the US Department of Defense in 2004 The X 37 had its first flight as a drop test in April 2006 at Edwards AFB The spacecraft was launched in April 2010 to begin a United States Air Force mission

In 1999 NASA chose Boeing to design the vehicle The vehicle was built at the California branch of Boeings Phantom Works At the end of 2002 a new 300 million contract was awarded to Boeing in the framework of NASAs Space Launch Initiative

The X 37 was transferred from NASA to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in September 2004 The program has become a secretive though it is not known whether DARPA will maintain this status for the project

In June 2005 the X 37 completed a captive carry flight underneath the White Knight at Mojave Spaceport Mojave California Through the second half of 2005 the X 37 underwent structural upgrades including reinforcement of the nose wheel supports Further captive carry flight tests and the first drop test were expected mid February 2006

March 2006 was scheduled for the X 37s first free flight but a snow storm covered the area dropping snow on the Mojave The next flight attempt in March was canceled due to high winds In late March the X 37 flew but a flaw prevented the free flight and the vehicle returned to the ground still docked with its White Knight carrier In April 2006 the X 37 made its first free glide flight During landing the vehicle ran off the runway After the vehicle was repaired the program moved from Mojave to Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale California for the remainder of the flight test program White Knight continued to be based at Mojave but would ferry over to Plant 42 when flights were scheduled Five additional flights were performed at least one of which is believed to have been a free flight with a successful landing

In November 2006 the US Air Force announced it would develop the X 37B from the NASA X 37A The Air Force version is designated X 37B Orbital Test Vehicle The OTV program builds on industry and government investments by DARPA NASA and the Air Force The X 37B effort will be led by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office and includes partnerships with NASA and the Air Force Research Laboratory Boeing is the prime contractor for the OTV program The X 37B can remain in orbit for up to 270 days at a time

The Secretary of the Air Force states the OTV program will focus on risk reduction experimentation and operational concept development for reusable space vehicle technologies in support of long term developmental space objectives

The X 37B was originally scheduled for launch in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle but following the Columbia accident it was transferred to a Delta II It was then transferred to the Atlas V following concerns over the spacecrafts aerodynamic properties during launch

The first orbital flight of the X 37B was launched on an Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Florida in April 2010 The spacecraft was placed into low Earth orbit for testing and then will land at Vandenberg Air Force Base California 

A second X 37B is being manufactured for a test mission scheduled for 2011

The main engines are fueled by JP 8 kerosene a military standard jet fuel The maneuvering engines are fueled by hydrogen peroxide This is wrong the propellants were changed to hypergols long ago when it was a NASA program

The X 37 was originally designed to be carried into orbit in the Space Shuttle cargo bay but underwent redesign for launch on a Delta IV or comparable rocket after it was determined that a shuttle flight would be uneconomical

This vehicle has the potential to become the United States first operational military spaceplane after the cancellation of Dyna Soar in 1963 It is expected to operate in a velocity range of up to Mach 25 on reentry Among the technologies to be demonstrated with the X 37 are improved thermal protection systems avionics the autonomous guidance system and an advanced airframe The on board engine is the Rocketdyne AR 23 which is fueled by hydrogen peroxide and JP 8

The X 37s aerodynamic design was derived from the Space Shuttle hence the X 37 has a similar lift to drag ratio and a lower cross range at high altitudes and mach numbers than the Hypersonic Technology Vehicle

The test vehicle which was used as an atmospheric drop test glider had no propulsion system Instead of an operational vehicles payload bay doors it had an enclosed and reinforced upper fuselage structure to allow it to be mated with a mothership Most of the thermal protection tiles were fake made of inexpensive foam rather than ceramic a smaller number of the X 37s tiles were actual TPS tiles and TPS blankets were used in areas where heating would not have been severe enough to require tiles

Following their missions X 37B spacecraft are to land on a runway at Vandenberg Air Force Base California with Edwards Air Force Base as an alternate site

A barcode is a way of optically representing data Originally barcodes represented data in the widths and the spacings of parallel lines and may be referred to as linear or 1D barcodes 2D systems use symbols other than bars but they are still referred to as barcodes as well Barcodes can be read by optical scanners called barcode readers or scanned from an image by special software

The first use of barcodes was to label railroad cars but they were not commercially successful until they were used to automate supermarket checkout systems a task in which they have become almost universal Their use has spread to many other roles as well but the simplicity universality and low cost of barcodes has limited the role of these other systems

Barcodesespecially the Universal Product Code UPChave slowly become an essential part of modern life Their use is widespread and the technology behind barcodes is constantly improving Some modern applications of barcodes include

In point of sale management the use of barcodes can provide up to date information on aspects of the business For example

The reason barcodes are business friendly is that the scanners are relatively low cost and extremely accurate compared to key entry with only about 1 substitution error in 15000 to 36 trillion characters entered The exact error rate depends on the type of barcode

OMR is a form of automated data input Marks are made on a specially printed paper forms which are then read by an OMR reader The data is then sent to a computer for processing One of the most common uses of OMR is in multiple choice examinations Students mark their answers on specially printed sheets using either a pencil or a special marker The sheets are then collected in and the data read using a sheet feed OMR scanner

Optical character recognition is a method of automatic data entry OCR software is used to convert handwritten type written or printed text into data that can be edited on a computer In simple systems the paper documents are scanned with an image scanner The OCR software then looks at the image and compares the shapes of the letters to stored images of letters In this way it makes a text file that can be edited with a normal text editor

More complex systems look at images layout and so on This can make editable electronic versions which look identical to the original documents

OCR works best with clean clearly printed materials

Istrian Italians are one of the ethnic groups of Istria The others are Croatians Slovenians and Istrorumanians

The Istrian Italians are the descendants of the romanized Illyrian population of Istria during the Roman Empire During the Middle Ages they were under domination of many political states like the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire But most of the time they were under the Republic of Venice especially during the Renaissance

The Istrian Italians enjoyed a huge cultural development in the centuries under Venice Pola and Capodistria were important centers of art and culture during the Italian Renaissance Personalities like Pier Paolo Vergerio and Santorius Santorio are renowned worldwide

In the last two centuries the Istrian Italians who were the majority of the population of Istria under Napoleon have been in continuous ethnic fighting with the Slavs of Istria As a consequence now they are reduced to a small minority who have survived the Istrian exodus and the Foibe massacres during and after WWII 

According to the Italian Census done in 1936 in the peninsula of Istria there were 294000 residents most were Istrian Italians Here there are the percentages for all the Istrian citiesdistricts

The Istrian Italians are nearly 50000 in our days a small minority of the Istria peninsula population They are mainly divided between Croatia and Slovenia but a few thousands still live in Italy

Simply put design management is the business side of design Design management encompasses the ongoing processes business decisions and strategies that enable innovation and create effectively designed products services communications environments and brands that enhance our quality of life and provide organizational success  This means that design management is not limited on a single design discipline In his Classification of Design Gorb divided design into three different classes design management operates in and across all three categories

Design management is not independent from the organization and product context and plays three integrative key roles in the interface of design organisation and market

Supportive activities are used in design management to manage design more efficient and effectively Depending on a multitude of factors design managers have a broad range of job profiles with very different roles activities and responsibilities

It is difficult to exactly trace the history of design management Even though design management as an expression is first mentioned in literature in 1964 earlier contributions created the context in which design management could arise Throughout its history design management was influenced by a number of different disciplines and movements and in its understanding it can be attributed neither directly to design nor to management

Historical development of design management 

Design management can be divided by its different fields of application into the three different levels 

Operational design management is concerned with the management of individual design projects and design teams

Tactical design management addressed the organisation of design resources and design processes 

Strategic design management involves the creation of the strategic long term vision planning for design and deals with defining the role of design within the company

The middlegame is the part of a game of chess after the opening

The middlegame begins when most of the pieces have been developed It is where most games are won and lost Many games will end in resignation even before an endgame takes place 

The simplest way to learn the middlegame is to select an opening and learn it well 

A middlegame position has a structure caused by the opening These are some things to look for when looking at a middlegame position

 Material changes in the balance of material are critical To lose a piece for nothing is enough to lose a game If the players are evenly matched then a rough material balance of pieces is normal Material balance is often quite static it doesnt change for many moves On the other hand material may be sacrificed usually for a direct attack on the opposing king

 Development the opening may have left one player with a lead in development That player has the initiative and may attack before the opponent can get his pieces out It is a temporary asset if a lead in development is not used effectively it will disappear

 The centre in the centre pieces have their greatest effect and some attack more squares in the centre than at the sides The player who controls the centre will almost always have the advantage

 Mobility a position is mobile if the pieces can get where they need to Almost all middle game positions have some limitations to mobility Look for open files for the rooks and open diagonals for the bishops Outposts are what knights need places where they cant easily be dislodged

 King safety where is the king Ideally a king should be castled and kept behind a screen of pawns Many other things may happen in practice If a king is weak it may be put under direct attack If the kings castle on opposite wings and queens are on the board both players may try to assault the enemy king 

 Pawns provide the skeleton of a position They move slowly and may become blocked for many moves Everything takes place round the pawns Different openings produce different pawn structures In this way openings influence the whole game Notice these things when they occur

What the player does is note the features on the board and formulate a plan which takes the features into account Then the player works out a sequence of moves Of course in practice the opponent is interfering with the plan at every step

The Tarrasch variation of the French defence gives us 1e4 e6 2d4 d5 3Nd2 c5 4exd5 exd5 5Nf3 Nc6 6Bb5 Bd6 7dxc5 Bxc5 80 0 Ne7 9Nb3 Bd6 10Re1 0 0 11Bg5 Bg4 and so on Now the opening is over and all the pieces are developed This line is quiet and mostly about the centre

The isolated black QP is what gives the middlegame its character The pawn itself is both a weakness and a potential source of strength It controls the very important square e4 but leaves the equally important d4 much weaker The position is fairly equal but the database shows that White has an advantage of about 7

In the English opening this line became popular 1c4 Nf6 2Nc3 e6 3e4 c5 4e5 Ng8 5Nf3 Nc6 6d4 6cxd4 7Nxd4 Nxe5 8Ndb5 a6 9Nd6 Bxd6 10Qxd6 f6 11Be3 Ne7 12 Bb6 Nf5 and now both 11Qc5 and 11Bxd8 give White an advantage of only 24

The variation involved a number of middlegame themes rapid development material sacrifice exploiting weak squares In total it is a frantic struggle for the centre

Rapid development is the benefit of the old style gambits An opening such as 1e4 e5 2d4 exd4 3c3 dxc3 4Bc4 is virtually never played nowadays but White does get good value for his pawn Some trainers recommend young players try this out to learn how to get the best out of rapid development

Many middlegames are played around blocked or semi blocked pawn chains The pawn chains are decisive in deciding the players plans These plans often involve a K side v Q side struggle with each player attacking his opponents pawn base

1e4 e6 2d4 d5 3Nc3 Bb4 4e5 c5 5a3 Bxc3 6bxc3 Ne7 7Qg4 Qc7 8Qxg7 Rg8 9Qxh7 cxd4 10Ne2 and so on The play in lines like this is strongly asymmetric White owns the kingside and Black owns the queenside

This example from the Winawer variation is an extreme case Each side plays a maximum of moves attacking the opponents weak side and as few moves as possible defending his own weak side This is a general principle for these unbalanced K side v Q side positions

Here is an example from the borderline between opening and middlegame In the diagram to the left White will operate mainly on the Q side and Black on the K side The reason for this is that the black d6 pawn and the white e4 pawn are the bases of their pawn chains It was Nimzovich who pointed out that such pawns are usually the most vulnerable to attack

White to play may wish to cope with Black playing 10Nf4 He can do this by playing 10g3 or by playing 10Re1 so that if 10Nf4 11Bf1 will preserve the bishop Or maybe White will plough ahead with 10c5 the key move on the Q side 

ChessBase shows that the number of tournament games with these choices were

The data base also shows that the overall results were significantly better for 10Re1 What the player does is note the features on the board and formulate a plan which takes the features into account Then the player works out a sequence of moves Of course in practice the opponent is interfering with the plan at every step

Safety of the king is probably the most common theme in the later middlegame This example is a classic Two pawns up White could win the endgame by exchanging queens However he thought he saw something better

This is a skewer because if the black queen moves aside then Rxg7 gives mate

This brilliant reply puts its finger on Whites weak point the back rank

Devices and technologies used to input data into a computer system

VHS means Video Home System This system uses a cassette tape to record video and sound which can be watched on a television A DVDVHS combo can record on VHS tapes read off VHS tapes and additionally read from DVD discs

VHS cassettes can be recorded using a video camera They can also be recorded with a video cassette recorder or VCR A VCR can use a VHS cassette to record broadcast television

This system was created in 1976 by the Victor Company of Japan VHS was a very popular way for people to record and play video at home in the 1980s and 1990s but now DVD has become more popular as they can store better quality video can be easier to use and the discs are cheaper to make However in many less rich countries the VCD is often much more popular than the DVD because the disks and the player are much cheaper and the quality is similar to a VHS tape

Woolmer green is a settlement in Hertfordshire England

Situated between the villages of Welwyn and Knebworth Woolmer Green was first settled in the Iron Age The Belgae colonised the area in the 1st century BC and later it was settled by the Romans Many Roman artefacts have been found in the surrounding area with a Roman bath house existing at nearby Welwyn The village was at the junction of two thoroughfares the Great North Road and another road called Stane Street from St Albans The route of this road runs across the parish along the path of Robbery Bottom Lane continuing on as a public bridleway to Datchworth and then Braughing on its eventual way to another major Roman town Colchester

Thomas de Wolvesmere is recorded as having lived in a dwelling here in 1297 and his name is considered to have led to the current name of the village

Woolmer Green has always been one of those places which is neither here nor there In the Middle Ages part of the village was in Mardleybury Manor part in Rectory Manor with the northern part owing allegiance to Broadwater Manor or Knebworth Things have not changed the village is still at the point where the Districts of North Hertfordshire East Hertfordshire and Welwyn Hatfield meet 

Apart from the trade generated by travellers life in Woolmer Green was agricultural and feudal until the middle of the nineteenth century Things started to change however when the railway arrived in 1850 The village school which was opened a few years after this obtained much funding from the railway

In 1863 only a gunsmith and a shoemaker were listed in the trade directory By 1898 when the population of Woolmer Green stood at 363 and that of Knebworth at 382 there were five shops including two beer retailers no mention in the trade directory of the many front room shops This level of service persisted until recent years with a general store and Post Office a baker a small supermarket and a butcher Sadly these have all now closed

The main road through the centre of the village was still the Great North Road down which thousands of cattle and sheep were driven on the hoof to London markets each year The area around Knebworth and Woolmer Green provided what was probably the last overnight stop for the animals and their drovers before they reached London

Life sounds good when looked at in retrospect but the majority of the residents of Woolmer Green were dependent on farming and the 1879 harvest which was the worst of the century resulted in the leases of many farms in the area being relinquished and thus labourers not being employed to work on them At this time there was quite an influx of farmers from Scotland and Cornwall They must have considered the prospects here to be better than their own and indeed they were actively lured here by the owners of the local agricultural land which at that time was largely owned by the big land owning estates particularly in this immediate area by the Knebworth Estate

During the 20th century the village became a popular destination for tourists travelling to and from London as it lies on the old Great North Road from London to Edinburgh Many who passed along the road would have visited the cottage inhabited by the late Harry McDonald who for many years adorned both the cottage and garden with intricate carvings of animals and other objects He became famous as the Woodcarver of Woolmer Green sadly The Woodcarvers Cottage as it came to be known was demolished after his death

Prior to the millennium year 2000 Woolmer Green was part of the parish of Welwyn for local government purposes In that year however the parish gained its independence from its neighbour and the inaugural meeting of the Parish Council was held in May 2000 The first chairman of the new Woolmer Green Parish Council Judith Watson was instrumental in achieving the separation

The boundary between Woolmer Green and Welwyn parishes is formed by the path of the East Coast Mainline railway The small viaduct to the south of the Parish at the end of Robbery Bottom Lane follows the same basic design as the long Digswell Viaduct It was designed by William Cubitt and built by Thomas Brassey between 1848 and 1850 for the sum of 4643 There are seven arches with a height above the roadway of 17m and a length of 60m The viaduct and the bridges over London Road and Heath Road are all original dating from when the railway was first built although they have been strengthened and the parapets raised

Immediately to the south of the viaduct the railway enters the first of two tunnels between Woolmer Green and the station at Welwyn North The first tunnel heading south was the site of a notorious accident in 1866

There was a temporary railway halt at Woolmer Green during the war which was used by soldiers but nowadays the nearest station is just down the road at Knebworth built in 1884 at the request of Viscount Knebworth Until then the railway was used as a means of transferring manure from all the stables in London to a convenient place in the country Chutes were constructed so that the manure could be shovelled down on to the roads and the local farmers then picked it up to use as fertiliser

The parish has an excellent modern Village Hall and adjoining sports field which are very actively used by the community The hall was opened in November 1990 by local celebrity Barry Norman and is licensed for wedding ceremonies

Though Sunday services had been held in the school since 1878 there were many people in Woolmer Green who thought it was high time that the village had its own church This was a wish particularly dear to the heart of the Revd Edwin Hoskyns who was a curate at Welwyn when part of the school was consecrated as a church

The problem of finding a suitable site for the new church which was to be dedicated to St Michael and All Angels was soon solved when Lord Lytton presented the Church authorities with the plot of land at the junction of London Road and Mardleybury Road which was to prove an ideal site with easy access for the majority of the villagers The church was designed by Robert Weir Schultz a modest example of late Arts and Crafts The estimated cost was 2500 and the contract was given to Mr E Lawrence of Datchworth The foundation stone was laid in September 1899 by Lady Lytton who used a silver trowel for the task

It was originally felt that the church should have a tower but it proved impossible to raise the necessary funds By October 1899 only 1500 had been promised so the decision was taken that only the walls and the roof of the church should be built and the internal fittings left to be proceeded with as the money came in It was suggested in the Parish Magazine that the children of the parish should contribute towards the cost of the font Each can give very little but the pennies and halfpennies of 350 children will quickly mount up and all alike will feel they have a share in the new building

The church was to be named St Michael and All Angels in the hope that it would be consecrated at Michaelmas 29 September 1900 However it was not until 3 November 1900 that the consecration of the church and burial ground took place The people of the village no longer needed to marry and bury at Datchworth or Welwyn

The church screen is a significant example of late Arts and Crafts design and carving It is said that the school bell was bought for the church in 1931 at a cost of 10

Speech recognition is the process of converting spoken words into computer text The user speaks into a microphone and the computer creates a text file of the words they have spoken

Although the broken wikt linkaccuracyaccuracy of these systems has improved in recent years they are still far from perfect If you only need them to recognise a few words for example the words one two three etc then speech recognition software can be very accurate This is why this feature has started to appear on modern mobile phones But systems that can recognise any word spoken by any person in any language are still a few years away

You can greatly improve the accuracy of these systems by training them to recognise just one voice This is usually done by getting the user to read a short set piece of text into the microphone The user looks at the text which has been created and corrects any mistakes the software has made By repeating this a number of times the computers accuracy increases a great deal

Total Drama Action is the 2nd season in the Total Drama television series It started on June 11 2009 The players on the show are Geoff Bridgette Izzy Trent Gwen Owen Heather Le Shawna Courtney Beth Lindsay Justin Harold Duncan DJ

Like the previous season much of Total Drama Action chronicles the events of the eponymous fictional reality shows The Total Drama series itself is an animated reality television series which stars the cast and crew of the fictional series parodying many aspects of reality television in general

After last seasons winner Owen forgoes his prize money of C100000 for a challenge in which the winner would receive C1000000 the money was left in limbo after a situation resulted in a 14 way tie As such show host Chris McLean had no choice but to commission a second competition with all 14 tied contestants The contestants are told to arrive at an abandoned movie studio lot in Toronto where the new competition titled Total Drama Action would take place Because of its location Chris tells the contestants that the challenges would all be in the form of various movie genres The accommodations of the contestants are handled by Chef Hatchet in a similar manner to how it was handled in the previous season 

After a quick elimination of two contestants the couple Geoff and Bridgette a second challenge determined the team captains of the two competing teams the Screaming Gaffers headed by Gwen and the Killer Grips headed by Trent From then on challenges would alternate between reward challenges where winners would receive a special prize and elimination challenges where the losing team would vote off one of its own in an elaborate Gilded Chris Ceremony The pattern of reducing the contestants down was briefly interrupted on two occasions once when Izzy was reinstated following a voting irregularity where her alter ego E Scope was voted off and another time when Courtney a contestant who did not originally qualify for Total Drama Action successfully sued the show The players eliminated would make the walk of shame and into the Lame o sine where they leave the movie studio

Once seven contestants were left the Screaming Gaffers and the Killer Grips were dissolved and the challenges became individual oriented in nature Chris hired Owen as his ringer to sabotage the other contestants and to create drama Eventually two contestants were left standing Beth and Duncan The Total Drama Action winner was Duncan Beth wins in the alternate ending

Sprinkled among the episodes is TDA Aftermath a show within a show hosted by Geoff and Bridgette commissioned shortly after their eliminations On TDA Aftermath Geoff and Bridgette interview eliminated contestants on their Total Drama Action experiences They are accompanied by the contestants of Total Drama Island that did not qualify for Total Drama Action as well as other previously eliminated contestants TDA Aftermath consisted of various never before seen footage sequences as well as two recurring segments Thats Gonna Leave a Mark and Truth or

When the field eventually narrowed down to two contestants a final obstacle course challenge would lead the contestants into the Aftermath set with the first one arriving winning the shows million dollar grand prize Unfortunately Beth and Duncan had sufficiently cooperated enough though the final challenge to arrive at the same time and what was meant as a season recap became a show in which the winner would be determined After efforts by the eliminated and nonparticipant contestants to come up with an impartial way of determining the winner all fail Chris ultimately returns to the set and has the eliminated contestants vote for the winner who was eventually Duncan

He also wrote that he liked the term Civil Resistance better than Civil disobedience Gandhi also translated it as love force or soul force 

In most conflict the goal is to defeat the enemy to stop him from meeting his goal or to meet a goal that the enemy is trying to stop But in satyagraha these are not the goals The goal Gandhi said is to change the mind of the wrong doer not to force him  Winning means getting along with the enemy to make what is wrong right again which they might not realize is wrong For this to happen the enemys mind must change to realize that he is stopping a goal that is right

Gandhi asked those who did satyagraha to follow these rules

Another time Gandhi gave seven important rules A satyagrahi

Cycads are seed plants whose fossils are first found in the early Permian period 

They were very common in the Mesozoic era the age of the dinosaurs and are still living but are now much less common

They are different from most plants because they have large crowns of compound leaves and a stout trunk They are evergreen dioecious plants having large pinnately compound leaves 

They are frequently confused with and mistaken for palms or ferns but are only distantly related to both and instead belong to the division Cycadophyta

Like other members of the Kuiper belt Pluto is mainly made of rock and ice It is quite small It is about a fifth of the weight of the Earths Moon It is only a third its volume It has an odd orbit and This orbit is very sloped It takes Pluto to 30 to 49 AU from the Sun This causes Pluto to sometimes go closer to the Sun than Neptune 

Since it was discovered in 1930 Pluto was thought to be the Solar Systems ninth planet In the late 1970s the minor planet 2060 Chiron was found and people learned that Pluto had a small mass They asked why it was a major planet from then on because it was really small Later in the early 21st century the scattered disc object Eris and other objects like Pluto were discovered Eris is 27 more massive than Pluto On August 24 2006 the International Astronomical Union gave a definition to the word planet for the first time By this definition Pluto was not a planet anymore It became a dwarf planet along with Eris and Ceres After this Pluto was put on the list of minor planets It was given the number 134340 A number of scientists continue to hold that Pluto should be classified as a planet

Pluto and its largest moon Charon are sometimes called a binary system This is because the barycentre of their orbits does not lie within them The IAU has yet to formalise a definition for binary dwarf planets and until it passes such a ruling they classify Charon as a moon of Pluto Pluto has three known smaller moons Nix and Hydra discovered in 2005 and another as yet unnamed discovered in 2011

In the 1840s using Newtonian mechanics Urbain Le Verrier predicted the planet Neptune existed He discovered this after studying the orbit of Uranus Neptune was seen later in the late 19th century Astronomers then felt that Uranuss orbit was being disturbed by another planet In 1906 Percival Lowell a person from Boston began an extensive to search the ninth planet He called it Planet X By 1909 Lowell and William H Pickering had suggested many possible places in the Solar System where the planet could be Lowell continued the research till 1916 However it fetched no good result On March 19 1915 his observatory had captured two images of Pluto Lowell did not know this The pictures was not recognized then for what it was

Constance Lowell Percivals widow had a ten year long legal battle for Percivals estate For this reason the search for Planet X again started in 1929 The director of the mission Vesto Melvin Slipher gave the job to Clyde Tombaugh a 23 year old Kansas man Tombaugh had just come at the Lowell Observatory Slipher had been impressed by his astronomical drawings

Tombaughs had to systematically get pictures of the night sky in pairs every two weeks Then he had to look at each pair This was to know whether any object had shifted He used a machine called a blink comparator He quickly shifted between the different views of each of the plates This helped him to see whether any object had changed their position On February 18 1930 Tombaugh discovered an object which seemed to move from the photographic plates taken on January 23 and January 29 of the year Another picture taken on January 21 confirmed this After the observatory did more research about it news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13 1930

The discovery made headlines across the Earth The Lowell Observatory had the right to name the new object They received over 1000 suggestions from all over the world Some proposed Atlas as the name Others wanted to name it Zymal Tombaugh urged Slipher to suggest a name for the new object quickly before someone else did Constance Lowell proposed Zeus then Lowell and finally Constance These suggestions were not used

The name Pluto was proposed by Venetia Burney She was an 11 year old schoolgirl in Oxford England then Venetia was interested in classical mythology and astronomy The name was of the Roman god of the underworld She thought it was a good name for a dark and cold world She suggested it when she was talking with her grandfather Falconer Madan He was a former librarian at the University of Oxfords Bodleian Library Madan passed the name to Professor Herbert Hall Turner Turner told this proposed name to the astronomers in the United States

The object was officially named on March 24 1930 Each member of the Lowell Observatory was allowed to vote on a short list of three names The names were Minerva Cronus and Pluto Pluto received all votes The name was announced on May 1 1930 Upon the announcement Madan gave Venetia five pounds as a reward

The name became popular in culture The Disney character Pluto introduced in the same year He was named in the objects honour In 1941 Glenn T Seaborg named the newly created element plutonium after Pluto This was to keep the tradition of naming new elements after newly discovered planets For example uranium had been named after Uranus and neptunium after Neptune

Alessandro Scarlatti was an Italian composer He lived in the Baroque period He is especially famous for his operas and chamber cantatas He is thought of as the founder of the Neapolitan school of opera He was the father of the famous composer Domenico Scarlatti

Scarlatti was born in Palermo At that time it was part of the Kingdom of Sicily We know nothing about his musical education When his opera Gli Equivoci nell sembiante was produced in Rome in 1679 the Queen of Sweden who was living in Rome at the time was very impressed and gave him the job of being her Maestro di cappella In February 1684 he became Maestro di Cappella to the viceroy of Naples He wrote many operas for him as well as some music for important state occasions 

In 1702 Scarlatti left Naples and went to Florence where he composed operas for Ferdinando de Medici and for Cardinal Ottoboni who made him his maestro di cappella In 1703 he also got a similar job in Rome at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore 

After visiting Venice and Urbino in 1707 Scarlatti went back to Naples in 1708 and stayed there until 1717 However the audiences in Naples no longer seemed interested in his music They liked their serious operas to include comic music Some of his best operas were written for Rome where they were produced at the Teatro Capranica He also wrote some church music and music for royal weddings He died in Naples

Scarlattis music forms an important link between the early Baroque Italian vocal styles of the 17th century and the classical period of the 18th century which led to the music of Haydn and Mozart 

Perhaps his greatest work is Mitridate Eupatore Many of his later operas are full of music which allows the singers to show off  In his opera Teodora he was the first composer to use the orchestral ritornello 

Some of his later operas written for Rome make the orchestra sound much more modern He uses horns in the orchestra This was a new idea

As well as operas Scarlatti composed at least five hundred chamber cantatas These are works for solo voice accompanied by orchestra Hardly any of them were published but they contain a lot of good music

He also wrote masses including the St Cecilia Mass

Hurricane Elena was a category 3 major hurricane that caused heavy damage along the Gulf Coast of the United States in August and September of the 1985 Atlantic hurricane season

Elenas unusual path through the Gulf of Mexico which included a loop caused many people to evacuate from the coastline

Before Hurricane Elena there was a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on August 23 It remained weak due to its fast westward motion and Saharan Air Layer around the circulation As it moved through the Greater Antilles it slowed and a tropical depression formed on August 28 between Cuba and Haiti It paralleled the northern cost of Cuba and became Tropical Storm Elena that night Conditions were good for the storm to develop in the Gulf of Mexico and Elena became a hurricane on the 29th

Italian irredentism in Istria was the political movement dedicated to the unification of Istria to Italy

When Napoleon defeated Venice in 1797 found that Istria was populated by Italians on the coast and in the main cities but the interior was populated mainly by Croats and Slovenians 

This dual ethnicity in the same peninsula created a situation of antagonism between Slavs and Italians for the supremacy of Istria when started the first nationalisms after Napoleons fall

Since 1815 Istria was a part of the Austrian monarchy and CroatsSlovenians and Italians engaged in a nationalistic feud with each other

As a consequence Istria has been the theater of an ethnic struggle between them with bloody nationalistic wars during the XIX and XX centuries The Italian irredentism was actively followed by many Italians in Istria like the Italian hero Nazario Sauro of Capodistria

Indeed between 1918 and 1947 Istria was part of the Kingdom of Italy but after WWII was part of Yugoslavia Now the Istrian Italians are reduced to a small minority who has survived the Istrian exodus and the Foibe massacres during and after WWII 

Furthermore after the war was created the Free Territory of Trieste in north western Istria in the years following the division of the territory between Italy and Yugoslavia up to 40000 Istrian Italians chose to leave the Yugoslav B zone and move to the A zone or Italy for various reasons  some were intimidated into leaving and some simply preferred not to live in Titos Yugoslavia

Since the end of WWII the irredentism has totally disappeared in Istria even because of the Istrian exodus

Actually Istria is populated mainly by Slavs but nearly 50000 Italians still live there

Capodistria and Muggia were the centers of the irredentism in Istria In these cities there was the main Comitato istriano the meeting place of the most famous istrian irredentists like Carlo Combi e Antonio Madonizza From there sailed in 1848 many Istrian Italians to fight for Venice against the Austrians with the Legione Istriano dalmata

After 1866 when Venice and the Veneto region were united to Italy in all Istria there was full support for the irredentism The Italian hero Nazario Sauro was born in Capodistria 

Actually only Muggia remains Italian as part of the Province of Trieste 

Perestroika which means restructuring in the Russian language was a series of changes to the economy of the Soviet Union Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev started it in 1986 This happened only a few years before the Soviet Union fell apart into 15 countries Many historians argue that it was a major reason that the Soviet Union fell apart It happened at about the same time as Gorbachevs glasnost reforms which made what the government did not as much of a secret

The Soviet Union was a communist country The government controlled the economy People did not own their own land or businesses Under perestroika some people could even start to own their own businesses Gorbachev wanted perestroika to help out the Soviet economy which had been having problems However in the end it could not save the countrys economy

The Labrador is one of several kinds of retriever a type of gun dog They have webbed paws for swimming useful when they retrieve their prey hence the name retriever The Labrador once known as the Lesser Newfoundland is the most popular breed of dog in the world It is by a large margin the most popular breed by registration in Canada the United States and the United Kingdom

The Brown Labrador breed does not come from Labrador These dogs were bred on the coast of Newfoundland in the 17th century They were trained to bring in the fishing nets from the icy waters for the fishermen In the early 19th century they were brought to Poole Harbor in Great Britain These dogs had short strong legs and were good swimmers Their coats were thick and they had a broad tail Englishmen had many offers to buy them from fishermen because they were so attractive The breed was instantly successful as a gundog The Master of Malmesbury was interested and amazed by these dogs known at that time as Saint Johns breed of water dogs and he started breeding them calling them Labrador dogs A heavy dog tax in Canada and the new isolation laws in Great Britain caused a great reduction in the breed limiting further breeding to be done without any more imports

Brown Labradors are intelligent dogs Labradors are easily trained making them good for use in field sports obeying competitions as search dogs as guide dogs and as hearing dogs These dogs take a great pleasure in any of these activities

Cosmic rays are particles that hit Earth and come from outer space Most of these particles are protons some are the insides of helium some are electrons gamma rays or photons and a tiny fraction are even heavier particles

Some of these particles come from things that happen in the Sun and some come from all the way from unknown events in the farthest away parts of the universe Cosmic rays can have as much energy as 1020 eV far higher than the 1012 to 1013 eV that man made particle accelerators can produce 

When cosmic ray particles enter the Earths atmosphere they hit other particles particles like oxygen and nitrogen they then split apart into a shower of lighter particles a so called air shower

The number of particles made in an air shower event can reach billions All of the particles in the shower stay within about one degree of the first particles path Lots of different particles are made in collisions like this but lots of the time there are charged mesons Cosmic rays are also the reason for the why we usually have a number of unstable isotopes in the Earth that does not change much even though those isotopes break into other elements a good example is carbon 14 we always have the same number of carbon 14 particles because some cosmic rays react with elements like carbon 14 and make them unstable

The word Janeite has been used by people who love the works of Jane Austen However it can also be used to show disapproval Claudia Johnson says that Janeitism is the self consciously idolatrous enthusiasm for Jane and every detail relative to her

Janeitism did not begin until after J E Austen Leigh published A Memoir of Jane Austen in 1870 When this was published Jane Austen became much more popular This worried the literary elite They felt they had to separate their liking of Austen from the masses The word Janeite was first begun by the literary scholar George Saintsbury in his 1894 introduction to a new edition of Pride and Prejudice Austen scholar Deidre Lynch explains he meant to equip himself with a badge of honor he could jubilantly pin In the early twentieth century Janeitism was principally a male enthusiasm shared among publishers professors and literati Rudyard Kipling even printed a short story called Janeites about a group of World War I soldiers who were fans of Austens novels 

In the 1930s and 1940sAustens works were accepted at school and the word began to change its meaning It began to mean the people who liked Austen in the wrong way The word according to Lynch is now used about and against other people

Histones are proteins found in eukaryotic cell nuclei which package the DNA into structural units called nucleosomes They are the chief protein components of chromatin the active component of chromosomes 

Histones act as spools around which DNA winds and play a role in gene regulation Without histones the unwound DNA in chromosomes would be very long For example each human cell has about 18 meters of DNA but wound on the histones it has about 90 millimeters of chromatin which when duplicated and condensed during mitosis result in about 120 micrometers of chromosomes

Histones act as spools around which DNA winds This packs in the large genomes of eukaryotes to fit inside cell nuclei The compacted molecule is 40000 times shorter than an unpacked molecule

Histones undergo changes which alter their interaction with DNA and nuclear proteins Long term changes in histoneDNA interaction cause epigenetic efects Combinations of modifications are thought to constitute a code the so called histone code Histone modifications act in diverse biological processes such as gene regulation DNA repair and chromosome condensation

Examples of histone modifications in transcription regulation include

Histones were discovered in 1884 by Albrecht Kossel The word histone dates from the late 19th century and is from the German Histon of uncertain origin perhaps from Greek histanai or from histos Until the early 1990s histones were dismissed as merely packing material for nuclear DNA During the early 1990s the regulatory functions of histones were discovered

The discovery of the H5 histone appears to date back to 1970s

Histones are found in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells and in certain Archaea namely Euryarchaea but not in bacteria Histone proteins are among the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes which suggests they are vital to the biology of the nucleusrp939 In contrast mature sperm cells largely use protamines to package their genomic DNA most likely to achieve an even higher packaging ratio

Core histones are highly conserved proteins that is there are very few differences among the amino acid sequences of the histone proteins of different species Linker histone usually has more than one form within a species and is also less conserved than the core histones

In organic chemistry and biochemistry a fatty acid is a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched hydrocarbon tail It may be either saturated or unsaturated Unsaturated compounds have reactive double bonds saturated ones do not

Fatty acids are aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in an animal or vegetable fat oil or wax Natural fatty acids commonly have a chain of four to 28 carbon atoma which may be saturated or unsaturated This would include acetic acid although this is not usually considered a fatty acid 

The blend of fatty acids exuded by mammalian skin together with lactic acid and pyruvic acid are distinctive and enable animals with a keen sense of smell to differentiate individuals

Repetitive strain injury also known as occupational overuse syndrome is a medical condition affecting the muscles and nervous system It is usually caused by doing the same thing repeatedly or without breaks Using a computer for long periods of time is a common way of causing this problem 

Repetitive strain injury is described as a sudden intense pain in affected parts of the body often the wrists neck back or hands that keeps coming back It is different from more specific diagnoses because RSI does not have an easily found cause The pain is often spread across different muscle groups and inspection of the affected area usually cannot show any differences from that of a healthy person Because of this treatment for RSI is usually limited to rest and exercises and sometimes wearing a brace

Debt consolidation involves taking out a loan to pay off multiple loans This is usually done to secure a lower interest rate and for the convenience of paying only one loan

Debt consolidation usually entails taking a secured loan against an assets such as a house and using this to pay off higher interest unsecured loads and credit card debts However this puts the individuals assets at risk if they do not keep up payment

Sometimes debt consolidation companies can discount the amount of the loan When the debtor is in danger of bankruptcy the debt consolidator will buy the loan at a discount A prudent debtor can shop around for consolidators who will pass along some of the savings Consolidation can affect the ability of the debtor to discharge debts in bankruptcy so the decision to consolidate must be weighed carefully

Prognosis refers to the expected courseoutcome of a disease

Nephrectomy is the surgical removal of a kidney It is commonly performed in patients with Renal cell carcinoma or other forms of Kidney cancer

Prostatectomy is the surgical removal of part or all of the prostate It is often used in the treatment of inability to urinate or of prostate cancer Patients who are having a prostatectomy can expect to stay in the hospital for two to four days A tube called a catheter is usually left in the patients bladder for two or three weeks which can result in the patient having problems controlling his bladder for awhile

Metastatic melanoma is Melanoma that has metastasized It is treated with Dacarbizine or Interleukin 2 also known as Proleukin in many cases Interleukin 2 has a response rate of up to sixteen percent Recent studies support the use of a new drug called Ipilimumab which appears to prolong survival in metastatic melanoma patients Percutaneous liver perfusion with a chemotherapeutic agent known as melphalan can prolong progression free survival in patients with melanoma metastatic to the liver although the majority of patients in this study had melanoma starting in the eye rather than the skin

Interleukin 2 is a form of Interleukin It is important in medicine because it is an effective treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and Metastatic melanoma It can produce up to a 16 response rate in patients with Metastatic melanoma and a slightly lower 15 response rate in metastatic renal cell carcinoma

Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system There are many types of lymphoma including Hodgkins lymphoma the primary central nervous system lymphoma the B cell lymphoma and the hepatosplenic lymphoma 

Chemotherapy is often used for both Hodgkin lymphoma and Non Hodgkin Lymphomas Radiotherapy may also be used

Primary central nervous system lymphoma is a form of Lymphoma affecting the Central nervous system It is more common in those with weak immune systems such as those with AIDS

The Late Heavy Bombardment or lunar cataclysm is a period of time approximately 41 to 38 billion years ago during which a large number of impact craters are believed to have formed on the Moon and by inference on Earth Mercury Venus and Mars as well

The evidence for this event comes from the dating of lunar samples which indicates that most impact melt rocks formed at that time Many hypotheses have been suggested to explain how asteroidal or cometary material got into the inner solar system no consensus yet exists One popular theory is that the gas giant planets migrated in orbit at this time causing objects in the asteroid belt andor Kuiper belt to be forced into orbits which reached the terrestrial planets 

Some argue that the lunar sample data do not require a cataclysmic cratering event near 39 Ga They think the apparent clustering of impact melt ages near this time is an artifact of sampling

Brain tumors are any tumor in the Brain They may be benign or malignant

The treatment varies based on the type of tumor For meningiomas surgical removal of the tumor alone is often sufficient Malignant tumors like Anaplastic astrocytoma and Glioblastoma multiforme however require more aggressive therapy For Glioblastoma multiforme surgical removal of the tumor followed by radiotherapy is used Temozolomide is also used for gliomas

Benzodiazepines are organic chemical substances made of two rings Certain benzodiazepines can be used as drugs that increase the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA The resulting drug has sedative effects Depending on the drug the effect may be stronger or weaker The first benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide was discovered accidentally by Leo Sternbach in 1955 and made available in 1960 by HoffmannLa Roche

In general taking benzodiazepines is safe and effective in the short term Longer term use is controversial In the long term the drug may become less effective and problems of dependency may show 

Benzodiazepines may not be safe to be taken during pregnancy They are not teratogens but they may cause cleft palate in a small number of babiesBenzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness However they are much less toxic than the drugs they replaced the barbiturates Death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken When combined with other central nervous system depressants such as alcohol and opiates the potential for toxicity increases Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse

Bacterial meningitis is Meningitis caused by Bacteria It is almost always fatal without antibiotics

Treatment for Bacterial meningitis consists of IV antibiotics

Viral meningitis is an infection of the brain that is caused by a virus It is usually caused by enteroviruses Viral meningitis is not so dangerous as meningitis that is caused by bacteria and the symptoms are often mild or similar to flu This disease occurs mainly in the summer Children get this infection more than adults Children usually recover completely after a two weeks Strong medicines are often not needed

Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer involving the plasma cells Some symptoms of the multiple myeloma are bone pain renal failure recurring infections and anemia It is treated with chemotherapy A commonly used chemotherapy regimen is the Vincristine Adriamycin and Dexamethasone Thalidomides velcades melphalans prednisones and inteferons have also been used

Edward Everett was an American politician religious leader and educator from Massachusetts He was a Whig He served as US Representative and US Senator the 15th Governor of Massachusetts Minister to Great Britain and United States Secretary of State He also taught at Harvard University and was as president of Harvard He was the Vice Presidential candidate of the Constitutional Union Party in 1860 He gave a long speech at Gettysburg right before Abraham Lincoln

When Abraham Lincoln became president the Civil War broke out Everett had been calmer about slavery but he was a strong Unionist He worked hard to raise support for the Union through speaking in public In November 1863 when the military cemetery at Gettysburg Pennsylvania was dedicated Everett was the main speaker His two hour speech was before the much shorter but now more famous Gettysburg Address by President Lincoln Everett was moved by the short speech and wrote to Lincoln I should be glad if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion in two hours as you did in two minutes 

The NBA Draft happens every year in June It is where teams in the National Basketball Association choose players who have never played in the NBA before If a team chooses a player that player cannot sign a contract to play for any teams other than that team

Players must be at least 19 years old at some point during the year of the draft If the players 19th birthday will be the next year they are too young If a player is from the United States it must be at least one year after the graduation of his high school class Some players who are star players go to college and play college basketball for just one year then enter the NBA Draft These players are called one and dones Other players enter the draft after two or three years in college and other players are drafted after playing in college for all four years that they can

If a player has not played in college for four years they must enter the NBA Draft by declaring themselves eligible 

Teams take turns choosing players When a team chooses a player it is called a pick For example if a player is the second player chosen people will say that he was taken with the second pick in the draft There are two rounds in the draft Both rounds have 30 picks so there are 60 picks in the whole draft Each team gets one pick per round but sometimes a team will pick more than once in a round or not at all This is because teams can trade draft picks for players for money or for other draft picks

The NBA allows teams who had worse records the previous season to pick before better teams This lets bad teams draft good players and become better The first fourteen teams to pick are the fourteen teams that did not make the playoffs the previous season The teams that do not make the playoffs and who get picks 15 through 30 in the first round pick in reverse order of how good their records were However the first fourteen picks are given out differently so that teams will not lose games on purpose to get higher picks These picks are given to teams in a process called the Draft Lottery

Since 1985 all teams that have missed the playoffs have participated in a lottery system to see who gets the first pick The lottery system has changed a few times since then but the system that the NBA uses right now uses ping pong balls that have numbers written on them A machine picks four balls at a time and every possible combination of numbers is assigned to a team Teams with worse records get more combinations of numbers which means that they have a better chance to win The machine picks three teams and these teams get the first three picks in the draft The other eleven teams will pick in order of how bad their records are so the worst team that was not selected will pick fourth and so on

Many star NBA players who helped their teams a lot were selected early in the NBA Draft For example with the first pick in the 1997 NBA Draft the San Antonio Spurs chose Tim Duncan Duncan would help the San Antonio Spurs win several NBA Championships Other star players who were chosen with the first pick are Shaquille ONeal Dwight Howard and LeBron James chosen by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003 However not all players who have been chosen with the first pick have gone on to become star players Some players have not had as much success as the teams who drafted them expected and have been called draft busts A few players chosen with the first pick who have been called draft busts include Joe Smith Michael Olowokandi and Kwame Brown

Radiometric dating is a technique used to date materials The method compares the amount of a naturally occurring radioactive isotope and its decay products in samples The method uses known decay rates 

It is the main source of information about the age of rocks and other geological features including the age of the Earth itself It may be used to date a wide range of natural and man made materials Fossils may be dated by taking samples of suitable rocks from strata above and below the fossils original position Radiometric dating is also used to date archaeological materials including ancient artifacts

Radiometric dating methods are used to establish the geological time scale Among the best known techniques are radiocarbon dating potassium argon dating and uranium lead dating 

All ordinary matter is made up of combinations of chemical elements each with its own atomic number indicating the number of protons in the atomic nucleus Elements exist in different isotopes with each isotope of an element differing in the number of neutrons in the nucleus A particular isotope of a particular element is called a nuclide Some nuclides are inherently unstable That is at some point in time an atom of such a nuclide will spontaneously transform into a different nuclide This transformation may occur in various ways including radioactive decay either by emission of particles or by spontaneous nuclear fission and electron capture

The mathematical expression that relates radioactive decay to geologic time is 

where

The above equation makes use of information on the composition of parent and daughter isotopes at the time the material solidified This is well known for most isotopic systems Plotting an isochron is used to solve the age equation graphically and calculate the age of the sample and the original composition

The method requires that neither the parent nuclide nor the daughter product can enter or leave the material after its formation Anything which changes the relative amounts of the two isotopes must be noted and avoided if possible Contamination from outside or the loss of isotopes at any time from the rocks original formation would change the result It is therefore essential to have as much information as possible about the material being dated and to check for possible signs of alteration 

Measurements should be taken on multiple samples from different parts of the rock body This helps to counter the effects of heating and squeezing which a rock may exoerience in its long history Using different dating methods may be required to confirm the age of a sample For example a study of the Amitsoq gneisses from western Greenland used five different radiometric dating methods to examine twelve samples and achieved agreement to within 30 million years on an age of 3640my

PotassiumArgon dating or KAr dating is a radiometric dating method used in geochronology and archaeology It is based on measurement of the product of the radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium into argon 

Potassium is a common element found in many materials such as micas clay tephra and evaporites In these materials the decay product 40Ar is able to escape the liquid rock but starts to accumulate when the rock solidifies Time since recrystallization is calculated by measuring the ratio of the amount of 40Ar accumulated to the amount of 40K remaining The long half life of 40K allows the method to be used to calculate the absolute age of samples older than a few thousand years The quickly cooled lavas that make nearly ideal samples for KAr dating also preserve a record of the direction and intensity of the local magnetic field as the sample cooled past the Curie point of iron The geomagnetic polarity time scale was calibrated largely using KAr dating





Uranium lead is one of the oldest and most refined of the radiometric dating schemes 

It can be used over an age range of about 1 million years to over 45 billion years Precision is in the 01 1 percent range 

The method relies on two separate decay chains the uranium series from 238U to 206Pb with a half life of 447 billion years and the actinium series from 235U to 207Pb with a half life of 704 million years

The existence of two parallel uranium lead decay routes allows several dating techniques within the overall U Pb system 

The term U Pb dating normally implies the coupled use of both decay schemes However use of a single decay scheme leads to the U Pb isochron dating method analogous to the rubidium strontium dating method 

Finally ages can also be determined from the U Pb system by analysis of Pb isotope ratios alone This is termed the lead lead dating method Clair Cameron Patterson an American geochemist who pioneered studies of uranium lead radiometric dating methods is famous for having used it to obtain one of the earliest accurate estimates of the age of the Earth

Uranium lead dating is usually performed on the mineral zircon though it can be used on other minerals Zircon incorporates uranium and thorium atoms into its crystalline structure but strongly rejects lead Therefore we can assume that the entire lead content of the zircon is radiogenic Where this is not the case a correction must be applied Uranium lead dating techniques have also been applied to other minerals such as calcitearagonite and other carbonate minerals These minerals often produce lower precision ages than igneous and metamorphic minerals traditionally used for age dating but are more common in the geologic record

Imhotep was a high priest in ancient Egypt and had many other important skills He was born in Ankhtowe on the 16th day of Epiphi Epiphi is the third month of the Egyptian harvest season His mother was Khreduonkh and father was Kanofer an architect Imhotep also became famous as an architect After his death because of his attachment with the god Ptah during his work at Ptahs temple stories were spread that said that Ptah was his father As a god he was often pictured seated wearing a long kilt robe and a skull cap or a shaven head He had a papyrus scroll spread on his lap to show his scholarly nature and scribal assistance 

As an architect Imhotep was most famous because he was the designer of the step pyramid Before the step pyramid pharaohs were buried in flat topped structures called mastabas The term mastaba comes from the word meaning bench because they look like the benches most Egyptians placed outside their door An average mastaba had four walls a flat top and an underground burial chamber reached by a vertical shaft or stairwell There were also a couple of small rooms above the burial chambers containing various items for the afterlife The step pyramid was actually just a number of mastabas placed one on top of the other each one smaller than the previous one 

Imhoteps best known writings were medical scrolls He is thought to have written the Edwin Smith papyrus The papyrus consists of 48 injuries of which 27 are head trauma and six are spine trauma Heres an example for treatment of a head injury Examination If thou examinest a man having a wound in his head while his wound does not have two lips penetrating to the bone of his skull not having a gash thou shouldst palpate his wound shouldst thou find his skull uninjured not having a perforation a split or a smash in it Treatment Thou shouldst bind it with fresh meat the first day treat afterwards with grease honey lint every day until he recovers wound in the head nosourcesdateJuly 2010

Around 100 years after his death Imhotep was deified He became the god of medicine and healing Small temples were built in honor of him People with injuries would sleep near his temple hoping to be healed As a god Imhotep was also worshiped by scribes Scribes would offer a couple drops of water in libation to him before starting to write Even when the Greeks took over he was identified with another deified man called Asclepius and the Greeks continued to honor and build temples for him This continued until the Arab invasion in North Africa in the 7th century AD Imhotep did many things that boosted Egyptian society to amazing heights He was the architect that changed Egyptian funeral architecture from mastabas to the phenomenal structures we today call pyramids As a physician he healed many people and saved many lives which after his death lead to him becoming a medicine god
