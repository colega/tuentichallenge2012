Kpenick part of the German capital city of Berlin It is at the meeting place of two rivers the Dahme and Spree 

It is known for the famous imposter Wilhelm Voigt the Captain of Kpenick 

Kpenick was an independent town until 1920 It then became a borough of Berlin with an area of km2 to mi2128abbryes making it Berlins largest borough In 2001 the borough of Kpenick was merged with that of Treptow to create the current borough of Treptow Kpenick

A lot of Kpenicks area is covered with forests and water such as the Mggelsee lake 

The Spree connects Kpenick with the Mggelsee and the Berlin city centre The Oder Spree Canal links the Dahme at nearby Schmckwitz with the Oder river at Eisenhttenstadt thus providing a navigable connection between Kpenick and the Oder 

There are so many forests and parks in Kpenick is sometimes called the green lungs of Berlin The Mggelberge hills in the south east of Kpenick reach m to ft115abbryes making them the highest natural point of Berlin

Kpenick is divided into 8 zones

For many years Kpenick was an independent town Its was first mentioned as a stronghold in 1209 This means Kpenick is older than Berlin Clln which was first mentioned in a 1237 deed For the most part of Kpenicks history the town was known as Cpenick

In 1631 during the Thirty Years War the emissaries of George William Elector of Brandenburg went to Kpenick to meet the approaching army of Gustav Adolph King of Sweden to try to stop the devastation of Brandenburg 

In 1906 a shoemaker called Wilhelm Voigt pretended to be a Prussian officer and took over the town hall of Kpenick A play was made about the event and later several films and television shows

Photocatalysis is using light as a catalyst to increase the rate of a photoreaction Most known photoreactions begin when light creates a free radical in the reaction system Light can have a lot of energy and is able to break chemical bonds For example some things fade or lose their color when left in sunlight When light breaks the chemical bonds free radicals are produced A free radical is a molecule atom or an ion that needs an electron The free radical will take electrons from other molecules or atoms and this starts chemical reactions

Photo is a prefix showing that light is involved Photolysis is when light cuts of a molecule In a chemical reaction there are reactants also called reagents that you begin with Once the reaction takes place you have products In the example below methane and oxygen are the reactants and carbon dioxide and water are the products 

CH4 2O2 CO2 2H2O

Catalysis is using a catalyst to change the rate of a chemical reaction For the reactants to become the products the reaction must overcome an energy barrier This energy barrier is known as the activation energy For example when you lit the methane gas you are providing the activation energy to burn 

Rate is how fast or slow a chemical reaction happens

Catalyst is a substance present but not consumed in a reaction like the other reagents while increasing the rate of the reaction The graph below shows the catalysts effect on the activation energy The Y axis shows the activation energy while the x axis shows the reaction over time With no catalyst present the reaction has a higher energy to overcome In the presence of a catalyst the activation energy is reduced FileCatalysisSchemepngActivation Energy vs Time 

In a vacuum light travels at c c 299792458X108 ms thats 186000 miles in one second 

The up and down pattern is how we show light The high points are called crests and the low are called troughs Light has three characteristics that we use to describe it Wavelength is the distance between two peaks that are next to each other Frequency is the number of times a unit of light can pass by a point over time Amplitude is the vertical distance between a peak and the next trough  FileEM Spectrum Properties editsvgElectromagnetic Spectrum 

Photocatalysis is getting more attention from the scientific community due to the green movement  An example of organometallic research is mimicking photosynthesis Photosynthesis is the process that plants use to make sugar for food Plants use only carbon dioxide gas from the air water and sunlight Plants actually have an organometallic molecule containing Mn that helps them perform this reaction Scientists hope to make an organometallic molecule that can make organic products like fuels using only carbon dioxide water and light If this process could be harnessed it could dramatically reduce pollution because the carbon you make your fuel with is the carbon dioxide from the air

X ray crystallography is a way to see the three dimensional structure of a molecule The electron cloud of an atom bends the X rays slightly This makes a picture of the molecule that can be seen on a screen It can be used for both organic and inorganic molecules The sample is not destroyed in the process

The technique was jointly invented by Sir Lawrence Bragg and his son Sir William Bragg They won the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1915 Lawrence Bragg is the youngest to be made a Nobel Laureate He was the Director of the Cavendish Laboratory Cambridge University when the discovery of the structure of DNA was made by James D Watson and Francis Crick in February 1953

NMR spectroscopy is a way to see the structure of a molecule Certain atoms nuclei have certain magnetic properties when in a strong magnetic field Carbon and hydrogen can be detected in this way It does not destroy the sample being tested

Mercury sulfate also known as mercurous sulfate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Hg2SO4 It has mercury and sulfate ions in it The mercury is in its 1 oxidation state

Mercury sulfate is a whitish yellow solid It is not soluble in water It does dissolve in dilute nitric acid

It is made by dissolving a large amount of mercury in concentrated sulfuric acid It can also be made by reacting mercury nitrate with any sulfate or sulfuric acid

Spectroscopy is a involves the interactions between light and matter that allow us to analyze the structure of molecules based on variations in their absorption of electromagnetic radiation Instrumentation is defined as the method of measurement and control

How do we prove what we have synthesized Or how much of something we have made Molecules are far too small to be observed under a microscope like cells To gauge what we are dealing with there are sub atomic particles atoms atoms combine to form molecules millions of specific molecules make up cells thousands of specialized cells make up tissue combinations of tissues make organs a collection of specialized organs make organisms Spectroscopy provides scientists with the ability to identify various chemical species These various methods are based on different chemical properties like functional groups symmetry structure etc The efforts of thousands of scientists over time have resulted in some very clever means by which we can identify molecules

IR spectroscopy Uses the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum The highlight of IR spectroscopy is that it is very useful in identifying functional groups of organic molecules The absorption of infrared light by organic molecules causes molecular vibrations The vibrational frequencies are unique to the individual functional groups IR spectra is given graphically by transmittance vs wavenumber

X Ray crystallography is a technique that yields the three dimensional structure of a crystalline molecule The electron cloud of each atom diffracts the x rays thus revealing the positions of the atoms Various inorganic and organic molecules can be crystallized and used in this method including DNA proteins salts and metals  The sample used for analysis is not destroyed 

UV Vis uses visible light and ultra violet light to determine the amount of a substance dissolved in a solution The color of the solution is the basis for how UV Vis works The color of the solution we are working with is colored because of its chemical composition  So the solution absorbs some light colors and reflects other colors the light it reflects is the color of the solution UV Vis spectroscopy works by passing light through a sample of your solution then determining how much light gets absorbed by the solution

Nuclear magnetic resonance uses the magnetic properties of certain nuclei the most common being 13C and 1H The NMR instrument generates a large magnetic field that makes the nuclei act like tiny bar magnets The nuclei either align with the instruments magnetic field or against it At this point we have two possible orientations the nuclei could be in or Next the nuclei are exposed to radio waves that make go to the orientation When this change occurs energy is given off and detected The data is interpreted graphically by a computer system NMR does not destroy the sample you use for analysis Below is a 900 MHz NMR system

Italian Renaissance art is a style of painting and sculpture that began in the late 13th century with the work of the painter Giotto and a sculptor Nicola Pisano The Renaissance way of painting and sculpting did not become the usual style until about 100 years later From 1400 to about 1600 many artists in Italy used and developed the style Leonardo da Vinci is a very famous example of an artist in this style 

The city of Florence is a birthplace of the Renaissance and in particular of Renaissance art 

Italian Renaissance painting can be divided into four periods 

The Proto Renaissance begins with the works of the painter Giotto and includes Taddeo Gaddi Orcagna and Altichiero and the sculptor Nicola Pisano The Early Renaissance was the time of the painters Masaccio Fra Angelico Uccello Piero della Francesca and Verrocchio and the sculptors Ghiberti and Donatello The High Renaissance was the time of Leonardo da Vinci Raphael and Titian as well as Michelangelo who was famous as a sculptor and as a painter The Mannerist period was the time of Andrea del Sarto Pontormo and Tintoretto and the sculptors Giambologna and Cellini 

Cosimo de Medici was intelligent deeply religious very rich and wanted to be remembered as a man who did great things for Florence He was a great patron of the arts and learning He paid artists to make many beautiful paintings and sculptures He collected many books that were given to the Friary of St Mark so that a library could be made and many people could use them After Cosimo his sons Piero and Giovanni and his grandsons Lorenzo and Giuliano continued to be patrons of the arts and of learning They gathered a group of philosophers poets and artists together in the Medici Academy

Cunard Line is a shipping company that was founded in 1840 and runs cruise ships all over the world

Cunard was formed in 1840 by Samuel Cunard after he decided to start a company that would carry mail from England to the United States England paid for the costs of this service since the country wanted a more regular service than the sailing ships of the time could do Cunard started with four steam ships that made crossings of the Atlantic Ocean once a week The company became known for its record of good safetywhile ships of other companies often sank killing many people these sorts of things rarely happened to Cunard

By the early 1900s though Cunard was faced with many other ships from several countries also competing with it for passengers going across the Atlantic This caused the company to build three new ships larger and faster than the ones before them They were named RMS Mauretania RMS Lusitania and RMS Aquitania Theses ships made Cunard back into a leading shipping line even though Lusitania was sunk during World War I by a German submarine killing 1200 people

In 1934 another big Cunard ship the RMS Queen Mary began service She was the largest ship ever built at that time During World War II Queen Mary and another new ship like her Queen Elizabeth carried many soldiers to support England and the US

By the 1960s people preferred to cross the Atlantic by jet airplanes rather than by ships so Cunard sold most of their ships or made them cruise ships instead of ocean liners Cunard still decided to build one new ocean liner though RMS Queen Elizabeth 2 She started service in 1969 and became a very popular ship because she made both cruises and crossings of the Atlantic

In 1998 Carnival Corporation bought Cunard Soon after the company decided to build a new ocean liner that would make both cruises and Atlantic crossings like Queen Elizabeth 2 but would be bigger This ship entered service in 2004 and is named RMS Queen Mary 2

Cunard operates three ships as of 2010 and has operated many more in the past The three that are in service are RMS Queen Mary MS Queen Victoria and MS Queen Elizabeth

Emulsifiers are additives that help two items mix For example water and oil separate in a glass but adding an emulsifier will help the liquids mix together It is commonly used for different foods and drinks

The German invasion of the Soviet Union was originally Operation Barbarossa This was the plan to conquer the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany The Invasion took place on the Eastern European border of German occupied land next to the Soviet Union Yet the Soviets had invaded and occupied the Baltics and Moldavia This did not change the invasion Hitler thought that the Soviet territory would double their amount of resources and expand the War to Asia and help fight with Japan also thinking that the Red Army would be easy to defeat Though Hitler was wrong A freezing Russian winter broke in and froze many of the tanks fuel and men were still wearing summer uniforms which they stuffed with newspapers in an attempt to stay warm The war lasted only for a few months with a German victory But the Soviets struck back when the Allies invaded Normandy The Soviets invaded and continued to occupy more German Territories in Eastern Europe When they Reached the capital the Battle of Berlin began Hitler and Nazi Germany crumbled as the war ended in Europe

Lawrence Richard Walters nicknamed Lawnchair Larry or the Lawn Chair Pilot was an American truck driver On 2 July 1982 he flew very high in the sky in a homemade aircraft He called his flying machine Inspiration I It was made of an ordinary outdoor chair and 45 large balloons full of helium Walters went up of more than 15000 feet He went from San Pedro California into an area near Los Angeles International Airport that was only for airplanes Many newspapers reported his flight and he became famous Later he had problems and killed himself

Walters had always dreamed of flying He was unable to become a pilot in the United States Air Force because he could not see well enough Walters had first thought of using weather balloons to fly at age 13 He got the idea when he saw the balloons hanging from the ceiling of a military surplus store Twenty years later he decided to do try it He planned to attach a few large balloons filled with helium to his lawnchair and then float above his backyard He planned to stay about 30 feet up in the air for several hours He had a pellet gun to break some balloons and move back to the ground softly

In 1982 Walters and his girlfriend Carol Van Deusen bought 45 eight foot weather balloons They got helium tanks from California Toy Time Balloons They used a fake letter from his employer FilmFair Studios It said the balloons were for a television commercial

They went to the backyard of a home at 1633 W 7th St in San PedroWalters attached the balloons to his lawnchair filled them with helium He put on a parachute and used belts to hold himself in the chair He took his pellet gun a CB radio sandwiches cold beer and a camera His friends cut the rope that tied his lawn chair to his Jeep and Walters lawnchair went up very quickly Soon he was 15000 feet up in the air

At first he was afraid to shoot any balloons He thought he might change the way the chair pointed and fall out He could not control which way he moved He slowly passed over Long Beach and moved into the space where airplanes came into Long Beach Airport

He used his CB radio to contact people on the ground Some people made a recording of the conversation Walters asked them to tell the airport what was happening He also asked them to tell people he was OK

After 45 minutes in the sky he shot several balloons Then he accidentally dropped his pellet gun He went down slowly until cables hanging from the balloon got caught in an electrical power line This caused a blackout in a Long Beach neighborhood for 20 minutes Walters was able to climb to the ground

The Long Beach Police Department was waiting for him They arrested him immediately A reporter asked Larry why he had done it Walters said A man cant just sit around

At first Walters was fined US4000 for breaking U S Federal Aviation Regulations Walters tried to have the fine cancelled It was reduced to US1500

Walters received the top prize from the Bonehead Club of Dallas for his adventure He was on television programs such as The Tonight Show and Late Night with David Letterman He got a special prize in 1982 at the Darwin Awards

The TV show MythBusters made a flight like Walters had done But they used a rope to keep the chair from going too high One of the shows hosts went up about 30m He went back down slowly by shooting balloons with a pellet gun

Larry gave the lawnchair from the flight to a boy named Jerry because the boy liked him Later Walters realized that was a mistake when the Smithsonian Institute asked him to donate it to its museum Twenty years later Jerry contacted Mark Barry Barry is a pilot wrote about Walters and made a website about his flight The chair was still sitting in Jerrys garage and had some of the original ropes and water jugs

Walters said that he had dreamed about flying this way for twenty years And that if he had not tried it he would have become crazy He did not think that reaching his goal in life would cause so much excitement or make so many people laugh

After his flight he quit his job as a truck driver He was in a Timex print advertisement in the early 90s He also gave speeches to help people get more confidence But he never made much money from being famous Walters hiked in the San Gabriel Mountains and did volunteer work for the United States Forest Service He broke up with his girlfriend after 15 years He worked as a security guard sometimes

In 1993 Walters shot himself in the heart in Angeles National Forest and died He was 44 years old

Kent Couch is a gas station owner from Bend Oregon He flew 240 miles in his lawn chair on Saturday 7 July 2007 He landed in a field about 3 miles NNW of North Powder Oregon near Idaho He travelled an average of 22 miles per hour He tied 105 large helium balloons to his lawn chair Couch used plastic bags filled with 75 liters water as weight to balance the balloons Couch had a BB gun to shoot the balloons and start going down on that first flight He tried again and learned how to let helium out of the balloons and go down more carefully On 5 July 2008 Couch finally reached his goal He travelled to another state and landed his lawnchair in western Idaho The trip was 240 miles and took 9 hours and 12 minutes

On 20 April 2008 a Brazilian Roman Catholic priest Adelir Antonio de Carli flew using a chair and 1000 helium balloons He did not check the weather forecast and got caught in a storm He had a GPS but did not know how to use it He crashed into the sea The Brazilian navy found his body near an offshore oil platform on 4 July 2008 This unsuccessful flight won him a 2008 Darwin Award

Many other people have tried flying with balloons the same way Some may even have gone higher than Larry did

The Upper Jurassic or Late Jurassic is the last epoch of the Jurassic Period It lasted from 1612 40 to 1455 40 million years ago and is preserved in Upper Jurassic strata

During the Upper Jurassic epoch Pangaea broke up into two supercontinents Laurasia to the north and Gondwana to the south The result of this break up was the spawning of the Atlantic Ocean However at this time the Atlantic Ocean was relatively narrow

Sea level was high though not so high as during the Upper Cretaceous The Laurasian landmass was broken up by the rising sea into large islands The rocks were carbonate limestones and clays The epoch included the famous Solnhofen limestone lagersttte where Archaeopteryx was found

 Stages  The Upper Jurassic is divided into three stages

The Upper Jurassic of England and Europe bears a huge amount of the products of life The Kimmeridge clay is the main source for the huge North Sea oil reserves and the whole epoch is stuffed full of marine fossils Many dinosaur remains have also been found The epoch starts with the Oxford Clay deposited in a shallow seaway of 10 to 50 metres depth

The first fossils which show small dinosaurs with feathers are found Anchiornis

Mercury bromide also known as mercuric bromide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is HgBr2 It has mercury and bromide ions in it The mercury is in its 2 oxidation state

Mercury bromide is a colorless solid It is very toxic and similar to mercury chloride It can form explosive mixtures with potassium It also reacts violently with indium at high temperatures It is corrosive 

It can be made by reacting mercury oxide with hydrobromic acid or by disproportionation of mercury bromide

It is used as a reagent in a reaction in organic chemistry It is also used to test for arsenic The arsenic is reacted with hydrogen to make arsine which reacts with mercury bromide to turn it yellow or brown

The babirusas are a genus Babyrousa in the pig family found in Wallacea or specifically the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi Togian Sula and Buru All members of this genus were considered part of a single species until recently the babirusa but following the split into several species this scientific name is restricted to the Buru babirusa from Buru and Sula whereas the best known species the north Sulawesi babirusa is named B celebensis The name pig deer has sometimes also been used in English and is a direct translation of the Indonesian babi rusa

Originally known as the second Mademoiselle de Blois that style eventually gave way to the name Franoise Marie de Blois She married her first cousin Philippe dOrlans in 18 February 1692 at the age of fourteen and later bore eight children four of which would have further children

Proud lazy and attractive she successfully intrigued to have her daughters marry well to the Prince of Conti Duke of Berry Duke of Modena and King of Spain mostly to spite her sister Louise Franoise de Bourbon the Duchess of Bourbon However she welded little political influence considering her proximity to the political circle of the era She was involved in the Cellamare Conspiracy in 1718 which was supposed to overthrow her own husband Philippe dOrlans as Regent of the Kingdom and replace him with her favourite brother the Duke of Maine The marquis dArgenson said she was very like her mother Madame de Montespan but also had Louis XIVs orderly mind with his failings of injustice and harshness

Louis Philippe dOrlans was Duke of Orlans and the father of Philippe galit He greatly augmented the already huge wealth of the House of Orlans 

Louis Philippe dOrlans was born at the Palace of Versailles on 12 May 1725 As the only son of Louis dOrlans Duke of Orlans and his wife Johanna of Baden Baden 

In 1743 his paternal grandmother Franoise Marie de Bourbon the formidable Dowager Duchess of Orlans and Louise lisabeth Dowager Princess of Conti arranged his marriage to his seventeen year old cousin Louise Henriette de Bourbon The couple was married on 17 December 1743 at Versailles

After a few months of a passion that surprised everyone at court the couple started to drift apart as the young Duchess of Chartres began to lead a scandalous life 

After the death of Louise Henriette on 9 February 1759 Louis Philippe took as his mistress tiennette Le Marquis a former dancer who liked to act in comedy plays and who introduced him into the world of the theater Louis Philippe had three children with tiennette they were raised under the care of the Orlans family

In spite of his liaison with tiennette Louis Philippe had several other mistresses until he met in July 1766 Charlotte Jeanne Braud de La Haye de Riou Madame de Montesson a witty but married twenty eight year old After the death of the Marquis of Montesson in 1769 Louis Philippe tried to obtain Louis XVs authorisation to marry the young widow Finally in December 1772 the King gave his consent on the condition that the Marquise of Montesson would never become Duchess of Orlans or succeed to any other Orlans titles In addition the couple was to live a quiet life away from the court The morganatic wedding took place on 23 April 1773 

Surrounded by all the members of his immediate family even his three children by Etiennette Le Marquis Louis Philippe died on 18 November 1785 at Sainte Assise at the age of sixty He was buried at the Val de Grce convent in Paris built by his ancestor Anne of Austria to celebrate the birth of Louis XIV of France Louis Philippes great grandfather 

Louis Philippe Joseph dOrlans commonly known as Philippe was a member of the House of Orlans He actively supported the French Revolution and adopted the name Philippe galit but was still guillotined during the Reign of Terror His son Louis Philippe became King of the French after the July Revolution of 1830 

Louis Philippe Joseph dOrlans was the son of Louis Philippe dOrlans Duke of Chartres and Louise Henriette de Bourbon and was born at the Chteau de Saint Cloud 

In November 1785 upon his fathers death Philippe the new Duke of Orlans became the head of the House of Orlans This was one of the wealthiest families of France and Premier Prince du Sang addressed as Monsieur le Prince the most important person of the kingdom after the kings immediate family He was next in line to the throne should the main Bourbon line die out

On 6 June 1769 Louis Philippe married Louise Marie Adlade de Bourbon at the Chapel of the Palace of Versailles Louise Marie Adlade brought to the already wealthy House of Orlans a considerable dowry of six million livres an annual income of 240000 livres as well as lands titles residences and furniture They had five children

During the first few months of their marriage the couple appeared devoted to each other but the duke went back to the life of libertinage he had led before his marriage During the summer of 1772 a few months after his wife had given birth to a stillborn daughter Philippe began a secret relationship with one of her ladies in waiting Stphanie Flicit Ducrest de St Albin comtesse de Genlis Stephanie was the niece of Madame de Montesson his fathers second wife 

In 1778 Philippe served in the squadron of the Count of Orvilliers He was present in the Battle of Ushant a naval battle against the British during the American War of Independence on 27 July 1778 He was removed from the navy due in part to the queens hatred of him and also to his own incompetence and alleged cowardice As compensation he was given the honorary post of colonel general of hussars

The part Philippe dOrlans played during the summer of 1789 is one of the most debated points in the history of the French Revolution The royal court said he was at the bottom of every popular movement and saw the gold of Orlans as the cause of the Rveillon riot and the storming of the Bastille This was like the subsequent belief held by the Jacobins that everything opposing them relied on the gold of Pitt the Younger His hatred of Marie Antoinette his previous disgrace at court and his liberalism all seem to point towards his involvement The Duke is also said to have deliberately withheld grain from the people of Paris being a direct cause of the 5 October March on Versailles The Duke is also thought to have lied about where he was when the Palace at Versailles was stormed in the early hours of the morning on the 6th of October He said he was at the General Assembly in Paris yet several witness saw him lead the bloodthirsty mob to a staircase leading to the Queens bedroom protected by Swiss Guard The mob cried Long live our King dOrlans during the raid

The Marquis de La Fayette apparently jealous of Philippes popularity persuaded the king to send the duke to Britain on a mission where he remained in England from October 1789 to July 1790 On 7 July 1790 he took his seat in the National Constituent Assembly On 2 October both he and Honor Mirabeau were declared by the Assembly entirely free of any involvement in the events of 56 October 1789

Philippe dOrlans tried to keep himself distant from the political world but he was still suspect to the King and subject to pressures from his supporters to replace Louis XVI His lack of political aspirations could be proven by noting that he did not attempt to obtain any leading position after the Kings flight to Varennes in June 1791 In fact Louis Philippe attempted to reconcile with the King in January 1792 but was rejected and refused to aid the King any further In an attempt to show his support of democratic and Enlightenment philosophies he changed his name to Philippe Citoyen Egalit meaning equality

In the summer of 1792 he was present for a short time with the Army of the North together with his two sons the Duke of Chartres future King of the French and the Duke of Montpensier but had returned to Paris before the insurrection of 10 August

After the fall of the monarchy Philippe risked his own life by saving suspects of the revolutionary regime At the request of Grace Elliott he saved the life of Louis Ren Quentin de Richebourg de Champcenetz the governor of the Tuileries Palace who was his personal enemy He accepted the title Citoyen galit given to him by the Commune He was elected 20th and last deputy for Paris to the National Convention where he again made no notable contribution other than voting in the kings trial He voted in support of the death sentence for Louis XVI Many citizens of Paris saw this as an attempt by Philippe to overthrow the crown and take power himself They believed that not only was the Palais Royal the center for revolutionary and philosophical debates but that it was also his ground for recruiting and financing riots and rebellious activity

As a member of the House of Bourbon Louis Philippe was shortlisted for a trial and effectively tried and guillotined in the space of one day on 6 November 1793 Accounts of his time in prison and execution mention his exceptional courage

Philippe dOrlans was buried in the Madeleine cemetery in Paris where Louis XVI Marie Antoinette and hundreds executed on the Place de la Rvolution during the Terror had been buried His remains have never never found

Hamiltonian mechanics is a mathematical way of understanding the way something mechanical will behave It was invented in 1833 by Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton

The value of the Hamiltonian is the total energy of the thing being described For a closed system it is the sum of its kinetic and potential energy There will be a set of differential equations known as the Hamilton equations which show how the thing changes through time 

Hamiltonians can be used to describe such simple systems as a bouncing ball a pendulum or an oscillating spring in which energy changes between kinetic and potential energy and back again over time Hamiltonians can also be used to study the orbits of planets and in the behaviour of atoms using the principles of quantum mechanics

Finally in 1770 when she was twenty years old she was allowed to leave the convent and marry her younger cousin the Louis Henri de Bourbon son and heir of Louis Joseph de Bourbon Prince of Cond and his wife Charlotte lisabeth Godefride de Rohan 

The scandal of her husbands adultery came out in 1778 and the consequences fell entirely on her shoulders The couple separated in 1780 As a separated spouse she was never received at court and was forced to reorganise her life at the Chteau de Chantilly 

In her isolation she discreetly had an illegitimate daughter with a marine officer Later she passed the child off as the daughter of her secretary in order to keep the little girl close to her In 1787 she purchased the lyse Palace from Louis XVI and had a hamlet constructed there

During the French Revolution just like her brother Philippe galit Bathilde discovered democracy She fell out with her royalist husband and son who both chose to leave France after the storming of the Bastille As the Ancien Rgime crumbled she took the name Citoyenne Vrit Citizeness Truth Threatened by the new revolutionary government she offered her wealth to the First French Republic before it could be confiscated

In April 1793 her nephew the young Duke of Chartres fled France and sought asylum with the Austrians In retribution the National Convention decreed the imprisonment of all Bourbons remaining in France While other members of the Orlans family still in France were kept under house arrest Bathilde Philippe galit and his sons were imprisoned in the Fort Saint Jean in Marseille Badly rewarded for her fidelity to the democratic ideals of the Revolution she survived a year and a half in a prison cell In November of the same year her brother was guillotined Miraculously spared during the Reign of Terror Bathilde was freed during the Thermidorian Reaction and returned to her lyse residence in Paris Poverty stricken she was forced to rent out most of the palace

In 1797 the Directoire decided to exile the last of the Bourbons still living in France With her sister in law Louise Marie Adlade de Bourbon she went to Spain with her illegitimate daughter Despite being forty seven years old at the time during the months which this journey took she had an amorous intrigue with a handsome twenty seven year old police officer under whose responsibility she had been put The two maintained a correspondence during her exile

Relegated to a place near Barcelona Bathilde founded despite her small means a pharmacy and dispensary for the poor and her house became a gathering place for those who needed aid She became completely republican during this time period despite her exile

In 1804 she learned that Napolon I whom she admired had had her only son Louis Antoine Duke of Enghien kidnapped and executed by firing squad in the moat of the Chteau de Vincennes For ten years the emperor kept the mother of his most famous victim from setting foot in France Bathilde got her revenge in 1814 when the people seeing in her the mother of the Martyr of Vincennes cheered her as she travelled the route back to Paris

In 1815 at the start of the Bourbon Restoration she returned to France Louis XVIII traded with her the Htel Matignon for the lyse Palace Bathilde promptly installed a community of nuns on the premises and charged them with praying for the souls of the victims of the Revolution Her family in the new moral order of the day wanted to see her rejoin her husband after a separation of thirty five years but she refused Instead she resumed her affair with the police officer who had escorted her to Spain in 1797 

In 1822 while she was taking part in a march towards the Panthon she lost consciousness and drew her last breath in the home of a law professor who taught at the Sorbonne After her death her nephew Louis Philippe wanting to give an air of respectability to her bohemian lifestyle burned the manuscript of her memoirs and a file on her young police officer located in the war archives 

She was buried in the Orlans family chapel the Collgiale de Dreux

A geological basin is a large low lying area It is often below sea level

Geological basins are one of the two most common places inland which collect sediment the other being lakes The type of rocks which form there tell about the palaeoclimate of the continent The geology is of interest to both oil companies and palaeontologists

Starting around 16 million years ago in the Miocene and continuing into the present a large part of the North American Plate has been stretched by being pulled apartp611 The result has been the creation of a large and still growing region of relatively thin crust the region grew an average of convert1incm per year initially and then slowed to convert03incm per year in the last 5 million years Geologists call this region the Basin and Range Province

Pulling forces causes rock at depth to stretch like silly putty and rock closer to the surface to break along normal faults into downfallen basins called grabens

Because the basin is low lying it collects sediment Rivers may run down into the basin from surrounding mountains Floods or lakes may form with no outlet to the sea Evaporation occurs more sediment arrives and so on The strata which forms gives clues as to the palaeoclimate

Other terms that are used to describe a basin are drainage basin catchment catchment area catchment basin drainage area river basin water basin and watershed

Many basins drain through slow moving tropical rivers into the sea These rivers meander through a web of islands at the river delta and bring along a huge amount of sediment in the form of mud clay and sand into the sea The Amazon and the Mississippi river systems are like this The strata which form are quite different from inland basin lakes

Auger electron spectroscopy is a way of telling what chemical elements are at the surface of an object

When an electron is removed from a core level of an atom a higher energy level electron may fall in the vacancy If the energy released by the fall is transferred to another electron the latter will be emitted from the atom in what is called the Auger effect after the French physicist who discovered the phenomenon Pierre Auger The kinetic energy levels of the Auger electrons depend on the type of the atoms from which the electrons were ejected and the chemical environment of the atoms AES consists of bombarding a sample with energetic electrons and measuring the energy of the Auger electrons obtaining a spectra that can be used to get information about the identity and environment of the emitting atoms

Lee Joseph Fogolin is a retired defenceman who played in the National Hockey League He played for the Buffalo Sabres and the Edmonton Oilers playing in 924 NHL regular season games between 1974 and 1987 winning the Stanley Cup in 1984 and 1985 

Fogolin was born in Chicago while his father Lee Fogolin Sr was a member of the Chicago Blackhawks His son Michael Fogolin played for the Prince George Cougars in the WHL and died in his sleep on May 26 2004 of a possible heart condition

Marie Thrse of Austria was the daughter of Philip IV King of Spain and Elisabeth of France She was Queen of France as wife of King Louis XIV and mother of Le Grand Dauphin During her lifetime in Spain she was painted by the renowned painter Diego Velzquez Married to Louis XIV in 1660 following the Franco Spanish War she played little part in politics during her lifetime The Bourbon Claim to the Spanish Throne which sparked of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1700 stems from her 

Born Mara Teresa she was the only surviving daughter of Philip IV King of Spain and Elisabeth of France By birth she was she was an Infanta of Spain Portugal and Archduchess of Austria and member of the Spanish branch of the House of Habsburg 

Mara Teresa Infanta of Spain and Archduchess of Austria married Louis XIV of France by proxy on 3 June 1660 at Fuenterrabia Her father Philip IV and the entire Spanish court accompanied the Mara Teresa to the Isle of Pheasants in Bidassoa where Louis XIV and his court met her On 7 June 1660 she departed from her native country of Spain On 9 June she married Louis XIV in a religious ceremony at Saint Jean de Luz in the Saint Jean Baptiste church which had recently been rebuilt for the occasion Known as Marie Thrse dAutriche she had a six children with Louis XIV but he would never love her Marie Thrse lived a quiet life with her Spanish attendants and had to put up with her husbands various affairs notably with Louise de La Vallire and Madame de Monstespan

Louis of France was the eldest son of Louis Dauphin of France known as le Grand Dauphin and as such was known as le Petit Dauphin He became Dauphin of France upon his fathers death in 1711

Louis de France was born in the Palace of Versailles the eldest son of Louis le Grand Dauphin and his wife Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria At birth he received the title of Duke of Burgundy

Louis grew up with his younger brothers Philippe Duke of Anjou and Charles Duke of Berry 

At the age of 15 he married his second cousin Marie Adlade of Savoy the daughter of Victor Amadeus II Duke of Savoy and Anne Marie dOrlans This match had been decided as part of the Treaty of Turin which ended Franco Savoyard conflicts during the Nine Years War The marriage took place on 7 December 1697 at the Palace of Versailles The two were in love with one another a rarity at the court of Versailles

Louis became Dauphin of France upon the death of his father in 1711 

In February 1712 his wife contracted measles and died on the 12th of that month 

The Duke of Burgundy who dearly loved his wife and who had stayed by her side throughout the fatal illness contracted the disease and died on 18 February six days after her at the Chteau de Marly Both of his sons also became infected the eldest Louis Duke of Brittany the latest in a series of Dauphins succumbed to it on 8 March The only one to survive was the two year old Duke of Anjou the future King Louis XV of France

The Dauphin was the heir apparent to the throne of France from 13501791 and from 18241830 

Guy VIII Count of Vienne had a dolphin on his coat of arms and had been nicknamed le Dauphin The title of Dauphin of Viennois descended in his family until 1349 when Humbert II sold his signeurie called the Dauphin to King Philippe VI on condition that the heir of France assumed the title of le Dauphin The wife of the Dauphin was known as the Dauphine The first French Dauphin was Charles V The title is roughly equivalent to the English title Prince of Wales

The title of Dauphin of Auvergne was used by the Count of Clermont 

The Plague mask was created and used when the plague came to London to stop docters catching the plague It was a crude gas mask in the shape of a birds beak A common idea at the time was that the plague was spread by bad air There could have been a belief that by dressing in a bird mask the docter could move the plague away from the patient and onto the clothes the plague doctor wore The mask also had red glass eyes which were thought to make it so the wearer could not be harmed by evil The beak of the mask was often filled with herbs and spices to make the bad air smell better Even though the mask did not work like it should have it may have made the smell of unburied bodys and plague victims smell better

Bust A Move 2 is the first sequel to Bust A Move and is also known as Puzzle Bobble 2 outside Europe and North America Released into the arcades in 1995 PlayStation Sega Saturn Nintendo 64 and PC conversions followed The game was included in Taito Legends 2 but the US arcade version was included on US PS2 version instead The game is a spin off from Bubble Bobble

The game builds on the original by adding a tournament style variation on the two player game for play against the computer and by adding a branching map to the one player game allowing the player to periodically select one of two groups of five levels to play next leading to different game endings Some of the contestants in the new tournament mode are based on characters from Bubble Bobble including variations on a Monsta and a Mighta

Some versions of the game including the PlayStation feature time trial competitions in which a single player attempts to finish simple rounds quickly enough to beat previous time records or two players simultaneously attempt to beat the records and each other

Completion of the single player game gives the player a code which can be entered to unlock Another World for the single player game which features subtle changes to the existing levels to increase their difficulty and changes to all backdrops to resemble levels from Bubble Bobble The various enemies from Bubble Bobble also make an appearance in the background of the credits sequence

Taito later repacked Bust A Move 2 with an optional alternative set of levels and some new attract mode animations as Bust A Move 2X

Ports of Bust A Move 2 to the PC and Sega Saturn are of Bust A Move 2X and additionally include a level editordesigner A port of 2X was made to the PlayStation but was not released until some time after a port of Bust A Move 2 was released therefore it is not so well known

This game has become notorious for one version of its cover art The original US version of the Saturn edition featured a picture of several large balls with screaming blue human faces with white sticks forcing their eyes open This cover earned it a place on Gamespycoms Top Ten Worst Covers list

W and Z bosons are some of the least understood elementary particles Both are bosons which means that they have a spin of 0 or 1 Both had been found in experiments by the year 1983 Because of this Z bosons are theoretical Together they are responsible for a force known as weak force Weak force was called weak because it is was not predicted to be very strong compared to other forces like electromagnetism There are two W bosons with different charges the normal W and its antiparticle the W Z bosons are their own antiparticle

W bosons are named after the weak force that they are responsible for The naming of the Z boson is still uncertain although it is believed to have been the last particle on a list that a lab that named it was looking for Weak force is what physicists believe is responsible for the breaking down of some radioactive elements in the form of Beta decay In the late 70s scientists managed to combine weak force and electromagnetism and called it the electroweak force

W and Z bosons are only known to be created under Beta decay which is a form of radioactive decay

Beta decay occurs when there are a lot of neutrons in an atom An easy way to think of a neutron is that it is made of one proton and one electron When there are too many neutrons in one atom nucleus one neutron will split and form a proton and an electron The proton will stay where it is and the electron will be launched out of the atom at incredible speed This is why Beta radiation is harmful to humans

The above model is not entirely accurate as both protons and neutrons are each made of three quarks A proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark This is why a proton has a charge of 1 A neutron is made of one up quark and two down quarks which is why its charge is 0 Up quarks and down quarks are two of the six types of quarks These six types are known in the scientific world as flavours

Weak force is believed to be able to change the flavour of a quark For example when it changes a down quark in a neutron into to an up quark the charge of the neutron becomes 1 since it would have the same arrangement of quarks as a proton The three quark neutron with a charge of 1 is no longer a neutron after this as it fulfills all of the requirements to be a proton Therefore Beta decay will cause a neutron to become a proton 

When a quark changes flavour as it does in Beta decay it releases a W boson W bosons only last for 3x10 25 seconds which is why we had not discovered them until less than half a century ago Surprisingly W bosons have a mass of about 80 times that of a proton Keep in mind that the neutron that it came from also only weighs one atomic mass unit In the quantum world it is not an extremely uncommon occurrence for a more massive particle to come from a less massive particle because it lasts less time than Plancks constant After the 3x10 25 seconds has passed a W boson decays into one electron and one neutrino Since neutrinos rarely interact with matter we can ignore them from now on The electron is propelled out of the atom at a high speed The proton that was produced by the Beta decay stays in the atom nucleus and raises the atomic number by one 

Z bosons are also predicted in the Standard Model of physics which successfully predicted the existence of W bosons Z Bosons decay into a fermion and its antiparticle which are particles such as electrons and quarks which have spin in units of half of the reduced planks constant

J mesons are subatomic particles made of one charm quark and one charm antiquark Mesons are a family of composite particles which are made of one quark and one antiquark The discovery of J mesons was huge because it revealed the existence of the fourth known quark of the time the charm quark J mesons were used in an attempt to learn more about quark gluon plasmas but no conclusive results were found The name J comes from the chosen names from the two labs that found them one of which chose the letter J while the other chose the greek letter 

Toxic shock syndrome is a non common deadly infection where bacteria causes an infection

Often toxic shock syndrome comes from toxins made by staph bacteria but the infection may also be caused by toxins made by strep bacteria

While the infection often occurs in women it can also affect men and children

Symptoms of toxic shock syndrome can show up suddenly and the disease can be deadly You can take steps to reduce your risk of toxic shock syndrome

The symptoms of toxic shock syndrome may include

A sudden high fever 

Low blood pressure

Vomiting or diarrhea 

A rash that looks like a sunburn particularly on your palms and soles which after a week or so generally leads to peeling of the skin on your hands and feet 

Confusion 

Muscle aches 

Redness of your eyes mouth and throat 

Seizures 

Headaches

Toxic shock syndrome can recur People whove had it once can get it again

Setsubun means division of the seasons in the literal sense In ancient times the beginning of each season was called Setsubun On the Setsubun day various rituals were conducted to drive away devils sprits Nowadays however Setsubun only refers to Risshun because the day is the most important than the other Setsubun day since the day is a new years day in lunar calendarIt is said that both of beans and rice have spiritual power in it and to throw these things is a good way to drive demons from our own and our housePeople used to throw rice in ancient time but people started to throw beans instead of rice since Chinese folkway was introduced Since then people throw beans to drive demons on Setsubun day As we said above people usually eat an Ehomaki which is a kind of makizushi on Setsubun Makizushi means call over happiness We usually eat it without cutting because if we cut it it implies break up People usually put 7 kinds of ingredients in it after the Seven Gods of Fortune We eat it without saying anything Generally its because it would be rudeness for the Seven Gods of Fortune if we are talking while we eat it but anyone doesnt know the fact

Setsubun means separating seasons and indicated each day before the first day of spring summer autumn and winter However the event Setsubun is very famous so it became the word to indicate the day before the first day of spring only Setsubun was a ceremony to drive of ancient China and gods who brought misfortune Originally it was the folk event to hope talisman and good crop of private sector This ceremony came down to Japan in the Nara era In the Hiean era Tsuina that the event of New Years Eve held in the palace changed into the ceremony to drive demons It died out in the Muromachi era but the event gradually spread among commoner and remained as Mamemaki of Setsubun In the evening of Setsubun people set up branches of holly with sardine at the entrance of house and scatter parched beans However nowadays households which adorn with them decreased and only scatter parched beans In the meantime Ehomaki started as a custom to pray for te prosperous business at the harbor of Osaka in the end of Edo era The custom died out temporarily but Osaka Nori Kyodo Kumiai revived it in the event of Dotonbori in the late 1970s Therefore it was famous in the Kansai district Also it began to sell in the part of supermarkets and convenience stores in 1990s In addition it became rapidly popular among the whole country because Ehomaki was advertised considerably in stores

There are a lot of events related to Setsubun in big shrines For example Narita san  Shinsho ji in Chiba holds on big events every year Some believers of Toshi otoko or big names are invited to the event and they perform mame maki ceremony to gather people Because of the bad economy in Japan these events are crowed with a lot of people who try to call in happiness

The Komodo National Park is a national park in Indonesia It is on several islands in the Lesser Sunda Islands The park is in the area between the East Nusa Tenggara and West Nusa Tenggara provinces The park includes three larger islands Komodo Padar and Rincah It also includes 26 smaller ones for a total area of 1733 km The national park was founded in 1980 to protect the Komodo dragon This animal is the worlds largest lizard Later it began protecting other species including some in the ocean In 1991 the national park was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site

The park is spread over several islands It includes part of western coast of Flores the three larger islands of Komodo Padar Rincah and 26 smaller islands It also includes ocean areas such as the Sape Straights The islands of the national park are volcanic The land is generally rugged with some rounded hills to 735m The climate is one of the driest of Indonesia Each year between 800mm and 1000mm of rain falls in the park area Temperatures in the dry season from May to October are around 40C

The Park is hot and dry There are many savannah plants that make it a good place for the Komodo dragon

Cloud forests are in only a few areas above 500 metres These forests are good places for some local plants There are mangrove forests in some of the quiet bays of the three larger islands 

Large and complex coral reefs are along the north east coast of Komodo The park has many animals that live in the ocean including whale sharks ocean sunfish manta rays eagle rays pygmy seahorse false pipefish clown frogfish nudibranchs blue ringed octopus sponges tunicates and coral

The island of Padar and part of Rinca were made nature reserves in 1938 Komodo Island became a nature reserve in 1965 UNESCO also began to protect the island in 1977 The three islands were named a national park in 1980 The park was extended to include the nearby parts of the ocean and a part of Flores in 1984 In 1991 the national park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site Since 1995 the national park authority has been supported by an American environmental organization called The Nature Conservancy 

Komodo National Park has been selected as one of 28 finalists to become one of the New7Wonders of Nature

About 4000 people live within the park Scuba diving is popular because of the many different kinds of life living in the water Ecotourism in the ocean is the main way to get money to support the park

However several fishermen died since the 1980s People disagree about what happened to them Park patrol and military said they needed to protect themselves Fishermen living in the area say the park management killed the fishermen on purpose

The adjoining prefectures Nagano Shizuoka and Gunma have similar noodle dishes with soy sauce They are called Okkirikomi Niboutou etc More recently such Hoto culture has been promoted to encourage profit from tourism

There are many different stories about the history of Hoto In the old days in Yamanashi rice fields were replaced by mulberry fields to grow silkworms Then cultivation of wheat become popular and dishes which use flour developed In all of the dishes Hoto was economical because it used many vegetables and stock Also its taste was good Therefore Hoto spread throughout Yamanashi

First knead flour with a little water in a bowl Then spread the dough with a stick Fold the dough and cut widely You do not need to let it sit or add salt Nowadays you can buy Hoto noodles around Yamanashi prefecture The soup tastes like soybean paste Adding pumpkin paste into the soup is popular The stock is made from dried small sardines The main ingredient is vegetables In summer leeks onions potatoes and so on are used In winter pumpkins taro carrots napa cabbage and so on are used Sometimes pork or chicken are used

Pions are a type of meson which are subatomic particles made of a combination of quarks and antiquarks Since antiquarks are antimatter they will annihilate the same type of quark if they come near it However this reaction is not instantaneous and so Pions like all mesons can exist for a short amount of time What makes pions different from other mesons is that they are made of one up quark and one down quark either of which can be the antiparticle Pions are significant in science because they are thought to be responsible for the strong force interactions that occur between nucleons

There are three types of Pions  and 0 The  or 0 in above the simply refers to the charge of the pion are made of one up quark and one down antiquark  are made of one down quark and one up antiquark Since antiparticles have the opposite charge a is positive because an up quark has a charge of 23 and a down antiquark has a spin of 13 The reverse statement applies for 0 can be formed with one up quark and an up antiquark or one down quark and one down antiquark

Force carriers are particles that are responsible for forces such as electromagnetism As photons are believed to be responsible for electromagnetic force mesons are believed to be responsible for some of the lower energy strong force interactions that occur between nucleons At an even smaller level gluons are believed to be responsible for the strong force interactions between quarks However because they are made of the lightest quarks pions are the lightest mesons This means that they are also some of the longest living mesons However like all mesons they will eventually decay or break down

Pion decay will always produce leptons like electrons will usually decay into one muon and one muon neutrino  will usually decay into one antimuon and one muon antineutrino Neutral pions0will usually decay into two highly energized photons 

However there is some probability involved with the decay of some pions as they can also decay into different forms For the second most likely decay product is one positron and one electron neutrino will sometimes decay into one electron and one electron antineutrino 0 will sometimes decay into one highly energized photon one electron and one positron

Since the decay of pions is due to weak force yet another force carrier is introduced During the decay a W boson is created which lasts for 3x10 25 seconds After this incredibly short amount of time the W boson will decay into the leptons that the pion would naturally decay to However it is important to draw this distinction as it includes weak force

Labyrinthodont is a term which was used for fossil amphibia Although it is no longer a formal term in taxonomy it is still useful as a catch all term 

The Labyrinthodontia is not a clade because it is not monophyletic It has been replaced in the classification by more correct terms

The labyrithodonts were some of the dominant animals from the Devonian to the Lower Triassic The group is an evolutionary grade of species which look rather similar 

The name describes the pattern of infolding of the dentine and enamel of the teeth which often fossilise They are also have a heavily armoured skull roof and complex vertebrae

The labyrinthodonts flourished for more than 200 million years There are a few anatomical traits that make their fossils distinct and easy to recognise

ImageFishapodsjpgthumb300pxIn Late Devonian vertebrate speciation descendants of pelagic lobe finned fish like Eusthenopteron exhibited a sequence of adaptations Panderichthys suited to muddy shallows Tiktaalik with limb like fins that could take it onto land Early tetrapods in weed filled swamps such as

Descendants also included pelagic lobe finned fish such as coelacanth species

Early tetropods are now classified as lobe finned fish This is because we now know they were aquatic when the limbs first evolved 

The informal term fishapods is often used for this group of Devonian animals 

A more formal term used by Clack is stem group tetrapods

Puntland is a province of Somalia Its capital is Garowe but the economy is centered around Boosasso The province covers about a third of Somalia and about a third of the population of Somalia lives in the province Puntland is next to Somaliland which wanted to become an independent state Puntlant also wants some degree of autonomy but the people of Puntland want to stay within Somalia and find a solution for the whole country

Daddy G is an English musician and a founding member of the band Massive Attack

Marshall joined the Bristol music scene as a member of the DJ group The Wild Bunch in the 1980s which included two other Massive Attack members Robert Del Naja and Andrew Vowles In 1986 The Wild Bunch dissolved Del Naja Vowles and Marshall then formed the trip hop group Massive Attack which is considered to have pioneered the Bristol Sound along with Portishead and Tricky

In addition to appearing on Massive Attacks albums Marshall has also mixed a CD for the DJ Kicks mix series

Tau leptons are one of the very small elementary particles This means that they are believed to be so small that they can not be divided any more Tau leptons can be thought of as very heavy electrons as they are both leptons This is because they have about 3500 times as much mass as electrons and about 17 times as much mass as muons Since they only live for 29x1013 seconds they do not have a significant role in the regular world However they are very important in the decay of subatomic matter

Like the other two basic leptons tauons have a neutrino named after them

Tau have a charge of 1 and can be written as Since antimatter has the opposite of charge of regular matter anti tauons have a charge of 1 and can be written as Tauons themselves are unstable and can decay Also and can annihilate each other in a form of decay When a single tauon decays it is the only lepton that can decay into hadrons and can be formed by an electron positron pair combining The two tauons then decay into an electron or a positron a muon or an antimuon and four of the various neutrinos However a single tauon decays differently than a tauon and an antitauon

A will quickly decay into a tau neutrino and a W boson The W boson will exist for 3x1025 seconds before it decays into an electron or an electron antineutrino a muon or a muon antineutrino and a down quark or an up antiquark

Thallium bromide also known as thallous bromide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is TlBr It has thallium and bromide ions in it The thallium is in its 1 oxidation state

Thallium bromide is a yellow white solid It is similar to silver bromide It gets darker when light shines on it It is very toxic like all thallium compounds It does not dissolve in water

Thallium bromide is made by reacting thallium and bromine or by reacting sodium or potassium bromide with any thallium compound

It is used in semiconductors and gamma ray and X ray detectors 

Thallium hydroxide also known as thallic hydroxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Tl3 It has thallium and hydroxide ions in it The thallium is in its 3 oxidation state

Thallium hydroxide is a weak base It is a white solid It is highly toxic It is also an oxidizing agent It breaks down to thallium oxide when heated If it is heated more it breaks down to oxygen and thallium oxide

Julian Assange is the spokesman and editor in chief of WikiLeaks which is a website that posts news leaks He started the website in 2006 He was born in Australia but has lived in several different countries He also made a program called Rubberhose to hide secret information in a specific way that protects against torture

Assange was the Readers Choice for Time Person of the Year in 2010 after getting the most Internet votes However Mark Zuckerberg who started Facebook won the actual award

Kaons are a specific type of meson What makes kaons unique is that they are made of one up quark or down quark and one strange quark The discovery of kaons was significant because it proved the existence of yet another flavour of quark the strange quark

There are four types of kaons but two of them are relatively easy to understand There is the K and the K0 The and 0 above the letter K refer to whether the charge is positive or 0 The K is made of one up quark and one strange antiquark Since antiparticles have the opposite charge of their counterpart 23 13 a 1 charge or simply a charge Since down quarks and strange quarks have the same charge if either one of them is an antiparticle the overall charge is zero Therefore a K0 can either be made of one down quark and strange antiquark or one down antiquark and one normal strange quark

Thallium oxide also known as thallic oxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Tl2O3 It has thallium and oxide ions in it The thallium is in its 3 oxidation state

Thallium oxide is a white powder It is very heavy and very toxic It is a semiconductor It reacts with acids to make other toxic thallium compounds It does not dissolve in water 

It is made by oxidation of thallium oxide

It may be used in solar cells

Thallium chloride also known as thallous chloride is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is TlCl It has thallium and chloride ions in it The thallium is in its 1 oxidation state

Thallium chloride is a colorless odorless solid It is very toxic It is insoluble in cold water but dissolves a little in hot water Otherwise it is somewhat similar to potassium chloride in being colorless and silver chloride in being insoluble in water 

Thallium chloride is made by reacting any soluble chloride such as hydrochloric acid with thallium sulfate This makes a thallium chloride solid It can also be made by reacting thallium metal with hydrochloric acid

It is the result of a certain way to make hexafluorophosphates from chlorides

Fredric Wertham was a Jewish German American psychiatrist He was an author who wrote about images in media He thought that violent imagery in mass media and comic books was harmful to children His best known book was Seduction of the Innocent After this book became popular the United States Congress took a close look at the comic book industry Also the Comics Code was made in response He called television a school for violence 

He was born on 20 March 20 1895 in Munich He studied medicine in Germany and England He and Sigmund Freud wrote letters to each other and Wertham chose to study mainly psychiatry In 1922 he was asked to come to the United States and to join the Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore Maryland He became a United States citizen in 1927 He moved to New York City in 1932 He became the director of a psychiatric clinic connected with the New York Court of General Sessions All people who were convicted of serious crimes had a psychiatric examination there The report from those examinations were used in court In 1935 Wertham spoke in court for the defense in the trial of Albert Fish a serial killer Wertham said Fish was insane

In Seduction of the Innocent Wertham wrote about clear or hidden violence sex drug use and other adult topics in crime comics Wertham used the words crime comics to mean popular comics about criminals and murder that were popular at that time But he also included superhero and horror comics in the same group of comics He said that reading violent comics made children violent However this idea was from stories he had heard not careful research

Comics especially the crime and horror titles started by EC Comics had many shocking or ugly images Wertham often reproduced such images He pointed out themes about death such as injury to the eye that he thought were common One example Jack Coles Murder Morphine and Me in Magazine Villages True Crime Comics Vol 1 2 The story showed a character named Mary Kennedy who was a drug dealer In her dream she was almost stabbed in the eye with a needle by a drug addict Many of his other ideas seemed like nonsense to the comics industry Wertham thought he saw hidden sexual themes in comics such as nude women hidden in drawings of muscles and tree bark He also thought Batman and Robin were gay partners Werthams idea that Wonder Woman had a hidden story of bondage did have some facts to support it Her creator William Moulton Marston had said the same thing However Wertham also claimed that Wonder Womans strength and independence made her a lesbian

Werthams views on mass media have largely overshadowed his broader concerns with violence and with protecting children from psychological harm His writings about the effects of racial segregation were evidence in the important Supreme Court case Brown v Board of Education Part of his 1966 book A Sign for Cain was about medical professionals and their actions in the Holocaust He talked about the book on a popular TV program Parts of these programs were shown at the 2003 Comic Con International San Diego

Beaty writes that in 1959 Wertham tried to sell a another book to follow Seduction of the Innocent It was called The War on Children The book was about the effect of television on children Wertham was unhappy that no companies wanted to publish it

Wertham always said he did not want censorship of comics In the 1970s he was more interested in the good side of comics fan groups In his last book The World of Fanzines he concluded that fanzines were a good way to be creative Wertham was asked to speak to the New York Comic Art Convention Most comics fans still had bad opinions about him They did not trust him and yelled at him during his speech He soon stopped writing about comics 

Before he retired Wertham had several jobs He became a professor of psychiatry at New York University He was a senior psychiatrist in the New York City Department of Hospitals and a psychiatrist and the director of the Mental Hygiene Clinic at the Bellevue Hospital Center

He died on November 18 1981 at his retirement home in Kempton Pennsylvania He was 86 years old

The Library of Congress keeps his papers People were able to study them starting May 20 2010 The library has a list of all of his writing This list shows Werthams many different interests

Edward Drinker Cope was an American biologist who was notable for his work on fossil animals of North America

He was a paleontologist comparative anatomist herpetologist and ichthyologist who wrote many papers His parents were wealthy Quakers 

His father wanted him to be a farmer but he became a scientist He married his cousin Later they owned a museum in Philadelphia

Mostly he read books on his own to learn science and found things out himself He was not a teacher He did field work and wrote a lot In the 1870s and 1880s he used to go the American West to report what the land was like to the government often on a team sent by the United States Geological Survey The USGS shows where natural resources are such as coal wood and water 

For a while he and Othniel Charles Marsh were competing to find dinosaurs This feud between them is called the Bone Wars Sometimes being a scientist cost him more money than he could afford In the 1880s Cope lost so much money in the mining business he had to sell a lot of his fossil collection In the 1890s he was no longer poor but he died when he was only 57 

1400 of his articles were published in science journals He discovered over 1000 species of extinct animals He wrote about hundreds of kinds of ancient fish He discovered dozens of dinosaurs He wrote about the evolution of mammalian molars teeth and produced two huge works on the amphibia and reptiles of North America 

Cope showed that horses evolved to be larger as they moved from woodland onto grassland That the fossils show the mammals getting bigger over time is called Copes rule

Cope was the first son of Alfred and Hanna Cope His father was a serious Quaker and ran the shipping business started by his father Thomas P Cope The business was started in 1821 His parents took him to gardens museums and zoos They taught him to read and write and draw 

He started going to school when he was 9 years old When he was 12 his parents sent him away to a Quaker boarding school At 15 years old he studied biology and often visited the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia They had a Natural history museum 

His letters home show he felt farm work was not for himp15 Copes father made him get a summer job on a farm when he was 14 and 15 When he was 16 he was not sent to the boarding school any more because his father wanted him to be a farmerp100 His father wanted him to get more exercise so he bought him a farm Cope rented out the land to farmers and worked on farms 

When he was 18 years old he began working at the Academy of Natural Sciences part time He took classes His father paid for them Still his father said he should farm Until he was 23 his letters to his father kept saying he did not want to be a farmer and that he wanted to be a scientistp100 

He worked at the Academy of Natural Sciences for two years and became a memberp21 He sometimes had to visit the Smithsonian Institution where he met Spencer Baird who knew all about fish and birdsp107 He also joined the American Philosophical Society The Academy and the Society published journals and they accepted his articles 

In 1861 when he was 21 years old he wrote about classifying salamanders A salamander is an amphibian He then took a comparative anatomy class from a famous teacher at the University of Pennsylvania Cope then asked his father if he could learn German and French so he could read science books and novels in German and Frenchp101

At the beginning of the American Civil War Cope tried to get a job helping in a field hospital Then when he was 22 he wanted to somehow help out the freed blacks That year 1863 he and his fiance broke up and he was sad He went to Ireland England and Europe During his trip he met famous scientistsp26 30 

While in Germany he first met his rival scientist Othniel Charles Marshp11 On February 11 1864 he wrote to his father I shall get home in time to  be caught by the new draft I shall not be sorry for this  certain persons  would be mean enough to say that I have gone to Europe to avoid the warp138

Copes return home to Philadelphia was before the end of the Civil War He married a Quaker girl he knew Annie Pim She lived on a farm and the wedding was held at her house 

Cope wrote papers on fish whales and one on a fossil frog with a tail Copes father gave money to a small Quaker college called Haverford College The college gave Cope an honorary masters degree and hired him to teach Zoologyp48 

Cope went on scientific trips to the American west and wrote letters to his parents and to his wife and daughter while on those trips He told his father that teaching took up too much of his time for him to make scientific discoveriesp1436 He quit his job at the college He and his wife and daughter then moved to Haddonfield to be closer to the fossil beds in western New Jersey 

In Haddonfield New Jersey were marlpits where a dinosaur skeleton was discovered in 1858 by William Foulke and named Hadrosaurus foulkii by Dr Leidy of Philadelphias Academy of Natural Sciencesp1518 Cope found more fossils in the marlpits there For example he described Elasmosaurus platyurus and Laelaps in 1868 Edward Cope also went on expeditions to caves the last cave he visited was the Wyandotte Caves in Indiana in 1871p1515 

In his 30s the Quaker wrote a lot of scientific papers that were published Charles Sternberg said that in the fossil fields of Kansas Cope had a severe attack of nightmare  every animal of which we had found trace during the day played with him at night  sometimes he would lose half the night in this exhausting slumberp167 

Cope also looked for fossils in the west of the United States In 1872 he explored Eocene rocks The rocks were 55 to 38 million years old That year he worked too much and had a breakdownp583 In 1873 he studied the Titanothere beds of northeastern Colorado Titanothere was a large extinct herbivorep183194 

In 1874 Cope volunteered for the Wheeler Survey These geological mapping trips were led by George Montague Wheeler They mapped parts of the United States west of the 100th meridianp200 The 100th meridian west is the boundary between the dry West and the rainy East of the United States 

In 1874 Cope discovered the Puerco formation in New Mexico during the Wheeler Surveyp200 The Puerco formation was a layer of soft rock 500 feet thick along the upper Puerco River near Cuba New Mexico It was green and black marl Fossils were later found by someone at a similar formation west of there in a different county Cope said it was like those fossils came from his Puerco formation which he discovered His cliff may have been dug by the river over a long time and it looked like it had been there a long time It was something the scientists he knew had not seen before him As part of the Wheeler Survey he was able to shop at commissaries He was able to get his finding in the reports the survey published He brought his wife and daughter along on one trip of the survey renting a house for them As a volunteer he paid his own wayp63

When Cope was 35 his father died leaving him a quarter of a million dollars The next year 1876 Cope moved his wife and daughter from their house by the apple orchard in Haddonfield New Jersey back to Philadelphia Pennsylvania this time to a row house in the City He bought two units and used the one next door as a paleo lab for his fossil collection He stopped doing field work to catch up on his writing He hired teams to look for fossils for him And he helped the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition set up their fossil displaysp218 In 1877 he was able to buy half of the American Naturalist

He published papers so fast his rival Professor Marsh had doubts about when Copes fossils were found In August 1878 when he was 38 Cope sailed to the British Isles to attend a scientific convention in Dublin Ireland He then sailed to France to go to a two day scientific convention there At one of the conventions he decided to buy some boxes of Argentine fossils maybe for the museum in Philadelphia 

When Cope came back two years worth of collecting by his man Lucas awaited him This included a Camarasaurus a sauropodp42

Cope introduced his friend Marsh to the marl pit owner Albert Vorhees when the two visited the site Later he discovered that Marsh had gone  behind Copes back and made a private agreement with Vorhees any fossils that Vorheess men found were sent back to Marsh at New Haven

In 1868 Professor Marsh said Cope put the skull of dinosaur at the tail end It was Elasmosaurus a long necked plesiosaur It turned out Marsh was right and Cope was humiliated

The feud lasted for the rest of Copes life Both became less wealthy trying to keep the others men from digging for fossils Each criticized the others work in the New York Herald Another time Marsh tried to keep Cope from getting his articles and books published so Cope hired two fossil finders away from Marshp257 

In 1889 US Geological Survey stopped giving grants to Cope Marsh persuaded John Wesley Powell to ask Cope to give the Survey the specimens Cope found back in 1874p2337 249 Cope did not want to give the fossils to the Survey because when he found them he was a volunteer paying his own way So he spoke to the New York Heraldp2459 The first article was on January 12 1890 Cope said Marsh underpaid his workers and said some of what Marsh wrote was really written by others Also he said Powell was spending tax money wrong and had made mistakes in classifying fossilsp404 Later another article gave their side of the story As a result of the articles the Survey lost its funding for fossil finding Marsh got fired from the Survey And Cope almost got fired from the University of Pennsylvaniap329334 Cope wondered if people thought of him as a liar  actuated by jealousy and disappointment He seemed sorry Marsh had been fired writing to Paleontologist Henry Osborn I think Marsh is impaled on the horns of Monoclonius sphenocerusp408

In 1882 Cope wrote a paper about a fossil pelycosaur Edaphosaurus It looked like a lizard with a huge fin along its back In 1886 Professor Cope fired his fossil diggers and started selling some of his large fossil collection to museums He also wrote forty more scientific reports about their findings that yearp242 

In 1889 he reported Coelophysis a slender dinosaur from the Upper Triassic This little carnivore is one of the earliest dinosaurs found The same year he succeeded Joseph Leidy who had died the previous year as professor of zoology at the University of Pennsylvania

In 1892 Cope was granted expense money for field work from the Texas Geological Survey With his finances improved he was able to publish a massive work on the Batrachians of North America which was the most detailed work on the continents frogs and amphibians ever donep350 and the 1115 page The Crocodilians Lizards and Snakes of North America 

In the 1890s his publication rate increased to an average of 43 articles a yearp350 His final expedition to the West took place in 1894 when he prospected for dinosaurs in South Dakota and visited sights in Texas and Oklahoma

In 1895 Cope re hired Sternberg who knew about the nightmares he had about dinosaurs to look for fossils for himp358

Cope sold fossils to museums For example in 1895 the American Museum of Natural History in New York City bought his collection of about 10000 fossil mammals

Cope sold three other collections for 29000 Although his collection still contained more than 13000 specimens Copes fossil hoard was much smaller than Marshs collection which was valued at over a million dollars

In 1896 Cope got sick and he died on April 12 1897 His friends told of how they remembered him They then held the reading of his will The American Journal of Science had an obituary about Cope The Naturalist had a longer one And the National Academy of Sciences journal had one years later

Edward D Cope was a Quaker His biographer Henry Osborn wrote If Edward doubts about the Bible he did not them in his letters to his family but there can be little question that he shared the intellectual unrest of the period Cope was conservative about women working or voting He felt the husband should be able to take care of his wife and that married women would vote the same as their husbandsp176 

He was remembered as not liking the Negro accent and he believed that if a race was not white then it was inherently more ape likep26 169 176 

Although his daughter Julia burnt many of his private papers many of his friends have written about him Charles R Knight a former friend said that Copes language was so filthy that in Copes heyday no woman was safe within five miles of himp109 

People said Cope had great energy and activity and was always interesting kind and helpful Others said he had a temper and said he was a militant paleontologist Some say he was well liked by those who lived when he did 

Cope said Charles Darwins book The Voyage of the Beagle had too much geology in it 

Over his lifetime Copes views on evolution shifted His original view described in the paper On the Origin of Genera held that while Darwins natural selection may affect the preservation of superficial characteristics in organisms natural selection alone could not explain the formation of genera

Copes beliefs became one with an increased emphasis on continual and utilitarian evolution with less involvement of a Creator He became one of the founders of the Neo Lamarckism school of thought which holds that individuals can pass on traits acquired in its lifetime to offspring Although the view has been shown to be incorrect it was common among paleontologists in Copes timep68 In 1887 Cope published his own Origin of the Fittest essays in evolution detailing his views on the subject He was a strong believer in the law of use and disusethat an individual will slowly over time favor an anatomical part of its body so much that it will become stronger and larger as time progresses down the generations This theory fails because use and disuse does not affect the genetic code of the gametes something which became clear in the generations after his death

The National Science Foundation is a United States government agency that supports fundamental research and education in all the non medical fields of science and engineering Its medical counterpart is the National Institutes of Health With an annual budget of about US687 billion the NSF funds approximately 20 percent of all federally supported basic research conducted by the United States colleges and universities In some fields such as mathematics computer science economics and the social sciences the NSF is the major source of federal backing

The NSFs director deputy director and the 24 members of the National Science Board are appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate The director and deputy director are responsible for administration planning budgeting and day to day operations of the foundation while the NSB meets six times a year to establish its overall policies

Drosophila pseudoobscura is a species of fruit fly used extensively in lab studies of the genetics of natural populations

It was first used by Theodosius Dobzhansky and his colleagues They collected samples from populations in western North America and Mexico and grew them in population cages in the laboratory They were interested in natural selection genetic drift and other aspects of population genetics

In 1989 Diane Dodd gave laboratory populations of D pseudoobscura two different food types starch and maltose They rapidly evolved into two distinct groups after only eight generations with the different foods As the two groups both showed a strong preference for mating with their own type this was claimed as an example of allopatric speciation by reproductive isolation Dodds experiment has been repeated by others and works with other kinds of fruit flies and foods

In 2005 D pseudoobscura was the second Drosophila species to have its genome sequenced after Drosophila melanogaster

lisabeth Charlotte dOrlans was a niece of Louis XIV and wife of Leopold Duke of Lorraine She was later regent of Lorraine As a widow she was created Princess of Commercy Among her children was Francis I Holy Roman Emperor father of Marie Antoinette 

lisabeth Charlotte was born at the Chteau de Saint Cloud the daughter of Philippe Duke of Orlans and of his second wife Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate Her father was the only sibling of King Louis XIV of France

She was entitled to have the style of Her Royal Highness At birth she was given the honorary style Mademoiselle de Chartres After the marriage of her two older half sisters Marie Louise and Anne Marie born of the first marriage of their father to Henrietta of England she was known as Madame Royale according to her status as the highest ranking unmarried princess in France

There were plans for her to marry Joseph Clemens of Bavaria William III of England Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I Joseph was suggested by Pope Innocent XII himself as well as her widowed first cousin Louis Grand Dauphin Another was Louis Auguste de Bourbon Duke of Maine eldest son of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan

lisabeth Charlotte was finally married on 13 October 1698 at the Palace of Fontainebleau to Leopold Duke of Lorraine son of Charles V Duke of Lorraine and of the Archduchess Eleonora of Austria The marriage was the result of the Treaty of Ryswick one of its conditions being that the Duchy of Lorraine which had been for many years in the possession of France be restored to Leopold a son of Charles V Duke of Lorraine Thus lisabeth Charlotte was but an instrument to cement the peace treaty The House of Lorraine received a dowry of 900000 Livres 

To everyone surprise what had been expected to be an unhappy union turned out to be a marriage of love and happiness With the birth of her children lisabeth Charlotte showed great maternal instinct and a naturally caring character The marriage produced thirteen children of which five survived into adulthood Three of them died within a week in May 1711 due to a smallpox outbreak at the Chteau de Lunville the country seat of the Dukes of Lorraine

Her husband died in 1729 leaving his wife Regent of Lorraine for their son Francis Stephen of Lorraine After being educated in Vienna Francis Stephen returned to Lorraine in 1737 ending his mothers tenure as regent

lisabeth Charlotte tried to engage her youngest child Anne Charlotte to King Louis XV this project failed due to the intrigues of Duke of Bourbon lisabeth Charlotte then tried to arrange the marriage of Anne Charlotte to her first cousin Louis dOrlans Duke of Orlans who had been recently widowed Louis dOrlans refused 

Unable to prevent her son from giving up the duchy of Lorraine to Stanisaw Leszczyski when he married the Habsburg heiress Maria Theresa of Austria lisabeth Charlotte moved into the Chteau dHarou in nearby Commercy which was turned into a sovereign principality for her to enjoy during her dowager years 

lisabeth Charlotte died of a stroke on 23 December 1744 one week after her daughter in law and grandchild at the age of sixty eight She was the last of her siblings to die and had outlived ten of her thirteen children Nine months after her death her son Francis Stephen became Holy Roman Emperor

She was buried in the funerary chapel of the Dukes of Lorraine in the Saint Franois des Cordeliers church in Nancy

Victor Amadeus III was King of Sardinia from 1773 until his death Although he was politically conservative he carried out numerous administrative reforms until declaring war on revolutionary France in 1792

Born at the Royal Palace of Turin he was a son of Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia and his second wife Polyxena of Hesse Rotenburg He was styled as the Duke of Savoy from birth As a young prince he surrounded himself with intellectuals and stayed far from public life

He married Maria Antonia of Spain youngest daughter of Philip V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnese on 31 May 1750 at Oulx and later had twelve children He had a loving relationship with his wife who exerted little influence over her husband The marriage had been arranged by Maria Antonias half brother the ruling Ferdinand VI of Spain 

When Victor Amadeus came to the throne in 1773 he started working on bureaucratic and military aspects of the reign He was suspicious of anything innovative

At the outbreak of the French Revolution Victor Amadeus III allowed his two sons in law the Counts of Artois Provence and the Princesses Marie Adlade and Victoire to stay in his kingdom under his protection

He died at the Castle of Moncalieri having suffered an attack of apoplexy He died leaving an economically damaged kingdom and two key provinces Savoy and Nice devastated having suffered at the hands of French revolutionary forces He was buried at the Basilica of Superga in Turin

Louise Marie Adlade de Bourbon was the daughter of Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon Duke of Penthivre and of Maria Teresa dEste At the death of her brother Louis Alexandre de Bourbon prince de Lamballe she became the wealthiest heiress in France She married the future Philippe galit and was the mother of Frances last king Louis Philippe I King of the French 

Marie Adlade was born on 13 March 1753 at the Htel de Toulouse in Paris Styled Mademoiselle dIvoy initially and as a young girl until her marriage Mademoiselle de Penthivre The style of Mademoiselle de Penthivre had been previoulsy borne by her sister Marie Louise de Bourbon who died six months after Marie Adlades birth She was raised in a convent the Abbaye de Montmartre overlooking Paris 

At the death on 8 May 1768 of her brother and only sibling the Prince of Lamballe Marie Adlade became heiress to what was to become the largest fortune of France Her marriage to Louis Philippe Joseph dOrlans Duke of Chartres son of the Duke of Orlans had been envisaged earlier and while the Duke of Penthivre saw in it the opportunity for his daughter to marry into the family of the First Prince of the Blood the Orlans did not want a union with an illegitimate branch of the royal family However the Orlans mind changed when the Prince of Lamballes death left his sister sole heiress to the family fortune Although Marie Adlade was much in love with her Orlans cousin Louis XV warned Penthivre against such a marriage because of the reputation of the young Duke of Chartres as a womaniser

Her marriage to the Duke of Chartres took place at the Palace of Versailles on 5 April 1769 

During the first few months of their marriage the couple appeared devoted to each other but the duke went back to the life of libertinage he had led before his marriage It is during the summer of 1772 a few months after his wife had given birth to a stillborn daughter that began Philippes secret liaison with one of her ladies in waiting Madame de Genlis the niece of Madame de Montesson the morganatic wife of Philippes father Passionate at first the liaison cooled within a few months and by the spring of 1773 was reported to be dead After the romantic affair was over Flicit remained in the service of Marie Adlade at the Palais Royal a trusted friend to both Marie Adlade and Philippe They both appreciated her intelligence and in July 1779 she became the governess of the couples twin daughters born in 1777 

On 5 April 1791 Marie Adlade left her unfaithful husband and went to live with her father at the chteau de Bizy in Normandy In September 1792 having sided with the Revolution the Duke of Orlans was elected to the National Convention under the name of Philippe galit Siding with the radical group called The Mountain he was from the very beginning suspect in the eyes of the Girondists who wanted all the Bourbons to be banished from France The fate of the Orlans family was sealed when Marie Adlades eldest son the duc de Chartres Gnral galit in the Army of the North commanded by Charles Franois Dumouriez sought political asylum from the Austrians in March 1793 On 6 April all the members of the Orlans family still remaining in France were arrested

After their arrest in Paris Philippe galit and his son the comte de Beaujolais were imprisoned in the Abbey prison in Paris Later the two were transferred to the prison of Fort Saint Jean in Marseille where they were soon joined by the duc de Montpensier who had been arrested while serving as an officer in the Army of the Alps The day before his father and brothers were arrested in France the duc de Chartres rushed to Tournai near the French border where his sister Adlade and Mme de Genlis had been living since Philippe galit had made them emigrate in November 1792

Upon the execution of her husband Marie Adlade now known as Veuve galit was incarcerated at the Luxembourg Palace which had been transformed into a prison during the Revolution There she met the man who was to become the love of her life a former member of the National Convention named Jacques Marie Rouzet The two always remained together and lived in Paris until 1797 when a decree banished the remaining members of the House of Bourbon from France

Marie Adlade was exiled to Spain as was her sister in law Bathilde dOrlans Rouzet accompanied them to the Spanish border and managed to secretly join them in Barcelona where he became her chancellor 

Marie Adlade Rouzet and the Orlans exiled in Spain returned to France in 1814 at the time of the first Bourbon Restoration After legal battles which lasted until her death the bulk of her inheritance was eventually recovered She died in her castle at Ivry sur Seine having suffered from breast cancer She also was buried at the Chapelle royale de Dreux

Thallium sulfate also known as thallous sulfate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Tl2SO4 It has thallium and sulfate ions in it The thallium is in its 1 oxidation state

Thallium sulfate is colorless odorless and tasteless It is very toxic though It dissolves easily in water and is similar to potassium sulfate 

It is made by dissolving thallium ore or thallium metal in sulfuric acid

It was used in rat poison but since it is so similar to other chemicals it poisoned some people and was outlawed It was also used for some medicines before it was found that it was too toxic It stops plants from germinating It is the main source of thallium in the laboratory and is used to make thallium sulfide 

Thallium sulfate like all thallium compounds is very toxic This is because the size of the thallium ion is very similar to the size of the potassium ion After it goes into the cells it cannot be used like potassium is used and so kills the cell It also gets absorbed through the skin Eating more than 12 gram can kill It gets deposited in the kidney liver brain and similar places It has been blamed for the extinction of the Brown Fish Owl 

The thallium halides are very rare Some of them are unstable The thallium iodide does not form

Thallium fluoride also known as thallic fluoride is made of thallium in its 3 oxidation state and fluoride ions It is made by reacting thallium oxide with bromine trifluoride fluorine or sulfur tetrafluoride at a warm temperature

Thallium chloride also known as thallic chloride is made of thallium in its 3 oxidation state and chloride ions It disproportionates above 40C making thallium chloride and chlorine It is made by reacting thallium chloride with chlorine in an organic solution

Thallium bromide also known as thallic bromide is made of thallium in its 3 oxidation state and bromide ions It disproportionates at a low temperature to thallium bromide and bromine It can be made by reacting thallium bromide with bromine in water or an organic solution

Thallium halide can refer to either set of thallium halides

Up quarks are subatomic particles that help make up many larger particles like protons Up quarks have a charge of 23 and are the lightest of the six types of quarks Like all fermions Up quarks have a spin of 12 They are affected by all four of the fundamental forces which are gravity strong force weak force and electromagnetism Like all quarks Up quarks are elementary particles which means that they are so small that scientists believe that they can not be divided any more

Protons are made of two up quarks and one down quark Neutrons are made of one up quark and two down quarks Up quarks can also be used to create more complex particles such as pions

The Rape of the Lock is a poem written by Alexander Pope mocking heros and heroines It was first published anonymously in Lintots Miscellany in May 1712

The poem is sarcastically laughing at the epic world of the gods It was based on an incident that was remembered by Popes friend John Caryll Arabella Fermor and Robert Petre were both from Catholic families at a time in England when Anglicanism was very important Petre lusting after Arabella had cut a lock of her hair to keep without permission which made the two families have a big argument This was because in those days cutting off a lock of the lovers hair was scandalous and symbolized improper love Pope also a Catholic wrote the poem to make the two families reconcile and be happy again He made the character Belinda to represent Arabella in the poem

Popes poem mocks all the traditions of classics Although the poem is funny at times Pope keeps a sense that beauty is fragile and that just because Belinda loses a lock of her hair she is very deeply hurt

Three of Uranuss moons are named after characters from The Rape of the Lock Belinda Umbriel and Ariel

The Gorgonopsids were mammal like reptiles called Therapsids

They were a successful group which lived during the Permian period about 260 million years ago They became extinct in the PermianTriassic extinction event 

They were the major predators of their day They had large powerful square shaped jaws with huge sabre like canine and interlaced socket like teeth Many fossils have been found in South Africa

The largest known Inostrancevia was the size of a large bear with a 45 cm long skull and 12 cm long saber like teeth 

The Gorgonopsidae are divided into three sub families 

Gorgonops is the name given to an extinct genus of therapsid which lived about 255 250 million years ago during the latest part of the Permian period It was a typical representative of the Gorgonopsia the dominant predators of their day which in the largest forms grew to over four meters long 

Down quarks are very small particles that help make up many larger particles like protons and neutrons Down quarks have a charge of 13 Since Down quarks are fermions they have a spin of 12 Down quarks are the second lightest quark the first being up quarks

The antiparticle of a Down quark is a Down antiquark or simply an antidown

Strange quarks are the third lightest quarks which are subatomic particles that are so small they are believed to not be able to be divided Like down quarks strange quarks have a charge of 13 Like all fermions strange quarks have a spin of 12 What makes strange quarks different from down quarksapart from having 25 times the mass of down quarksis that they have something that scientists call strangeness Strangeness is basically a resistance to decay against strong force and electromagnetism This means that any particle that contains a strange quark can not decay due to strong force but instead with the much slower weak force 

Strange quarks can be found in particles such as kaons and some hyperons Scientists began noticing strangeness when these particles did not decay as quickly as their masses would have suggested they would have However it took them a long time to even guess strangeness was the answer because it took over 16 years to predict it after the discovery of kaons

Charm quarks or c quarks are the third most massive of the six quarks Like all quarks they are thought to be so small that they can not be divided Similar to up quarks charm quarks have a charge of 23 Although charm quarks are not extremely common they can be found in particles created by particle accelerators such as J mesons D mesons and other charmed particles Since they are fermions charm quarks have a spin of 12 

The discovery of charm quarks and J mesons led to a rapid series of scientific breakthroughs These events are known as the November revolution

Othniel Charles Marsh MA PhD LLD was one of the leading paleontologists of the 19th century He discovered and named many fossils found in western North America

Marsh was born in Lockport New York into a family of modest means However he was the nephew of the very wealthy banker and philanthropist George Peabody 

He graduated from Yale College in 1860 He later studied geology and mineralogy in New Haven and afterwards paleontology and anatomy in Berlin Heidelberg and Breslau He returned to the United States in 1866 and was appointed professor of vertebrate paleontology at Yale University He persuaded his uncle George Peabody to establish the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale

Marsh and his many fossil hunters were able to uncover about 500 new species of fossil animals which were named by Marsh himself 

In May 1871 Marsh uncovered the first pterosaur fossils found in America He also found early horses the Cretaceous and Jurassic dinosaurs Apatosaurus and Allosaurus and described the toothed birds of the Cretaceous Ichthyornis and Hesperornis 

Marsh is also known for the so called Bone Wars waged against Edward Drinker Cope The two men were fiercely competitive discovering and documenting more than 120 new species of dinosaur between them Marsh eventually won the Bone Wars by finding 80 new species of dinosaur while Cope only found 56

Bottom quarks or beauty quarks are the second most massive of the elementary particles All quarks are elementary particles Bottom quarks have a charge of 13 similar to down quarks Although bottom quarks are not very common they are found in particles such as B mesons among others All bottom quarks will decay into charm quarks or up quarks in about 1012 due to weak force

Top quarks or truth quarks are the heaviest known elementary particles All quarks are elementary particles and since they are fermions they have a spin of 12 Top quarks interact with all four of the fundamental forces which are gravity electromagnetism strong force and weak force Almost all of the time top quarks will decay into a bottom quark and a W boson although it can sometimes decay into a strange quark

One top quark weighs about as much as one atom of tungsten Since top quarks are so massive scientists have been able to make predictions about the mass of the theoretical particle known as a Higgs Boson Unfortunately top quarks are only believed to be able to exist for 5x1025 seconds

Gauge bosons are carrier particles for three of the four fundamental forces The three gauge bosons are as follows

Mesons are not considered to be gauge bosons of the strong force because only the lighter mesons are thought to be responsible for the interaction responsible for the strong force

The only remaining fundamental force that has no known gauge boson is gravity The theoretical gauge boson for gravity is called a graviton

All gauge bosons are bosons which simply means that two or more of them can exist in the same place at the same time unlike fermions It also means that gauge bosons have a spin of 0 or 1 

Gauge bosons are the particles that are thought to interact with a Higgs field This theoretical field is believed by many scientists to be responsible for why some gauge bosons like W and Z bosons have mass while others such as photons do not have mass

Henryk Sienkiewicz  Polish journalist and Nobel Prize winning novelist

Hyperons are particles that are made of quarks What makes them different from other baryons is that they must have at least one strange quark but no charm quarks or bottom quarks Strange quarks have a property known as strangeness Strangeness causes the strange quarkand all other particles bonded with itto not decay by strong force but instead due to the much slower weak force Since all quarks are fermions each quark has a spin of 12 adding up to a total spin of 32 for a hyperon This quickly decays into a 12 spin particle 

Hyperons themselves decay due to weak force There are dozens of different hyperon combinations For example a hyperon has a charge of 0 and is often written as 0 When it decays it usually creates one proton and one antipion Like many forms of weak force decay there is more than one possible outcome A 0 also has a significantly lower but still possible chance to decay into a neutron and an uncharged pion 0 hyperons have an average lifespan of 26x1010 seconds which makes it one of the longest living hyperons

Scientists still study hyperons in labs across the world such as CERN Fermilab and SLAC Hyperons provide answers questions for problems such as CP Violation in which symmetries that were believed to be true may not be true

Dithering is the intentional use of noise to reduce the error of compression 

Example below 

The Donner Party were a group of people who tried to cross the Sierra Nevada mountains in the winter of 18461847 Many of them died from cold weather Because of this they became famous in the history of the American West

The group started in the Midwest in 1846 and tried to get to California They made it to Fort Bridger in Wyoming without trouble but after that they took a way to California that was not used much This route was called the Hastings cut off Instead of being shorter it took them much longer to get across Nevada They stopped in Reno Nevada for a few days in October 1846 to get supplies

Once they left Reno snow fell earlier than normal and trapped them in the mountains The group made shelters but ran out of food On 16 December seventeen people tried to go west again Of these two went back to the camp Of the fifteen who kept going seven stayed alive and reached a settlement on the western side of the mountains after 32 days 

After this a rescue party went back and in about two weeks made it to one of the camps set up in the mountains After this three more groups tried to rescue those trapped in the mountains The last person was rescued on 7 April 1847

In all 42 people from the original Donner Party died and there were 47 who survived Some of the survivors used cannibalism to survive All the survivors made it to California but they disagreed about what happened during the winter and whose fault it was

Today there are several memorials to the group including a monument and the Donner Memorial State Park A lake was also named for them

Body of Evidence is a 1993 movie starring Julianne Moore Madonna and Willem Dafoe The movie was written by Brad Mirman directed Uri Edel and produced by Dino De Laurentiis It was given an R rating because it showed female nudity sex scenes and vulgar language The film performed very poor at the box office and was rejected by critics the New York Times described it as a sluggish courtroom melodrama The 99 minute long movie was released by MGM

The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was a military campaign to occupy Kuwait in the Persian Gulf Started by Saddam Hussein in 1990 who accused Kuwait of stealing Iraqi oil through slant drilling In August 2 1990 Iraq launched 100000 troops backed up by 750 tanks into Kuwait Two days after the invasion Kuwait was fully occupied and surrendered Saddam Hussein made a temporary annexation of Kuwait as the 19th province of Iraq It was not recognized by the United Nations or other countries 

After the occupation Iraq took over many of the Kuwaiti oil fields and started taking the oil to keep for Iraq Factories businesses and industries were also taken over by Iraqis as well

After seven months of occupation the United Nations launched a US led coalition to enter Kuwait to free it from Iraq

Leuconostoc is a gram positive bacteria emerging human pathogen found in environment and food products Risk factors of infection include antibiotic pressure foreign device or underlying immune defects Commercial diagnostics are commonly used to identify gram positive bacteria with errors mostly at the species level Here we report inaccuracies of the Analytical Profile Index systems in identifying Leuconostoc at the genus level We also propose practical methods for clinical bacteriology laboratories to identify this organism

Pediococcus is a genus of Gram positive lactic acid bacteria They usually occur in pairs or tetrads and divide along two planes of symmetry as do the other lactic acid cocci genera They are purely homofermentative

Pediococcus strains are found in foods on plants and as beer spoilage agents They produce inactive lactic acid and are used mainly for making fermented vegetables mashes beer and wort

Charles Robert Knight was an American artist famous for his paintings of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals

His works were reproduced in many books and are on display at several major museums in the United States

As a child Knight was deeply interested in nature and animals and spent many hours copying the illustrations from his fathers natural history books Though legally blind he was partially sighted He had severe astigmatism and a later injury to his right eye but had specially designed glasses At twelve he enrolled at the Metropolitan Art School to become a commercial artist 

In his free time Knight visited the American Museum of Natural History and attracted the attention of Dr Jacob Wortman Soon the museum commissioned Knight to produce a series of watercolors for their fossil halls

These paintings were hugely popular among visitors and Knight continued to work with the museum well into the 1930s He painted what would become some of the most celebrated images of dinosaurs prehistoric mammals and prehistoric humans

One of Knights best known pieces for the American Museum of Natural History is 1897s Leaping Laelaps one of the few pre 1960s images to present dinosaurs as active fast moving creatures This was long before the theories of modern paleontologists like Robert Bakker 

Other familiar American Museum paintings include Knights portrayals of Agathaumas Allosaurus Brontosaurus Smilodon and the Woolly Mammoth All of these have been reproduced many times

Soon natural history museums throughout the country began asking Knight for paintings as background for their own fossil exhibits In 1925 Knight produced an elaborate mural for the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County This illustrated some of the birds and mammals whose remains had been found in the nearby La Brea Tar Pits 

The following year Knight began a 28 mural series for Chicagos Field Museum of Natural History a project which showed the history of life on earth and took four years to complete At the Field Museum he produced one of his best known pieces a mural featuring Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops This confrontation scene between a predator and its prey would inspire many imitations establishing the two dinosaurs as mortal enemies in the popular consciousness

Knights work also found its way to the Carnegie Museums in Pittsburgh the Smithsonian Institution Washington DC and Yales Peabody Museum of Natural History among others Several zoos such as the Bronx Zoo the Lincoln Park Zoo and the Brookfield Zoo also got Knight to paint murals of their living animals 

Knight illustrated books and magazines and became a frequent contributor to National Geographic He also wrote and illustrated several books of his own such as Before the Dawn of History Life Through the Ages Animal Drawing Anatomy and Action for Artists and Prehistoric Man The Great Adventure Additionally Knight became a popular lecturer describing prehistoric life to audiences across the country

Knight worked in an era when new and often fragmentary fossils were coming out of the American west in quantity Understandably not all of his creations were based on solid evidence His painting of ceratopsians as solitary animals in lush grassy landscapes was incorrect The grasslands which feature in many of his paintings did not appear until the Cenozoic and ceratopsians are known to have been gregarious animals  

Knight restored many dinosaurs with typical reptilian like limbs and narrow hips In the 1920s studies by palaeontologists had confirmed that dinosaurs had broad avian like hips rather than those of a present day reptile 

Knight often restored extinct mammals birds and marine reptiles in action poses but his depictions of large dinosaurs as ponderous swamp dwellers destined for extinction reflected more traditional concepts In his catalogue to Life through the Ages he repeated views he had written earlier He described the great beasts as slow moving dunces that were unadaptable and unprogressive while conceding that small dinosaurs may have been more active In fact by their long survival in a world of many predators herbivorous dinosaurs were as effective as they needed to be

The single most obvious fault in his dinosaur paintings was one he shared with all the paleontologists of his day They did not realise the tail was used as a counter balance and so in movement was held horizontal not dragged along the ground In many species the ligaments of the tail were ossified so the tail simply must have been horizontal Deinonychus is a good example

This issue which was certainly not Knights fault limits the usefulness today of many of his best illustrations

Other admirers have included special effects artist Ray Harryhausen who writes in his autobiography An Animated Life Long before Obie myself and Steven Spielberg he put flesh on creatures that no human had ever seen At the LA County Museum I vividly remember a beautiful Knight mural on one of the walls depicting the way the tar pits would have looked in ancient times This plus a picture book about Knights work my mother gave me were my first encounters with a man who was to prove an enormous help when the time came for me to make three dimensional models of these extinct beings

Though many other paleoartists have succeeded Knight Knights paintings still remain very popular among paleontology enthusiasts

Pseudopodia are temporary cytoplasm filled parts of the cell wall that can move out of the cell wall They are used in some eukaryotic cells to move around or to eat Most cells that do this are called amoeboids The amoeba is a common example

The cell wall makes a network of fibers The cytoplasm flows into the network and fills it up similar to a net filled with gelatin This is able to move lengthen or shorten

Pseudopedia are used by some cells to move around They can detect food and place it inside the cell The human white blood cell uses this way to get around

Industries began on the outskirts of the city away from the centre special areas for making objects Companies from Biscay and Gipuzkoa moved to Vitoria because land was cheaper there Between 1950 and 1977 833 companies started in the city

The largest effects of this was that the city grew quickly with many immigrants and a mixture of cultures Between 1950 and 1975 the population grew from 53000 to 173000FactdateJanuary 2012 In 1975 only 418 of the population had been born in the cityFactdateJanuary 2012

Vitoria Gasteiz is a very old city It was founded in 1180 by the Navarrese King Sancho VI who conquered the small hill village of Gasteiz and decided to call it New Victoria Only nineteen years later the city fell into the hands Castille s King Alfonso VIII The new king enlarged the city with three new streets on the west side of the hill In 1202 a terrible fire almost destroyed the town The city prospered quickly it was on the shortest way between the Court of Castille and northern Europe

In 1443 another terrible fire affected the western part of the city After that new houses had to be built of stone and adobe In 1492 the expulsion of Jews had an negative impact and caused a long period of decline

In this century the customs house was moved from Vitoria to the coast seriously affecting the local economy However the effect was softened with the development of the services sector

With the turn of the century come the first modern factories They were small family businesses Now there are also multinationals for example Mercedes Benz and Michelin Between 1950 and 1975 the city tripled its population and new districts were built In 1980 the Basque Parliament chose Vitoria Gasteiz as the capital of the Basque Country

The city is characterized as green and sustainable We could define the current Vitoria Gasteiz as a city designed and planned to live in

Vitoria has a green ring around the city with more than 11000 hectares of trees and different species of animals There are also a lot of tracks for walking and cycing

Water usage is another reason why Gasteiz won the award because it is one the cities of Europe than wastes less water  only 10 and its inhabitants are reasonable consumers Other towns lose 50  25 of domestic rubbish is recycled but it is possible to improve

It is true that a lot of inhabitants use public transport and bike to move in the city but there are too many people who use cars

The prize is very important for the city because its population has been working on improving its environment for the last 30 years With the green capital prize the environment is the future for Vitoria and its inhabitants

The EndTriassic extinction event marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods 1996 million years ago However many of the extinctions occurred before then in the Upper Triassic

Overall this was one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon It profoundly affected life on land and in the oceans At least half of the species now known to have been living on Earth at that time went extinct 

A whole class 20 of all marine families and all large crurotarsans some remaining therapsids and many of the large amphibians were wiped out 

The event emptied many ecological niches and allowed the dinosaurs to assume the dominant roles in the Jurassic period This event happened in less than 10000 years and occurred just before Pangaea started to break apart 

Several explanations for this event have been suggested but all have unanswered challenges

Mahakala is a dromaeosaurid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of 80 million years ago 

It is based on a partial skeleton found in the Gobi Desert Mongolia 

Mahakala was a small dromaeosaur about 70 centimeters long Its skeleton shows some features which are also found in early troodontids and avialans However its short forearms rule it out of the Alialae

Despite its late appearance its structure is that of a basal dromaeosaur Its small size and the small size of other basal deinonychosauria suggests that small size came before flight in birds

Although this individual was small comparable in size to Archaeopteryx Caudipteryx and Mei it was close to adulthood 

This genus can be distinguished from other paravians by details of the ulna thighbone ilium and tail vertebrae

It had a typical dromaeosaurid form of the second toe with an expanded claw Mahakala also had very short forelimbs compared to other Dromaeosaurs

A phylogenetic analysis performed by Turner and colleagues who described the specimen found Mahakala to be the most basal known dromaeosaur Their results along with the small size of other theropods found at the base of paravian lineages suggest that small size was not an innovation of early birds but a common trait of early paravians

In evolution small size would have come before flight Like birds troodonts and dromaeosaurs did not keep small size throughout their evolutionary history They had several separate size increases among different lineages 

Mahakala also shows a combination of characteristics found among basal troodonts and birds and is missing some that are present in more derived dromaeosaurs

The paleoenvironment had a semiarid climate with sand dunes and alluvium The semiarid steppe landscape was drained by streams after rain and was affected by dust and sandstorms Rainfall was low and seasonal 

Animals present included terrestrial turtles and crocodilians lizards mammals and a variety of dinosaurs aquatic animals like fish were not present The majority of the fauna was small to medium sized 

Small coelurosaurians are the most diverse dinosaurs including fellow dromaeosaurid Velociraptor troodonts Byronosaurus and Saurornithoides oviraptors Citipati Khaan and Oviraptor and alvarezsaurs Mononykus and Shuvuuia other dinosaurs present included the ceratopsian Protoceratops and the ankylosaur Pinacosaurus Like other dromaeosaurs Mahakala would have been a small active predaceous carnivore

Avialae is a term for birds and their immediate extinct ancestors It is a clade of dinosaurs containing their only living representatives birds and whatever coelurosaurs are regarded as their ancestors

Avialae is defined as clade based on physical characteristics Jacques Gauthier named Avialae in 1986 and first defined it in 2001 as all dinosaurs that possessed feathered wings used in flapping flight and the birds that descended from them 

Several other authors use a similar but branch based definition all theropods closer to birds than to Deinonychus

he origin of Yatsuhashi is come from Yatsuhashi Kengyo who is the pioneer of making Yatsuhashi In Edo era he saved everything so he wanted to make something from the rice that was left in rice chest a little Then Yatsuhashi was born After he died Yatsuhashi was love by people in Kyoto and now it is very famous food in Kyoto 

Yatsuhashi is made by rice flour and sugqar cane and a lot of cinnamon Especially cinnamon is called Nikkei and become a essential part of it unique tast

 100g michiko or glutinous rice flour

 60g raw cane sugar or light brown sugar

 1 tsp ground cinnamon

 85cc water

Step1 Mix the dry ingredients together well with chopsticks or a fork add the water and mix very well It will be rather loose and sludgy

Step2 Put back in the microwave and cook on HIGH for 1 minute 30 seconds Take out and mix again At this stage it will form a rough ball and more or less clear the sides of the bowl

Step3 Spread a large piece of heat proof plastic wrap on your working surface and turn the dough out on it

Step4 Wrap the dough up in the plastic Knead the dough several times using the plastic wrap as a heat barrier and to prevent sticking between you the working surface and the dough This kneading is very important to ensure the dough is smooth and pliable You may have to open the plastic wrap and re shift the dough a few times Keep kneading until the dough is smooth and shiny

Step5 Mix the 3 Tbs of kinako and 1 Tbs of cinnamon and use this as the dusting flour to roll out the dough as thinly as possible It helps to use more plastic wrap to prevent sticking here If you have trouble getting it thin enough try dividing the dough and rolling out smaller pieces

Step6 Cut the dough into 10 to 12 squares Wet two sides fill with about 12 tsp of filling fold up into a triangle and press hard to seal I then like to coat them again in the kinako cinnamon powder mix and dust on extra cinnamon to serve but this is optional

Telephone is a song by American singer Lady Gaga from her third EP The Fame Monster featuring American RB singer Beyonc Knowles The main inspiration of the song was Gagas fear of not being able to enjoy herself because of her career hence the lyrics show the singer as wanting the dance floor rather than answering her lovers phone calls

Gaga explained that the telephone addressed in the lyrics of the song is in reality a person telling her to continue working harder Musically the song is made of an expanded bridge verse rap and an epilogue where the voice of an operator says that the phone line is not reachable Knowles appears in the middle of the song singing the verses in a rapid fire way accompanied by double beats

Telephone was appreciated by contemporary critics who many times noted it as a stand out track from The Fame Monster

Flavivirus is a genus of the family Flaviviridae This genus includes the West Nile virus Dengue fever virus Tick borne Encephalitis Virus Yellow fever virus and several other viruses which may cause encephalitis

Flavivirus are share a common size 40 65 nm Flaviviruses are named from the yellow fever virus a type virus for the Flaviviridae family flavus means yellow in Latin Yellow fever in turn was named because of its propensity to cause yellow jaundice in victims2

Flaviviruses share a common size symmetry nucleic acid and appearance in the electron microscope

These viruses are transmitted by the bite from an infected arthropod Human infections with these viruses are typically incidental as humans are unable to replicate the virus to high enough titres to reinfect arthropods and thus continue the virus life cycle The exceptions to this are yellow fever and dengue viruses which still require mosquito vectors but are well enough adapted to humans as to not necessarily depend upon animal hosts

Other virus transmission routes include handling infected animal carcasses blood transfusion child birth and through consumption of unpasteurised milk products The transmission from animals to humans without an intermediate vector arthropod is thought to be unlikely For example early tests with yellow fever showed that the disease is not a contagious disease

Cytomegalovirus is a viral genus of the Herpesviruses group in humans it is commonly known as HCMV or Human Herpesvirus 5 CMV belongs to the Betaherpesvirinae subfamily of Herpesviridae which also includes Roseolovirus Other herpesviruses fall into the subfamilies of Alphaherpesvirinae or Gammaherpesvirinae All herpesviruses share a characteristic ability to remain latent within the body over long periods

He won many awards he was made a Commander of the Lgion dHonneur and awarded the Grande Ufficiale al Merito della Repubblica Italiana

Benot de Maillet was a well travelled French diplomat and naturalist 

He was French consul general at Cairo and overseer in the Levant He formulated an evolutionary hypothesis to explain the Earth and its contents 

Maillets geological observations convinced him that the Earth could not have been created in an instant because the features of the crust indicate a slow development by natural processes He also believed that creatures on the land were ultimately derived from creatures living in the seas He believed in the natural origin of man 

Maillet made the first reasonable estimate of the Earths age based on evidence He thought the Earth must have developed by slow natural forces He studied geology in the field He could see signs of erosion on land and sedimentation in the sea 

He hid his ideas under the guise of a talk with an Indian philosopher to avoid conflict with the Catholic Church His work stayed in manuscript until after his death when it was published after its editor had made changes which damaged it Now there is a better modern edition based on the manuscripts 

Maillet estimated that the Earth was older than two billion years He also recognized the true nature of fossils and had early ideas about evolution

Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber von Bibern was a Bohemian Austrian composer and violinist He was the most famous German violinist of his time He is particularly famous for his violin sonatas

Biber was born in a small Bohemian town near Reichenberg Nothing is known about his music education We know that in the mid 1660s he went to work for Prince Bishop Karl Count Liechtenstein Kastelkorn of Olomouc The prince loved music and kept many musicians at his court During the winter of 1670 1671 Biber became a member of the Kapelle at Salzburg court He was married there in 1672 There he played the violin and trained the choirboys and composed a lot of music He probably had a lot of contact with other well known musicians such as Georg Muffat Although he was the greatest virtuoso of his time he hardly seems to have travelled about to play

In 1690 Biber was raised to the nobility During his last years he seems to have spent much of his time composing works for the theatre as well as sacred music

Category theory is a type of mathematics Category theorists show how different ideas in mathematics are the same For example some ideas from Topology and Abstract Algebra are similar Ideas in category theory are written down in formulas or diagrams

Category theory can be used to make computer programs more secure or easy to write

A category is a mathematical object It can be drawn with dots and arrows Each arrow goes from one dot to one other dot There can be many dots sometimes so many that you can not count them

Composition is a way to make a new arrow out of two arrows If two arrows form an elbow shape then they have a composition arrow from the start of the first to the end of the second Composition obeys some axioms or equations

Many ideas in abstract algebra are examples of categories or can be used to make categories Often this makes the ideas seem more similar

Examples of Category Theoretic Definitions

Quango is an acronym used especially in the United Kingdom and the Ireland It means an organisation which the government has given devolved power 

The acronym is spelt out in various ways

 quasi non governmental organisation

 quasi autonomous non governmental organisation

 quasi autonomous national government organisation

 In the United Kingdom the official term is non departmental public body or NDPB

The term quasi autonomous non governmental organization was created in 1967 by the Carnegie Foundations Alan Pifer He wrote an essay on independence and accountability in public funded bodies This term was shortened to quango by Anthony Barker a Briton during a follow up conference 

Many quangos were created from the 1980s onwards The UK governments definition in 1997 of a non departmental public body or quango was

According to the Tax Payers Alliance in the year 2006 07 tax payers funded 1162 Quangos at a cost of nearly 64bn equivalent to 2550 per household About a thousand still remain

Since Scotland was given devolved self government in 1999 their government has also set up a number of quangos

The Republic of Ireland in 2006 had more than 800 quangos 482 at national and 350 at local level with a total of 5784 individual appointees and a combined annual budget of 13 billion

Depending upon ones point of view the separation of a quango from government might allow its functions to be more commercially exercised Or else it might allow an elected minister to evade responsibility for spending public money Quangos have been criticised as undemocratic expensive and letting government grow too big

The Times has accused quangos of bureaucratic waste and excess In 2005 Dan Lewis author of The Essential Guide to Quangos claimed that many quangos were useless and duplicated the work of others In August 2008 a report by the right leaning pressure group the Taxpayers Alliance claimed that 15 billion was being wasted by the regional development agencies quangos set up to encourage economic development in their regions

Daniel Vladimir Lewicki is a retired Canadian ice hockey left winger He played for the Toronto Maple Leafs Chicago Black Hawks and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League in the 1950s and early 1960s Before becoming a professional Lewicki was at the centre of a dispute over professional hockey signing practices As of2010 Lewicki is the only player to have won the Allan Cup Memorial Cup and Stanley Cup while still a junior

Lewicki was one of eight children in the family of Michael and Anastasia Lewicki Both Michael and Anastasia were born in Ukraine and emigrated to Canada where they met in Fort William Ontario The family lived in the area known as the Coal Docks an immigrant enclave near the docks in Fort WilliamsfnLewicki2006pp23 The family shared a home with six boarders In an abusive marriage Anastasia left Michael when Daniel was two years of agesfnLewicki2006pp6 Two of the children were sent to Geraldton Ontario where the eldest sister lived with her husband Daniel his mother a sister and brother and a boarder lived in a two room shack Convert20ft by Convert30ftsfnLewicki2006pp67

Lewicki started skating at age five first with bob skates then a used pair three sizes too largesfnLewicki2006p24 Until age twelve Lewicki learned to play hockey by playing shinny on outdoor rinks Organized hockey started at age twelve and Lewicki joined the Bantam Elks This he did in secret as his mother was strongly opposed to his playing hockey Lewicki would hide his hockey equipment outside under the backyard stairssfnLewicki2006p36 The next season Lewicki played for the North Star Bantams moving up to the Midgets at age fourteen a year early to play against boys sixteen and older

At age fifteen Lewicki got his first taste of junior hockey with the Columbus Juniors in their playoffs against the Winnipeg Monarchs Lewicki would return to the Columbus Juniors the following season That season Lewicki would lead the Fort William league in scoring and started attracting the attention of pro scouts from Toronto New York and Detroit Lewicki did not sign with any team but was placed on the negotiating list of the Providence Reds by his coach Leo Barbini who did some scouting for the RedssfnLewicki2006pp4751 Barbini somehow managed to put Lewicki on the Providence list before Toronto and New York who had filed at 1201 am on Lewickis sixteenth birthday

The following season Columbus would be defeated by the Port Arthur West End Bruins After the series Lewicki was invited to join the Bruins as they continued in junior series playoffs The Bruins would defeat Winnipeg to advance to the Western title series against Lethbridge Alberta Port Arthur and Lethbridge would be tied 33 in a best of seven series Lethbridge refused to play the seventh game in Port Arthur and the game was moved to Torontos Maple Leaf Gardens The large ice surface favoured the Bruins and they defeated Lethbridge 111 to advance to the 1948 Memorial Cup final against the Barrie Flyers The Bruins would defeat the Flyers in four straight to win the Cup and Lewicki would score the series winning goalsfnLewicki2006pp5862 The club had an impressive array of talent Eight players from the Bruins would go on to play in the NHL Lewicki was the top scorer in the playoffs recording 40 pointssfnLewicki2006pp6263

After the Cup the Toronto Maple Leafs bought the rights to Lewicki for a record price of 35000 and a playersfnLewicki2006p65 In the fall Lewicki left Port Arthur to join the Stratford Kroehlers coached by Barbini his old coach Before the regular season started Lewicki was ordered to join the Toronto Marlboros by the Maple Leafs Unbeknownst to Lewicki Barbini had signed Lewicki to a C Form which bound Lewicki at age eighteen and not simply signed Lewicki to a negotiating listsfnLewicki2006p73 

Lewicki refused to play for Toronto but was told that he had to play for the Marlboros or nowhere else Lewicki received a telegram from NHL President Clarence Campbell advising him that he was suspended The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association took up Lewickis case but the CAHA stopped backing Lewicki short of any legal action Stratford did as well in the face of pressure from the Maple Leafs Lewicki decided to join the Marlboros The C Form which Lewicki signed became an issue in the Canadian Parliament and was abolished a few years latersfnLewicki2006pp7392

The Marlboros were defeated in the playoffs that year and like in Port Arthur Lewicki was invited to join another team on a playoff run This time it was the Marlboros senior team in competition for the Allan Cup The Marlboros defeated the Kitchener Waterloo Dutchmen then the Cornwall Calumets the Sault Ste Marie Greyhounds and the Sherbrooke Saints to advance to the 1950 Allan Cup final against the Calgary Stampeders Lewicki would be named the MVP for the series as the Marlboros defeated Calgary 41 Lewicki scored 42 points in the 17 playoff gamessfnLewicki2006p109

In 1950 Lewicki began his National Hockey League career with the Maple Leafs As a nineteen year old he made the team straight out of training camp Lewicki was able to get a one way contract at 10000 for three years and a signing bonus of 3000 Lewicki made his NHL debut on October 14 1950 against the Chicago Black Hawks In his seventh game Lewicki scored his first NHL goal on a bounce off the glass that bounced off the back of the Boston Bruins Jack Gelineau Lewicki became a contender for the Calder Trophy although he had strong competition from future Hall of Famer Terry Sawchuk Lewicki had 16 goals and 31 assists before a groin injury ended his season early Lewicki would end up third in voting for the CaldersfnLewicki2006pp121136 The team finished second to qualify for the playoffs Lewicki was pressed into service on the orders of Conn Smythe although he was not healed To play he had to have his groin muscle frozen and taped before each game Instead of being able to contribute as a scorer Lewicki would play a checking role in the playoffs The Leafs would defeat the Montreal Canadiens in the final 41 to win the 1951 Stanley Cup FinalsfnLewicki2006p144 Lewicki was an Allan Cup Memorial Cup and Stanley Cup winner at the age of 20

Lewicki spent the next three seasons mainly with the Leafs Pittsburgh Hornets Smythe was mad at Lewicki for getting married during the 1951 off season In Smythes memoirs he later regretted demoting a player to the minors for getting married without naming the player Lewicki may be the player but he is not the only player to be demoted for that reason Lewicki and another Leaf player John McCormack were both demoted following marriages Despite a 36 goal 45 assist and 81 point season in Pittsburgh in 1954 the Maple Leafs sold Lewicki to the New York Rangers Back in the NHL Lewicki would respond with the best NHL season of his career scoring 29 goals and 24 assists in 70 games and was named to the NHL Second All Star team 

After the 195758 season the Rangers left him unprotected for the annual intra league draft and Lewicki became Montreal Canadiens property Although he had a good training camp and earned a bonus for his play he was shipped to the Chicago Black Hawks Lewicki and other players who had been picked from the Rangers system were picked by the Canadiens simply to hurt the Rangers and the Canadiens had no plans to play them 

Lewicki played one season for the Black Hawks who managed to make the playoffs only to lose in the first round In the final game of the playoff referee Red Storey missed a tripping call leading to a series winning goal by the Canadiens The fans at Chicago Stadium were threatening Storey and Lewicki gave Storey his stick to defend himself Lewicki was unhappy after sitting on the bench and he handed Storey his stick saying you need it more than me Storey used the stick to defend himself to exit the arena It would be both Storey and Lewickis last game in the NHL Storey resigned after criticism from league president Campbell and the Black Hawks would sent Lewicki to the minors Lewicki contends that the incident led to him being black balled from the league as he received no call ups or any chances to make another NHL club for the rest of his career Lewicki played for a few seasons in the American Hockey League before retiring in 1963

Jundallah or Peoples resistance movement of Iran is a militant organisation based in Balochistan The organisation claims to be fighting for the rights of Sunni muslims in Iran Most muslims in Iran are Shia Sunni make up for the largest group that is not Shia Iran says the group is a terrorist organisation Iran has blamed the organisation for many acts of smuggling illegal drugs and of kidnapping The organisation is believed to have 1000 fighting soldiers 

Many observers believe the group is linked to al Qaeda For a long time Iran has believed that the US government supported Jundallah Several other sources such as the ABC News Daily Telegraph and journalist Seymour Hersh have also reported that Jundullah has received support from the United States against the government of Iran although the US denies any involvement

In August 2007 the Israeli Mossad chief Meir Dagan pushed for using ethnic groups in Iran to make the Iranian government weaker and try to change the people in charge of the government

A flame retardant is a chemical substance that makes things harder to burn Some flame retardants are minerals or inorganic compounds like antimony trioxide or asbestos Other flame retardants are special types of plastics and polymers There are several ways flame retardants work Some absorb heat when they are heated stopping the thing from igniting Others stop the heat from the fire from going into the thing Flame retardants are used in textiles and bedding to prevent them from burning easily

The Solingen arson attack of 1993 happened on the night of 29 May 1993 when five Turkish people died in Solingen Germany They died when four young German men belonging to the political far right firebombed a house The dead were women and children aged four nine 12 18 and 27 all of whom who were related

The attack caused many protests in Germany and many German government officials were at a memorial service for the dead Some of the protests were violent but others were peaceful

Because of the attack Germany decided to make sure fewer people from other countries came into Germany for political asylum It also banned some right wing political groups

On 14 October 1995 a Germany court sentenced the four people who did the attack Three men aged 18 19 and 22 were given prison terms of ten years The fourth man 25 was given a term of 15 years The sentences were opposed by the men and their families though most of the Turkish people in Germany approved of them Some Turkish people wanted the men to get life terms in jail

Hyperthermophiles are extremophile organisms that live best in very hot environments from 60C up to 100C The best temperature for hyperthermophiles to grow at is around 80C Hyperthermophiles are mostly in the Archaea domain but some bacteria are able to tolerate temperatures of around 100C as well Many hyperthermophiles are also able to tolerate other environmental extremes like high acidity or radiation levels

Solder is a metal or alloy that melts at a low temperature There are two types of solder soft solder and hard solder Soft solder melts easily with soldering irons and is used for electronics and electrical work Hard solder melts at a higher temperature with a torch Using solder is called soldering 

There are two main types of soft solder lead solder and lead free solder Lead solders have about 60 tin and 40 lead in them They are toxic because they have lead in them They melt at around 185C Lead solder is cheap so it used to be popular In plumbing a 50 tin and 50 lead mixture was used People thought this was safe but then they saw that the lead was coming into the water Now lead solder is illegal for water Lead solder was once used for food cans After many years the lead could come into the food The cans poisoned people who ate the food Lead solder is still used in electronics

In 2006 the European Union China and California banned lead in consumer products Lead solder became illegal in electronic devices in some places Lead free solder was needed Many lead free solders have tin silver and copper in them They melt around 217C Sometimes indium is added to the solder to make it better but indium is very expensive

Many times when a metal is being soldered it oxidizes making a layer of metal oxide that does not hold solder Flux is added to react with the metal oxide and turn it back into the metal again That helps the solder connect to the metal Rosin is a common flux Some electronics makers use fluxes that can be washed away with water Some solders have a flux core where the flux is inside the solder

Another type of solder is used to connect glass to other things They melt around 450 550C

Frame dragging is a theory which says that space is elastic and particles in it will exchange energy with it In the scientific world elastic means that when you apply a certain amount of force to an object and then remove the force the object will return to its original shape and energy state Also space is referred to as spacetime which is simply a way to bring together the concepts of space and time together This basically means that whenever space is affected time is affected Frame dragging would provide answers for very old questions about gravity strong force and wave particle duality

In frame dragging particles spin and this spin has energy in it Since spacetime is elastic in this theory it can absorb the energy of the particle This would slow down the spin of the particle 

Mass has a strange effect that we experience in the normal world it attracts other mass Scientists have been spending centuries trying to explain this occurrence Recently they have discovered that mass has an effect that it can curve spacetime This means that when mass is present the shortest path through spacetime between two points is slightly bent towards wherever the mass is 

Since the energy absorbed by spacetime has to go somewhere many scientists predict that spacetime would be bunched up or folded This can also be phrased as a curvature in spacetime This would indicate that the particle generated gravity The reason that this theory is called frame dragging is probably due to the effect of particles effectively dragging or grabbing spacetime as they spin Not only would space be curved but time would as well

However the way to imagine this gravity is not so much as the force that we normally consider when we think of gravity since normal gravity is created as well Basically frame dragging is an effect that occurs when one object is moving near another which makes both objects change their motion because of the others motion Frame dragging does not occur if an object is neither spinning nor moving In effect one object deflects the motion of the other and the other way around

Scientists such as Einstein and Schrdinger spent much of their lives trying to find an answer for how can something like an electron act like a wave and also act like a particle Frame dragging states that since spacetime is elastic it can also give the spin energy back to the particle Once the particle has all of its spin energy given back to it it acts most like a wave At that point it will once again begin using its energy bunching up spacetime Once the particle is no longer spinning it acts most like a particle Then spacetime begins giving the particle its energy back and the cycle continues forever This is how a particle can actually act like a particle and a wave at nearly the same time No energy is lost during the cycle due to the conservation of energy

Frame dragging also has an effect that if one particle is next to another they can both save energy if one is absorbing energy as the other one is emitting it This would encourage particles to group together which would explain what strong force is

There are effects that come out of the math of the frame dragging theory Scientists are currently testing one which is that if one small spinning object is orbiting a larger spinning object the smaller object will slowly adjust its spin axis to align with the larger objects spin axis This is known as the Lense Thirring effect They are testing this theory by having a gyroscope orbit the Earth and testing whether its spin axis will align with the Earths spin axis So far scientist say that they have evidence that proves the Lense Thirring effect to less than 5 accuracy

It is made by reacting antimony pentoxide or antimony pentachloride with hydrofluoric acid It can also be made by reacting antimony trifluoride with fluorine 

It is used to make very strong acids

Antimony pentafluoride reacts with most chemical compounds It is extremely corrosive

Antimony pentoxide also known as antimony pentaoxide and antimony oxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Sb2O5 It has antimony and oxide ions in it The antimony is in its 5 oxidation state

It is a yellow solid It is a strong oxidizing agent It reacts with hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid to make antimony pentachloride and antimony pentafluoride It breaks down to antimony tetroxide when heated to a high temperature

It is made by reacting antimony trioxide with nitric acid It can also be made by reacting antimony pentafluoride or antimony pentachloride with water

Charming pretty and graceful Marie Louise was her fathers favourite and she had a happy childhood Marie Louise spent a lot of time with both her grandmothers  Anne of Austria and Queen Henrietta Maria For a time she was raised with the future Queen Anne I of Great Britain her first cousin who lived in France till 1670 Marie Louises mother died the same year and her father married Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate in 1671 All her life Marie Louise would maintain an affectionate correspondence with her stepmother 

She was forced to marry Charles II of Spain The proxy marriage ceremony took place at the Palace of Fontainebleau on 30 August 1679 On 19 November 1679 Marie Louise and Charles II were married in person in Quintanapalla near Burgos Spain This was the start of a very lonely existence at the Spanish court Her new husband had fallen madly in love with her whose beauty and charm were renowned and his passion for her remained with him until the end of his life The very rigid etiquette of the Spanish Court and her unsuccessful attempts to bear a child however caused her to suffer from depression 

Her French attendants were all accused of plotting against the king and his family and as a result one of her personal maids was tortured under allegations Due to the nature of the times and the Spanish Courts hatred of the young French princess there were even riots outside the Palace in Madrid where she resided

Sadat was born in 1918 into a family with 13 children and attended a military school After his graduation he was sent to an outpost where he met and became a close friend of Gamal Abdel Nasser There the two of them became part of a group of young soldiers who later became the Free Officers group that overthrew the Muhammad Ali Dynasty in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 Nasser became the president after the revolution and Sadat served as one of Nassers ministers until he died in 1970

Sadat was chosen as president because Nassers supporters saw him as someone who they could control They did not think he would be president for very long However in his eleven years as president Sadat changed a lot of the things Nasser had set in place and made Egypt respected for its military strength and political power in the Middle East On 6 October 1973 Sadat started the October War together with Syria to try to take back the land Israel had taken from them six years earlier in the Six Day War The Egyptian army was very successful at the start of the war and their advance across the Suez Canal into the Sinai Peninsula surprised Israel and the rest of the world This success made Sadat a hero in Egypt and for a time throughout the Arab World 

Sadat visited Israel in 1977 and made a speech in front of the Knesset about what he thought was the best way to bring about peace with them He was the first Arab leader to visit Israel and recognize that it was a country In 1978 after the Camp David Accords he signed a peace treaty with Israel This won him the Nobel Peace Prize but made him very unpopular among other Arabs who did not support peace with Israel This led to Egypt being suspended from the Arab League at that time

Many Islamists were very angry about the peace treaty They made plans to take over the Egyptian government and kill all the main leaders so that they could bring Egypt back to having an Islamic government instead of a secular one In February 1981 the Egyptian government heard of this plan In September that year Sadat ordered over 1500 people arrested because he thought they might be part of the plot These people included Islamists but also the Bishop and other clergy and many of Egypts top intellectuals and activists This arrest was very unpopular However Sadat missed a group of Islamists in the military who were led by Lieutenant Khalid Islambouli This group assassinated Sadat on 6 October during the victory parade celebrating the crossing into the Sinai Peninsula Eleven other people were killed in the attack and 28 were wounded At the same time Islamists also took control of the city of Asyut for a few days

Sadats funeral was attended by many important people from around the world including Gerald Ford Jimmy Carter and Richard Nixon but only three Arab nations sent representatives and only Sudans head of state attended Sadat was succeeded by his vice president Hosni Mubarak

Arsenic trioxide is a white solid It dissolves in water to make an acidic solution of arsenious acid It dissolves easily in bases to make arsenites It reacts with concentrated hydrochloric acid to make arsenic trichloride It reacts with very strong oxidizing agents to make arsenic pentoxide It reacts with reducing agents to make arsenic or arsine It sublimes much easier than metal oxides making it easy to separate by heating the mixture

Arsenic trioxide is rarely found as a mineral It is normally made from orpiment or realgar arsenic sulfide minerals About 50000 tons of arsenic trioxide are made each year Arsenic trioxide is made by burning arsenic in air reacting arsenic with concentrated sulfuric acid or the roasting of arsenic sulfide ores

It is used to make elemental arsenic It was used as a pigment and as a wood preservative but was banned in many countries because it is so toxic Arsenic trioxide is used to fight cancer

Arsenic trioxide is highly toxic when eaten It also can be toxic if on the skin for long amounts of time It affects the digestive system when eaten Workers exposed to arsenic trioxide fumes in their job can be poisoned as well

Arsenic oxide can refer to either of these arsenic oxides

Arsenic trisulfide is a yellow solid It is a semiconductor It has a glass form and a crystalline form It burns in air to make sulfur dioxide and arsenic trioxide which makes a highly toxic smoke Arsenic trisulfide can oxidize on the surface to make a highly toxic layer of arsenic trioxide as well Arsenic trisulfide is not toxic unless it oxidizes It does not react with acids

Arsenic trisulfide is found as the mineral orpiment

Arsenic trisulfide is made when an arsenic compound like arsenic trichloride reacts with hydrogen sulfide It is also made when arsenic and sulfur are heated together 

It was looked at for treating cancer It was used by the Egyptians as a pigment and cosmetic It is used in glass 

Arsenous acid also known as arsenious acid is a chemical compound It is also an acid Its chemical formula is As3 It has arsenic and hydroxide ions in it The arsenic is in its 3 oxidation state

Arsenous acid is a colorless solution It is a weak acid It reacts with bases to make arsenite salts It is highly toxic It cannot be made in a crystalline form because it turns into arsenic trioxide and water again It is similar to phosphorous acid although it is not a strong reducing agent

It is made by dissolving arsenic trioxide or arsenic trichloride in water 

Arsenite is an ion Its chemical formula can be either AsO33 or AsO2 It has arsenic in its 3 oxidation state All arsenites are highly toxic Sodium arsenite is an example Arsenites are salts of arsenous acid

Sometimes arsenite means arsenic trioxide especially in groundwater chemistry

Paris Green which has the chemical name copper acetoarsenite is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is Cu2 3 Cu2 It has copper acetate and arsenite ions in it The copper is in its 3 oxidation state

Paris Green is a blue green solid It is extremely toxic It has a very bright blue green color It darkens in air

It is made by reacting copper acetate with arsenic trioxide and water

Paris Green was first used to kill rats in sewers in Paris This is where it got its name from It was used as an insecticide It was dropped from airplanes to stop malaria in Italy It was used as a bright green pigment It was painted on ships to prevent barnacles from growing In many places Paris Green is banned because it is so toxic It is only used in a very few places

Paris Green is extremely toxic It used to be common and so was a common poison

Potassium arsenite is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is KAsO2 It has potassium and arsenite ions in it

It is a solid It is highly toxic

It is made by reacting arsenic trioxide with potassium hydroxide

It was used as a medicine but it is carcinogenic and toxic so it is not used anymore It is banned for use as a pesticide in the United Kingdom

Sodium arsenite is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is NaAsO2 It has sodium and arsenite ions in it 

Sodium arsenite is a colorless solid It is highly toxic and carcinogenic 

Sodium arsenite is made by reacting sodium hydroxide with arsenic trioxide

Arsenic pentafluoride also known as arsenic fluoride is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is AsF5 It has arsenic and fluoride ions in it The arsenic is in its 5 oxidation state

Arsenic pentafluoride is a colorless gas It is a strong oxidizing agent It is highly toxic It makes an ionic bond with sulfur tetrafluoride Its melting point is 798C and its boiling point is 528C

Arsenic pentafluoride is made by reacting arsenic trifluoride with fluorine or by reacting arsenic with a large amount of fluorine

Arsenic pentoxide also known as arsenic oxide is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is As2O5 It has arsenic and oxide ions in it The arsenic is in its 5 oxidation state

Arsenic pentoxide is a white solid It dissolves easily in water to make arsenic acid It is highly toxic as are almost all arsenic compounds It is a powerful oxidizing agent It reacts with hydrochloric acid to make chlorine It breaks down to arsenic trioxide and oxygen when heated It reacts with bases to make arsenates

Arsenic pentoxide is made by dissolving arsenic in concentrated nitric acid Other strong oxidizing agents like ozone or hydrogen peroxide can be used

Arsenic pentoxide was used to make pesticides but it is now seen as too toxic Its uses are very similar to arsenic trioxides uses

Arsenate is an ion Its chemical formula is AsO43 It has arsenic in its 5 oxidation state Arsenates are salts of arsenic acid They are oxidizing agents Sometimes not all of the protons are taken away from the arsenic acid and then hydrogen arsenate salts are formed Their chemical formulas are HAsO42 or H2AsO4 Arsenate can replace phosphate in the cells but it does not work like phosphate does The cell dies and that is why arsenates are toxic Some bacteria can use arsenate instead of phosphate though They are called arsenic bacteria 

Arsenic acid is a chemical compound It is also an acid Its chemical formula is H3AsO4 It has hydrogen and arsenate ions in it

Arsenic acid is a colorless solid It absorbs water from the air It is a strong oxidizing agent It is similar to phosphoric acid It can be deprotonated three times making various arsenates Arsenic acid reacts with iodide to make iodine 

It is made by reacting moist arsenic with ozone or by reacting arsenic trioxide with concentrated nitric acid It can also be made by dissolving arsenic pentoxide in water

Arsenic acid is used in the making of some dyes and organic arsenic compounds It is also used as a preservative for wood and a biocide

Breccia is a type of rock formed of broken fragments of minerals or rock cemented together by a fine grained matrix The matrix may be similar to or different from the composition of the fragments 

Rocks formed by sticking together pieces of previous rocks are called clastic rocks There are two types of clastic rock conglomerates and breccias What divides these two categories is the amount of rounding The particles that make up conglomerates are well rounded whereas in breccias they are angular

A breccia may have a variety of different origins as indicated by the named types including sedimentary breccia tectonic breccia igneous breccia impact breccia and hydrothermal breccia

The basic sequence is as follows Sediment is laid down in the sea and is gradually transformed into sedimentary rock After a long period of time something violent happens to the rock breaking it up into many jagged pieces Later the pieces are cemented together by another deposition forming a new sedimentary rock This is a breccia On examination the rock is seen to include fragments of the original rock

Brecciated marble can have a marvellous appearance The Pantheon in Rome is full of the most wonderful marble many of which are breccias It includes two gigantic columns of pavonazzetto a breccia coming from Phrygia Pavonazzetto obtains its name from its extremely colourful appearance which is reminiscent of a peacocks feathers

Lead arsenate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula is PbHAsO4 It has lead hydrogen and arsenate ions in it The lead is in its 2 oxidation state

Lead arsenate is a white solid It is highly toxic because of the lead and the arsenic in it It does not dissolve in water

It was made by reacting lead nitrate with arsenic acid

It was the most used insecticide that had arsenic in it It was used against the potato beetle and the gypsy moth It replaced the even more toxic Paris Green It was later used to kill certain moths mosquitoes and pests of cranberries It was found that it stayed inside fruits even after washing off so it was replaced with DDT It was completely banned in 1988 

Potassium arsenate is a chemical compound Its chemical formula can be K3AsO4 K2HAsO4 or KH2AsO4 It has potassium and arsenate ions in it 

Potassium arsenate is a white solid It dissolves easily in water It is an oxidizing agent It is carcinogenic and highly toxic

Potassium arsenate is made by reacting amounts of potassium hydroxide with arsenic acid The amount of potassium hydroxide can be changed to make the different chemical formulas Potassium arsenate was once used for medicine but is too toxic to be used now

Clastic rocks are composed of fragments or clasts of pre existing rock

Although in principle almost any rock made of eroded former rock is clastic in practice the term is used for clasts of at least gravel size upwards That means clasts are at least visible to the naked eye and may be huge

There are two types of clastic rock by shape conglomerates have rounded clasts and breccias have jagged clasts

In a clastic rock the clasts are often of a different make up from the ground rock or matrix

Spandau Prison was a prison situated in the borough of Spandau in the British Sector of West Berlin

The prison was built in 1876 and knocked down in 1987 after the death of its last prisoner Rudolf Hess This was to stop it from becoming a neo Nazi shrine The prison was near to the Renaissance era Spandau Citadel fortress 

The prison was built in 1876 At first it was only used for soldiers but after 1919 it was also used for civilian inmates It held up to 600 inmates at that time

In the aftermath of the Reichstag Fire of 1933 opponents of Hitler and journalists such as Egon Kisch and Carl von Ossietzky were held there in so called protective custody Spandau Prison became a sort of predecessor of the Nazi concentration camps It was supposed to be controlled by the Prussian Ministry of Justice but the Gestapo tortured and abused its inmates as Egon Erwin Kisch recalls in his memories of Spandau Prison By the end of 1933 the first Nazi concentration camps had been built All remaining prisoners in protective custody in state prisons were transferred to these concentration camps

After World War II it was operated by the Four Power Authorities to house the Nazi war criminals sentenced to imprisonment at the Nuremberg Trials

Only seven prisoners were finally imprisoned there Arriving from Nuremberg on 18 July 1947 they were 

Of the seven only four served all of their sentence the remaining three Neurath Raeder and Funk were released early due to ill health Between 1966 and 1987 Rudolf Hess was the only inmate in Spandau Prison His only companion was the warden Eugene K Bird who became a close friend Bird wrote a book about Hesss imprisonment entitled The Loneliest Man in the World

Spandau was one of only two Four Power organizations to continue to operate after the breakdown of the Allied Control Council the other being the Berlin Air Safety Center The four occupying powers of Berlin would alternate control of the prison on a monthly basis each having the responsibility for a total of three months out of the year

The prison was demolished in 1987 largely to prevent it from becoming a Neo Nazi shrine after the death of its final remaining prisoner Rudolf Hess who had been the prisons sole occupant after the release of Speer and von Schirach in 1966 The site was made into a car park and a NAAFI shopping centre named The Britannia Centre Spandau and nicknamed Hesscos after a British supermarket chain called TESCO All materials from the demolished prison were ground to powder and dumped in the North Sea or buried at the former RAF Gatow

In 2006 a Kaisers Supermarket ALDI and a Media Markt consumer electronics store occupied the former prison grounds In late 2008 Media Markt left the main shopping complex

The prison initially designed for a population in the hundreds was an old brick building surrounded by one wall 15 feet high another of 30 feet a 10 foot high wall topped with electrified wire followed by a wall of barbed wire In addition some of the sixty soldiers on guard duty manned nine machine gun armed guards towers twenty four hours a day Due to the number of cells available an empty cell was left between the prisoners cells to avoid the possibility of prisoners communicating in Morse Code Other remaining cells in the wing were designated for other purposes with one being used for the prison library and another for a chapel The cells were approximately 3 metres long by 27 metres wide and 4 metres high

The highlight of the prison from the inmates point of view was the garden The garden space was first divided into small personal plots that were used by each prisoner in many ways usually for the growing of vegetables Dnitz favored growing beans Funk tomatoes and Speer flowers although the Soviet director subsequently banned flowers for a time By regulation all of the produce was to be put toward use in the prison kitchen but prisoners and guards alike often skirted this rule and indulged in the gardens offerings As prison regulations slackened and as prisoners became either apathetic or too ill to maintain their plots the garden was consolidated into one large workable area This suited the former architect Speer who being one of the youngest and liveliest of the inmates later took up the task of refashioning the entire plot of land into a large complex garden complete with paths rock gardens and flower displays On days without access to the garden for instance when it was raining the prisoners occupied their time making envelopes together in the main corridor

The Allied powers originally took over the prison in November 1946 expecting it to accommodate a hundred or more war criminals Besides the sixty or so soldiers on duty in or around the prison at any given time there were teams of professional civilian warders from each of the four countries four prison directors and their deputies four army medical officers cooks translators waiters porters and others This was thought to be the wrong way to use the money and resources and became a serious point of contention among the prison directors politicians from their respective countries The West Berlin government was especially unhappy at the arrangements because it cost them a lot of money but they still had a lack of space in their own prison system 

Every part of life in the prison was strictly set out by a set of rules designed before the prisoners arrival by the Four Powers France Britain the Soviet Union and the United States Compared with other established prison regulations at the time Spandaus rules were quite strict

The prisoners outgoing letters to families were at first limited to one page every month

A lot of the stricter regulations were either later relaxed or deliberately ignored by prison staff The directors and guards of the Western powers often complained about many of the stricter measures The complaints were often vetoed by the Soviet Union because it thought the rules should be stricter The Soviet Union suffered 19 million civilian deaths during the war and wanted the death penalty for all of the prisoners at the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg Western commentators accused the Russians of keeping Spandau prison in operation chiefly as a centre for Soviet spying as they had an excuse to drive into western Berlin and the soldiers often looked out over the city instead of into the prison grounds

Every day prisoners had to wake up at 0600 hours wash clean their cells and the corridor together eat breakfast They then stayed in the garden until lunch time at noon after lunch they rested in their cells then returned to the garden Supper followed at 1700 hours after which the prisoners were returned to their cells Lights out was at 2200 hours Prisoners were given a shave and a haircut if necessary every Monday Wednesday and Friday they did their own laundry every Monday This routine except the time allowed in the garden changed very little throughout the years although each of the controlling nations made their own interpretation of the prison regulations

All prisoners feared the months when the Soviets were in control the Russians were much stricter in enforcing prison regulations and offered poorer quality meals Each nation in charge would bring its own cook and in the American French and British months feed the prisoners better than regulations allowed The Soviets would offer an unchanging diet of coffee bread soup and potatoes This rigidity was primarily due to the much loathed Soviet director who perpetually enforced these measures and whom Russian and Western guards alike feared and despised Until this directors sudden removal in the early 1960s the Soviet month was dreaded Afterwards matters including diet were improved

A conglomerate is a rock consisting of individual clasts within a finer grained matrix that have become cemented together 

Conglomerates are sedimentary rocks consisting of rounded fragments and are thus differentiated from breccias which consist of angular clasts Both conglomerates and breccias have clasts larger than sand

Philip of Spain was Duke of Parma from 1748 to 1765 He founded the Parma line of the House of Bourbon He was a son in law of Louis XV 

Born at the Royal Alcazar in Madrid he was the fourth child and third son of Philip V of Spain and his wife Elisabeth Farnese He was raised in Madrid and as a child showed more interest in art than in politics He was created Count of Chinchn which he later ceded to his brother Louis in 1754

His mother was the last of the Farnese rulers the Duchy of Parma The Duchy had been ruled between 1731 and 1736 by his elder brother Charles I but exchanged with Austria for The Two Sicilies after the War of Polish Succession Twelve years later in the Treaty of Aix la Chapelle Austria lost Parma and Philip became the new Duke founding the Bourbons of Parma

As part of the Treaty of Versailles between Austria and France it was intended that Philip would become King of the Southern Netherlands in a deal that would see French troops occupy key positions in the country however this arrangement was repudiated by the subsequent Third Treaty of Versailles and Philip continued in Parma

Parma was ruined by many years of warfare and in 1759 Philip named the abled Frenchmen Guillaume du Tillot as his minister to restore the economy He stimulated education and philosophy attracting personalities like tienne Bonnot de Condillac

Philip died unexpectedly on 18 July 1765 in Alessandria Italy after having accompanied his daughter Maria Luisa on her way to Genoa where she sailed for Spain to marry Infante Charles Through Philips daughter Maria Luisa he is an ancestor of the Bourbons of Spain the Bourbons of the Two Sicilies and the House of Orlans

Philip married Louise lisabeth of France in Alcal de Henares Spain on 25 October 1739 She was the eldest daughter of Louis XV They had three children The marriage was the first between the French and Spanish Bourbons the other taking place in 1745 between Louis Dauphin of France and Maria Teresa Rafaela of Spain

Creative destruction is a term that came from Marxism It talks about how wealth is gathered and lost under capitalism The term was first used in Werner Sombarts Krieg und Kapitalismus These ideas were first discussed in books The Communist Manifesto in Grundrisse Volume IV of Das Kapital

Creative destruction is supposed to describe a theory of how the destruction of economic order leads to capitalistic economic ideals A German Marxist sociologist is credited for using it first in his 1913 book Krieg und Kapitalismus which means War and Capitalism in English The works and publications of Marxists such as Karl Marx himself and Friedrich Engels a socialist scientist discuss the ideas of creative destruction

In and after the 1950s the term became associated with Austrian American economist Joseph Schumpeter Schumpeter is credited for making the theory popular However his idea of creative destruction was quite different from Marxs original theory The term gained popularity within neoliberal or free market economics where it is used to described processes such as downsizing The original Marxist usage has however been maintained in the work of influential social scientists such as David Harvey Marshall Berman and Manuel Castells

The Society of the Muslim Brothers often called the Muslim Brotherhood or The Brotherhood is an Islamist movement Today it exists in many states and often is one of the largest political opposition groups The group is the worlds oldest and largest Islamic political group and the worlds most influential Islamist movement Hassan al Banna founded the group in Egypt in 1928 

The Brotherhoods stated goal is to instill the Quran and Sunnah as the sole reference point for ordering the life of the Muslim family individual community and state Since it was created in 1928 the movement has officially opposed violent means to achieve its goals with some exceptions such as in the Israeli Palestinian conflict or to overthrow secular Baathist rule in Syria This position has been questioned particularly by the Egyptian government which accused the group of a campaign of killings in Egypt after World War II

The Muslim Brotherhood is banned in Egypt People have been arrested because they participated in the group To circumvent this ban supporters of the group often run for office as independent candidates

Outside Egypt the groups political activity is more traditional and conservative Inside Egypt the group is modernist and wants reforms to happen In Kuwaitfor example the Muslim Brotherhood says that women should not have a right to vote in elections The Brotherhood condemned terrorism and the 911 attacks Whether the group has ties to terrorist organisations is disputed 

The question whether and how to use violence has also led to disputes inside the movement At times those in favour of using violence split from the main group and created their own groups Examples of such groups are Al Gamaa al Islamiyya and Al Takfir Wal Hijra

Among the Brotherhoods more influential members was Sayyid Qutb Qutb was the author of one of Islamisms most important books Milestones The book called for the restoration of Islam by re establishing the Sharia and by using physical power and Jihad for abolishing the organizations and authorities of the Jahili system Qutb believed these included the entire Muslim world The book also reveals that Qutb no longer held the Brotherhoods ideas and that he was closer to the ideas of Hizb ut Tahrir which is concluded in the introduction and dedication of the book   While studying at university Osama bin Laden claimed to have been influenced by the religious and political ideas of several professors with strong ties to the Muslim Brotherhood including both Sayyid Qutb and his brother Muhammad Qutb However once Al Qaeda was fully organized they denounced the Muslim Brotherhoods reform through nonviolence and accused them of betraying the cause of Islam and abandoning their jihad in favour of forming political parties and supporting modern state institutions

The Brotherhood is financed by contributions from its members who are required to allocate a part of their income to the movement Some of these contributions are from members who live in oil rich countries

Egyptian Islamic Jihad originally called al Jihad is an Egyptian terrorist group based on an extreme interpretation of Islam It has been active since the late 1970s It is under worldwide embargo by the United Nations as a group linked to al Qaeda It is also banned by several governments around the world including that of the Russian Federation 

Since 1991 it has been led by Ayman al Zawahiri who is now the deputy leader of al Qaeda According to Zawahiri the EIJ was different from the Takfir wal Hijra group as we do not consider people infidels because of their sins And we are different from the Muslim Brotherhood because sometimes they do not oppose the government

The organizations original main goal was to overthrow the Egyptian government and replace it with an Islamic state based on the way it thought Islam should be Later it broadened its aims to include attacking the United States and Israel and other interests in Egypt and abroad

Islamic Jihad was responsible for the assassination of Anwar Sadat in 1981 Sadats Sinai treaty with Israel which recognized the Jewish state made them very angry

In June 2001 Al Qaeda and Egyptian Islamic Jihad which had been associated with each other for many years merged into Qaeda al Jihad

Joseph Henry Hall nicknamed Bad Joe Hall was a professional ice hockey defenceman who played professionally from 1904 until 1919 when he died as a result of the influenza epidemic He won the Stanley Cup twice with the Quebec Bulldogs and once with the Kenora Thistles

Confuciusornis is a genus of primitive crow sized birds from the Lower Cretaceous It was found in the Yixian and Jiufotang Formations of China dating from 125 to 120 million years ago The bird was named after the Chinese moral philosopher Confucius

Like modern birds Confuciusornis had a toothless beak but close relatives of modern birds such as Hesperornis and Ichthyornis were toothed This shows that the loss of teeth occurred more than once in Confuciusornis and in ancestors of modern birds This is an example of convergent evolution

Confuciusornis is the oldest known bird to have a beak It is also the first known bird to have lost the long tail of Archaeopteryx and develop fused tail vertebrae

Confuciusornis is one of the most abundant vertebrates found in the Yixian Formation and several hundred complete articulated specimens have been found

The proportions of the toes suggest that they were used for both walking and perching while the large claws of the thumb and third finger were probably used for climbing The head probably had a small crest or tuft

The orientation of the shoulder joint was sideways instead of angled upward as in modern birds this means that Confuciusornis was unable to lift its wings above its back Like Archaeopteryx it was thus incapable of the upstroke required for flapping flight This conclusion is not established at present Peters sees Confuciusornis as capable of flapping flight but specialising in soaring flight The birds weight has also been debated 

An argument from Gregory Paul noted that Confuciusornis is commonly found as large groups in lake bottom sediments with little to no evidence of the bodies being moved after death It would be highly unusual for gliding animals to be found in such large numbers in deep water Rather this evidence suggests that Confuciusornis traveled in large flocks over the lake surfaces a habitat consistent with a flying animal

In early 2010 a group of scientists led by Zhang Fucheng examined fossils with preserved melanosomes By studying the fossils with an electron microscope they found melanosomes preserved in a fossil Confuciusornis specimen The melanosomes where of two types which indicates that Confuciusornis had hues of grey redbrown and black possibly something like the modern zebra finch

A banyan is a kind of fig It begins to grow on another plant

Its seeds germinate in the cracks and crevices on a host tree or on structures like buildings and bridges 

Banyan often means the Indian Banyan or Ficus benghalensis the National tree of India The term actually includes all figs which share their epiphytic life cycle They are put in the subgenus Urostigma The seeds of banyans are dispersed by fruit eating birds The seeds germinate and send down roots towards the ground These roots may envelop part of the host tree or building structure when they get the casual name of strangler fig 

A number of tropical forest species grow by strangling A good example is the genus Ficus that competes for light Any Ficus species showing this habit may be termed a strangler fig

The leaves of Banyan tree are large leathery glossy green and elliptical in shape Like most of the fig trees the leaf bud is covered by two large scales As the leaf develops the scales fall Young leaves have an attractive reddish tinge

Older banyan trees have aerial prop roots that grow into thick woody trunks which with age can become indistinguishable from the main trunk Old trees can spread out laterally using these prop roots to cover a wide area

Like other Fig species banyans have unique fruit structures and are dependent on fig wasps for reproduction

Once the roots get to the ground they suck up nutrients and grow faster and thicker They cover the trunk of the host tree and their leaves and branches in the canopy block the light from the host Lacking enough nutrition and light the host tree eventually dies Its wood is destroyed by beetles termites and fungi Only the hollow space inside the banyan remains The banyan roots make a huge cylinder and it stands up perfectly well 

Often the banyan tree is formed from several different fruits which germinated on the same host tree This has been proved by genetic analysisp170

They became one of the Electors of the Holy Roman Emperor Kings of Prussia in 1702 and in 1871 German Emperors 

They stopped ruling after World War One when Germany became a republic Prussia was abolished by the 4 allied powers controlling Germany in 1947

The Royal Family took their name from their ancestral home Hohenzollern Castle in what is now Baden Wrttemberg The area around the castle was once ruled as a separate principality

A Family History Site

Hohenzollern may refer to 

Hohenzollern Hechingen was a county and principality in southwestern Germany part of what is now Baden Wrttemberg Its rulers were members of a branch of the senior Swabian branch of the Hohenzollern family

The County of Hohenzollern Hechingen was created in 1576 when the County of Hohenzollern was divided The county was ruled as a part of the Holy Roman Empire When the last count of Hohenzollern Charles I of Hohenzollern died the territory was to be divided up between his three sons

Unlike the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg and Prussia the Hohenzollerns of southwest Germany remained Roman Catholic The County was raised to a principality in 1623

The principality joined the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806 and was a member state of the German Confederation between 1815 and 1850 The democratic Revolution of 1848 was relatively successful in Hohenzollern and on 16 May 1848 the Prince was forced to accept the constitution limiting his power However the conflict between monarch and democrats continued and on 6 August Hohenzollern was occupied by Prussian forces On 7 December 1849 Prince Friedrich Wilhelm Konstantin sold the country to his relative King Frederick William IV of Prussia On 12 March 1850 Hohenzollern Hechingen officially became part of Prussia Hohenzollern Hechingen and Hohenzollern Sigmaringen which also became part of Prussia in 1850 were called the Hohenzollernsche Lande Hohenzollern Lands

 Christoph Ahlhaus is a German politician He is a member of the German Christian Democratic Union From 25 August 2010 to 7 March 2011 he was the First Mayor of Hamburg

Ahlhaus was born on 28 August 1969 He is married and studied law at the universities of Heidelberg Munich and Berlin

From 7 May 2008 to 24 August 2010 Ahlhaus was state minister of the Interior in Hamburg

The government of Hamburg is divided into executive legislative and judicial branches

There are two levels of government 

As a federal state the city wide administration has much more responsibility and scope than in ordinary cities

The head of the city wide and state administration is the First Mayor A ministry is called Behrde and a state minister is a Senator in Hamburg 

The legislature is the state parliament called Hamburgische Brgerschaft

The judicial branch is composed of the state supreme court and other courts 

The seat of the government is Hamburg Rathaus

There is a clear separation of powers

The power to create amend and ratify laws is given to the parliament A plebiscite and a referendum is possible due to the Constitution of Hamburg In other German states the parliament is called Landtag

The parliament is among other things responsible for the law the election of the Erster Brgermeister for the election period and the control of the Senate The parliament is a unicameral parliament and the 121 deputies are elected in universal direct free equal and secret elections every four years

The executive is the Senat der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg Its purpose is to enforce the laws The senate is responsible for the day to day management and head of this branch is the First Mayor The senate represents Hamburg to the federal government and other states or countries

The Senat der Freien und Hansestadt Hamburg is formed by the First Mayor of Hamburg the Minister President and mayor of Hamburg His deputy is the Second Mayor The senate is permitted no more than 12 members by law This law also regulates among other pay pensions privilege to refuse to give evidence and the legal position of Hamburg judges The senators get appointed by the First Mayor and thereafter they need to get confirmed by the Hamburg Parliament The First Mayor forms the ministries according to the coalition agreement of the ruling parties

Until 1860 the government of Hamburg was called Rath or Rat the members had been Ratsherrn and Brgermeister After a change of the Constitution of Hamburg in 1861 the government was called Hamburger Senat

Prior to the first world war the two mayors were elected for one year terms Until 1997 the First Mayor was Primus inter pares among his colleagues in the Senate by whom he was elected Since then he has been elected by the parliament and been able appoint and to dismiss other Senators

Interpreting the law is task of the Hamburgisches Verfassungsgericht and 17 more courts of Hamburg

The supreme court has a president and 8 judges The City Parliament elects the judges for 6 years and they only canget reelected once The schedule of responsibilities is based on the constitution of Hamburg and the Gesetzes ber das Hamburgische Verfassungsgericht

The professional judges of the other courts are appointed by the senate according to a nomination of a committee

In 2011 there are nine senators holding ministerial positions and the head of state the First mayor A senator is the presiding minister for a Behrde

The State Chancellery coordinates the senate and supports the mayor The First Mayor is head in this agency In 2011 the First Mayor of Hamburg is Olaf Scholz

The ministry is responsible for the school system in Hamburg

Among others the Behrde fr Inneres is the oversight authority for the law enforcement agencies in Hamburg the fire brigade for disaster control and its units the residents registration offices the State Election Office and the Scientology Task Force In 2011 Michael Neumann is the Minister of the Interior

In 2011 head of the Ministry of Finance is Peter Tschenscher

In 2011 Frank Horch is head of the minitry

The ministry is in charge of the correctional facilities the courts and the revision of the laws In 2011 Jana Schiedek is the Minister of Justice of Hamburg 

On May 7 2008 the former Ministry of Culture was changed to the Ministry of Culture Sports and Media now among other responsible for tourism the public record office of Hamburg the office of the protection of historical monuments and the memorial site for the Neuengamme concentration camp In 2005 the annual budget was 2127 million

Since law enforcement and police duties are partly in the responsibility of the German states Hamburg has its own police force This forces consists of the state police Polizei Hamburg the State Criminal Police Office the Criminal Investigation Services the Water Police controlling traffic in the port of Hamburg the Reserve Police the Special Weapons and Tactics Unit and Mobile Surveillance Units 

The State Office for the Protection of the Constitution is Hamburgs domestic intelligence agency 

The Ministry of the Interior has the legal and technical oversight for the law enforcement agencies

Elections for the state parliament of Hamburg are held every four years combined with the elections of the diet of the boroughs The elections are regulated by law

Main political parties in Hamburg are the Christian Democratic Union the Social Democratic Party Alliance 90The Greens The Left and as of 2008 not in the state parliament the Free Democratic Party

The STATT party is a minor political party which was founded in 1993 The party was elected to the Hamburg Parliament in the Hamburg state election 1993 The governing SPD and the new STATT party formed a coalition to rule until 1997 when the party lost all seats

A defunct party is Law and Order Offensive Party The party was in the Hamburg Parliament from 2001 until 2004 receiving 194 of votes

The Golden Book consists of the signatures of especially honoured guests of Hamburg The book itself is a box with not fixed sheets It is folded in golden leather and a gift of the family of the First Mayor Carl Friedrich Petersen In 1937 the German leader Adolf Hitler signed the book before giving a public speech in Hamburg During the denazification Hitlers sheet as these from other Nazis was removed from the book The only signature remained is from Joseph Goebbels because he wrote on the same sheet as the former German President Paul von Hindenburg The Dalai Lama signed the Golden Book during his 5th visit in Hamburg in February 2007

During World War I the Hanseatic Cross was a decoration of the three Hanseatic Cities of Bremen Hamburg and Lbeck who were member states of the German Empire Each city state established its own version of the cross but the design and award criteria were similar for each There were approximately 50000 awards of the Hanseatic Cross of Hamburg

In 2007 the Herbert Weichmann medallion named for the First Mayor Herbert Weichmann was granted for the first time by the city of Hamburg honoring those  both Jewish and non Jewish  who have contributed to Jewish life in Germany First recipients were Paul Spiegel who was a member of the executive committee of the Zentralrat der Juden and Hinrich Reemtsma whose foundation constributed 500000 for the removal of the Jewish community centre in Hamburg

The light clock is a simple way of showing a basic feature of Special relativity A clock is designed to work by bouncing a flash of light off a distant mirror and using its return to trigger another flash of light meanwhile counting how many flashes have occurred along the way It is easy to show that people on Earth watching a spaceship fly overhead with such a clock would see it ticking relatively slowly This effect is called time dilation

Before we study the light clock consider another kind of relativity Imagine that someone is dribbling a basketball in the hold of a large cargo jet The basketball player is moving in the same direction as the jet airplane The other people in the plane see him moving a meter or two as he makes one dribble Between the time the ball bounces the first time and the ball bounces the second time about one second has passed But when the first bounce occurred the basketball was over Gibraltar and when the second bounce occurred the basketball was over the coast of Spain So the basketball has moved 28 km with respect to Earth

Now consider a somewhat similar question of relative motion This time we are going to consider what people looking at stars from the North Pole see when a very fast spaceship flies over them We can use algebra and the Pythagorean theorem to calculate how much time slows on the spaceship The only other thing we need is the equation that relates distance d rate or speed of travel r and time t The equation is

d rt

The speed of light is constant so we will apply this value to two problems We will call the speed of light c as this is the letter scientists usually use to name it

A clock is made by putting a light output at the bottom of a long pole a mirror on top of the pole and an electronic light detector down at the bottom of the pole The clock is started by briefly closing a switch that sends one blink of light from the bottom of the pole to the top of the pole where it is reflected back to the bottom of the pole When the light detector at the bottom of the pole sees the blink of light it does two things It adds one to the counter that is attached to it and it fires another blink of light up to the mirror When that blink of light gets back to the bottom the count changes to two and another blink of light is set off Since light travels very rapidly for each second measured by an ordinary clock the light clock will tick a very large number of times 

To make the math easier we will say that the pole is one half kilometer long So if we are standing by the light clock that is built next to the big telescope at the North Pole we will see that light travels one kilometer for each tick of the light clock Since distance traveled d equals speed multiplied by time and the speed involved is c we have the equation

d ct

and we can solve this equation for t to learn how long in seconds each tick is

1 km 300000 kmsecond t seconds

t seconds 1 km300000 1300000 seconds  0000003333 seconds

In other words each tick of the light clock will take 0000003333 seconds

If a spaceship were flying on a straight line passing over the North Pole at a large fraction of the speed of light and it had a similar clock people watching its passage would see that the mirror on top of the pole had moved from directly over the emitting light so the light would travel along the line marked h in the diagram and then it would follow the other hypotenuse back down to the base of the pole  which would by now have moved some distance since the spaceship is moving so fast We can figure out how much time one tick would take according to the people on Earth We know that the spaceships pole has a length of a since it is the same kind of clock as people are using at the North Pole We want to figure out t the time it takes to make one tick of the clock on the spaceship

We know that the spaceship will travel 12 r t while the blink of light is heading up toward the mirror and another 12 r t while the blink of light is heading down toward the base of the pole So that calculation gives us the length of line b in the chart We know a so we can figure out h by the Pythagorean theorem

h 

So the total distance the light travels is 2 h or d 2 

We also know that the speed of light c is constant No matter who measures it it turns out to be the same speed So we can use that fact to get another way of calculating how long it takes for the flash of light to go from the base to the top of the pole and back again

t  dc

In other words d c t 

So we can write

c t  2 

or

12 c t  

To solve the above equation we will need to

Solving the above equation we find that

t  2ac

The time between ticks on the clock at the North Pole is 2ac so we can then write

t  t

If t 1 second then if the spaceship is traveling at one half the speed of light t  11547 sec

Karmacoma is a song by trip hop band Massive Attack It was released in 1995

Luminiferous aether is something once believed to fill the Universe and explain how the transmission of waves of light can happen People believed that light was a kind of wave Waves travel over the surface of water in a pond through the air in a room etc All waves that people had studied before had traveled through something Sound waves traveled faster through steel than through air So people imagined that light had to travel through something too Since light travels faster than anything else light should travel through something more rigid than anything else But at the same time this substance would have to be entirely yielding so that it would not slow down the movements of planets and cause them to eventually fall into their suns The people coming before Albert Einstein believed this stuff to exist and they called it the Luminiferous aether 

If we were traveling on a boat moving through an ocean current then we could see changes in the rate that waves appeared to travel depending on whether we were moving with the current across the current or against the current 

People who studied the physics of this problem made experiments to try to make this question become clear The Michelson Morley Experiment showed that there was no substance through which light traveled This negative result was a great success for science It took down one untrue belief that stood in our way of true understanding It said that there is no luminiferous aether

The easiest way to see the general idea is to imagine a very fast spaceship moving at one half the speed of light from one star to another The spaceship has two light speed meters one pointing backward and one pointing forward Since the spaceship is running away from the photons given off by the yellow star and running toward the photons given off by the blue star our ordinary experience leads us to expect that we would measure the speed of the yellow photons as 150000 kilometers per second and the speed of the blue photons as 450000 kilometers per second But the truth is that both photons are measured at 300000 kmsec That result indicates that speeds do not add up the way we ordinarily expect speeds to add together

Albert Einstein made a basic change in how we understand things He said that light always moves at 300000 kmsec and we just have to accept that fact If we do then we will find that everything else makes sense If we do not accept that fact then we will have to make up explanations for all sorts of inconsistencies We do not need the hypothesis of the luminiferous aether

httpphysicsworldcomcwsarticlenews40355 A recent study is much more precise than the one by Michelson and Morley but it still shows that the speed of light is constant no matter which direction one is moving in

The Christogram IHS a monogram being a symbol of Jesus Christ in form of acronym

From Greek it is an abbreviation of the name IH

In Eastern Orthodox Church the Christogram is composed with letters X and P and I and X arranged into the cross They are the first letters of one from two words in Greek language Christ and Jesus Christ

In the Western culture there exist the compositions IHS and also IHC being the first letters of the name Jesus in Greek alphabet The abbreviation in form IHS appeared in first time on the coins of Justinian II on the turn of the 7th and 8th centuries

The order of Jesuits in other words the Society of Jesus addopted IHS as its fixed emblem  the symbol in 17th century There appeared also Latin interpretations of the abbreviation IHS among others

and also

These developped inscriptions were formed the most probably because in Middle Ages people in wrong way had read the letter E as H

According to a legend this inscription with the cross was seen by emperor Constantine the Great in his sleep before the battle against Maxentius in 312 on the Ponte Milvio

Commentators unfriendly to the Catholic Church sometimes interpret the abbreviation IHS as derived from the solar idols of the Egyptian mythology Isis Horus and Seth Nevertheless present scientific knowledge do not confirm such interpretations

Alfred Sisley was an English Impressionist landscape painter He was born and spent most of his life in France Sisley is known for his Impressionist landscapes painted en plein air that is outdoors He never went into portrait painting and unlike Renoir and Pissarro found that Impressionism fulfilled his artistic needs 

Among his most important works are a series of paintings of the River Thames mostly around Hampton Court painted in 1874 and various paintings showing places in or near Moret sur Loing

Sisley was born in Paris to rich English parents His father William Sisley was in the silk business and his mother Felicia Sell enjoyed music In 1857 at the age of 18 Sisley was sent to London to study for a career in business but he gave it up after four years and returned to Paris In 1862 he studied at the atelier of Swiss artist Marc Charles Gabriel Gleyre where he met Frdric Bazille Claude Monet and Pierre Auguste Renoir 

Together they would paint landscapes in the open rather than in the studio This helped them to capture the changing effects of sunlight This new approach resulted in paintings more colorful and more broadly painted than people were used to seeing At first Sisley and his friends had few chances to show or sell their work Their works were usually rejected by the jury of the most important art exhibition in France the annual Salon During the 1860s though Sisley was in a better position than some of his fellow artists for his father regularly gave him money 

In 1866 Sisley began a relationship with Eugnie Lesouezec They had two children son Pierre and daughter Jeanne At the time Sisley lived not far from Avenue de Clichy and the Caf Guerbois the meeting place of many Parisian painters In 1868 his paintings were accepted at the Salon but it did not bring him any financial or critical success and neither did any of the subsequent exhibitions

The Franco Prussian War which began in 1870 caused Sisleys fathers business to fail The painters only income was from the sale of his works He lived in poverty for the rest of his life as the value of his paintings only rose in value after his death Occasionally however Sisley would be helped by his patrons which allowed him among other things to make a few short trips to England The first trip was in 1874 after the first independent Impressionist exhibition The result of the trip was a series of nearly 20 paintings of the Upper Thames near Molesey Art historian Kenneth Clark said this was a perfect moment of Impressionism

Until 1880 Sisley lived and worked in the countryside west of Paris then Sisley and his family moved to a small village near Moret sur Loing This was close to the forest of Fontainebleau where the painters of the Barbizon school had worked earlier in the century Here as art historian Anne Poulet has said the gentle landscapes with their constantly changing atmosphere were perfectly attuned to his talents Unlike Monet he never sought the drama of the rampaging ocean or the brilliantly colored scenery of the Cte dAzur In 1881 Sisley made one more short trip to England 

In 1897 Sisley and his partner visited Wales and were married in Cardiff Register Office on 5 August They stayed at Penarth where he painted at least six pictures of the sea and the cliffs In mid August they moved to the Osborne Hotel on the Gower Peninsula where he painted at least eleven oil paintings in and around Rotherslade Bay They returned to France in October This was Sisleys last trip to England The National Museum of Wales in Cardiff now has two of his Welsh paintings

In 1898 he applied for French citizenship but was refused He made a second application supported by a police report He became ill before the application was accepted with Sisley remaining English till his death The painter died in Moret sur Loing at the age of 59 just a few months after the death of his wife

Sisleys first works are lost His earliest known work is Lane near a Small Town This is believed to have been painted around 1864 His first landscape paintings are sad and gloomy coloured with dark browns greens and pale blues They were often painted at Marly and Saint Cloud No one knows if Sisleys knew the paintings of J M W Turner and John Constable which he may have seen in London These artists have been suggested as an influence on his development as an Impressionist painter as well as Gustave Courbet and Jean Baptiste Camille Corot

Among the Impressionists Sisley has been overshadowed by Monet Sisleys work very similar to that of Camille Pissarro Described by art historian Robert Rosenblum as having almost a generic character an impersonal textbook idea of a perfect Impressionist painting his work strongly creates atmosphere and his skies are always very impressive His concentration on landscape subjects was the most consistent of any of the Impressionists

Among Sisleys best known works are Street in Moret and Sand Heaps and The Bridge at Moret sur Loing shown at Muse dOrsay Paris Alle des peupliers de Moret has been stolen three times from the Muse des Beaux Arts in Nice The first time was in 1978 when on loan in Marseille but it was found a few days later in the citys sewers It was stolen again in 1998 and the museums curator was convicted of the theft and jailed for five years along with two friends It was stolen again in August 2007 On 4 June 2008 the French National Police found it and three other stolen paintings inside a van in Marseille

Sometimes it is just a close bunch of flowers on a spike 

An inflorescence is the reproductive portion of a plant each plant bears its flowers in a specific pattern

The advantages of the inflorescence mode is all about reproduction compared to a single primitive flower of the Magnolia type

Hesperornis is an extinct genus of flightless aquatic birds that lived during the Upper Cretaceous

Hesperornis was an important early find in the history of avian paleontology It was discovered by the paleontologist OC Marsh in the late 19th century Bone Wars 

Famous locations for Hesperornis are the Upper Cretaceous marine limestones from Kansas and the marine shales from Canada The genus probably had a Holarctic distribution

Hesperornis was a large bird reaching up to 15 meters in length It had virtually no wings and swam with its powerful hind legs 

Like many other Mesozoic birds such as Ichthyornis Hesperornis had teeth in its beak which were used to hold prey

Hesperornis hunted in the waters of such contemporary shelf seas as the North American Inland Sea the Turgai Strait and the prehistoric North Sea which then were subtropical to tropical waters much warmer than today They probably fed mainly on fish maybe also crustaceans cephalopods and mollusks as do the diving seabirds of today Their teeth were helpful in dealing with slippery or hard shelled prey

On land Hesperornis species may or may not have been able to walk They certainly could not stand upright like penguins as in the early reconstructions Their legs attached far at the back and sideways with even the lower leg being tightly attached to the body Thus they were limited to a clumsy hobble at best on land and would have been more nimble if they moved by sliding on their belly or galumphing The leg skeleton of Hesperornis was so thoroughly adapted to diving that their mode on land and their egg laying and parental care is a matter of speculation

Young Hesperornis grew fairly quickly and continuously to adulthood as is the case in modern birds More young birds are known from the fossil record of the more northerly sites than from those further south This suggests that at least some species were migratory like todays penguins which swim polewards in the summer

Hesperornis was preyed upon by large marine carnivores such as mosasaurs A Tylosaurus specimen contains the bones of a Hesperornis in its gut area

In biology a cline or ecocline describes a series of connected populations in a species These populations show a continuous gradient of characters and genetics The term was coined by the English evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley in 1938 He defined a cline as a species whose members fall into a series of sub species with continuous change in characters over a geographical area 

Clines consist of forms of a species that show gradual phenotypic andor genetic differences over a geographical area 

The reason for these differences is that the environment is somewhat different in different parts of the range Populations become adapted to the situation in their areas but this adaptation is limited by gene flow between neighbouring sub species

Genetically clines result from the change of allele frequencies within the gene pool of the species in question

The mica group of minerals are aluminosilicates with various metals They split into fine sheets 

Mica includes several closely related materials having perfect basal cleavage 

All are monoclinic with a tendency towards pseudo hexagonal crystals and are similar in chemical composition The highly perfect cleavage which is the most prominent characteristic of mica is explained by the hexagonal sheet like arrangement of its atoms

The Charophyceae are the green algae closest to plants

Their exact rank is the matter of some debate Some botanists recommend expanding the existing plant kingdom to include charophyceans and chlorophytes 

Others classify Charophyceae as a class under division Charophyta with Chlorophyta remaining a distinct division There are also other possibilities 

The consensus among botanists is that charophyceans are the organisms most closely related to land plants 

Many of the complex traits related to sexual reproduction photosynthesis and other plant characters evolved first in charophyceans Analysis of cpDNA shows that characteristics of plant chloroplasts evolved first in the charophycean genera Staurastrum and Zygnema

Being pro active is when someone prevents something before it happens For example a government are given intelligence from an anonymous source that a terrorist attack is going to take place in a city So the government and other forces prevent the terrorist attack and arrest the terrorists

Chlorophyta are a division of green algae 

It includes about 7000 species of mostly aquatic photosynthetic eukaryote organisms 

Like the land plants green algae contain chlorophylls a and b and store food as starch in their plastids 

They are related to the Charophyceae and land plants together making up the Viridiplantae

The division contains both unicellular and multicellular species While most species live in freshwater habitats and a large number in marine habitats other species are adapted to a wide range of environments Watermelon snow or Chlamydomonas nivalis lives on summer alpine snowfields Others live attached to rocks or woody parts of trees Some lichens are symbiotic relationships between fungi and green algae 

Members of the Chlorophyta also form symbiotic relationships with protozoa sponges and cnidarians All are flagellated and so have an advantage of motility Some conduct sexual reproduction

Political views and ideas which are far from the mainstream are called extremist Such views often violate common moral standards As an example a group that wants to replace a democratic form of government with a totalitarian one is almost always considered extremist Political or religious fundamentalism as well as fanaticism can also be seen as extremist

What is seen as extremist varies by country People who support that Muslim women should wear a burqa may be seen as extremist in France but such an opinion may not be extremist in Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia

Viridiplantae are the clade which includes the green algae and land plants

In some classification systems they have been called Plantae by expanding the traditional Plant Kingdom to include the green algae 

Adl et al who produced a classification for all eukaryotes in 2005 introduced the name Chloroplastida for this group reflecting the group having primary chloroplasts with green chlorophyll They rejected the name Viridiplantae on the grounds that most of the species are not plants as understood traditionally

The monophyletic Chlorophyta and Charophyceae are classified under Viridiplantae So a simple arrangement is

Green algae is not used here because they are definitely not monophyletic It is just a convenience term

There are more than 350000 species of Viridiplantae

Mudrocks are a class of fine grained siliciclastic sedimentary rocks 

The varying types of mudrocks include siltstone claystone mudstone slate and shale 

Most of the particles are less than 00625 mm and are too small to study readily in the field At first sight the rock types look quite similar however there are important differences in composition and nomenclature 

There has been a great deal of disagreement involving the classification of mudrocks There are a few important hurdles to classification including

Mudrocks make up fifty percent of the sedimentary rocks in the geologic record and are easily the most widespread deposits on Earth 

Fine sediment is the most abundant product of erosion which is why mudrocks are so common 

With increased pressure over time the platey clay minerals may become aligned with the appearance of parallel layering This finely bedded material which splits readily into thin layers is called shale as distinct from mudstone 

From the beginning of civilization when pottery and mudbricks were made by hand to now mudrocks have been important The first book on mudrocks was not published until 1964 However scientists engineers and oil producers have understood the significance of mudrocks since the discovery of the Burgess Shale and the relatedness of mudrocks and oil 

A claystone is a mudrock which does not split easily 

In order for a rock to be a claystone it must be up to half clay whose particles measure less than 1256th of a millimeter 

There are 35 recognized clay mineral species on Earth they make muds stick together or able to flow 

Clay is by far the smallest particles recognized in mudrocks Most materials in nature are clay minerals but quartz feldspar iron oxides and carbonates can weather to sizes of a typical clay mineral

For a size comparison a clay sized particle is 11000th of a sand grain This means a clay particle will travel 1000 times further at constant water velocity thus requiring quieter conditions for settlement

The formation of clay is well understood and can come from soil volcanic ash and glaciation Ancient mudrocks are another source because they weather and disintegrate easily

A siltstone is a mudrock For a rock to be a siltstone it must be over fifty percent silt sized material 

Silt is any particle smaller than sand 116th of a millimeter and larger than clay 1256th of millimeter Silt is the product of physical weathering such as freezing and thawing Physical weathering does not involve any chemical changes in the rock just its physical breaking apart 

One of the highest proportions of silt found on Earth is in the Himalayas which get rainfall of up to five to ten meters a year Quartz and feldspar are the biggest contributors to silt Silt tends to be non cohesive non plastic but can liquefy easily

There is a simple field test to judge whether a rock is a siltstone or not and that is to put the rock to ones teeth If the rock feels gritty against ones teeth than it is a siltstone

Maria Mitchell was one of the first famous female astronomers She was born in Nantucket Massachusetts and went to private schools in her life Her love for astronomy began when her father began maintaining a small observatory The accomplishment that brought her international recognizition was when she discovered a telescopic comet in October of 1847 The year after she became the first women elected at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Afterwards she became professor of astronomy at Vassar College in 1865 and stayed there until she retired in 1888

A mudstone is a siliciclastic sedimentary rock which has a mixture of silt and clay sized particles

So a mudstone is a type of mudrock with a more varied grain size than either siltstones or claystones

Lactose intolerance is when a person cannot digest milk or milk products An enzyme called lactase is needed to break down lactose People with lactose intolerance do not have this enzyme or make only small quantities Because of this they are unable to digest lactose 

Up to 75 of people worldwide begin to lose the ability to digest lactose as they grow into adults This loss of ability ranges from 5 in northern Europe to over 71 in Sicily and to over 90 in parts of Africa and Asia There is no cure for lactose intolerance People need to change their diet to only include food with very little lactose There are many milk substitutes 

Milk is not a fermented product If is not digested then it may ferment in the small intestine which can cause a problem called pseudoallergy Amino acids are changed to other substances which may act in much the same way as histamine in a true allergy

Lactose intolerance is not the same as milk allergy which is an immune reaction to some of the proteins in milk

Normally infant mammals drink their mothers milk Then the gene which causes the body to make lactase is switched off and the young move on to adult food They can no longer digest milk

Humans are somewhat different from other mammals Some humans continue to produce lactase and some do not It is a type of genetic polymorphism

The ability to digest lactose into adulthood was useful to humans after the invention of animal husbandry People kept animals which could provide milk 

Hunter gatherer people before the Neolithic revolution were mostly lactose intolerant So are modern hunter gatherers 

A mutation on chromosome 2 stops the shutdown in lactase production This makes it possible for those with the mutation to continue drinking fresh milk throughout their lives

This appears to be a recent adaptation to dairy products It occurred in both northern Europe and east Africa in people with a historically pastoral lifestyle Lactase persistence allowing lactose digestion to continue into adulthood is a dominant allele making lactose intolerance a recessive trait 

Genetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations associated with lactase persistence have only become common in human populations in the last 10000 years Because of this lactase persistence is often given as an example of recent human evolution As lactase persistence is genetic but animal husbandry a cultural trait this is geneculture coevolution

Sterile neutrinos also known as neutral heavy leptons heavy neutrinos or right handed neutrinos are theoretical particles that are extremely difficult to find This is because they are not affected by all of fundamental forces that rule normal physics only gravity They are detected by a theory called the seesaw mechanism which says that when sterile neutrinos are near other neutrinos they increase their own mass by lowering the mass of the nearby neutrinos Detection probably comes from the fact that they are affected by gravity

A burn is an injury to a persons skin or even flesh Burns can grow to be very powerful and in some cases can even kill a person There are 6 degrees of burns 

Burns are usually minor They are usually Degree One to a minor Degree Two Others are more powerful such as Degree 3 People may get more powerful burns from high heat or radioactive items

Degree One burns are minor and can be cured at home They seldom leave scars A person can get them from hot water a minor sunburn or by touching hot metal It causes pain but only the top layer of skin is burnt and no nerves are injured 

Degree Two burns can be cured at home but some people would prefer to take them to the hospital This degree of burn goes into the second layer of skin

Degree Three burns are the most severe burns that most people can survive from Although they may be severe the chances of death are very low if treated at the hospital right away It burns through all three layers of skin leaving a scab

This degree of burn goes through the skin and destroys the nerves near it There is no pain at the 4th degree burn area but there can be immense pain occurs around the burn Very few have survived it It must be treated at the hospital ASAP if it occurs and the person is still alive

This burn degree goes all the way through the skin the nerves near it and ends at the muscle

This degree goes and destroys the core of the body It burns the skin nerves muscles and scorches the bones In other words immediate death can and will happen

Sexual reassignment surgery is a surgery for transsexuals on genitals to get the body they want through body modification

For transsexual women there is a vaginoplasty after phallectomy and orchidectomy and also breast enriching surgery

For transsexual men there is mastectomy and hysterectomy and also phalloplasty in order to make a new penis but this surgery is more difficult and dangerous than vaginoplasty for transsexual women 

International laws on human rights such as the Declaration of Montreal or the Yogyakarta Principles affirm that such sexual reassignment surgery must be provided for any transsexuals as non discriminating treatment with health insurance and also necessary care relating to the surgeries

An unconformity is a buried erosion surface separating two rock strata of different ages

It shows that sediment deposition was broken for a time 

Usually the older layer was exposed to erosion for some time before deposition of the younger However the term is used to describe any break in the sedimentary record

Many millions of years may separate the rocks above and below the discontinuity 

James Hutton found examples of unconformity in Scotland at Jedburgh in 1787 and at Siccar Point in 1788

The rocks above an unconformity are younger than the rocks beneath An unconformity represents time during which no sediments were preserved in the region 

The local record for that time interval is missing and geologists must use other clues to discover that part of the geologic history of that area The interval of geologic time not represented is called a hiatus

At the time of his career Mummery was the largest player ever in the NHA and NHL playing at 245 pounds in his NHL years and he was known to eat two steaks before hockey games Mummery appeared in three games as an NHL goaltender in an era when teams did not dress a backup netminder making him the skater to have played the most games in net He suited up as a goaltender twice with Quebec and once with Hamilton

Born in Chicago Illinois Mummery moved at an early age to Brandon Manitoba He first played senior level hockey for Brandon YMCA in 190708 He moved to Fort William Ontario to play a season with the Fort William Forts on the Northern Ontario League He returned to the prairies playing for Brandon and Moose Jaw in minor professional leagues In 1912 he joined the Quebec Bulldogs then in the National Hockey Association In his rookie season the Bulldogs the defending champions won the NHA and Stanley Cup championships He played with the Bulldogs until 1916 when he joined the Montreal Canadiens for a season The Canadiens won the NHA title but lost to the Seattle Metropolitans in the Stanley Cup championship

Before the beginning of the 191718 season the NHA was suspended and the owners formed the National Hockey League The Quebec team did not field a team that year and he was loaned to the Toronto Blueshirts club now run by the Toronto Arena Company The club would go on to win the Stanley Cup in a series against Vancouver After the season the Arena company formed the Toronto Arena Hockey Club and Mummery signed for the 191819 season Unfortunately the season was a disaster as the club had poor results weak attendance and it folded prematurely ending the season 

In 191920 a Quebec team was formed in the NHL and the NHL assigned former Bulldogs players from the NHA to the team Mummery was one of those players When the Quebec team was moved to Hamilton he was traded before the season to the Canadiens where he played for the 192021 season He was traded to Hamilton for the 1921 22 season and traded from Hamilton to Saskatoon of the West Coast Hockey League in 1922 He played four games for Saskatoon in 192223 and retired

James Hutton MD Edinburgh was a Scottish geologist physician naturalist chemist and experimental farmer 

Hutton trained in medicine but never practised it Instead he farmed his estate and did scientific research He is the founder of modern geology He saw the Earth as the product of natural forces What could be seen happening today over long periods of time could produce what we see in the rocks

His theories of geology and geologic time also called deep time came to be included in theories which were called plutonism and uniformitarianism He wrote one of the great books of the 18th century Theory of the Earth

Hutton hit on a variety of ideas to explain the rock strata he saw around him According to Playfair he was in no haste to publish his theory for he was one of those who are much more delighted with the contemplation of truth than with the praise of having discovered it 

After some 25 years of work his Theory of the Earth was read to meetings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1785 

Hutton later read an abstract of his Concerning the system of the Earth its duration and stability on 4 July 1785 which he had printed and circulated privately In it he outlined his theory as follows

It has been said that the prose of Principles of Knowledge was so difficult that it hindered his theories John Playfair in 1802 restated of Hutttons geological ideas Charles Lyell in the 1830s popularised the idea of an infinitely repeating cycle Lyell believed in gradual change and thought even Hutton gave too much credit to catastrophic changes 

Lyells books had widepread influence not least on the up and coming young geologist Charles Darwin who read them with enthusiasm during his voyage on the Beagle William Whewell coined the term uniformitarianism to describe Lyells version of the ideas This was in contrast with catastrophism the idea that the rocks recorded a series of catastrophes followed by repopulation by a new range of species Over time there was a convergence between these views but Lyells description of the development of geological ideas led to a belief that uniformitarianism had triumphed

Street art is like impressionism cubism or pop art an art movement 

A lot of poor people try to survive by asking a little money in the street They sometime do the same while making art These are the original true street artists They make music theatre temporary paintings on the ground The other ones are more likely called urban artist

A spray can is a artistic tool used by writters on the walls in cities like Philadelphie or New York in 1970 This technique is still used but remain considered more or less as vandalism One of the most important New York writter wrote SEEN on subways in New York

The artist Banksy said in december 2010 in a French newspaper called Le Monde that he has been influenced by the Street art of Paris For I him it is the mai 1968 mini revolution that started the Street art movement He also mention Stencil artist called Blek

Before Street art emerge there was another art movement called Land art It was before Internet and before the end of USSR But after the World War A couple of Land artists called Christo and Jeanne Claude started making illegal art in the street of Paris in 1962 to protest against the Berlin Wall In 1972 and 1976 they made Land art in the desert of California building a very long fence In 1985 they made a huge Land Art work in Paris They wrapped the oldest bridge of the city with polyamide fabric They had to negotiate for years to have the permission of doing it So it was official but it was controversial Another artist Richard Serra put a big wall made of steel in Chicago It was official but a lot of people hated it and it was removed after a trial The work of a steet artist like JR is ephemeral so it does not have the same problem

After the Berlin wall collapsed a man called Shepard Fairey started gluing images of a dead french wrestler called Andr the Giant in California It was a phenomenon Fairey opened a web site were he just said it was phenomenology It was so absurd people could not stop talking about it Stickers were made of the image of the dead wrestler It was considered cool by some skateboarders

Bit synchronization

Synchronization is one of the most important techniques in the digital communication systems nowadays The problem with bit synchronization is at the receiver side The receiver must be able to find the beginning and the end of coming bits Then the receiver can decide where is the middle of the symbol This is important to detect data correctly because the rise and fall edge of symbols are distorted The receiver must also generate the local synchronized clock This clock must work at the same frequency as the transmitter clock This whole process is called the bit synchronization

Synchronization is a basic problem in digital communications Synchronization depends on the initial error very much If the error rate is high the synchronization becomes unstable This means that the performance of the communication system gets worse The receiver analyzes the incoming signal and signal to noise ratio to make the bit synchronized clock

There are two basic methods to ensure the bit synchronization  the pilot frequency method and the data derived method

The pilot frequency method is based on adding an extra signal to the frequency spectrum This signal is called the pilot frequency It carries the information about the frequency of transmitted data The receiver uses the pilot frequency to make local synchronized clock This method is not used very often because it needs extra power to transmit the pilot frequency

In the data derived method the receiver gets the bit synchronized clock directly from the received signal This method has one big advantage It does not need any extra energy and any extra frequency spectrum This is why this method is used more often than the first one

Traditional bit synchronization methods have good performance if the signal to noice ratio is high The performance gets worse when the SNR becomes lower the receiver cannot work correctly In this case the special synchronization methods must be used

Earthquake performance simulation is meant to study effect of earthquakes on building structures and is a practical way of seeing a thing to happen without it actually taking place in the same way

The best way to do it is to put the structure on a shake table that simulates the seismic loads and watch what may happen next The earliest experiments like this were performed more than a century ago

Another way is to evaluate the earthquake performance analytically The very first earthquake simulations were performed by statically applying some horizontal inertia forces based on scaled peak ground accelerations to a mathematical model of a building With the further development of computational technologies statics approaches began to give way to dynamics ones

Natron is a natural mixture of sodium carbonate decahydrate and about 17 sodium bicarbonate along with small amounts of household salt and sodium sulfate Natron is white or without color when it is pure It can be gray or yellow with impurities Natron deposits are sometimes found in saline lake beds which arose in arid environments Throughout history natron has had many practical uses which are still used in the wide range of modern uses of its constituent mineral components

In modern mineralogy the word natron has come to mean only the sodium carbonate decahydrate which makes up most of the historical salt

The English word natron is a French cognate that came from the Spanish natrn through Greek nitron which came from the Ancient Egyptian word netjeri meaning natron The modern chemical symbol for sodium Na is an abbreviation of that elements New Latin name natrium which came from natron

Historical natron was harvested as a salt mixture from dry lake beds in Ancient Egypt and has been used for thousands of years as cleaning Together with oil it was an early form of soap It softens water and removes oil and grease at the same time Natron was also a cleanser for the teeth and an early mouthwash The mineral was mixed into early antiseptics for wounds and minor cuts Natron can be used to dry and preserve fish and meat It was also an ancient household insecticide was used for making leather and as a bleach for clothing

The mineral was used in Egyptian mummification because it absorbs water and was a drying agent Also when exposed to moisture the carbonate in natron increases pH which makes a good environment for bacteria In some cultures natron was thought to keep both the living and the dead spiritually safe Natron was added to castor oil to make a smokeless fuel which allowed Egyptian artisans to paint artworks inside ancient tombs without staining them with soot

Natron is an ingredient for making a color called Egyptian blue It was used with sand and lime in ceramic and glass making by the Romans and others at least until 640 CE The mineral was also used as a flux to solder precious metals together

Most of natrons uses both in the home and by industry were replaced in time with closely related sodium compounds and minerals Natrons detergent properties are now commercially supplied by soda ash the mixtures chief compound ingredient along with other chemicals Soda ash also replaced natron in glass making Some of its ancient household roles are also now filled by ordinary baking soda natrons other meaningful ingredient

Natron is also the mineralogical name for the compound sodium carbonate decahydrate which is the main component in historical natron Sodium carbonate decahydrate has a specific gravity of 142 to 147 and a Mohs hardness of 1 It crystallizes in the monoclinic domatic crystal system typically forming efflorescences and encrustations

The term hydrated sodium carbonate is commonly used to encompass the monohydrate the decahydrate and the heptahydrate but is often used in industry to refer to the decahydrate only Both the hepta and the decahydrate effloresce in dry air and are partially transformed into the monohydrate thermonatrite Na2CO3H2O

Sodium carbonate decahydrate stays the same at room temperature but it changes into the crystal material Na2CO37H2O then above convert37 38CF to sodium carbonate monohydrate Na2CO3H2O if the temperature becomes convert32CFabbron This releases a mostly clear colorless salty kind of water with a little solid thermonatrite The mineral natron is often found in association with other minerals such as gypsum and calcite Most human made sodium carbonate is soda ash sodium carbonate anhydrate Na2CO3 which is obtained by calcination of sodium bicarbonate sodium carbonate monohydrate or trona

The Perciformes is the largest order of vertebrates They have about 40 of all bony fishp151 

Perciformes means perch like They belong to the class of ray finned fish and have over 7000 species in almost all aquatic environments

They have the widest range of sizes of any order of vertebrates ranging from the 7 mm Schindleria brevipinguis to the 5 metre Makaira species They first appeared and diversified in the Upper Cretaceous

Some well known members of this group are angelfish barracuda bass blenny cichlids damselfish filefish goby grouper remora swordfish mackerel pufferfish tilefish tuna whiting and of course perch

The dorsal and anal fins are divided into front spiny and back soft rayed portions which may be partially or completely separated 

The pelvic fins usually have one spine and up to five soft rays positioned unusually far forward under the chin or under the belly Scales are usually ctenoid 

They are grouped as in the text Fishes of the World The order is probably polyphyletic and changes may occur in this and other teleost orders

Recent morphological and DNA sequence analysis has shown that several of the higher level groupings of teleosts are evolutionary grades rather than clades Examples of demonstrably paraphyletic groups include the Perciformes

Negative film is the name for a photographic film that will give images which have their colors inverted after development This inversion means that the complementary color is used A second process is used to obtain any number of photos which can also be in different sizes The other kind of film is called reversal film where development results in exactly one positive image 

Negative films that use colors have multiple layers Each layer is sensitive to a different wavelength of light  

Most amateur films in use today are negative films 

The benefits of this kind of film is that it is very tolerant to exposure differences without noticeable loss in quality Another benefit is that getting the film developed is very easy

Air navigation is special kind of general navigation It is used by pilots in aircraft to know their exact position That is very important Because if they get lost they can for example fly into some dangerous area or hit the mountain There are generally two types of air navigation depending on weather When there is a good weather outside pilots navigate themselves visually with map But when the weather is bad and they do not see the ground they use the special radio navigational instruments radar or the air traffic controller navigates them First kind of navigation is called VFR navigation The second is IFR navigation Also we cannot forget the effect of wind on the aircraft in the air 

When the pilot flies VFR flight he uses his map compass and he looks on the ground During the preparation for a flight he chooses big visible points on the map for example large cities lakes hills rivers roads or forests Then when he is in the air he seeks the chosen points to make sure he is on a good way The weather must be good enough to let the pilot see the ground He also cannot fly into clouds because he can get lost Pilots also have to look for the other aircraft It is their responsibility to make sure they do not get too close to other aircraft

During IFR flight pilots cannot fly wherever they want They have to fly only on specified routes Also the aircraft must have many special devices working with radio waves GPS or radar The air routes lead mostly from radio beacon to beacon Pilot must set the correct frequency of the beacon and fly to it GPS helps to find exact position of airplane Each aircraft have special code that is indicated on air traffic controllers radar screen Because pilot does not see outside he has to do what the controller says And the controller makes sure that the aircraft does not crash 

The wind is a great problem in navigation Imagine that pilot sets the plane to fly eastwards If the wind blows from the north it will blow the plane to the south And the aircraft will fly to south east So to fly exactly to the east pilot must set the plane to north east This was just an example In reality wind can blow from any direction and at any speed So pilots must also watch the wind and know how to compensate the effect of the wind on the aircraft

Feria Del Sol or Carnaval Taurino de America is an international cultural festival held in the city of Mrida every February of the year The Feria festival is held alongside the carnival feast The festival includes bull competitions cultural expositions commercial and zootechnic expositions concerts parades sports and a voting competition for La Reina Del Sol

In the city of Mrida celebrates a more ancient interest of Venezuela but in the City of the Knight which did not celebrate fairs similar to the cities of San Cristbal Barquisimeto Maracaibo Triba Therefore a group of amateurs had the idea to build a Plaza de Toros so that Mrida had a taurine calendar and was added to the most important fairs of the country which already had a peak imponente in all the national territories At the beginning the fairs who was set up the first days of December had the function of celebrate the day of the Immaculate Conception therefore the people set the date of the fairs on 9 December and 10 December For the bullfighting Csar Faraco Manuel Bentez El Cordobs Francisco Rivera Paquirri Julio Aparicio Curro Girn Paco Camino and the mounted bullfighter Juan Caedo who is of Mexican origin and fought bulls of Flix Rodrguez Achury Vejo and Ambal who all originated in the country of Colombia

For the first run heavy rainfall prevented the inauguration which resulted in two runs which had to be held on the second day one in the morning hours and the other during the afternoon which was the first time this had happened in a same square in the same day in Venezuela Previously in Caracas which celebrated two runs in the same day but in two different squares in the Circo Metropolitano and the Nuevo Circo but in the same square during the same day which also was the first time that this had happened

In 1968 the fair was not celebrated but a bullfighting occurred on 13 April 1968 in coincidence of the Holy Saturday Was fought a stupendous closing of Dosgutirrez and acted Alfredo Leal Curro Girn and Pepe Cceres Then decided celebrate the fairs so that they coincided with the carnivals under the name of Feria del Sol and like this was as in 1969 celebrated the first fair with three run of bulls the days 15 16 and 17 February of said year The first poster was composed by bulls of Valparaso for Alfredo Leal Daniel Matatoba Santiago Manuel Bentez El Cordobs and the Venezuelan Lucio Requena The first ear of the fair was for Alfredo Leal

At the end the fair has transformed into one of the most important fairs of Venezuela and also the taurine world Regarding the fair of the Immaculate which has celebrated in these years 1990 1991 and 1997 but with very little acceptance

An extratropical cyclone is a weather system of low pressure It is a huge whirling wind which turns anticlockwise in the Northern Hemisphere The shape is circular or oval The usual size in diameter is about 1000 km They originate in latitudes 30 60 from the equator We can call also them mid latitude cyclones

These cyclones are usually connected with fronts A front is a system of changes in weather It is caused by a very cold air mass meeting a very hot air mass In the cyclone there is a system of warm and cold front 

The closer we come to the centre of a cyclone the cloudier it is There is also a very high chance of precipitation The wind is strong and changes its direction as the warm front passes The weather is stable and fog is usual As the cold front passes there is a change of wind the temperature decreases and rain is also common 

Cyclonal defects usually occur in series We call them the families of the cyclones Usually there is a belt of 3 or 4 cyclones in different stages The cyclone has several stages of evolution First there is a stage of the origin of a cyclone Second stage means that the cyclone is strengthening At that moment both the warm and cold front are very large The system is moving very fast The cold front is generally faster which means that it runs down the warm one This causes an occluded front The weather is similar to both types of fronts The third stage ends with filling of the area with air The pressure rises Stage four means that the signs of cyclonal weather disappear

Grameen Foundation Australia is a 501 non profit organization based in Sydney create to support the poverty alleviation work and mission of the Grameen Bank Grameen Trust and their affiliate organisations by giving access to the poorest people to microfinance and as a result of access to these services move themselves out of poverty 

The poor themselves can create a poverty free world all we have to do is to free them from the chains that we have put around them Muhammad Yunus

Grameen Foundation Australia takes its inspiration from the poverty alleviation work done by Professor Muhammad Yunus and his colleagues at Grameen Bank in Bangladesh

In 2006 Prof Yunus and Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel peace prize for their efforts to create economic and social development from below According to the Norwegian Nobel Committee Every single individual on earth has both the potential and the right to live a decent life Across cultures and civilizations Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that even the poorest of the poor can work to bring about their own development

GFAs predecessor in Australia the Grameen Bank Support Group was started by 10 co founders in Sydney in 1994 The purpose of this group was to promote the work and vision of Grameen Bank amongst the Australian public media and policy makers 

Between 1994 and 1998 the Support Group engaged with the Grameen Bank in a number of ways The most fruitful instances of this engagement were

During Prof Yunus visit to Sydney in 1998 to receive the Sydney Peace Prize he met with members of the Grameen Bank Support Group and their pro bono lawyer David Ford and gave detailed guidance on setting up GFA Whilst there are no formal protocols in place for a country to establish a Grameen Foundation this personal imprimatur from Prof Yunus became the mandate underpinning the existence of GFA In 1999 the Grameen Bank Support Group was disbanded in Australia and replaced by the newly incorporated GFA

In the first 5 years of GFAs existence GFA carried out AusAID projects in East Timor Nepal Vietnam the Philippines and Bangladesh In the last few years GFA has been heavily involved in poverty alleviation in the Philippines

In 1994 a similar foundation Grameen Foundation USA was started in the United States by Alex Counts 

NB It is important to recognize that there are no formal relationships between the various members of the Grameen Family namely Grameen Bank and Grameen Trust in Bangladesh GFA in Australia and GFUSA in the United States  However there is a strong informal association between these organizations They draw upon each others expertise when required and they are all inspired by Prof Yunus philosophy of alleviating poverty through driving scalable efficiencies in service delivery to the poor and supporting the skills and entrepreneurship of the poor

The mission of GFA is to see poor people especially the poorest and those living in harder to reach areas to extract themselves from poverty trough micro finance and lead lives of respect dignity and opportunity for the long term GFA works for empowerment of targeted populations not dependence

Rather than provides funds and technical assistance to local and regional microfinance organizations directly administering microfinance programs GFA directly administers microfinance programs The Current GFA Projects are 1Poverty alleviation in Northern Samar the Philippines 2Poverty alleviation in the Manila Slums 3Scoping work in the State of Andhra Pradesh in India  4Scoping work in East Timor 

Every action made by GFA follows the core principles that the foundation impose to herself and which are A holistic approach to assisting development in a targeted region Effective use of partnerships which can bring particular skills resources and local knowledge to help maximise project outcomes Hard work efficiency innovation cost effectiveness Honesty transparency accountability Constant improvement in the way that we operate Maximizing the organizations leverage at all times so that we can have the maximum substantive effect on helping poor people in poor developing countries Empowerment of targeted populations not welfare and dependence Remain secular and respectful to others values and beliefs

Liquid scintillation counting

Liquid scintillation counting is an analytical technique It is used to measure radiation from beta  emitting nuclides It can also detect the auger electrons emitted from Chromium 51 and Iodine 125 samples Samples of nuclides are dissolved or suspended in a cocktail The cocktail is containing an aromatic solvent and small amounts of other additives known as fluors Beta particles emitted from the sample transfer energy to the solvent molecules The molecules in turn transfer their energy to the fluors The excited fluor molecules dissipate the energy by emitting light Scintillation cocktails often contain additives that shift the wavelength of the emitted light It makes it more easily detected 

The samples are placed in small transparent vials They are loaded into a liquid scintillation counter The counter has two photomultiplier tubes They are connected in a coincidence circuit The coincidence circuit assures that genuine light pulses are counted Counting efficiencies under ideal conditions is about 30 for tritium Tritium is a low energy beta emitter It is nearly 100 for phosphorus 32 Phosporus is a high energy beta emitter Some chemical compounds and highly colored samples can interfere with the counting process This interference is known as quenching It can be overcome through data correction or through careful sample preparation 32P can also be counted in a scintillation counter without the cocktail This technique is known as Cherenkov counting It relies on the Cherenkov radiation being detected directly by the photomultiplier tubes Cherenkov counting in this experimental context is normally used for quick rough measurements

Edmund talks cruely to Lucy when she first finds the entrance to Narnia through a wardrobe and is the second of the Pevensie children to go to Narnia after following Lucy so he could tease her While there he meets Jadis the White Witch and he gets to eat some magical Turkish delight which causes an addiction in the person who eats it After that he promises the White Witch that he will bring his brother and sisters to her castle not knowing that she was intending to kill them all to prove a Narnian prophecy Lucy did mention the White Witch in a conversation and Edmund realizes that the witch was none other than the Queen of Narnia but the magic of the Turkish Delight was so strong that he decided to go to the castle for more

When Edmund returns to the normal world he refuses having been in Narnia not wanting to admit that Lucy was speaking the truth

When the four of the Pevensie children later go through the wardrobe he says that he has been in Narnia before He and the other siblings are protected by Mr and Mrs Beaver But when the Beavers and the other three Pevensie children are having a conversation about the arrival of Aslan Edmund sneaks away to the White Witchs castle where he hopes to be made a prince and later on a king

However his thoughts of the Witch changes when she berates him for coming without his siblings and even more so when on their journey to the Stone Table they find a small group of creatures enjoying a feast made by Father Christmas When the creatures continue to say that Father Christmas is their benefactor and has entered Narnia a sign that her power is weakening she turns them to stone

Edmund now finds to his horror that the White Witch was evil and would give anything to be with his brother and sisters The White Witchs sledge eventually stops as the snow melts so they have to continue their journey on foot They stop in a wooded valley where the Witch prepares to kill Edmund on account of his betraying her She ties Edmund to a tree and takes out a dagger but a rescue party sent by Aslan arrives frees him and brings him to his siblings and the rest of Aslans troop Edmund becomes fully sorry after a long talk with Aslan who afterward commands the Pevensies to agree the matter of their brothers misdeeds forgotten The next day the Witch claims that Edmunds life is hers She and Aslan work out an agreement that Aslan will die in Edmunds place but unknown to her the magical nature of this agreement allows Aslan to be brought back to life Susan and Lucy witnessed Aslans resurrection

While Aslan and Lucy and Susan race to free the stone prisoners in the Witchs castle Edmund joins Peters army in the battle where he plays a role in breaking the White Witchs dangerous wand and is wounded in the attempt Then the Witchs army outnumbered very quickly and she is soon killed by Aslan while the leftover of the enemies either give themselves up or take to flight

However Edmund is saved from death by the arrival of Aslan and of Lucy who gives Edmund a few dropse of a magic cordial which can quickly heal any sickness

Eventually Edmund heals is crowned to the Great Western Wood by Aslan as King Edmund the Just co ruler of Narnia with Queen Lucy Queen Susan and High King Peter and is knighted as Duke of Lantern Waste Count of the Western March and Knight of the Noble Order of the Table

15 years later he and his siblings return to England where they all appear as children again

Edmund and his siblings return to Narnia to meet Caspian rightful King of Narnia against King Miraz He convinces Trumpkin the dwarf that they are the Kings and Queens from the legend by defeating him in a sword fighting practice Later he helps Peter and Trumpkin defend Caspian against Nikabrik the hag and the were wolf Edmund is also there to see Peters sword duel against King Miraz

Edmund has since become more caring for Lucy and is the first one to believe her when she sees Aslan going on her side against the disbelief comments of Trumpkin and her other siblings Edmund is shown in the book more nicer than in The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe

In the movie Edmund proves to be much more mature than Peter and Caspian both but he stays out of their arguments Also in the movie he is able to stop the White Witch from being brought back from the dead by crashing the ice wall she is slipping out of

Edmund Lucy and their cousin Eustace come back to Narnia again by a painting and end up in the ocean They are saved and brought on board the Dawn Treader by King Caspia who is on a journey to find the three Lords that disappeared This was Edmund and Lucys last adventure in Narnia because Aslan told them they were getting too old to come back By this point Edmund had matured a great deal which can be seen in the way he deals with Eustace and in the fights with King Caspian Also Edmund has completely stopped insulting Lucy When Eustace changes his behavior after being changed back from a dragon Edmund mentions his own betrayal and says that Eustace was not worse than he was with the words You are an ass but I was a traitor

King Edmund Queen Susan and Mr Tumnus the Faun are visitors in the country of Calormen where Prince Rabadash wants Susan to marry him Thinking that Shasta is the missing Prince Corin of Archenland Narnias ally Edmund scolds the boy for running off and making everybody worried sick of him The Narnians escape thanks to Tumnus cloever plan which leads Rabadash to make his father agree that they should take Narnia by invading Archenland

Shasta meets Edmund once again in Anvard Edmund reminds Shasta that he should not eavesdrop Edmund and King Lune of Archenland lead the fight against the Calormene army and they manage to win

After dreaming of King Tirian in Narnia begging for their help in England Peter and Edmund go to the Ketterleys old home in London to dig up the magic rings that Professor Kirke buried in the yard as a boy in The Magicians Nephew to be used by Eustace and Jill to reach Narnia They are waiting for the others on the train platform when an accident happens

When King Tirian sees the Seven Friends of Narnia in his dream he thinks that Edmund and Peter had already the face of a King and a warrior

Edmund joins everyone except Susan into Aslans country Like his Peter and Lucy he is killed in the train crash and goes back to Aslans country where they can all live forever in a peaceful way

Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein KG GCB DSO PC often referred to as Monty was a British Army officer He fought in World War I and during World War II he successfully commanded Allied forces at the Battle of El Alamein a major turning point in the Western Desert Campaign He was later an important commander in Italy and in North West Europe where he was in command of all Allied ground forces during Operation Overlord until after the Battle of Normandy and was the principal commander for Operation Market Garden After the War he became Commander in Chief of the British Forces of Occupation in Germany and then Chief of the Imperial General Staff

Montgomery was born in Kennington London in 1887 He was the fourth child of nine His parents were The Reverend Henry Hutchinson Montgomery an Anglo Irish Anglican priest and Maud Montgomery Henry Montgomery was the second son of the noted British Indian Empire official Sir Robert Montgomery who died a month after Bernards birth Bernards mother Maud was the daughter of the well known preacher Frederic William Farrar and was eighteen years younger than her husband After the death of Sir Robert Montgomery Henry inherited the Montgomery ancestral estate of New Park at Moville a town on the Inishowen Peninsula of north County Donegal in the west of Ulster

However there was still 13000 to pay on the mortgage a large amount of money in the 1880s and Henry was at the time still only a parish priest Despite selling off farms at Ballynally there was barely enough to keep up New Park and pay for the summer holiday It was lucky that in 1889 Henry was made Bishop of Tasmania then still a colony He thought he had to spend as much time as possible in rural Tasmania and was away six months at a time While he was away his wife still in her mid twenties gave her children constant beatings or ignored them most of the time as she carried out the public duties of the bishops wife Of Bernards brothers and sisters Sibyl would die when she was very young in Tasmania and Harold Donald and Una would all emigrate When her husband was absent Maud Montgomery took little active interest in the education of her young children She had them taught by tutors brought across from England The loveless environment made Bernard something of a bully as he himself later recalled I was a dreadful little boy I dont suppose anybody would put up with my sort of behaviour these days Later in life Montgomery refused to allow his son David to have anything to do with his grandmother and he refused to attend her funeral in 1949

The family returned home once for the Lambeth Conference in 1897 and Bernard and his brother Harold were educated for a term at The Kings School Canterbury In 1901 Bishop Montgomery became secretary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the family returned to London Montgomery went to St Pauls School and then the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst from which he was almost expelled for setting fire to a fellow cadet during a fight with pokers On graduation he joined the 1st Battalion The Royal Warwickshire Regiment in September 1908 as a second lieutenant first seeing service in India until 1913 He was promoted to lieutenant in 1910

The First World War began in August 1914 and Montgomery moved to France with his regiment that month Half his battalion was destroyed during the retreat from Mons At Mteren on 13 October 1914 during an Allied counter offensive he was shot through the right lung by a sniper and was so badly injured that a grave was dug because he was expected to die

A Platoon sergeant came to assist him but was killed He fell on Montgomery The German sniper fired at him until sunset The body of the sergeant protected Montgomery and took most of the enemy fire Montgomery was hit once more though in the knee He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for gallant leadership The citation for this award published in the London Gazette in December 1914 reads quoteConspicuous gallant leading on 13th October when he turned the enemy out of their trenches with the bayonet He was severely wounded

In early 1915 he was appointed to be brigade major training Kitcheners New Army and returned to the Western Front in early 1916 as an operations staff officer during the battles of the Somme Arras and Passchendaele During this time he came under IX Corps part of General Sir Herbert Plumers Second Army Because the infantry artillery and engineers were trained together rehearsed together and worked together they were able to do what they were asked efficiently and without unnecessary casualties

Montgomery served at the battles of the Lys and Chemin des Dames before finishing the war as General Staff Officer 1 and effectively chief of staff of the 47th Division with the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel A photograph from October 1918 shows the then unknown Lt Col Montgomery standing in front of Winston Churchill at the victory parade at Lille

Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939 The 3rd Division was sent to Belgium as part of the British Expeditionary Force Montgomery predicted a disaster similar to that in 1914 and so spent the Phoney War training his troops to retreat safely rather than offensive operations During this time Montgomery faced serious trouble from his superiors for his attitude regarding the sexual health of his soldiers However he was defended from dismissal by his superior Alan Brooke commander of II Corps Montgomerys training paid off when the Germans began their invasion of the Low Countries on 10 May 1940 and the 3rd Division advanced to the River Dijle and then withdrew to Dunkirk with great professionalism returning to Britain intact with minimal casualties During Operation Dynamo the evacuation of 330000 BEF and French troops to Britain Montgomery had assumed command of the II Corps after Brooke had taken acting command of the whole BEF

On his return Montgomery annoyed the War Office by criticising the way the BEF was run and he was put in charge of a smaller group of soldiers He was however made a Companion of the Order of the Bath In July 1940 he was appointed acting lieutenant general placed in command of V Corps responsible for the defence of Hampshire and Dorset and started a long running feud with the new commander in chief Southern Command Claude Auchinleck In April 1941 he became commander of XII Corps responsible for the defence of Kent During this period he instituted a regime of continuous training and insisted on high levels of physical fitness for both officers and other ranks He was ruthless in sacking officers he considered would be unfit for command in action In December 1941 Montgomery was given command of South Eastern Command overseeing the defence of Kent Sussex and Surrey He renamed his command the South Eastern Army to promote offensive spirit During this time he further developed and rehearsed his ideas and trained his soldiers culminating in Exercise Tiger in May 1942 a combined forces exercise involving 100000 troops

In 1942 a new field commander was needed in the Middle East Auchinleck was acting as both the commander in chief Middle East Command and commander Eighth Army He had fixed the Allied position at the First Battle of El Alamein but after a visit in August 1942 the Prime Minister Winston Churchill replaced him as C in C with Alexander and William Gott as commander of the Eighth Army in the Western Desert After Gott was killed flying back to Cairo Churchill was persuaded by Brooke who by this time was Chief of the Imperial General Staff to appoint Montgomery who had only just been nominated to replace Alexander as commander of the British ground forces for Operation Torch

Montgomery was very popular with the men of the Eighth Army and when he took command Armys fighting spirit and abilities got better Taking command on 13 August 1942 he immediately became a whirlwind of activity He ordered the creation of the X Corps which contained all armoured divisions to fight alongside his XXX Corps which was all infantry divisions This was in no way similar to a German Panzer Corps One of Rommels Panzer Corps combined infantry armour and artillery units under one division commander The only common commander for Montgomerys all infantry and all armour corps was the Eighth Army Commander himself Correlli Barnett said that Montgomerys solution was in every way opposite to Auchinlecks and in every way wrong for it carried the existing dangerous separatism still further Montgomery spent two months making the convert30mikm long front line at El Alamein stronger He asked Alexander to send him two new British divisions that were then arriving in Egypt and were scheduled to be deployed in defence of the Nile Delta He moved his field HQ to Burg al Arab close to the Air Force command post in order better to coordinate combined operations Montgomery wanted the Army Navy and Air Force to fight together from the same detailed plan He ordered immediate reinforcement of the vital heights of Alam Halfa just behind his own lines expecting the German commander Erwin Rommel to attack with there something that Rommel soon did Montgomery ordered all plans for retreat be destroyed I have cancelled the plan for withdrawal he told his officers at the first meeting he held with them in the desert If we are attacked then there will be no retreat If we cannot stay here alive then we will stay here dead

Montgomery made a great effort to appear before troops as often as possible frequently visiting various units and making himself known to the men often arranging for cigarettes to be distributed Although he still wore a standard British officers cap on arrival in the desert he briefly wore an Australian broad brimmed hat before switching to wearing the black beret for which he became notable The black beret had been given to him by a soldier when he climbing into a tank to get a closer look at the front lines Both Brooke and Alexander were astonished by the change in atmosphere when they visited on 19 August less than a week after Montgomery had taken command

Rommel attempted to turn the left side of the Eighth Army at the Battle of Alam Halfa from 31 August 1942 The GermanItalian armoured Corps infantry attack was stopped in very heavy fighting Rommels forces had to withdraw quickly so that they could escape though the British minefields be cut off Montgomery was criticised for not counter attacking the retreating forces immediately but he felt strongly that his build up of British forces was not yet ready A hasty counter attack risked ruining his strategy for an offensive on his own terms in late October planning for which had begun soon after he took command He was confirmed in the permanent rank of lieutenant general in mid October

The conquest of Libya was essential for airfields to support Malta and to threaten the rear of Axis forces opposing Operation Torch Montgomery prepared meticulously for the new offensive after convincing Churchill that the time was not being wasted He was determined not to fight until he thought there had been enough preparation for a victory and put into action his beliefs with the gathering of resources detailed planning the training of troops especially in clearing minefields and fighting at night and in the use of 252 of the latest American built Sherman tanks 90 M7 Priest self propelled howitzers and making a personal visit to every unit involved in the offensive By the time the offensive was ready in late October Eighth Army had 231000 men on its ration strength including British Australian South African Indian New Zealand Greek and Free French units

Generation Y is made up of people born in and after 1976 or the early 1980s and afterward until the early or mid 1990s according to various sources People in this generation period are known as Millennials or Echo Boomers The famous people born during this period include Katie Holmes Sarah Michelle Geller Colbie Caillat and Britney Spears The Generation Y period is known as the Echo Boom generation because of the high birth rate during this period The high birth rate almost matches that of the Baby Boom period after World War II 

Aeolus or Eolus was the king of winds in Greek mythology Although he varied from story to story he was sometimes said to have had all the winds in a bag In the Odyssey he gave that bag to Odysseus to help him get home Aeolus was the son of Hellen and a nymph named Orseis Aeolus brothers were Dorus Xuthus and Amphictyon

Hornblende is a complex series of silicate minerals 

Hornblende is not a recognized mineral in its own right but the name is used as a general or field term to refer to a dark amphibole 

It is an isomorphous mixture of three molecules a calcium iron magnesium silicate an aluminium iron magnesium silicate and an iron magnesium silicate 

Hornblende has a hardness of 56 a specific gravity of 2934 and is typically an opaque green greenish brown brown or black color It is most often confused with the minerals augite and biotite mica both of which are black and can be found in granite

Hornblende is a common constituent of many igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite diorite gabbro basalt andesite gneiss and schist It is the principal mineral of amphibolites 

Very dark brown to black hornblendes that contain titanium may be called basaltic hornblende from the fact that they are usually a constituent of basalt and related rocks 

The word hornblende is derived from the German horn and blenden to blind or dazzle The term blende is often used to refer to a brilliant non metallic luster for example zincblende and pitchblende the ore of uranium

Echidna is a monster of Greek mythology half woman half serpent Her parents were either the sea deities Phorcys and Ceto or Tartarus and Gaia in Hesiod Tartarus and Gaia are the parents of Echidnas husband Typhon Among Echidnas progeny by the 100 headed Typhon were Ladon another dragon who protected the Golden Fleece the Hydra the goatlike Chimera and the infernal hounds Orthus and Cerberus The Sphinx and the Nemean lion both sired by Orthus were also among her offspring

Particles which go near the speed of light are called ultrarelativistic

Particles which go below the speed of light are called tardyons Theoretical particles which go above the speed of light are called tachyons

Atmospheric circulation

The atmospheric circulation is a large scale movement of masses of air The origin of these processes is the sun radiation The sun waves radiate the short wave radiation The earth absorbs only a part of this energy The other part is radiated back to the atmosphere and to the universe The back radiation is long waved The thermal energy is distributed thanks to the circulation of the air on the surface of the earth The demonstration of circulation varies from year to year but the basic climatologic structure is almost constant We recognize 3 cells The Hadley cell the Ferrel cell and the Polar cell The movement of air masses is influenced by Coriolis Force It means that the air diverts to the west

The Hadley cell

The earth and ocean are intensively radiated in the equatorial areas The hot and usually moist air rises It is called convection This process creates a low pressure area along the equator The area is also called the Intertropical Convergence Zone The hot air goes to both south and north and gets colder As the air is cold enough it goes down to the surface again This creates deserts and semi deserts The masses of air from the 30 degrees go back to the equator 

The Pollar cell

The air on 60 degrees of latitude is colder and drier than the air on the equator On the other hand the rising movements are still possible The character of processes is similar to the Hadley cell The warmer air goes up and falls down on the poles This air comes back to the equator 

The Ferrell cell

The movements between 30 and 60 degrees are more compounds The temperature is not the main reason of this circulation The air in this cell moves according to the differences between moving masses in Hadley and Polar cells The interchange of high and low areas is typical

Christopher Roy Oddleifson is a retired professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League from 1972 until 1981 He is best known for his time with the Vancouver Canucks where he was one of the teams top players for much of the 1970s and served as team captain in 197677

Oddleifson was selected 10th overall in the 1970 NHL Amateur Draft by the California Golden Seals following a final junior season with the Winnipeg Jets of the WCHL during which he finished with 95 points and 243 penalty minutes However he was assigned to the minor leagues and would never play an National Hockey League game for the Seals and was dealt to the Boston Bruins mid way through the 197172 season 

In 197273 Oddleifson finally made his NHL debut appearing in 6 games for Boston without recording a point He managed to crack the Bruins full time in 197475 highlighted by a four goal game against the Golden Seals the team that had given up on him two years earlier Late in the season he was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks in a deal for sniper Bobby Schmautz and he finished out his rookie season with decent totals of 13 goals and 29 points in 70 games between Boston and Vancouver 

Oddleifson would have his breakout year in 197475 as he emerged as a leader on a young Canuck team which surprised by winning their division and making the playoffs for the first time in franchise history He proved himself to be an exceptional all around player who possessed size toughness and playmaking ability as well as the ability to play both at center and on the wing He lead the Canucks in scoring through the early part of the season until a fractured jaw forced him to miss 20 games Nevertheless he finished with career highs of 16 goals and 35 assists for 51 points in just 60 games

By the 197980 season the emergence of young stars like Thomas Gradin Stan Smyl and Curt Fraser as well as the acquisition of several skilled veterans had pushed Oddleifson into a mainly defensive role and he finished the season with career lows of just 8 goals and 28 points Early in the 198081 campaign he was assigned to the Dallas Black Hawks effectively ending his NHL career 

Oddleifson spent two more seasons playing in Switzerland before retiring in 1983 He finished his NHL career with totals 95 goals and 191 assists for 286 points in 524 games along with 464 penalty minutes

All the elements of the group except Roentgenium have been known since prehistoric times as all of them occur in metallic form in nature and no extraction metallurgy has to be used to produce them

Like other groups the members of this family show patterns in its electron configuration especially the outermost shells resulting in trends in chemical behavior

They are all relatively inert corrosion resistant metals Copper and gold are colored

These elements have low electrical resistivity so they are used for wiring Copper is the cheapest and most widely used Bond wires for integrated circuits are usually gold Silver and silver plated copper wiring are found in some special applications

These metals especially silver have unusual properties that make them essential for industrial applications outside of their monetary or decorative value They are all excellent conductors of electricity  The most conductive of all metals are silver copper and gold in that order Silver is also the most thermally conductive element and the most light reflecting element Silver also has the unusual property that the tarnish that forms on silver is still highly electrically conductive 

Copper is used extensively in electrical wiring and circuitry Gold contacts are sometimes found in precision equipment for their ability to remain corrosion free Silver is used widely in mission critical applications as electrical contacts and is also used in photography agriculture medicine audiophile and scientific applications

Gold silver and copper are quite soft metals and so are easily damaged in daily use as coins Precious metal may also be easily abraded and worn away through use In their numismatic functions these metals must be alloyed with other metals to afford coins greater durability The alloying with other metals makes the resulting coins harder less likely to become deformed and more resistant to wear

Gold coins Gold coins are typically produced as either 90 gold or 22 carat gold with copper and silver making up the remaining weight in each case Bullion gold coins are being produced with up to 99999 gold

Silver coins Silver coins are typically produced as either 90 silver  in the case of pre 1965 US minted coins or sterling silver coins for pre 1920 British Commonwealth and other silver coinage with copper making up the remaining weight in each case

Copper coins Copper coins are often of quite high purity around 97 and are usually alloyed with small amounts of zinc and tin

Inflation has caused the face value of coins to fall below the hard currency value of the historically used metals This had led to most modern coins being made of base metals  copper nickel is popular as are nickel brass manganese brass bronze or simple plated steel

The Calvin cycle is the set of chemical reactions that take place in chloroplasts during photosynthesis 

The cycle is light independent because it takes place after the energy has been captured from sunlight 

The Calvin cycle is named after Melvin Calvin who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for finding it in 1961 Calvin and his colleagues did the work at the University of California Berkeley

Using the radioactive carbon 14 isotope as a tracer Calvin Andrew Benson and their team mapped the complete route that carbon travels through a plant during photosynthesis They traced the carbon 14 from its absorption as atmospheric carbon dioxide to its conversion into carbohydrates and other organic compounds The single celled algae Chlorella was used to trace the carbon 14

The Calvin group showed that sunlight acts on the chlorophyll in a plant to fuel the manufacture of organic compounds not directly on carbon dioxide as previously believed

1 Grab A five carbon carbon catcher catches one molecule of carbon dioxide and forms a six carbon molecule

2 Split the enzyme RuBisCO breaks the six carbon molecule into two equal parts

3 Leave A trio of three carbons leave and become sugar The other trio moves on to the next step

4 Switch Using ATP and NADPH the three carbon molecule is changed into a five carbon molecule

5 The cycle starts over again

The carbohydrate products of the Calvin cycle are three carbon sugar phosphate molecules or triose phosphates Each step of the cycle has its own enzyme which speeds up the reaction 

A political machine is a political organization in which a person or small group with authority that has enough votes or is popular enough to have control over political administration or any type of government in a city county or state The term political machine has been used mostly since the 18th century in the United States used to describe machines like Tamanny Hall who stayed in control mostly because of the large support from the immigrants in Manhattan during the 18th century

The Daintree Rainforest is a main part of the Wet Tropics of Queensland listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988

The Daintree Rainforest meets all four natural criteria on the Criteria for Selection to be a World Heritage Site It is one of only twelve natural World Heritage Sites worldwide that meet all four criteria The Daintree area is adjacent to another World Heritage site the Great Barrier Reef This makes it the only place in the world where two natural World Heritage Sites meet  

The Daintree Rainforest contains 30 of the frog marsupial and reptile species in Australia and 65 of Australias bat and butterfly species 18 of bird species in the country can be found in this area There are also over 12000 species of insects All of this diversity is contained within an area that takes up 02 of Australia

The Red City Hall is the town hall of Berlin in the Mitte borough on Rathausstrae near Alexanderplatz It is the home to the governing mayor and the government of the Federal state of Berlin The landmark building got its name from the red clinker bricks with which it is covered

The Rathaus was built between 1861 and 1869 in the style of the north Italian High Renaissance by Hermann Friedrich Waesemann It was modelled on the Old Town Hall of Toru now in Poland while the architecture of the tower is reminiscent of the cathedral tower of Notre Dame of Laon in France It replaced several individual buildings dating from the Middle Ages and now fills an entire city block

The building was heavily damaged by Allied bombing in World War II and rebuilt to the original plans between 1951 and 1956 The Neues Stadthaus which survived the bombing and had been the head office of the Berlin city fire insurance company Feuersoziett in Parochialstrae was the temporary city hall for the post war city government for all four sectors of Berlin until September 1948 Following that time it housed only those of the Soviet sector The reconstructed Rotes Rathaus then in the Soviet sector served as the town hall of East Berlin while the Rathaus Schneberg in Schneberg borough was seat of the West Berlin Senate After German reunification the administration of reunified Berlin officially moved into the Rotes Rathaus on 1 October 1991

Unter den Linden is a boulevard in the Mitte district of Berlin the capital of Germany It is named for its linden trees that line the grassed pedestrian mall in the middle of the road

Unter den Linden runs eastwest from the site of the former Stadtschloss royal palace at the Lustgarten park where the demolished Palast der Republik used to be to Pariser Platz and Brandenburg Gate Eastward the boulevard crosses the river Spree near the Dom and continues as Karl Liebknecht Strae The western continuation behind Brandenburg Gate is Strae des 17 Juni Major northsouth streets crossing Unter den Linden are Friedrichstrae and Wilhelmstrasse 

Unter den Linden at the heart of the historic section of Berlin developed from a bridle path laid out by Elector John George of Brandenburg in the 16th century to reach his hunting grounds in the Tiergarten It was replaced by a boulevard of linden trees planted in 1647 stretching from the city palace to the gates of the city by order of the Great Elector Frederick William While the western part of the boulevard retained its character the area around present day Bebelplatz was changed after the Thirty Years War and fortified There are no trees 

By the 19th century as Berlin grew and expanded to the west Unter den Linden became the best known and grandest street in Berlin In 1851 the famous equestrian statue of King Frederick the Great designed by Christian Daniel Rauch was put up on the centre strip In the course of the building of the Nord Sd Tunnel for the Berlin S Bahn in 193435 most of the linden trees were cut down and during the last days of World War II the remaining trees were destroyed or cut down for firewood The present day linden were replanted in the 1950s they are affected by air pollution as well as by soil contamination

Since 1937 the numbering has started at the Schlossbrcke connecting Unter den Linden with the Lustgarten and Museum Island The disputed replica of the Alte Kommandantur is No 1 vis vis the Zeughaus arsenal the oldest building on Unter den Linden built between 1695 and 1706 today the seat of the Deutsches Historisches Museum Buildings along the street include the Kronprinzenpalais the Neue Wache war memorial built in 1817 considered by many to be Karl Friedrich Schinkels masterpiece Furthermore on Bebelplatz the Berlin State Opera coloquially called Lindenoper St Hedwigs Cathedral and the Altes Palais favoured residence of Emperor Wilhelm I in the north the main building of the Humboldt University and House I of the Berlin State Library On the western end are the Russian Embassy the Hungarian Embassy at the corner of Wilhelmstrasse and finally the Hotel Adlon at the corner of Pariser Platz which has been completely rebuilt on the site of the prewar hotel Well known statues of Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt in front of the university as well as of the Prussian generals Scharnhorst and Blow also adorn the street

Frederick II was a King in Prussia and a King of Prussia from the Hohenzollern dynasty As a prince elector of the Holy Roman Empire he was Frederick IV Margrave of Brandenburg He was also the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchtel He became known as Frederick the Great and was nicknamed der alte Fritz

When he was young Frederick was mostly interested in music and philosophy and not military affairs Frederick tried to escape from his strict father Frederick William I with childhood friend Hans Hermann von Katte When they were captured Frederick was forced to watch von Kattels execution 

Shortly after becoming King in Prussia he attacked Austria and claimed Silesia during the Silesian Wars Near the end of his life Frederick united most of his separated parts of his kingdom through the First Partition of Poland

For years Frederick exchanged letters with Voltaire He modernized the Prussian bureaucracy and civil service and promoted religious tolerance Frederick patronized the arts and philosophers and wrote flute music Frederick is buried at his favorite residence Sanssouci in Potsdam Because he died childless Frederick was succeeded by his nephew Frederick William II of Prussia son of his brother Prince Augustus William of Prussia

In 1732 Queen Sophia Dorothea tried to arrange a dual marriage of Frederick and his sister Wilhelmina with Amelia and Frederick the children of her brother King George II of Great Britain Fearing an alliance between Prussia and Great Britain Field Marshal von Seckendorff the Austrian ambassador in Berlin bribed Field Marshal von Grumbkow the Prussian Minister of War and Benjamin Reichenbach Prussian ambassador in London They pair discreetly slandered the British and Prussian courts in the eyes of the two kings Angered by the idea of the marriage Frederick William madeimpossible demands to the British such as Prussia acquiring Jlich and Berg leading to the collapse of the marriage proposal

After von Kattel died Frederick was granted a royal pardon and released from his cell on 18 November but he was not given back his military rank Instead of returning to Berlin however he was forced to stay in Kstrin and began learning statecraft and administration for the War and Estates Departments on 20 November Tensions eased slightly when Frederick William visited Kstrin a year later and Frederick was allowed to visit Berlin on the occasion of his sister Wilhelminas marriage to Margrave Frederick of Bayreuth on 20 November 1731 The crown prince returned to Berlin after finally being released from Kstrin on 26 February 1732

Frederick William considered marrying Frederick to Elisabeth of Mecklenburg Schwerin the niece of Empress Anna of Russia but this plan was opposed by Prince Eugene of Savoy Frederick himself proposed marrying Maria Theresa of Austria in return for renouncing the succession Instead Eugene persuaded Frederick William through Seckendorff that the crown prince marry Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick Bevern a Protestant relative of the Austrian Habsburgs Although Frederick wrote to his sister that There can be neither love nor friendship between us and he considered suicide he went along with the wedding on 12 June 1733 He had little in common with his bride and resented the political marriage as an example of the Austrian interference which had plagued Prussia since 1701 Once Frederick secured the throne in 1740 he would not let Elisabeth visit his court in Potsdam and instead gave her Schnhausen Palace and apartments at the Berliner Stadtschloss Frederick bestowed the title of the heir to the throne Prince of Prussia on his brother Augustus William despite this his wife remained devoted to him

Frederick was given back a rank in the Prussian Army as Colonel of the Regiment von der Goltz stationed near Nauen and Neuruppin When Prussia gave troops to help Austria during the War of the Polish Succession Frederick studied under Prince Eugene of Savoy during the campaign against France on the Rhine Frederick William weakened by gout brought about by the campaign gave Frederick Schloss Rheinsberg in Rheinsberg north of Neuruppin In Rheinsberg Frederick assembled a small number of musicians actors and other artists He spent his time reading watching dramatic plays making and listening to music and regarded this time as one of the happiest of his life Frederick formed the Bayard Order to discuss warfare with his friends Heinrich August de la Motte Fouqu was made the grand master of the gatherings

The works of Niccol Machiavelli such as The Prince were considered a guideline for the behaviour of a king in Fredericks age In 1739 Frederick finished his Anti Machiavel which put another point of view It was published anonymously in 1740 but Voltaire distributed it in Amsterdam 

Fredericks years dedicated to the arts instead of politics ended upon the 1740 death of Frederick William and his inheritance of the Kingdom of Prussia

When Frederick ascended the throne as King in Prussia in 1740 Prussia consisted of scattered territories including Cleves Mark and Ravensberg in the west of the Holy Roman Empire Brandenburg Hither Pomerania and Farther Pomerania in the east of the Empire and the former Duchy of Prussia outside of the Empire bordering the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth He was titled King in Prussia because this was only part of historic Prussia he was to declare himself King of Prussia after acquiring most of the rest in 1772

Fredericks goal was to modernize and unite his vulnerably disconnected lands toward this end he fought wars mainly against Austria whose Habsburg dynasty reigned as Holy Roman Emperors almost continuously from the 15th century until 1806 Frederick established Prussia as the fifth and smallest European great power by using the resources his frugal father had cultivated

The First Silesian War part of the War of the Austrian Succession resulted in Frederick conquering the Polish part of Silesia Austria attempted to recover Silesia in the Second Silesian War but Frederick was victorious again and forced Austria to stick to the previous peace terms Prussian possession of Silesia gave the kingdom control over the Oder River

Habsburg Austria and Bourbon France traditional enemies allied together in the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756 following the collapse of the Anglo Austrian Alliance Frederick swiftly made an alliance with Great Britain at the Convention of Westminster As neighboring countries began conspiring against him Frederick was determined to strike first On 29 August 1756 his well prepared army crossed the frontier and invaded Saxony thus beginning the Seven Years War which lasted until 1763 He faced widespread criticism for his attack on neutral Saxony and for his forcible incorporation of the Saxon forces into the Prussian army following the Siege of Pirna in October 1756

Facing a coalition which included Austria France Russia Saxony and Sweden and having only Great Britain and Hanover as his allies Frederick narrowly kept Prussia in the war despite having his territories frequently invaded

The sudden death of Empress Elizabeth of Russia led to the succession of the pro Prussian Peter III This led to the collapse of the anti Prussian coalition Although Frederick did not gain any territory in the ensuing Treaty of Hubertusburg he was able to keep Silesia and Prussia became popular in many German speaking territories

Late in his life Frederick also involved Prussia in the low scale War of the Bavarian Succession in 1778 in which he stopped Austrian attempts to exchange the Austrian Netherlands for Bavaria When Emperor Joseph IIJoseph II tried the scheme again in 1784 Frederick created the Frstenbund allowing himself to be seen as a defender of German liberties in contrast to his earlier role of attacking the imperial Habsburgs

Frederick frequently led his military forces personally and had six horses shot from under him during battle Frederick is often admired as one of the greatest tactical geniuses of all time especially for his usage of the oblique order of battle Even more important were his operational successes especially preventing the unification of numerically superior opposing armies and being at the right place at the right time to keep enemy armies out of Prussian core territory In a letter to his mother Maria Theresa the Austrian co ruler Emperor Joseph II wrote

Frederick changed Prussia from a European backwater to an economically strong and politically reformed state His took of Silesia to give Prussias new industries raw materials and he protected these industries with high tariffs and minimal restrictions on internal trade Canals were built including between the Vistula and the Oder swamps were drained for agriculture and new crops such as the potato and the turnip were introduced Frederick regarded his reclamation of land in the Oderbruch as a province conquered in peace With the help of French experts he reorganized the system of indirect taxes which provided the state with more revenue than direct taxes Frederick the Great commissioned Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky to promote the trade and  to take on the competition with France  put a silk factory where soon 1500 persons found employment Frederick the Great followed his recommendations in the field of toll levies and import restrictions In 1763 when Gotzkowsky went broke during a financial crisis which started in Amsterdam Frederick took over his porcelain factory known as KPM but refused to buy more of his paintings

During the reign of Frederick the effects of the Seven Years War and the gaining of Silesia greatly changed the economy The circulation of depreciated money kept prices high To revalue the Thaler the Mint Edict of May 1763 was proposed This stabilized the rates of depreciated coins that would not be accepted and provided for the payments of taxes in currency of prewar value This was replaced in northern Germany by the Reichsthaler worth one fourth of a Conventionsthaler Prussia used a Thaler containing one fourteenth of a Cologne mark of silver Many other rulers soon followed the steps of Frederick in reforming their own currencies this resulted in a shortage of ready money thus lowering prices

Frederick gave his state a modern bureaucracy whose mainstay until 1760 was the able War and Finance Minister Adam Ludwig von Blumenthal succeeded in 1764 by his nephew Joachim who ran the ministry to the end of the reign and beyond Prussias education system was seen as one of the best in Europe Frederick also abolished torture and corporal punishment

Frederick began titling himself King of Prussia after the acquisition of Royal Prussia in 1772 the phrasing King in Prussia had been used since the coronation of Frederick I in Knigsberg in 1701

Frederick generally supported religious toleration including keeping Jesuits as teachers in Silesia Warmia and the Netze District after their suppression by Pope Clement XIV He was interested in attracting a many skills to his country whether from Jesuit teachers Huguenot citizens or Jewish merchants and bankers particularly from Spain He wanted development throughout the country As an example of this practical minded but not fully unprejudiced tolerance Frederick wrote in his Testament politique that

Jews on the Polish border were therefore encouraged to perform all the trade they could and received all the protection and support from the king as any other Prussian citizen The success in integrating the Jews into those areas of society that Frederick encouraged them in can be seen by the role played by Gerson von Bleichrder in financing Bismarcks efforts to reunite Germany

As under Frederick much wasteland was made arable Prussia was looking for new colonists Frederick repeatedly emphasized that nationality and religion were of no concern to him

Frederick had famous buildings constructed in his capital Berlin most of which still exist today such as the Berlin State Opera the Royal Library St Hedwigs Cathedral and Prince Henrys Palace However the king preferred spending his time in his summer residence Potsdam where he built the palace of Sanssouci the most important work of Northern German rococo Sanssouci which translates from French as carefree or without worry was a refuge for Frederick Frederician Rococo developed under Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff

Many historians have considered whether Frederick the Great was homosexual or bisexual Frederick was forced to marry Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick Bevern with whom he had no children He immediately separated from his wife when Frederick William I died in 1740 In later years Frederick would pay his wife formal visits only once a year

Near the end of his life Frederick spent more and more time alone His circle of friends at Sanssouci gradually died off without replacements and Frederick became increasingly critical and arbitrary to the frustration of the civil service and officer corps The people of Berlin always cheered the king when he returned to the city from provincial tours or military reviews but Frederick took no pleasure from his popularity with the common folk preferring instead the company of his pet Italian greyhounds whom he referred to as his marquises de Pompadour as a jibe at Madame de Pompadour Frederick died in an armchair in his study in the palace of Sanssouci on 17 August 1786

Frederick had wished to be buried next to his greyhounds on the vineyard terrace on the side of the corps de logis of Sanssouci His nephew and successor Frederick William II instead ordered the body be entombed next to his father in the church of the Potsdam garrison Near the end of World War II Adolf Hitler ordered the coffins of Frederick and Frederick William I as well as those of Paul von Hindenburg and his wife transferred first to an underground bunker near Berlin then hidden in a salt mine close to the town of Bernrode Germany to protect them from destruction The US Army discovered the four coffins on 27 April 1945 behind a 6 foot thick masonry wall deep within the mine and moved them to the basement of Marburg Castle a collection point for recovered Nazi treasure As part of a secret project dubbed Operation Bodysnatch  the US Army relocated both kings first to the Elisabeth Church of Marburg and then on to Burg Hohenzollern close to the town of Hechingen After German reunification the body of Frederick William was entombed in the Kaiser Friedrich Mausoleum in Sanssoucis Church of Peace

On the 205th anniversary of his death on 17 August 1991 Fredericks casket lay in state in the court of honor of Sanssouci covered by a Prussian flag and escorted by a Bundeswehr guard of honour After nightfall Fredericks body was finally laid to rest on the terrace of the vineyard of Sanssouci according to his last will without pomp and at night

King in Prussia was the title used by the rulers of Prussia from 1702 to 1772

The rulers who were also Princes and Margraves of Brandenberg wanted to be Kings but knew that the Holy Roman Emperor would not allow them the title 

In return for support in the War of the Spanish Succession Emperor Leopold I allowed Frederick to call himself King in Prussia The Duchy of Prussia was outside the Empire and he was only regarded as King outside the Empire

In 1772 Frederick II annexed most of Poland and decided to call himself King of Prussia The Holy Roman Emperor was not as strong as they had been and in 1806 the Empire ceased to exist

Prince electors Kurfrst were the group of rulers of German countries which elected the Holy Roman Emperor In English they were usually called Electors and included the Elector of Brandenburg who also began ruling as King of Prussia and the Electors of Hanover who were also kings of Great Britain after 1714

In 1692 the Duke of Hanover was made an Elector of the Holy Roman Emperor After then the Dukes were usually called Electors of Hanover Kurfrst von Hannover

Queen Anne of England and Great Britain had no children Sophia Dorothea was chosen as her protestant heir When Anne died in 1714 Sophia Dorotheas son the Elector of Hanover became King George I of Great Britain 

Mantis shrimps are crustacean stomatopods 

They are not actually shrimps but members of the order Stomatopoda There are about 400 species

They are predators which kill their prey by hitting them at high speed 

They hold their body in a manner like that of a praying mantis and have large complex eyes Some species can be 30 cm long 

They are highly coloured and live in shallow tropical and subtropical habitats such as coral reefs

Each species has one of these two methods of attack

Both types strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey and are capable of inflicting serious damage on victims larger than themselves

In smashers these two weapons are employed with blinding quickness and hit their prey with the speed of a bullet This is one of the fastest responses known to man 

Smashers use this ability to attack snails crabs molluscs and rock oysters their blunt clubs enabling them to crack the shells of their prey into pieces Spearers on the other hand prefer the meat of softer animals like fish which their barbed claws can more easily slice and snag

Because they strike so rapidly they generate cavitation bubbles between the appendage and the striking surface The collapse of these bubbles hits their prey in addition to the impact of the appendage against the striking surface 

This means that the prey is hit twice by a single strike first by the claw and then by the collapsing cavitation bubbles that immediately follow Even if the initial strike misses the prey the resulting shock wave can be enough to kill or stun the prey

Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom

The mantis shrimp has such good eyes it can perceive both polarized light and colour vision outside the normal visual spectrum

Some species have at least 16 different photoreceptor types 12 of them for colour analysis in the different wavelengths and four of them for analysing polarised light By comparison humans have only four visual pigments three dedicated to see colour 

The eyes of mantis shrimp may recognize different types of coral prey species or predators such as barracuda which have shimmering scales 

Also the manner in which mantis shrimp hunt may require very accurate ranging information which would require accurate depth perception

During mating rituals mantis shrimp actively fluoresce and the wavelength of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by their eye pigments 

Females are only fertile during certain phases of the tidal cycle the ability to perceive the phase of the moon may therefore help prevent wasted mating efforts It may also give mantis shrimp information about the size of the tide which is important for species living in shallow water near the shore

This article lists Dukes Electors and Kings ruling over territories named Saxony from the beginning of the Saxon Duchy in the 9th century to the end of the Saxon Kingdom in 1918

The original Duchy of Saxony was the lands of the Saxon people in the north western part of present day Germany namely the modern German state of Lower Saxony as well as Westphalia and Western Saxony Anhalt not the modern German state of Saxony

Early dukes

Hattonid dynasty

When the Welfs left in 1180 the Duchy of Saxony lost a lot of territory Westphalia fell to the Archbishop of Cologne while the Duchies of Brunswick and Lneburg remained with the Welfs The Ascanian Dukes had their base further east near the Elbe so the name Saxony moved towards the east The post carve up Saxony is therefore sometimes called the younger Duchy of Saxony Also the counting of its dukes its mixed up While the first post carve up duke is sometimes called Bernard III  because of two predecessors of the same name before 1180  or Bernard I with his great great great great grandson Bernard II being counted second The second post carve up duke Albert I is already usually counted as the first although before 1180 he had one predecessor of the same name his grandfather Albert the Bear

The new dukes changed the Saxon horse emblem and used their Ascanian family colours and emblem and added a bendwise crancelin a crown diagonally across the coat of arms symbolising the Saxon ducal crown as new coat of arms of Saxony The later rulers of the House of Wettin adopted the Ascanian coat of arms

Since the Duke of Saxony was considered one of the prince electors electing a new Holy Roman Emperor there was an argument between the lines of Lauenburg and Wittenberg about who should cast Saxonys vote In 1314 both lines found themselves on different sides in a double election Eventually the Dukes of Saxe Wittenberg succeeded in 1356 after the promulgation of the Golden Bull To distinguish him from other rulers bearing the title Duke of Saxony he was commonly called Elector of Saxony 

In 1303 the brothers split their inheritance between them however only two brothers had heirs creating the Bergedorf Mlln and the Ratzeburg Lauenburg lines

First named Saxe Mlln however renamed after reorganising territory including parts of Albert IIIs share in 1321 

In 1401 the elder branch became extinct and Lauenburg rejoined the Ratzeburg Lauenburg line

First named Saxe Bergedorf Lauenburg however renamed after reorganising territory including parts of Albert IIIs share in 1321 

In 1401 the younger branch inherited Lauenburg and other possessions of the extinct elder Bergedorf Mlln line

The Ascanian Dynasty continued in Saxe Lauenburg until 1689 but after the Lauenburg line had finally lost the Saxon Electorate to the Wittenberg line in 1356 and failed to obtain the succession in the Electorate after 1422 recognition of the Dukes of Saxe Lauenburg as Dukes of Saxony waned

For the predecessor see the section Ascanian or younger Duchy of Saxony above in this article

The Albertines were a junior branch of the Wettin dynasty of Electors of Saxony who ruled in Northern Thuringia and Southern Meissen until they replaced the senior Ernestine branch as Electors and rulers of most Saxon territory in 1547

Following their displacement by the Albertines the Ernestine branch of the Wettins continued to rule in southern Thuringia as Dukes of Saxony but their lands eventually split up into many different tiny Ernestine duchies Of these Saxe Weimar Eisenach Saxe Coburg Gotha Saxe Meiningen and Saxe Altenburg lasted until 1918 This article does not list the subsequent Ernestine dukes

The Golden Bull of 1356 confirmed the right to participate in the election of a Holy Roman Emperor to the Duke of Saxony in the Saxe Wittenberg line For the predecessor see the section Ascanian Dukes of Saxe Wittenberg above in this article

 Kings of Saxony 

The Holy Roman Empire came to an end in 1806 The Elector of Saxony allied to Napoleon I anticipated its dissolution by becoming the ruler of an independent Kingdom of Saxony in 1806

Saxony became a republic at the end of the German Empire in 1918 For later rulers see List of Ministers President of Saxony

Strict weak ordering is a binary relation on a set Such relations define a strict ordering but they contain several elements of the same type An example might be the relation costs less than or is cheaper than For any two elements that are of different types the relation holds On the other hand there are some elements that cannot be ordered that way because they are of the same type An example for such a relation may be the relation costs less than milk may cost less than bread and bread may cost less than cake Two items of different types may cost less than another but they can otherwise have the same price 

Two different algorithms that sort words by the number of letters in the word may not give the same ordering of the words with the same number of letters but they will always give an ordering where the four letter words come before the five letter words and after the three letter words

Time will give a strict weak ordering too Events that are equivalent in the timeframe happen at the same time 

Colour vision is the capacity of an organism to distinguish objects based on the wavelengths of the light they reflect emit or transmit Colour is a quality constructed by the visual brain and not a property of objects 

A red apple does not emit red light Rather it simply absorbs all the frequencies of visible light shining on it except for a group of frequencies that are reflected

It is these frequencies which are perceived as red 

The nervous system derives colour by comparing the responses to light from the several types of cone photoreceptors in the eye These cone photoreceptors are sensitive to different portions of the visible spectrum 

For humans the visible spectrum ranges approximately from 380 to 740 nm and there are normally three types of cones The visible range and number of cone types differ between species

The advantage of colour vision is the better discrimination of surfaces it allows

In professional wrestling a VillainHeel is a Bad guy Who tries to get boosheat from fans 

Compound eyes consist of many photoreceptor units or ommatidia Each ommatidium is an individual eye unit 

The image perceived is a combination of inputs from ommatidia on a convex surface Thus they point in slightly different directions 

Compared with simple eyes compound eyes possess a wide angle view They can detect fast movement and in some cases the polarization of light 

Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms and 96 of animal species possess a complex optical system Image resolving eyes are present in molluscs chordates and arthropods

Almost all insects and arachnids use both simple and compound eyes

Compound eyes fall into two groups apposition eyes which form multiple inverted images and superposition eyes which form a single erect image Compound eyes are common in arthropods and are also present in annelids and some bivalved molluscs

Compound eyes in arthropods at least grow at their margins by the addition of new ommatidia

Good fliers like flies or honey bees or prey catching insects like praying mantis or dragonflies have specialized zones of ommatidia organized into a foveal area which gives acute vision In the acute zone the eyes are flattened and the facets larger The flattening allows more ommatidia to receive light from a spot and therefore higher resolution

Another version is the pseudofaceted eye as seen in Scutigera This type of eye consists of a cluster of numerous ocelli on each side of the head organized in a way that resembles a true compound eye

The body of Ophiocoma wendtii a type of brittle star is covered with ommatidia turning its whole skin into a compound eye The same is true of many chitons

Opsins are the universal photoreceptor molecules of all visual systems in the animal kingdom  

They change from a resting state to a signalling state by absorbing light This activates the G protein resulting in a signalling cascade which produces physiological responses 

This process of capturing a photon and transforming it into a physiological response is known as phototransduction

Five groups of opsins are involved in vision mediating the conversion of a photon of light into an electrochemical signal the first step in the visual transduction cascade

Another opsin found in the mammalian retina melanopsin is involved in circadian rhythms and pupillary reflex but not in image forming

He lived and died in Rome where his father had been given a home by the Pope  Clement XI

He spent his life in the Papal States and had a long career in the clergy of the Roman Catholic Church rising to become the Dean of the College of Cardinals and Cardinal Bishop of Ostia and Velletri At the time of his death he was one of the longest serving Cardinals in the Churchs history

When he was young Henrys father made him Duke of York and that was how he was best known Upon the death of his brother in 1788 Henry became known by Jacobites and within his personal entourage as Henry IX of England although publicly he referred to himself as Cardinal Duke of York nuncupatus

Henry was born in exile at Rome on 6 March 1725 and baptized on the same day by Pope Benedict XIII 37 years after his grandfather James II and VII lost the throne and ten years after his fathers failed attempt to regain it His father was James Francis Edward Stuart known to his opponents as the Old Pretender His mother was the Princess Maria Klementyna Sobieska granddaughter of the Polish King John III Sobieski

At the time of the French Revolution he lost the land and income he was given by the French king and spent a lot of his money helping Pope Pius VI This in addition to the seizure of his Frascati property by the French caused him to descend into poverty The British Minister in Venice arranged for Henry to receive an annuity of 4000 from King George III of Great Britain Although the British government said this as an act of charity Henry and the Jacobites called it to be a first installment on the money which was legally owed to him

Henry returned to Frascati in 1803 In September of that year he became the Dean of the College of Cardinals and hence Cardinal Bishop of Ostia and Velletri though he still lived in the episcopal palace at Frascati He died there on 13 July 1807 aged 82

Servant of God is a title given to individuals by different religions but in general the phrase is used to describe a person believed to be pious in his or her faith tradition In the Catholic Church it designates someone who is being investigated by the Church for possibly being recognized as a saint In the Eastern Orthodox churches this term is used to refer to any Eastern Orthodox Christian 

The Arabic name Abdullah  the Hebrew name Obadiah and the German name Gottschalk literally mean servant of God

Servant of God is the title given to a deceased person of the Catholic Church whose life and works are being investigated in consideration for official recognition by the Pope and the Catholic Church as a saint in Heaven The process for canonization is under the jurisdiction of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints 

The title Servant of God should not be confused with Servus Servorum Dei one of the titles of the Pope

Receiving the title Servant of God is the first of the four steps in the canonization process The next step is being declared Venerable upon a decree of heroicity or martyrdom by the honored This is followed by beatification with the title of Blessed after the confirmation of miracles attributed to the honored The final step is canonization where the honored would receive the title of Saint

The Venerable is used as a style in several Christian churches It is also the common English language translation of a number of Buddhist titles

In the Latin Rite of the Catholic Church The Venerable is the style used for a person who has been posthumously declared heroic in virtue during the investigation and process leading to possible canonization as a saint Before a person is considered to be venerable he or she must be declared as such by a proclamation approved by the Pope of having lived a life that was heroic in virtue the virtues being the Theological Virtues of faith hope and charity and the Cardinal Virtues of prudence justice fortitude and temperance The next step is beatification at which point the person is referred to as The Blessed and finally canonization at which point the person is referred to as Saint Two modern and well known examples of those who have been declared venerable are Popes John Paul II and Pius XII who were both declared venerable by Pope Benedict XVI in December 2009 and who are likely to be beatified soon

The 7 8th century English monk St Bede was referred to as being venerable soon after his death and by tradition is therefore often referred to as the Venerable Bede despite his also having been canonized St Bede was the first person to be recorded as The Venerable

Mike continued its westward movement and its intensification rate and became a typhoon early on November 9 the 18th of the season At this time a weakness in the subtropical ridge which kept the storm on its westward movement was bring Mike northward This did not occur and Mike kept its persistent westward motion On November 10 the typhoon rapidly intensified reaching peak winds of 165 mph later that day In a 48 hour period the typhoon deepened 99 millibars to a minimum central pressure of 915 mb

Mike retained its intensity of 165 mph winds for a day as it approached the Philippines Fortunately for the archipelago the combination of an eyewall replacement cycle and land interaction to its west weakened the super typhoon Nevertheless Mike still hit the eastern Philippines as a 140 mph typhoon on November 12 The typhoon further weakened to an 85 mph typhoon while crossing the islands but in the South China Sea conditions favored slight strengthening

Mike reached a secondary peak of 95 mph winds on November 14 but land interaction with Vietnam again weakened it to a minimal typhoon The forecast break in the subtropical ridge finally occurred on the 15th causing a northwest motion Vertical shear increased weakening Mike to a tropical storm on the 16th Early the next day the storm passed over western Hainan Island and degraded to a tropical depression that night After a brief passage over the Gulf of Tonkin Mike hit southern China where it dissipated on November 18

Negative feedback is a basic concept of cybernetics it is the basis of regulation and control It is important in engineering and physiology In biology and physiology negative feedback is known as homeostasis

Negative feedback occurs when the output of a system acts to oppose changes to the input of a system This has the result that the changes are made less and the system kept within limits The classic example is a central heating system which cuts off when a temperature sensor hits a pre set mark The negative feedback part is the thermostat

Virtually all aspect of living systems involve homeostasis and disease follows when any of these systems fail Examples blood pressure glucose level liver functions cell division and so on

Homeostasis was defined by Claude Bernard and later by Walter Bradford Cannon in 1926 1929 and 1932 is the property of a system either open or closed that regulates its internal environment and tends to maintain a stable constant condition The concept came from that of milieu interieur which was created by Claude Bernard and published in 1865

Systematics is the study of the diversification of life on the planet Earth both past and present and the relationships among living things through time 

Relationships are usually seen as evolutionary trees 

Phylogenies have two components branching order and branch length Phylogenetic trees of species and higher taxa are used to study the evolution of traits and the distribution of organisms Systematics is used to help us understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth

Systematic biology and taxonomy are terms that are often confused and used interchangeably They were defined as follows

 Systematics is the field which provides scientific names for organisms describes them preserves collections of them provides classifications for the organisms keys for their identification and data on their distributions investigates their evolutionary histories and considers their environmental adaptations Taxonomy is that part of systematics concerned with topics to above 

Artivism combine art and activism Artivism developed since the Berlin wall collapsed while the anti globalization and antiwar protests emerged and proliferated In most of the cases artivists attempt to push political agendas by the means of art and especially but not only street art

The Tiger Salamander is species of Mole Salamander The right name of this type of salamander is the Eastern Tiger Salamander to differentiate from other closely related species

Eastern tiger salamanders are big with a normal length of 68 inches They can grow up to 14 inches in length Grown ups are usually spotted with grey green or black and have large eyes They have short mouths big necks strong legs and long tails They eat small insects and worms Sometimes grown ups eat small frogs and baby mice

Adults are almost never seen in open fields and often live in holes that are usually 2 feet from the top Tiger salamanders almost always stay on land as adults and usually only return to the water to lay eggs But also they live in both land and water They also like to swim even if they are on land They also are good swimmers Like all ambystomatids they are extremely loyal to their birthplace and will travel long distances to go back However a single tiger salamander has only a 50 chance of laying eggs more than once in its lifetime Males bump a female to initiate mating and then deposit a spermatophore on the lake bottom The female picks up the packet and deposits the now fertilized eggs on vegetation Large scale captive breeding of Tiger salamanders has not been accomplished for unknown reasons

The larvae are entirely aquatic and are characterized by large gills on the outside and a big tail fin that begins just behind the head Arms are grown within a short time of coming out of their egg Some larvae especially in pools that are here one season and gone the next and in the north may metamorphose as soon as feasible These are known as small morph adults Other larvae especially in ancestral pools and warmer climates may not metamorphose until fully adult size These large larvae are usually known as waterdogs and are used many times in the fishing bait and pet trade Some populations may not metamorphose at all and become sexually mature while in their larval form These are the neotenes and are particularly common where terrestrial conditions are bad

While remaining common in many places Tiger Salamander numbers have gone down compared with old levels One of the largest threats to Tiger Salamander populations is wetland destruction andor changing Since they tend to breed in semipermanent wetlands baby Tiger Salamanders often experience mass deaths in association with pond drying Fishes that have moved to their ponds have also been known to reduce and levels they also experience reduced growth and longer larval periods The effect of agricultural pesticides in urine disruption has also been researched All of these issues have changed Tiger Salamander populations However Tiger Salamanders are only listed as endangered in Delaware New York New Jersey and Maryland protected in Arizona and of special concern in both North and South Carolina In November 2001 the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the Great Lakes number of the Tiger Salamander as being removed and the Southern Mountain population in British Columbias Okanagan as endangered in Canada Tiger salamander adults are also often sold as pets or used in research Nearly all such salamanders are wild caught

The California Tiger Salamander the Barred Tiger Salamander and the Plateau Tiger Salamander were all once subspecies of A tigrinum but are now separate species Genetic studies made it right to break up the first A tigrinum population even though there is some hybridization between groups

The Axolotl is also a relative of the Tiger Salamander Axolotls live in a neotenous state keeping most characteristics of their larval stage for their entire lifespan While they never change under natural conditions metamorphosis can be programmed in them resulting in a form very similar to the Mexican Tiger Salamander This is not however their natural condition and shortens their lifespan by a lot

Chinchilla is a small town of 3100 people in Queensland Australia It is 294 kms west of the state capital Brisbane The Chinchilla area was first explored by Europeans when Alan Cunningham made his journey from Sydney to explore the Darling Downs in 1827 Farmers arrived to settle the area in 1848 and set up Chinchilla Station This was part of the Wongongera Station which had been set up in 1846 It was probably named after the local Aboriginal word jinchilla meaning cypress pine

The railway from Brisbane reached Chinchilla in 1878 The area became well known for its dairy farming which became the main industry In the 1920s the Chinchilla area and more than 24 million hectares of Australia had become overgrown with an imported cactus called prickly pear In 1925 the Australian government imported a moth from Argentina cactoblastis which ate the prickly pear The Chinchilla Experimental Station was set up to breed these moths and release them At one time the station was sending out 14 million moth eggs a day

Built on the banks of Charleys Creek Chinchilla has been flooded several times During the 2010 2011 Queensland floods Chinchilla was flooded twice in two weeks

Deinosuchus is an extinct relative of the alligator which lived 80 to 73 million years ago in the Upper Cretaceous period 

The first remains were discovered in North Carolina in the 1850s but it was not until 1909 that the genus was named and described 

Additional fragments were discovered in the 1940s and were later made into an influential but inaccurate skull reconstruction at the American Museum of Natural History Knowledge of Deinosuchus is still incomplete but better skull material has been found in recent years

Although Deinosuchus was far larger than any modern crocodile or alligatormeasuring up to Convert12mftsigfig1abbronabbron and weighing up to convert85MTSTits overall appearance was fairly similar to its modern relatives 

It had large robust teeth that were built for crushing and its back was covered with thick round bony plates One study indicates that Deinosuchus may have lived for up to 50 years growing at a similar rate to that of modern crocodilians but maintaining this growth over a much longer period of time

Deinosuchus fossils have been found in ten US states as well as northern Mexico It lived on both sides of the Western Interior Seaway and was an ambush apex predator in the coastal regions of eastern North America 

Deinosuchus reached its largest size in its western habitat but the eastern populations were far more abundant Opinion remains divided as to whether these two populations represent separate species Deinosuchus was probably capable of killing and eating large dinosaurs It may have also fed upon sea turtles fish and other aquatic and terrestrial prey

Sarcosuchus is an extinct genus of giant crocodile It lived in the Lower Cretaceous of what is now Africa 135 to 112 million years ago 

Strictly speakingit was not a modern type of crocodile but a kind of pre crocodile These earlier types are called Crocodylomorphs True crocodiles arrived in the Upper Cretaceous 

Sarcosuchus was one of the largest giant crocodile like reptiles that ever lived It was almost twice as long as the modern saltwater crocodile and weighed approximately 8 to 10 tonnes 

Until recently all that was known of it was a few fossilised teeth and armour scutes which were discovered in the Sahara Desert in the 1940s or 1950s 

In 1997 and 2000 Paul Sereno discovered half a dozen new specimens including one with about half the skeleton intact and most of the spine All of the other giant crocodiles are known only from a few partial skulls so which is actually the biggest is an open question

Unlike other giant crododiles Sarcosuchus was a river predator As the overhanging jaw and stout teeth are designed for grabbing and crushing its primary prey may have been large animals and smaller dinosaurs which it ambushed dragged into the water crushed drowned and then tore apart

However the long thin snout of Sarcosuchus was very similar to the thin snouts of the modern gharial the false gharial and the slender snouted crocodile all of which are nearly exclusive fish eaters and incapable of tackling large prey This can be contrasted to both the modern Nile crocodile and the extinct Deinosuchus both of which have very broad heavy skulls suitable for dealing with large prey This coupled with the abundance of large lobe finned fish in its environment leads many to suggest that far from being a dinosaur killer Sarcosuchus was simply a large piscivore a scaled up version of the modern gharial

110 million years ago in the early Cretaceous the Sahara was still a great tropical plain dotted with lakes and crossed by rivers and streams that were lined with vegetation Based on the number of fossils discovered the aquatic Sarcosuchus was probably plentiful in these warm shallow freshwater habitats

Unlike modern true crocodiles which are very similar in size and shape to one another and tend to live in different areas Sarcosuchus was just one of many Crocodyliformes of different sizes and shapes all living in the same area Four other species of extinct Crocodyliformes were also discovered in the same rock formation along with the Sarcosuchus including a dwarf crocodile with a tiny 8 cm long skull They filled a diverse variety of ecological niches instead of competing with each other for resources

HMS Endeavour also known as HM Bark Endeavour was a British Royal Navy ship commanded by Lieutenant James Cook on his first voyage of discovery to Australia and New Zealand from 1769 to 1771

Launched in 1764 as a coal carrying ship Earl of Pembroke she was bought by the Navy in 1768 for a scientific mission to the Pacific Ocean She was also to search for the unknown southern land Terra Australis Incognita Renamed as His Majestys Bark the Endeavour she left Plymouth in August 1768 After sailing around Cape Horn she reached Tahiti to see the 1769 transit of Venus across the Sun She then set sail into the largely uncharted ocean to the south stopping at the Pacific islands of Huahine Borabora and Raiatea which Cook claimed for Great Britain In September 1769 she anchored off New Zealand the first European vessel to reach the islands since Abel Tasmans Heemskerck 127 years earlier In April 1770 Endeavour became the first ship to reach the east coast of Australia when Cook went ashore at what is now known as Botany Bay

Endeavour then sailed north along the Australian coast She ran into the Great Barrier Reef near Cape Tribulation The crew were able to get the ship onto a beach on the mainland This is now the site of the town of Cooktown They stayed for seven weeks so that basic repairs could be made to her hull On 10 October 1770 she limped into port in Batavia in the Dutch East Indies for more substantial repairs She left on 26 December rounded the Cape of Good Hope on 13 March 1771 and reached the English port of Dover on 12 July having been at sea for nearly three years

The Endeavour spent the next three years shipping Navy stores to the Falkland Islands She was renamed and sold in 1775 but was used as a troop transport during the American Revolutionary War She sunk in a blockade of Narragansett Bay Rhode Island in 1778 Her wreck has not been found but relics including six of her cannons and an anchor are displayed at maritime museums worldwide A full size working copy of Endeavour was launched in 1994 and is berthed alongside the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney Harbour

The largest bony fish of all time was Leedsichthys problematicus from the Middle Jurassic at around convert17mft0 long Earlier claims have been scaled down

The extinct megatoothed shark C megalodon is by far the biggest and most powerful shark that ever lived This giant shark reached a length of more than convert16mftlkon Larger individuals are possible

The largest known crocodilian is likely Sarcosuchus imperator at convert12mft0 long and weighing 8 tonnes A close contender in size is Deinosuchus also estimated at around convert12mft0

The largest pterosaur was Quetzalcoatlus northropi at 127 kg and with a wingspan of 11 m Another close contender is Hatzegopteryx also with a wingspan of 11 m this estimate is based on a skull 3 m long

A mega sauropod Amphicoelias fragillimus is a contender for the largest dinosaur in history It has been estimated at convert58mft0 in length and convert122400kglb in weight Unfortunately the fossil remains of this dinosaur have been lost 

However a titanosaurid Bruhathkayosaurus has been estimated at convert395 428mftlkon in length and 159200 metric tons in weight making it possibly larger than A fragillimus and potentially rival the modern blue whale in size However this animal is known from scanty evidence Another notably large titanosaurid is Argentinosaurus which is known from partially preserved remains This sauropod has been estimated to be convert30 37mftlkon long and around 7399 metric tons in weight Some other sauropods Supersaurus Sauroposeidon and Seismosaurus probably rival Argentinosaurus in size

The very largest ornithopods like Zhuchengosaurus and Shantungosaurus were as heavy as medium sized sauropods at up to 23 metric tons but never grew far beyond 15 meters The largest is probably Zhuchengosaurus at convert165mft0 in length However Lambeosaurus laticaudus appears to be close contender at around convert15 164mftlkon in length 

The largest known theropod is Spinosaurus aegyptiacus estimated at convert152 174mftlkon in length and around 79 metric tons in weight Spinosaurus aegyptiacus is also recognized as the largest terrestrial predator yet known 

A close contender in size is a giant theropod from South America Giganotosaurus carolinii whose holotype specimen is estimated at convert125mft0 in length and another specimen is estimated at convert135mft0 in length A study however presents Carcharodontosaurus as a close contender in size to Spinosaurus aegyptiacus Some other notable giant theropods may also have rivaled these giant theropods in size Another very large theropod was Deinocheirus being convert3mft0 tall at hips and weighing up to 16000 pounds The largest dromaeosaurid is Utahraptor In addition to being the largest known dromaeosaurid it was also the largest known deinonychosaur and the largest known paravian

Late on September 24 2006 the Joint Typhoon Warning Center noted that an area of convection had persisted about 460 NM to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines The JTWC assessed the development of a significant Tropical cyclone as fair This was because convection was beginning to flare up near a developing Low Level Circulation Center the JTWC also noted that the disturbance had a broad circulation Early the next day both the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration designated the Tropical disturbance as a Tropical Depression with PAGASA assigning the local name of Tropical Depression Milenyo to the depression Later that morning the JTWC reassessed the potential of the disturbance forming into a significant tropical Cyclone within 24 hours as good and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the developing disturbance Early that afternoon the JTWC started to issue advisories on the disturbance and designated it as Tropical Depression 18W Later that day the JTWC upgraded as the depression moved towards the west it was upgraded to a Tropical Storm by the JTWC Early on September 26 the JMA also upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and assigned the international name of Xangsane

Later on September 26 the JMA upgraded Xangsane to a severe tropical storm whilst six hours later both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded Xangsane to typhoon with the JTWC reporting wind speeds equivalent to a category one typhoon Early the next day Xangsane was upgraded to a category 2 typhoon and then over the next six hours Xangsane rapidly intensified into a category 4 typhoon with wind speeds of 115 kts Meanwhile the JMA reported that Xangsane had reached its peak wind speeds of 85 kts Early that afternoon the JTWC reported that Xangsane had reached its peak wind speeds of 125 kts

Xangsane then passed through the Philippine islands wreaking havoc and becoming the strongest typhoon to directly impact Metro Manila in eleven years As it entered the South China Sea as a weak typhoon it began to re intensify reaching its secondary peak strength shortly before landfall at Danang Vietnam on October 1 The JTWC ceased advisories after landfall while the JMA carried the storm inland until it was over Thailand as a tropical depression It remained as a low pressure area over central Indochina on the JMAs weather charts for several days while the US Navys Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting system carried the remnants of Xangsane into the Bay of BengalCitation neededdateDecember 2008

On September 27 PAGASA issued Storm Signal Number 3 a warning for winds of 100 185 kmh for areas of southern Luzon Storm Signal Number 2 for winds of 60 100 kmh was raised for northern Samar Island and central Luzon Storm Signal Number 1 was issued for northwestern Luzon including Metro Manila and northern Visayas including the rest of Samar Island Schools in the warned area were suspended and airports and seaports were closed Philippine Airlines cancelled over half of its flights to and from Ninoy Aquino International Airport for September 28 and various transit services also suspended service Metro Manila and the Tagalog provinces were warned of possible flooding and strong winds

When it became clear that Xangsane would approach the Capital PAGASA upgraded the warning for Manila and central Luzon to Storm Signal Number 3 on September 28 All the storm signals were discontinued later that day

The stamen is the male reproductive organ of a flower It produces the pollen The stamen has two parts the anther and the stalk

The anther contains microsporangia Each microsporangium contains pollen mother cells These undergo meiosis and produce pollen grains which contain the male gametes

The pollen grains are actually haploid male gametophytes

The pollen is released by the opening of the anther The pollen is carried by some agent to the receptive surface of the carpel of the same or another flower This process is known as pollination After successful pollination the pollen grain completes its development by growing a pollen tube and undergoing mitosis to produce two male gametes

The 2011 Pacific typhoon season is a current event in which tropical cyclones form in the Western Pacific Ocean The season will run throughout 2011 with most tropical cyclones forming between May and November The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean to the north of the equator between 100th meridian east and the 180th meridian Within the Northwestern Pacific Ocean there are two separate agencies who assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names The Japan Meteorological Agency will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10 minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65 kmh anywhere in the basin Whilst the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135E and 115E and between 5N 25N even if the cyclone has had a name assigned to it by the Japan Meteorological Agency Tropical depressions that are monitored by the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center are given a number with a W suffix On average 27 storms form in this basin every year 

During each season several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones tropical storms and typhoons will form during a season andor how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country

Since the 2000 Pacific typhoon season the Guy Carpenter Asia Pacific Climate Impact Centre of the City University of Hong Kong have issued forecasts of activity for each upcoming typhoon season On May 4 and July 5 2011 the GCACIC issued forecasts which predicted the amount of tropical cyclones tropical storms and typhoons there would be during 2011 as well as for how many tropical cyclones will make landfall on China or pass within 100 km of the Korean Peninsula or Japan

This season the GCACIC predicted in May that 31 tropical cyclones 27 tropical storms and 17 typhoons would either form or move into the North Western Pacific this year In their July forecast the GCACIC lowered their prediction for the number of tropical storms developing into a typhoon by one which they blamed on the strength of the India Burma trough For Southern China the GCACIC predicted in May that seven tropical cyclones would make landfall during the year compared to an average of five They further predicted that five of the cyclones would make landfall on Southern China between May and August while the other two would landfall between September and December After two tropical cyclones had made landfall on Southern China during June the July GCACIC forecast predicted that seven tropical cyclones would make landfall during the main season between July and December For the Korean Peninsular and Japan the GCACIC predicted in May that six tropical cyclones would affect either Japan or the peninsular during the year compared to an average of four and predicted that there would be an above average amount of landfalls on Japan After three tropical cyclones affected the region in May and June the GCACIC predicted that seven tropical cyclones would affect either the Korean Peninsular or Japan during the main part of the season

Since the 2000 Pacific typhoon season the Tropical Storm Risk Consortium of University College London have issued forecasts of activity for each upcoming typhoon season Forecasts on the number of tropical storms typhoons and intense typhoons there would be during 2011 in the Western Pacific were released in March May July and August In all off their forecasts this year TSR predicted that the season would see activity close to the average with 28 tropical storms 18 typhoons and 8 intense typhoons developing during the season

On April 1 the Japan Meteorological Agency and Joint Typhoon Warning Center began monitoring an area of low pressure associated with intermittent convection over the South China Sea roughly 535 km east southeast of Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam The former of these two agencies immediately declared the system a tropical depression the first of the 2011 season Following further development of the system most notably convective banding around the low level circulation center the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the storm Early on April 2 the agency followed through with this alert and designated the low as Tropical Depression 01W However within hours of this the depression became devoid of convection as wind shear buffeted the system This prevented the cyclone from intensifying beyond depression status as it remained nearly stationary Failing to regain convection by April 3 the depression degenerated into a remnant low and the final advisory from the JTWC was issued The JMA continued to monitor the system as a tropical depression for another day before issuing their last warning on the system

On March 30 the JMA began monitoring an area of low pressure located southwest of Yap By April 2 the system developed a low level circulation though convection appeared disorganized Exhibiting good outflow within a region of weak wind shear the low was anticipated to develop further over the following several days as it drifted west northwestward After briefly stalling early on April 3 the storm turned towards the east Additionally the JMA considered the system sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression As the system was located to the west of 135E PAGASA began issuing advisories on the depression as well assigning it the name Amang Tracking northeastward the depression eventually developed enough convection to be declared Tropical Depression 02W by the JTWC on April 4 However this was expected to be brief as a decaying frontal boundary approached from the west and prompted the system to undergo an extratropical transition This intensification prompted the National Weather Service in Tiyan Guam to issue a tropical storm warning for the islands of Agrihan Pagan and Alamagan Interacting with the front and high wind shear the system became partially exposed and elongated as it moved over cooler waters Early on April 6 the JTWC issued their final advisory on the depression as it began to dissipate over open waters Following degradation of the storms structure the NWS discontinued warnings for the Mariana Islands on April 6 The JMA continued to monitor the system for several more hours before ceasing advisories on it as well

Early of May 4 an area of low pressure formed about 140 km to the west of Palau Island On that same day the low pressure starts to strengthen rapidly with improved LLCC tightlywrapped shallow convective banding and a welldefined center On the next day the low pressure starts to move northwest in general direction to the seas east of Philippine Islands However it remained almost stationary by afternoon due to the influence of high pressure that located in the northeast of the system By that time its LLCC starts to become elongated and the system was also located in favorable sea surface temperatures with low vertical wind shear Later of that day its LLCC starts to consolidate again and the system starts to move northwest slowly whilst the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the system into a tropical depression In the afternoon of May 6 Joint Typhoon Warning Center upgraded the low pressure into a tropical depression In the same evening PAGASA upgraded the low pressure into a tropical depression and assigned its local name Bebeng In the afternoon of May 7 JMA upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm and assigned the name Aere During the early morning of May 12 the JMA downgraded Aere to a tropical depression while south of Kyushu Island

Throughout the Philippines multiple agencies activated their emergency plans as the storm approached The Armed Forces of the Philippines the Philippine National Police and the Philippine Coast Guard were all placed on standby to deploy to areas struck by Aere once the storm passed Several ports were affected by the storm stranding 1379 passengers by the afternoon of May 7 According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council at least 35 people have been killed and two more are missing as a result of Aere Agricultural losses are estimated at PHP137 billion Widespread flooding and landslides damaged homes blocked off roads and severed communications In Catarman Northern Samar convert3774mminabbron of rain fell in just 24 hours resulted in significant flash flooding

On May 19 the JTWC reported that an area of low pressure had persisted about 510 km to the southeast of Yap As the system moved towards the northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge of high pressure it rapidly consolidated in an area of light to moderate vertical windshear The JMA then started to monitor the system as a tropical depression later that day before the JTWC designated it as Tropical Depression 04W early on May 20 The JTWC then reported later that day that the depression had intensified into a tropical storm with windspeeds of 65 kmh however it later reported that it had overestimated the windspeeds and consequently lowered the storms status to a tropical depression based on observations from Yap island Late on May 21 both the JMA and the JTWC reported that the depression had now become a tropical storm with the JMA naming it as Songda Over the next couple of days the system gradually intensified further while moving northwest into PAGASAs area of responsibility PAGASA named it as Chedeng At 1200 UTC on May 24 the JTWC reported that Songda had intensified into a typhoon 12 hours later the JMA followed suit while the system was located about 800 km to the southeast of Manila in the Philippines It rapidly intensified into a Category 5 typhoon In the afternoon of May 29 Songda became extratropical south of Shikoku IslandCitation neededdateJune 2011

Although Songda remained offshore heavy rains within the typhoons outer bands impacted the Philippines causing significant flash flooding and landslides Four fatalities are attributed to the system there Further north Okinawa experience intense wind gusts measured up to 198 kmh along with torrential rain Extensive damage took place across the area with losses reaching 232 billion however there were no fatalities As it became extratropical Songda brought heavy rains from Kyushu to eastern Honshu causing significant flooding At least 13 people were killed in the country and an estimated 400000 had to be evacuated around Tokyo alone

During the evening of May 31 the JMA upgraded an area of low pressure to a tropical depression Initially the tropical depression was located about 400 km south west of Hong Kong The system did not develop further and was downgraded to an area of low pressure by the JMA on June 2

On early June 8 an area of low pressure formed about 10 km west of Cebu City Philippines As it moved towards the Mindoro Strait the JMA and JTWC began to monitor the system In the early morning hours of June 9 the Philippines PAGASA upgraded the system to a tropical depression and reported the storm center to be about 450 km west of Dagupan City in the Philippines The next day the JMA and JTWC upgraded the tropical depression into a tropical storm with the JMA naming it Sarika During the morning of June 11 the JTWC downgraded Sarika to a tropical depression after making landfall in Shantou China The JTWC soon issued their final advisory on Sarika Sarika made landfall on mainland China with winds of 75 kmh As a result of the storm 23 people were killed in Xianning and ten more were declared missing Damages from Sarika are estimated at 248 million

Early June 15 an area of low pressure area embedded along the Intertropical Convergence Zone located about 250 km west of Puerto Princesa Palawan As is moved towards the South China Sea both the JMA and the JTWC started monitoring it During the morning of June 15 the JMA upgraded it into a tropical depression Due to an anticyclone the system dissipated during the early morning of June 16as it made landfall in Hong KongCitation neededdateJuly 2011

On June 15 the JTWC started to monitor an area of disturbed weather that was located about 1350 km to the southeast of Manila Philippines Over the next couple of days the system gradually developed further before late on June 16 the JMA JTWC and PAGASA all reported that the system had developed into a tropical depression with PAGASA naming it as Egay Egay continued to develop during June 17 as it moved towards the northeast and on June 18 the JTWC reported that Egay had intensified into a tropical storm Late on June 19 the JTWC downgraded Egay to a tropical depression but they upgraded Egay again to a tropical storm on June 20 Early on June 20 the JTWC downgraded Egay to a tropical depression again On June 21 the JMA upgraded the system into a tropical storm and named it Haima with the JTWC following suit on June 22

During the evening of June 23 the JTWC downgraded Haima to a tropical depression after making landfall in Zhanjiang Guangdong China but upgraded it to a tropical storm again on June 24 Early on June 25 Haima became a tropical depression after moving inland in Vietnam As it made landfall over Hanoi Vietnam the JTWC and the Hong Kong Observatory downgraded Haima to a low pressure area

Early on June 20 and area of low pressure about 760 km east of the Philippines began to be monitored by both the JTWC and JMA That evening the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert Soon afterwards PAGASA upgraded the system into a tropical depression naming it as Falcon At the time of the upgrade Falcon was located about 1000 km east northeast of Cebu City During the evening of June 21 the JTWC also reported that Falcon had strengthened into a tropical depression On June 22 both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded Falcon into a tropical storm and the JMA named it Meari Meari leaves Philippines with 2 deaths and 5 missing In the afternoon on June 24 the JMA upgraded Meari to a severe tropical storm as it passed Okinawa Japan

On June 26 Meari rapidly moved to the Yellow Sea but slowly passed Weihai Shandong China and then the JMA downgraded Meari to a tropical storm on the same day On June 27 the JTWC downgraded Meari to a tropical depression before it made landfall in North Korea and the JMA reported that Meari became a low pressure area later

Heavy rains from the storms outer bands triggered significant flooding and landslides in South Korea At least nine people were killed and three others were reported missing across the country In North Korea heavy rains from the storm caused widespread flooding and damage At least 160 homes were destroyed and 50000 hectares of crops submerged Several reports of confirmed fatalities arose but no details on how many were given to news agencies

Late July 9 an area of low pressure area formed about 300 km east of Aurora as it moves Northwest it has been located 500 km east southeast of Basco BatanesClarifydateJuly 2011 On the morning of July 9 JMA upgraded the low pressure area into a tropical depression and it was located 450 km northeast of Cagayan In the afternoon PAGASA upgraded the low pressure area into a tropical depression and named it Goring After moving to Fujian China it dissipated on the evening on July 10

On July 11 both the JMA and JTWC upgraded a tropical disturbance to a tropical depression which was located near Minamitorishima On July 12 both the JMA and JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Ma on Early on July 13 the JMA upgraded Ma on to a severe tropical storm Late on July 13 both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded Ma on to a typhoon After absorbing Tokage Ma on reached its peak strength on July 16 The PAGASA named it Ineng on July 17

As Ma on was affecting Japan the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm in the evening on July 19 Ma on made landfall in Tokushima later The JMA downgraded Ma on to a severe tropical storm after it made landfall in Wakayama early on July 20 The JTWC downgraded Ma on to a tropical depression on July 21 and discontinued advisories the following day The JMA downgraded Ma on to a tropical storm early on July 23 On July 24 Ma on weakened into an extratropical cyclone east of the Thoku region

A low pressure area has formed about 740 km north northwest of Palau Early on July 14 the JMA upgraded it into a tropical depression and the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert On July 15 the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Tokage and the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical depression later PAGASA also upgraded it to a tropical depression and named it Hanna Due to the Fujiwhara effect Typhoon Ma on the powerful storm just northeast of Tokage later weakened Tokage to a tropical depression and completely absorbed it early on July 16

Originally a low pressure area the JMA reported that a tropical depression formed from it inland in Guangdong China on July 16 On July 17 the depression dissipated

Originally a low pressure area the JMA reported that a tropical depression formed from it in the Gulf of Tonkin near Guangdong China on July 16 However it quickly dissipated after only six hours

Early on July 22 an area of low pressure formed to the east of Philippines The system gradually drifted west over the next few days and late on July 24 the Joint Typhoon Warning Center Started Monitoring the system as a Tropical Depression Early the next day the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the area of low pressure into a Tropical Depression A few hours later the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration started monitoring the system as a Tropical Depression and named it Juaning The system continued to drift westwards and strengthened rapidly that on midnight that day the JMA furhter upgraded the system into a Tropical Storm naming it Nock Ten Early on July 27 the JMA reported that Nock ten continued to strengthen and upgraded it into a Severe Tropical Storm A few hours later the JTWC reported that Nock ten rapidly intensified to a category 1 typhoon and made its landfall over northern Aurora and started weakening Later the same day the JMA reported that Nock ten has exited the Luzon island at Candon maintaining severe tropical storm strength However overnight the storm rapidly weakened and the JMA downgraded it into a minor tropical storm the next day However on July 29 the storm gradually regained strength and approached south China coast at Qionghai China Later that day the storm strengthened over land and headed north towards Hainans provincial capital region Haikou Over the next day the storm drifted to the west and made landfall over Northern Vietnam The storm weakened rapidly and at midnight that day the JMA issuing their final warning on the system Downgraded it into a tropical low 

The provinces of Albay and Camarines were reported to be completely flooded by the rain Minor damage to rice crops was reported More heavier rains were expected throughout the day as the system has exited land into south china sea and will soon start reintensifying The number of missing was also pushed up to 31 after 25 crewmembers of a fishing boat were reported missing when their fishing boat was caught in the storm off Masbate Nock ten suspended all classes in Luzon from Pre school to college levels on July 26 and 27 In Northern Luzon Nock ten poured down heavy rainfall becoming widespread flooding in the area The national roads were impassable and landslides were also reported About 26 domestic flights were cancelled from July 26 to 27 due to heavy rains and strong winds

Late on July 23 an area of low pressure formed to the southeast of Chuuk the system gradually drifted to the west and on July 25 the JTWC upgraded the low pressure area to a tropical depression At that time it was located approximately convert505nmi to the west of Guam At midnight that day the JMA started monitoring the system as a tropical depression Early on July 28 the JTWC upgraded the system into a Tropical Storm A few hours later the JMA too upgraded the system to a tropical storm naming it Muifa Soon the storm moved into the Philippine Area of Responsibility and the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration named it Kabayan The storm gradually drifted north over the next day maintaining strength On the night of July 29 Muifa was upgraded into a Severe Tropical Storm Overnight the storm strengthened rapidly and was upgraded into a Typhoon the next morning The storm strengthened so rapidly and the JTWC reported that the storms peak winds were reaching convert140kn as it strengthened into a Category 5 Typhoon However the typhoon couldnt maintain Category 5 strength for a long time According to the JTWC On July 31 the typhoon interacted with an upper level trough and weakened into a Category 4 Typhoon on the SSHS The system gradually moved north then turned west and drifted towards Okinawa before turning northwest again when it was finally downgraded into a Tropical Storm by the JTWC Soon afterwards the JMA too downgraded Muifa to a Severe Tropical storm After weakening to a tropical storm Muifa made landfall at the estuary of the Yalu River on August 8 and the JTWC issued the final warning Early on August 9 Muifa weakened to a tropical depression in Northeast China and became a low pressure area later

Muifa killed 2 men as their boat was capsized in the vicinity of Hagonoy Bulacan and Pampanga Delta Due to the southwest monsoon enhanced by Muifa it caused heavy rains in several parts of Luzon including Metro Manila Early of August 2 the Malacaang Palace suspended government offices and Pre school to college level in NCR Nearby provinces like Calabarzon also suspended their classes In Marikina 200 residents or 31 families living in communities along the Marikina River have sought shelter in evacuation centers

On July 28 an area of low pressure formed approximately convert85nmi to the West of Guam Over the next few days the system gradually drifted to the northwest and on July 31 the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded the low into a Tropical Depression to the west of Philippines Later that day The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration started monitoring the system as a tropical depression and named it Lando The system slowly tracked northward However on the next day due to Fujiwhara effect Typhoon Muifa the much more powerful system just to the north east of Lando weakened Lando As a result the PAGASA issued their final warning on the system downgrading it to a tropical low But despite this Tropical Depression Lando regenerated soon afterwards and the JMA reissued their advisories on Lando Tropical Depression Lando continued to persist for another day as it slowly tracked eastward just off the western coast of Luzon Then during the late afternoon of August 2 the JMA stopped tracking Lando as it had dissipated Early on August 3 the remmants of Tropical Depression Lando dissipated completely without ever reaching Luzon

Early on August 3 the Japan Meteorological Agency upgraded an area of low pressure near Wake Island to a tropical depression The system intensified rapidly and just 6 hours later the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm naming it Merbok Soon the Joint Typhoon Warning Center started monitoring the system as a tropical depression and upgraded it to a tropical storm later Merbok began to move westward slowly but soon afterwards it turned northwest and gradually drifted in that direction Late on August 5 the JMA upgraded Merbok into a Severe Tropical Storm Early on August 6 the JTWC upgraded Merbok into a Category 1 Typhoon convert830nmi East southeast of Tokyo Japan Early the next day the storms winds reached a peak of convert80kn on the SSHS Later that day the system was caught in a moderate Vertical Wind Shear and started weakening On August 8 the system started accelerating towards north at the speed of convert20kn and was gradually diminishing because of colder and colder sea surface temperatures and unfavorable conditions As a result the JMA reporting that the system was no longer a Severe Tropical Storm downgraded Merbok to a Tropical Storm Late on that day the system started showing extratropical characteristics as the convection near the eye dissipated rapidly Thus the JTWC issued their final warning on the system reporting that the system was no longer tropical Later the JMA issuing their final warning on the system reported that the system was no longer tropical 

Early on August 3 a tropical depression formed near the Bonin Islands The system slowly began to track northwestwards towards Japan Late on August 4 the system dissipated near the Kii Peninsula

Late on August 8 the JMA upgraded a low pressure area to a tropical depression west of Guam and the JTWC issued a TCFA The system gradually drifted north and early on August 10 the JTWC started monitoring the system as a tropical depression and designated it with 13W Initially the JMA predicted the system to strengthen into a tropical storm but on August 11 as it moved further north into cool waters and experienced unfavourable conditions the JMA issued their final advisory Later the JTWC too issued their final warning on the system reporting that it has moved into a subtropical ridge and was expected to dissipate into a remnant low However the JMA continued to track the remants as a weak tropical depression over the next few days until the system dissipated on August 15

Late on August 8 the JMA upgraded an area of low pressure to a tropical depression to the northwest of Minamitorishima The system gradually moved to the northeast On August 10 the system was caught in a moderate vertical wind shear and due to cold sea surface temperature the system dissipated into a remnant low 

On August 19 a low pressure area developed east northeast of Guam Early on August 20 the system developed a broad area of low level circulation center and a good divergence aloft becoming more well defined Later that day the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression southeast of the Bonin Islands On August 22 the system started interacting with an anticyclone and was exposed to a strong vertical wind shear prompting the JMA to stop monitoring the system as a tropical depression as the system dissipated to a remnant low However at midnight the same day the remnants regenerated and the JMA started tracking the system as a tropical depression again until it last appeared near Okinawa Japan on August 25 as the system dissipated completely

Late on August 19 an area of low pressure developed north of Palau Early on August 20 the system became more better organized and developed a low level circulation center The system then turned north and continued to drift north until on August 21 when the JMA upgraded the low pressure area to a tropical depression east of Philippines The JTWC also issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system reporting that the system was becoming more well organized Later that day the PAGASA started monitoring the system as a tropical depression and named it Mina Late on August 22 the system became more well organized prompting the JTWC to initiate advisories on the system designating it with 14W On August 23 the JMA upgraded 14W to a tropical storm naming it Nanmadol Overnight the system continued to intensify and early on August 24 the JMA upgraded Nanmadol to a severe tropical storm Later that day convective banding improved and Nanmadol developed an eye like feature As a result Nanmadol continued to intensify rapidly and became a typhoon by midnight that day Nanmadol continued to drift north east and made landfall over Gonzaga Cagayan Philippines with strong winds of over convert95kn Nanmadol weakened significantly after interacting with land and early on August 28 the JMA downgraded Nanmadol to a severe tropical storm Late on August 28 Nanmadol made its second landfall over Taimali in the Taitung County of Taiwan and started weakening Landfall weakened the system rapidly prompting the JMA to downgrade Nanmadol to a tropical storm with winds of under convert45kn Soon it started experiencing strong wind shear and continued weakening The shear pushed convection approximately convert70kn south of the LLCC The system also accelerated towards China at convert08kn and weakened to a minimal tropical storm After its third landfall over Fujian China Nanmadol weakened rapidly prompting both the JTWC and the JMA to issue their final warnings on the system

On August 27 five people died after Nanmadol caused landslides At least two Filipino fishermen were reported to be missing after Nanmadols strong winds whipped up large waves

Late on August 22 an area of low pressure developed to the west of Guam At midnight that day the system became sufficiently well organized that the JMA started tracking it as a tropical depression On August 23 the system moved into an environment of low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures prompting the JTWC to issued a TCFA on it By August 25 the system grew strong enough that the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm naming it Talas Later that day the JTWC followed suit and initiated advisories on Talas Talas continued to strengthen and by midnight that day it became a severe tropical storm Over the next few days Talas continued to drift north very slowly until late on August 29 when the JMA upgraded Talas to a typhoon Soon a subtropical ridge to the west of the storm weakened and the subtropical ridge to the east of the system pushed Talas to the west As a result Talas accelerated towards the west maintaining strength and outflow An upper level cyclone over the system suppressed the convection and kept it from reaching the center Therefore Talas remained weak and did not strengthen further Convection never managed to consolidate the center and convective banding remained well away from the fully exposed low level circulation center The convective banding continued to expand more and more with the outer rainbands already brushing parts of Japan Coastal areas in the nation have already reported gale force winds several hours before landfall while the Omega block continued to drive Talas towards the nation Land interaction weakened Talas prompting the JMA to downgrade Talas from a typhoon to a severe tropical storm with winds of under convert60kn Early on September 3 Talas made landfall over Aki Japan After landfall Talas accelerated north at over convert13kn and its central convection became significantly eroded and was displaced to the north east as Talas was exposed to a very strong wind shear of over convert50kn that made the LLCC very distorted and difficult to pin point Talas was embedded in a baroclinic zone and the JTWC anticipated an extratropical transition which prompted them to issue their final warning on the system On September 5 the JMA issued their final warning on the system reporting that Talas has become extratropical on the Sea of Japan 

On September 1 a low pressure area formed to the northeast of Guam On the next day the JMA started monitoring the low pressure area as a tropical depression Soon the system developed a well defined but partially exposed low level circulation center prompting the JTWC to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert On September 3 the central convection around the LLCC deepened with favorable equatoward outflow prompting the JTWC to initiate advisories on the system designating it with 16W Soon 16W accelerated north at over convert18kn with its LLCC being being consolidated by convection Also data from an ASCAT scatterometer pass revealed that the LLCC was tightly wrapped with convert40kn winds prompting the JTWC to upgrade 16W to a tropical storm An Aqua microwave imagery depicted that the LLCC remained partially exposed though consolidated with deep central convection Albeit in an area of moderate vertical wind shear an anticyclone enhanced north eastward outflow while a tropical upper tropospheric trough suppressed the outflow towards the west As 16W continued to accelerate north at a staggering convert35kn convective banding became fragmented and detached behind the main area of central convection However the outflow to the southeast of the storm remained favorable and 16W continued to strengthen prompting the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm naming it Noru

Late on September 4 Norus LLCC that remained partially exposed since formation unexpectedly became elongated and started weakening However data from an ASCAT scatterometer pass depicted that the LLCC had an expansive area of strong tropical storm force winds along the eastern and northern peripheries A TUTT cell wrapped the east and northeastern sides of Noru suppressing its outflow Soon the convective banding which was already fragmented started becoming disorganized causing Noru to start weakening A new TUTT cell developed over the system and started restraining outflow As a result the LLCC became fully exposed and virtually lacked convection The TUTT cell moved over Noru snuffing outflow in all directions and sheared the remnant central convection prompting the JTWC to downgrade Noru to a tropical depression However data from an scatterometer pass depicted that Noru had winds of over convert35kn near the center prompting the JTWC to reupgrade the system to a tropical storm On September 5 Noru started to appear like a hybrid system primarily showing subtropical characteristics The JTWC added that Noru was undergoing an extratropical transition and would become an extratropical cyclone within 24 hours Noru continued to transition into an extratropical cyclone with a broadening LLCC and weaker winds at the core being embedded in an upper level trough that suppressed the formation of convection within the LLCC With the extratropical transition well underway Noru drifted into an area of low sea surface temperatures and started weakening prompting the JTWC to downgrade Noru to a tropical depression On September 6 Noru finished the extratropical transition becoming an extratropical cyclone east southeast of Hokkaido Japan prompting the JMA and the JTWC to issue their final warning on the system 

Late on September 4 an area of low pressure developed to the southeast of Okinawa Japan Over the next two days the system drifted north and developed a well defined LLCC with organized convective banding prompting the JMA to upgrade the low pressure area to a tropical depression On September 7 convection consolidated the low level circulation center very well with tightly curved banding wrapped into it Also high sea surface temperatures and very low wind shear caused the system to undergo rapid deepening prior to which the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Kulap However the system stopped strengthening soon after as the LLCC became partially exposed and the convection was displaced to the south Kulap remained small in size and dry air entering from the western periphery kept it from strengthening further Wind shear increased pushing convection approximately convert180nmi south of the LLCC Also Kulap was located beneath a tropical upper tropospheric trough that caused subsidence A mid level subtropical steering ridge cuased Kulap to track in a northwestward direction On September 8 Kulap moved into the east northeast periphery of the Philippine Area of Responsibility prompting the PAGASA to start issuing advisories on the system naming it Nonoy However Kulap quickly accelerated north and exited the PAR on the same evening prompting the PAGASA to issued their final advisory on the system After increasing wind shear caused further weakening the JTWC downgraded Kulap to a tropical depression late on September 8 Early on September 10 the JMA too downgraded Kulap to a tropical depression and continued to track Kulaps remnants as a tropical depression until it finally dissipated early on September 11

Early on September 8 a cluster of thunderstorms came together as a low pressure area with imporoving outflow and a developing low level circulation center Later that day the JMA upgraded the low pressure area to a tropical depression north northeast of the Northern Mariana Islands Over the next two days the system gradually drifted west and intensified slightly prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on it Convection gradually consolidated the LLCC and the JTWC initiated advisories on the system on September 11 designating it with 18W The next day the depression drifted into the Philippine Area of Responsibility and the PAGASA initiated advisories on the depression naming it Onyok However just as similar to Kulap Onyok also exited the PAR in 6 hours from entering the region In an advisory the JTWC reported that there were at least two more vortices associated with the system that caused an abrupt erratic movement However being located in an area of warm sea surface temperatures and low vertical wind shear the depression continued to strengthen and on September 13 the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and named it Roke On September 17 Roke developed a small deep convective eye promoting the JMA to upgrade Roke to a severe tropical storm with winds of over convert50kn Between September 19 and 20 Roke underwent Explosive intensification a more extreme case of rapid deepening that involves a tropical cyclone deepening at a rate of at least 25 mbar per hour for a minimum of 12 hours Also they added that Roke developed a convert10nmi eye and a good poleward outflow channel On September 21 Typhoon Roke made landfall over Hamamatsu Japan at about 500 UTC Soon Roke started weakening as cloud tops started getting warmed up and eye diameter started to decrease However the system still maintained a near radial outflow and the convective structure continued to remain organized that kept Roke from dissipating rapidly Although Roke entered a de intensification phase it still had plenty of strength that posed a great threat to regions of Japan Being located approximately convert330nmi southwest of Yokosuka Kanagawa the typhoon accelerated north northwestward at approximately convert16kn with winds of over convert100kn being a Category 3 typhoon on the SSHS Being embedded in the baroclinic zone Roke started its extratropical transition Also land interaction severely weakened the storm to a minimal Category 1 typhoon with winds of under convert70kn Only six hours later the storm further weakened and accelerated northeastward at approximately convert31kn with rapidly dissipating deep convection completely sheared to the northeast of the LLCC As a result the JTWC ceased advisories on the storm as it became fully extratropical

Early on September 13 a low pressure area formed northeast of the Northern Mariana Islands The system gradually drifted north and steadily intensified until the next day when the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression Later on September 14 the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system reporting that the system could intensify into a tropical storm within 24 hours from then Convection rapidly consolidated the center with persistent deep convection around the north eastern periphery prompting the JTWC to initiate advisories on the system designating it with 19W Soon the JMA also initiated advisories on the system upgrading it to Tropical Storm Sonca In the begging Sonca seemed to have intensified rapidly since formation however soon the storm weakened back to a minimal tropical storm because of dry air entering the LLCC that caused it to elongate and weaken However that was not for too long as vigorous convection persisted over the well defined LLCC with tightly curved banding wrapped in Sonca continued to strengthen gradually and the JTWC reported winds of at least convert50kn near the center As Sonca continued to strengthen and the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm on September 17 Later that day Sonca developed a large convert10nmi ragged eye with deep convective banding tightly wrapped into it As a result Sonca strengthened more rapidly and by early the next day it became a typhoon On September 18 Sonca reached a peak intensity of convert85kn and convert70kn and soon the convection around the northern periphery started weakening Being embedded in a baroclinic zone with low sea surface temperatures Sonca started its extratropical transition late on September 19 The transition took place relatively fast because of a frontal boundary and the JTWC reported that Sonca became extratropical early on September 20 while the JMA did the same later in the evening 

Early on September 14 the JMA started monitoring a cluster of thunderstorms located to the southeast of Taiwan as a tropical depression However due to land interaction the system could not strengthen and the JMA stopped tracking the depression late on September 15 as the system dissipated

In the evening of September 21 a low pressure area developed to the east southeast of Palau The low gradually drifted west and became more well organized prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on it Later the LLCC became well organized with flaring deep convection developing around it so the JMA started monitoring the low as a tropical depression Later on September 23 the JTWC also initiated advisories on the system designating it with 20W Early on September 24 the JMA further upgraded 20W to a tropical storm and named it Nesat Nesat continued to drift west with expanding deep convection around the entire system and consolidating convection around the LLCC The mid level warm anomaly near the system continued to intensify and convective banding near the LLCC became more and more tighter As a result the JMA upgraded Nesat to a severe tropical storm on September 25 Late on the same day the JMA further upgraded Nesat to a typhoon 

As of 0945 UTC September 26 Typhoon Nesat was located within 30 nautical miles of coord155N1246Edim1000kmnameNesat about convert225nmiabbron east northeast of Manila Philippines Maximum sustained winds are convert70kn gusting to convert100kn Minimum central pressure is 965 mbar and the system is moving west northwest at convert11kn

On the evening of September 21 at almost the same time when Nesat was first seen another low pressure area persisted far south of Hong Kong The low slowly drifted north and strengthened slowly until on September 24 when the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical depression east of Vietnam Later that day the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert stating that the low could develop into a tropical cyclone Early on September 25 the JMA upgraded the system to a tropical storm and named it Haitang

As of 1000 UTC September 26 Tropical Storm Haitang was located within 30 nautical miles of coord166N1105Edim1000kmnameHaitang about convert230nmiabbron east of Hu Vietnam Maximum sustained winds are convert35kn gusting to convert50kn Minimum central pressure is 998 mbar and the system is moving west northwest slowly

Within the Northwestern Pacific Ocean there are two separate agencies who assign names to tropical cyclones which often results in a cyclone having two names The Japan Meteorological Agency names tropical cyclones should they be judged to have 10 minute sustained windspeeds of 65 kmh to the north of the equator between the 180 and 100E Whilst the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135E and 115E and between 5N 25N even if the cyclone has had a name assigned to it by the Japan Meteorological Agency

Tropical Cyclones are named from the following lists by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in Tokyo Japan once they reach tropical storm strength Names are contributed by members of the ESCAPWMO Typhoon Committee Each of the 14 nations or territories submitted 10 names which are used in alphabetical order by the English name of the country The next 24 names on the naming list are listed here

The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration uses its own naming scheme for tropical cyclones in their area of responsibility PAGASA assigns names to tropical depressions that form within their area of responsibility and any tropical cyclone that might move into their area of responsibility Should the list of names for a given year prove to be insufficient names are taken from an auxiliary list the first 10 of which are published each year before the season starts

The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration announced that the names Bebeng Juaning and Mina would be stricken off their Tropical Cyclone Naming lists due to extensive damage and loss of life

The table on the right shows the ACE for each storm in the season Broadly speaking the ACE is a measure of the power of a typhoon multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong typhoons have high ACEs ACE is calculated for only full advisories on specifically tropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 34 knots or tropical storm strength Accordingly tropical depressions are not included here The ACE also does not include subtropical storms Later the JMA reexamines the data and produces a final report on each storm which can lead to the ACE for a storm being revised either upward or downward Until the final reports are issued ACEs are therefore provisional

A stage or age in geology is a period of time measured in millions of years It is less than an epoch and more than a chron or chronozone

Technically a stage is a succession of rock strata laid down in a single age on the geologic timescale which usually represents millions of years of deposition 

The term red beds usually refers to strata of reddish colored sedimentary rocks such as sandstone siltstone or shale that were deposited in hot climates under oxidizing conditions They are usually formed in terrestrial situations on land and in rivers and lakes 

The red color comes from iron oxide in their mineral structure Although they have been deposited throughout the Phanerozoic they are most commonly associated with rocks deposited during the Devonian Permian and Triassic periods The Old Red Sandstone is one of the most famous rock formations

Red beds have economic significance since many of them contain reservoirs of petroleum and natural gas

Secondary red beds are linked to the uplift erosion and surface weathering of previously deposited sediments and require conditions similar to primary red beds for their formation

Titanosaurus is a genus of sauropod dinosaur first described by Lydekker in 1877 from fragments but not confirmed by later research 

Titanosaurus was 9 12 metres long and weighed about 13 tons Titanosaurus has traditionally been treated as a wastebin taxon for poorly preserved sauropod remains 

The most well known species of Titanosaurus Titanosaurus colberti has been renamed Isisaurus It is from the Upper Cretaceous of India

The First Minister and the deputy First Minister are jobs in the Northern Ireland Government The First Minister is not more important than the deputy First Minister The two positions are a diarchy meaning they have equal power both are nominated and appointed by members of the Northern Ireland Assembly

The incumbents are Peter Robinson of the Democratic Unionist Party as First Minister and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fin as deputy First Minister

Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly are divided into two groups Nationalists and Unionists

The First Minister and the deputy First Minister are elected on a joint ticket Under the St Andrews Agreement the Leader of the largest party nominates the First Minister and the leader of the next largest party that is in the other group nominates the deputy First Minister 

Their joint nomination has to obtain an overall majority in the Assembly along with a majority of both designated Nationalist MLAs and designated Unionist MLAs Designated Other MLAs also vote

This diarchy was created to enable the leaders of the main unionist and nationalist parties to work together as a team jointly representing both communities

The first two holders of the office now known as deputy First Minister namely Seamus Mallon and Mark Durkan were both referred to during their periods of office as Deputy First Minister with a capital D This version was also adopted in 1999 for the logo of the OFMDFM 

Several weeks after Martin McGuinness took up office as Deputy First Minister in 2007 civil servants began asking the Assemblys Hansard team to replace the capital D with a lower case d deputy was spelled this way in the Northern Ireland Act 1998 the legislation which created the office 

It was neither Mr McGuinness nor his advisers who asked for the change The Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly William Hay ordered the change and the capital D was dropped from Hansard references The Office of the First and deputy First Minister still uses both versions of Mr McGuinness title on their website and their archive of press releases has been changed but the capital D still appears in some places and a spokesman confirmed on 20 March 2008 that the office has no plans to change the OFMDFM logo However the Assembly committee that looks at their work is now listed as the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister It was decided that Mr McGuinness should be the deputy First Minister unless all the other letters in the title are in capitals Confusion isnt completely resolved however if Mr McGuinness writes to the Assembly committee his note will have a letterhead that comes from the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister but hell get a reply back from the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister

A cold seep is an area of the ocean floor where hydrogen sulfide methane and other hydrocarbon rich liquids leak out of the Earths crust often in the form of a brine pool Cold seeps form a biome supporting several native species

Cold seeps change the shape of the ocean floor over time where reactions between methane and seawater create carbonate rock formations and reefs These reactions may change when bacteria are present

Cold seeps at different depths have different names Other kinds of cold seeps are

Cold seeps occur over cracks in the seafloor caused by the movement of the Earths crust Oil and methane seep out of those cracks get dissolved by tiny bits of rock and emerge over an area several hundred meters wide

Methane is the main part of what we commonly refer to as natural gas But in addition to being an important energy source for humans methane also forms the basis of a cold seep ecosystem

Calamba City is a city in the province of Laguna Philippines The city is located convert54kmmi south of Manila Calamba City is a popular tourist destination It has several hot spring resorts Most of these are in Barangay Pansol There are 651 resorts and hot springs in the city The Canlubang Golf and Country Club has been the host of many Philippine Opens Calamba is also an important modern industrial center in the CALABARZON region This is shown by the large number of industrial parks and business estates that are in the city The city has a population of 360281 people There are in 58466 households Calamba City is the most populated city in Laguna province San Pedro Santa Rosa City Bian City and San Pablo City follow it as the top 5 municipalities and cities by population in the province

Calamba City is the birthplace of Jos Rizal He is a national hero in the Philippines

The name of the city comes from a legend The legend says that during the early time of the Spanish period in the country two guardias civil or Spanish soldiers were lost As they moved through the area that is now Calamba they met a young lady She came from a river carrying a jar of water and a wooden stove The soldiers asked the lady what the name of the place was They asked this in Spanish and used an authoritative tone to hide the fact that they were lost She did not speak Spanish and thought she was being interrogated about what she was carrying She answered kalan banga meaning clay stove and water jar Because they could not pronounce it correctly the city has been called Calamba since then This legend is immortalized with a large concrete water jar built in the city plaza with the names of the citys barangays written on it It is said to be the Worlds Biggest Claypot This same jar is also in the citys seal The idea to build the plaza came from Dr Agapito Alzona He was a town councilor at the time It was built on an unused area that was at one time the old town market The plaza was built in 1939

Before it became a separate city Calamba was a part of Tabuco Tabuco is now known as Cabuyao Calamba became an independent pueblo on August 28 1742

While the area was under the control of the Japanese in World War II the city was the site of a massacre The Imperial Japanese Army killed at least 2000 civilians

With the passage of Republic Act No 9024 on April 7 2001 and the approval of the people on April 21 Calamba went from being a municipality into being Lagunas second component city San Pablo was the other component city at the time Calamba is seen as a major growth center 

On October 28 2003 Calamba City became the regional center of Region IV A CALABARZON

Calamba has been the home to five national heroes Dr Jose Rizal General Paciano Rizal Teodora Alonzo General Vicente Lim and Lt Geronimo Aclan

The main church in Calamba City is the St John the Baptist Church It was built in 1859 The church was burned by the Japanese during World War II It was rebuilt by Fr Eliseo Dimaculangan It was the christening site of Jose Rizal The original baptismal font has been is still there

The province of Laguna is about 30 kilometres south of Manila Philippines There are about 1500000 people living in the Laguna Laguna is named after La Laguna which means the lake meaning Laguna de Bay This is the largest lake in the Philippines and is on the north edge of the province

The Institute of Welsh Affairs is an independent think tank based in the capital of Wales Cardiff It focuses its research on politics culture economy education environment science and technology in Wales with the aim of developing plans for policy innovation and improvement and promoting new thinking on Welsh issues The IWA publishes numerous reports on the research it carries out and organises public seminars and conferences to encourage discussion and debate It is highly regarded for the quality of its work and its commitment to informed public discussion

2010 saw the begin of ClickonWalesorg the IWAs online news analysis magazine ClickonWales is designed to bring users a new level of regular commentary and analysis on Welsh affairs and opportunities for debate Expert contributors and commentators from across the political spectrum will be commissioned daily The site also features the Wales factfile and the Lecture Library Wales factfile is a handy one stop shop for information and data about many aspects of Wales and its economic social cultural and political life The Lecture Library is a place where organisations will be able to post the texts of public lectures on a wide range of subjects

The Institute of Welsh Affairs was created on 22 July 1987

The IWA is a membership based organisation it has approximately 1200 individual and 150 corporate members and more than 100 Fellows The corporate members include BBC Wales British Gas Cardiff County Council Corus Steel Eversheds Julian Hodge Bank ITV Wales the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust S4C Welsh Water and the University of Wales

The Institute is governed by a Board of Trustees Its first chairman was Henry Kroch then chairman of AB Electronics Since 1992 the chairman has been Geraint Talfan Davies and since 1996 the director of the organisation has been former journalist and television producer John Osmond

As at November 2010 the Board members were Eurfyl ap Gwilym Guy Clarke Rhys David Geraint Talfan Davies Peter Davies Sue Essex Nigel Griffiths Gerald Holtham Megan Mathias Rob Humphreys Robert Jolliffe Ruth Marks Chris OMalley Wendy Sadler Professor John Tucker Sir Adrian Webb Dr Ruth Williams and Professor Laura McAllister

The IWA has five area branches for north Wales for west Wales Swansea Bay Gwent and Cardiff and the Valleys A sixth virtual branch  IWA Women  has been formed to raise the profile of womens concerns in Wales and to increase the engagement of women with the IWA and civil society in Wales more generally

Approximately one third of the IWAs income is derived from membership subscriptions the remainder coming mainly from the funding of specific research projects by trusts and foundations and other public and private organisations

The IWA publishes a journal three times a year called Agenda First published in 1994 Agenda contains numerous articles on current issues in Wales written by experts in their field including academics politicians and business people and a wide range of participants from Welsh civil society

It now publishes a regular bulletin on developments in the Assembly Assembly Bwletin Cynulliad published in association with Grayling Wales These can be downloaded from clickonwalesorg In addition the IWA has published a multitude of research reports discussion papers and books

One of the IWAs central activities is holding events which are designed to disseminate information to the public on a host of public policy issues The events range from the smaller coffee shop debates to full scale conferences 

Typically an IWA event will focus on a contested issue in Welsh politics It will bring in an expert who have detailed knowledge and understanding of the issue to clearly present both sides arguments clearly This is inline with the first part of its mission which to help raise the level of public debate on issues affecting Wales by placing quality information in the public domain 

In 2010 the IWA began the Inspire Wales Awards in association with the Western Mail The Awards aim to raise the profile of Welsh men and women who are making a contribution to our society to encourage active citizenship and create role models for others Categories for the awards include the environment business education sport and arts media and the creative industries 2011 sees the IWAWestern Mail Business Awards celebrating business achievement in Wales

In November 2006 the IWA published a report entitled Time to Deliver The Third Term and Beyond This looked at policy options for the Assemblys third term and was the result of work by eight study groups in individual policy areas 

In 2010 the IWAs director John Osmond was asked by the Older Peoples Commissioner to carry out a study exploring Welsh policy responses to our rapidly ageing society in particular the Welsh Governments policy which has been developing in a number of innovative ways since 2003 The findings were published in the bilingual report Adding Life to Years Ychwanegu Bywyd at a y Blynyddoedd

The IWAs most recent publication entitled Engaging Wales disengaged youth explores the issue of so called NEETS  Children Not in Education Employment of Training It contains contributions from experts in the fields of youth policy education employment and youth centred charities A full list of the IWAs research outputs is available on its website 

The IWAs priority areas for its future work include economic development the environment and climate change education health and culture governance and civil society

Table Mountain is a flat topped mountain overlooking the city of Cape Town in South Africa It is 10846 metres in height

It is a significant tourist attraction featured in the flag of Cape Town and other local government insignia Many visitors use the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway or hike to the top The mountain forms part of the Table Mountain National Park

The upper part of the mountain mesa consists SilurianOrdovician quartzitic sandstone commonly referred to as Table Mountain Sandstone It is highly resistant to weathering and forms steep grey crags 

Below the sandstone is a layer of micaceous shale which weathers quite readily The basement of folded metamorphic shales intruded by the Cape Granite are of late Precambrian age

Fingals Cave is a sea cave on the uninhabited island of Staffa in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland part of a National Nature Reserve owned by the National Trust for Scotland It is formed entirely from hexagonally jointed basalt columns These are part of the same ancient lava flow as the Giants Causeway in Northern Ireland and those of nearby Ulva 

In both cases the cooling surface of the mass of hot lava cracked in a hexagonal pattern in a similar way to drying mud cracking as it shrinks These cracks slowly extended down into the mass of lava as it cooled and shrank to form the columns which were later exposed by erosion

The breakup of Pangaea separated the two parts of the same rock formation

The size of the cave and its naturally arched roof and the eerie sounds produced by the echoes of waves give it the atmosphere of a natural cathedral The caves Gaelic name Uamh Binn means cave of melody

Romantic composer Felix Mendelssohn visited in 1829 and wrote Die Hebriden inspired by the weird echoes in the cave Mendelssohns overture popularized the cave as a tourist destination Other famous 19th century visitors included author Jules Verne poets William Wordsworth John Keats and Alfred Lord Tennyson and Romantic artist JMW Turner who painted Staffa Fingals Cave in 1832 Queen Victoria also made the trip

Deadpool known as Wade Wilson is a made up character from Marvel Comics He was created by Rob Leifeld in 1991 He is still often seen in comics and most recently as a supervillain who is in the end of the movie X Men Origins Wolverine He is the property of Marvel Comics and is shown in many of their comic books His clothing is colored red and black and he has two guns and short katanas He is famous for frequently breaking the fourth wall such as referring to past events as issues ago and such

The Giants Causeway is an area of about 40000 interlocking basalt columns the result of an ancient volcanic eruption It is located in County Antrim on the northeast coast of Northern Ireland 

It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986 and a National Nature Reserve in 1987 by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland In a 2005 poll of Radio Times readers the Giants Causeway was named as the fourth greatest natural wonder in the United Kingdom 

The tops of the columns form stepping stones that lead from the cliff foot and disappear under the sea Most of the columns are hexagonal although there are also some with four five seven and eight sides The tallest are about 12 metres high and the solidified lava in the cliffs is 28 metres thick in places

The Giants Causeway is today owned and managed by the National Trust and it is the most popular tourist attraction in Northern Ireland

The Giants Causeway and Fingals Cave are part of the same volcanic eruption They were separated by the plate tectonics movements which happened when the supercontinent Pangaea broke up

Some 50 to 60 million years ago during the Paleogene period Antrim was subject to intense volcanic activity when highly fluid molten basalt intruded through chalk beds to form an extensive lava plateau As the lava cooled rapidly contraction occurred The size of the columns is primarily determined by the speed at which lava from a volcanic eruption cools The extensive fracture network produced the distinctive columns seen today The basalts were originally part of a great volcanic plateau called the Thulean Plateau which formed during the Paleogene period Parts of this plateau can be found in the Faroe Islands Iceland and Norway as well as at Fingals Cave

An ornithopter from the ancient greek language is an aircraft that flies by flapping its wings Designers try to make the flapping wing flight of birds bats and insects seem real Though machines may differ in form they are usually built on the same scale as these flying creatures Manned ornithopters have also been built and some have worked The machines are of two general types those with engines and those powered by the muscles of the pilot

The Calgary Stampede happens every year and has a rodeo exhibits and a festival held every July in Calgary Alberta Canada The ten day event which calls itself The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth brings over one million visitors every year and has the worlds largest rodeo It also has a parade rides stage shows concerts farming gamesand racing People from Calgary also begin wearing cowboy hats and other cowboy gear in spirit of the event The stampede began as a farming fair in 1886 and turned into the Calgary Stampede in 1923

Juggling is a skill which throwing objects for enjoyment or sport The juggler throws objects up to catch and throw up again Jugglers often call the objects they juggle as props The most common props are balls or beanbags rings clubs and special bounce balls Some performers use more dangerous objects such as knives fire torches and even chainsaws

Juggling can also mean other prop based skills such as diabolo devil sticks poi cigar boxes fire dancing contact juggling hooping foot bag and hat manipulation

3753 Cruithne is an asteroid

3753 Cruithne was discovered on October 10 1986 by Duncan Waldron on the UK Schmidt Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory Coonabarabran Australia The 1983 appearance is given to Giovanni de Sanctis and Richard M West of the European Southern Observatory in Chile It was not until 1997 that its unusual orbit was found by Paul Wiegert and Kimmo Innanen working at York University in Toronto and Seppo Mikkola working at the University of Turku in Finland The asteroid is named after the Cruithne a people of early medieval Ireland

3753 Cruithne is about 5 kilometres in diameter From 1994 through 2015 3753 Cruithne makes its annual closest approach to Earth every November Although Cruithnes orbit is not thought to be stable over the long term calculations showed that it has probably been synchronized with Earths orbit for a long time There is no danger of a collision with Earth for millions of years if ever Its orbital path and Earths do not cross

Cruithne is in a normal elliptic orbit around the Sun Its period of revolution around the Sun about 364 days at present is almost equal to that of the Earth Because of this Cruithne and Earth appear to follow each other in their paths around the Sun This is why Cruithne is sometimes called Earths second moon However it does not orbit the Earth and is not a moon In 2058 Cruithne will come within 136 million kilometres of Mars Cruithnes distance from the Sun and orbital speed vary a lot more than the Earths so from the Earths point of view Cruithne actually follows a kidney bean shaped horseshoe orbit ahead of the Earth taking slightly less than one year to complete a circuit of the bean Because it takes slightly less than a year the Earth falls behind the bean a little more each year and so from our point of view the circuit is not quite closed but rather like a spiral loop that moves slowly away from the Earth After many years the Earth will have fallen so far behind that Cruithne will then actually be catching up on the Earth from behind When it eventually does catch up Cruithne will make a series of annual close approaches to the Earth and gravitationally exchange orbital energy with Earth this will alter Cruithnes orbit by a little over half a million kilometres so that its period of revolution around the Sun will then become slightly more than a year The kidney bean will then start to migrate away from the Earth again in the opposite direction instead of the Earth falling behind the bean the Earth is pulling away from the bean The next such series of close approaches will be centred on the year 2292 in July of that year Cruithne will approach Earth to about 12500000 kilometres After 380 to 390 years or so the kidney bean shaped orbit approaches Earth again from the other side and the Earth once more alters the orbit of Cruithne so that its period of revolution around the Sun is again slightly less than a year The pattern then repeats itself

More resonant near Earth objects have since been discovered These include 54509 YORP 1998 UP1 2002 AA29 and 2009BD which exist in resonant orbits similar to Cruithnes Other examples of natural bodies known to be in horseshoe orbits include Janus and Epimetheus natural satellites of Saturn The orbits these two moons follow around Saturn are much simpler than the one Cruithne follows but operate along the same general principles Mars has four known co orbital asteroids and Jupiter has many there are also other small co orbital moons in the Saturnian system Telesto and Calypso with Tethys and Helene and Polydeuces with Dione However none of these follow horseshoe orbits

Combined the islands have an area of approximately convert415800hasqmi0 and had a population of 18257 people in 2001 The population density is therefore a little over 4 persons per km2

There are various important prehistoric structures many of which pre date the first written references to the islands by Roman and Greek authors 

In the historic period the earliest known settlers were Picts to the north and Gaels in the south The islands became part of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles the Sureyjar kingdom of the Norse The Norsemen ruled for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266 

Control of the islands was then held by various clan chiefs principal of which were the Clan MacLeod and Clan MacDonald The Highland Clearances of the 19th century had a devastating effect on many communities and it is only in recent years that population levels have ceased to decline

Sea transport is crucial and ferry services operate between the islands and the mainland Britain The Gaelic language and the Wee Free Church of Scotland remains strong in some areas The landscapes have inspired a variety of artists and there is a diversity of wildlife

Skye Mull and Islay are the largest islands

There are also many small uninhabited islands One of the uninhabited isles Staffa is home to Fingals Cave and basalt columns

The Scion xB is a car made by Toyota for the United States and is sold under the Scion brand It is a box shaped 5 door small car and is sometimes called the box car There are two types of Scion xB cars on the road today The first type was made from 2004 until 2006 This type was known for its boxy shape and high fuel economy The second type started being made in 2008 and is still being made today This type looks much rounder and it is more powerful than the first type of car This type is also not as popular because it is a more generic type of car There has been a lot of criticism about the second type of Scion xB because of this reason Also many original xB owners despise the xB2 even being called an xB The xB2 has its own name in other markets Scion used the xB name in an attempt to help sell it in America

Earthquake protector is a type of base isolation made to protect building and non building structures against damage from strong earthquakes

A buildings seismic performance may be improved by reducing vibrations This may be done with damping mechanisms in vibration control technologies and especially in base isolation 

However for the very pliant systems such as base isolated structures with a relatively low bearing stiffness but with a high damping the so called damping force may turn out the main pushing force at a strong earthquake This finding created a theoretical ground in earthquake engineering for a damping disengaged base isolation technology called Earthquake protector

The three Storegga Slides are amongst the largest known landslides They occurred under water at the edge of Norways continental shelf in the Norwegian Sea 100 km north west of the Mre coast 

This caused a very large tsunami in the North Atlantic Ocean The collapse involved an estimated 290 km length of coastal shelf with a total volume of 3500 km3 of debris 

Based on carbon dating of plant material recovered from sediment deposited by the tsunami the latest incident occurred around 6100 BC In Scotland traces of this tsunami have been recorded with deposited sediment being discovered in the Montrose Basin and the Firth of Forth up to 80 km inland and 4 metres above current normal tide levels 

As part of the activities to prepare the Ormen Lange natural gas field the incident has been thoroughly investigated One conclusion is that the slide was caused by material built up during the previous ice age and that a recurrence would only be possible after a new ice age This conclusion is supported by numerous scientific studies Facts and arguments supporting this conclusion were made public in 2004 

It was decided that the development of the Ormen Lange gas field would not significantly increase the risk of triggering a new slide A new slide would trigger a very large tsunami which would be devastating for the coast areas around the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea

Cameron Cam Jerrell Newton is an American football quarterback He played college football at Auburn University where he won a BCS National Championship in 2011 He is now quarterback for the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League

Newton was born in Savannah Georgia to parents Cecil and Jackie Newton His father also played professional football in the NFL He grew up in College Park Georgia He attended Seaborn Lee Elementary School and then Camp Creek Middle School In 2003 he attended Westlake High School in Fulton County Georgia where he played football and basketball

In 2007 as a freshman at the University of Florida Newton earned the spot over fellow freshman quarterback John Brantley as the back up for star quarterback and eventual Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow He played in five games and threw for 40 yards on 5 of 10 passing and ran the ball 16 times for 103 yards and three touchdowns In 2008 during his sophomore season Newton played in the season opener against Hawaii He then suffered an ankle injury and decided to take a medical redshirt season 

On November 21 2008 police arrested Newton for stealing a laptop computer from a student at the University of Florida He was subsequently temporarily suspended by the team after the laptop was in fact found to be in his possession Investigators tracked the stolen laptop to the athlete Newton tossed the computer out his dorm window in an attempt to hide it from the Police Newton was suspended indefinitely and announced his intention to transfer three days before Floridas national championship win over Oklahoma All criminal charges against Newton were dropped after he completed a court approved pretrial diversion program Foxsportscom reported that Newton left the University of Florida after the fall semester in 2008 rather than face suspension or expulsion in part because of three instances of academic cheating

In January 2009 Newton transferred to Blinn College a junior college in Brenham Texas In fall 2009 he was quarterback for the team The team won the 2009 NJCAA National Football Championship Newton then wanted to transfer to a four year college and his father allegedly sought money from the schools competing for Newtons attendance Newton transferred to Auburn University where he also played quarterback

Newton spent much of the second half of the 2010 football season haunted by allegations that his father Cecil Newton had sought substantial sums of money in return for his son playing for a major college team If true this would violate National Collegiate Athletic Association rules In early November officials with Mississippi State University charged that Cecil Newton said that it would take more than just a scholarship to secure his sons services This demand was apparently communicated by Kenny Rogers a recruiter who formerly played for the Bulldogs to John Bond his former teammate at MSU Rogers later said in a Dallas radio interview that Cecil Newton said it would take anywhere between 100000 and 180000 to get his son to transfer to MSU Auburn maintained throughout the investigation that they were not involved in any pay for play scheme and that Cam Newton was fully eligible to play

On December 1 the NCAA announced that Auburn had declared Cam Newton to be ineligible Auburn found evidence that Cecil Newton did in fact solicit Mississippi State for money in exchange for Cam Newtons athletic service Auburn immediately asked the NCAA to reinstate Newton The NCAA quickly reinstated Newton declaring him eligible for the 2010 SEC Championship Game three days later The NCAA said that there was not sufficient evidence that Cam Newton or anyone from Auburn had any knowledge of Cecil Newtons actions Auburn subsequently limited the access Cecil Newton had to the football program as result of NCAA findings Also due to increased pressure by the media and the NCAA investigation Cecil Newton announced he would not attend the Heisman Trophy Ceremony The NCAA reinstatement did not clear Cecil Newton of any wrongdoing The NCAA action did make Cam Newton eligible to win the Heisman Trophy He won the award with 2263 points and 729 first place votes

In October 2011 the NCAA closed its 13 month investigation into the Auburn University recruitment of Newton The NCAA conducted over 50 interviews and reviewed bank records IRS documents telephone calls and e mail messages The NCAA found nothing that would indicate Auburn participated in any pay for play scenario in recruiting Newton to become an Auburn student The NCAA would say that the charges failed to meet a burden of proof which is a higher standard than rampant public speculation online and in the media The NCAAs Stacey Osburn would say Weve done all we can do Weve done all the interviews Weve looked into everything and theres nothing there Unless something new comes to light thats credible and we need to look at its concluded 

Newton was the first person to be selected in the 2011 NFL Draft The Carolina Panthers picked him No current Heisman Trophy winner had been the first draft pick since Carson Palmer in 2003 During the 2011 NFL lockout he has spent up to 12 hours a day at the IMG Madden Football Academy in Bradenton FL with up to two hours per day spent doing one on one training with fellow Heisman Trophy winner and Carolina Panther quarterback Chris Weinke

On July 29 2011 Newton signed a four year deal worth over 22 million that is fully guaranteed A month later on September 1 2011 he was listed as the number one quarterback for the team above Jimmy Clausen and Derek Anderson In his NFL debut game on September 11 2011 Newton was 2437 passing for 422 yards 2 touchdowns and 1 interception in a 2821 road loss to the Arizona Cardinals With a quarterback rating of 1104 he also rushed for a touchdown and became the first rookie to throw for over 400 yards in his first career game His 422 passing yards broke Peyton Mannings rookie record for most passing yards on opening day 

In his second career game his team lost 3023 to the defending Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers Newton broke his own record set the weekend previously with 432 yards passing throwing and rushing for a touchdown Newtons 854 passing yards in the first two games of the season was the most in league history by a rookie Newton broke the NFL record of 827 set by Kurt Warner in the 2000 season and stood as the most by any quarterback in the first two weeks of the season until New Englands Tom Brady broke the mark again later in the day with 940 He also became the only player to begin his career with consecutive 400 yard passing games He broke the Carolina Panthers franchise record of 547 yards previously held by Steve Beuerlein After Newtons second career game Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers commented I think someone said in the locker room that Im kind of glad we played him early in the season because when he figures it out fully hes going to be even tougher to stop Newtons three additional interceptions against the Packers tied him for the most interceptions thrown in the league He passed a total of 1012 yards in the first three games 

The Panthers recorded their first victory of the season against the Jacksonville Jaguars 1610 Newton threw for 158 yards and one touchdown The Panthers played the Atlanta Falcons losing 3117 while passing for 237 yards with no passing touchdowns Newtons three interceptions returned him to leading the NFL in interceptions On October 23 2011 the Carolina Panthers won over the Washington Redskins 33 20 Newton completed 18 of 23 passes for 256 yards and a touchdown Newton also ran for 59 yards and a touchdown

Strong was 30 years old when she returned to Seattle to live with her father then pastor of Queen Anne Congregational Church She liked the the progressive politics that were popular there which supported organized labor 

Strong also enjoyed mountain climbing She organized cooperative summer camps in the Cascades and led climbing groups up Mt Rainier

When Strong ran for the Seattle School Board in 1916 she won easily because she was helped by womens groups and organized labor and because she was known as an expert on child welfare She was the only female board member She argued that the public schools should offer social service programs for poor children and that these programs should be community centers But there was little she could do Other members chose to devote meetings to things that Strong felt were less important such as plumbing in the schools 

In the year of her election 1916 the Everett Massacre happened Strong was hired as a stringer by the New York Evening Post to report on the bloody conflict between the IWW and the army of armed guards hired by Everett mill owners to keep them out of town At first she was just somebody who was watching without taking a side However she soon started taking the side of workers rights and speaking about this belief 

Strongs endorsement of left wing causes made her different from the other people on the school board She was against war and when the United States entered World War I in 1917 she spoke out against the draft On one hand the PTA and womens clubs joined her in opposing military training in the schools On the other hand the Seattle Minute Men many of whom were veterans of the Spanish American War said that she was unpatriotic 

The anti war beliefs of the Wobblies led to many of them being arrested at the Seattle office where Louise Olivereau a typist was mailing things to draftees that told them to think about becoming conscientious objectors and not enter the draft In 1918 Strong stood by Olivereaus side in the courtroom as the typist activist was tried for sedition found guilty and sent to prison 

Strongs fellow school board members started recall campaign to get Strong removed from the school board and they won She showed up at their next meeting to argue that they should choose a woman to replace her The school board decided to do this but they said that they wanted a mainstream patriotic representative and a mother with children in the schools They replaced Anna Louise Strong with Evangeline C Harper a well known country club woman

Strong because known as part of the citys labor owned daily newspaper The Union Record writing forceful pro labor articles and saying good things about the new Soviet government On February 6 1919 two days before the beginning of the Seattle General Strike of 1919 she wrote in an editorial We are undertaking the most tremendous move ever made by labor in this country a move which will lead NO ONE KNOWS WHERE The strike shut down the city for four days and then ended as it had begun peacefully and with its goals still unclear

Not knowing what to do she took her friend Lincoln Steffens advice and in 1921 travelled to Poland and Russia serving as a correspondent for the American Friends Service Committee The reason she was going was to give the first foreign relief to the Volga famine victims After a year of that she was named Moscow correspondent for the International News Service Strong saw many things in Europe which inspired her to write Some of her works include The First Time in History and Children of Revolution After remaining in the area for several years Strong grew to become an supporter of socialism in the newly formed Soviet Union In 1925 during the era of the New Economic Policy in the USSR she came back to the United States to make businessmen interested in investing in industry and development in the Soviet Union During this time Strong also gave many speeches and became well known as an authority on soft news about the USSR

In the late 1920s Strong travelled in China and other parts of Asia She became friends with Soong Ching ling and Zhou Enlai She wrote some more books about her travels including Chinas Millions Red Star in Samarkand 

In 1930 she came back to Moscow and helped start Moscow News the first English language newspaper in the city She was managing editor for a year and then became a featured writer She married Soviet official and fellow socialist Joel Shubin in 1932 Much like Strong Shubin was a man passionately dedicated to his work and the two were often apart because of work and would ultimately spend little time together before Shubins death in 1942

While living in the Soviet Union she became more happy with the Soviet government and wrote many books praising it They include The Soviets Conquer Wheat an updated version of Chinas Millions The Revolutionary Struggles from 1927 to 1935 the best selling autobiographical I Change Worlds the Remaking of an American This Soviet World and The Soviet Constitution 

In 1936 she returned once again to the United States Quietly and privately upset with news in the USSR she continued to write for leading periodicals including The Atlantic Monthly Harpers The Nation and Asia A visit to Spain resulted in Spain in Arms visits to China led to One Fifth of Mankind In 1940 she published My Native Land Other books include The Soviets Expected It the novel Wild River set in Russia Peoples of the USSR I Saw the New Poland and three books on the success of the early Communist Party of China in the Chinese Civil War 

While in the USSR she travelled throughout the huge nation including the Ukraine Kuznetsk Stalingrad Kiev Siberia Central Asia Uzbekistan and many more She also travelled into Poland Germany and Britain While in the Soviet Union Strong met with Stalin Molotov and many other Soviet officials She interviewed factory workers farmers and pedestrians 

In World War II when the Red Army began its advance against Nazi Germany Strong stayed in the rear following the soldiers through Warsaw d and Gdask In great part because of her overtly pro Chinese Communist sympathies she was arrested in Moscow in 1949 and charged by the Soviets with espionage She later returned to the USSR in 1959 but settled in China until her death 

Strong met W E B Du Bois who visited Communist China during the Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s Neither ever supported famine related criticisms of the Great Leap Strong wrote a book titled When Serfs Stood Up in Tibet based on her experience during this period which include the Chinese invasion of Tibet 

Partly from fear of losing her passport if she came back to the USA she moved to China until her death in 1970 publishing a Letter from China During that time she got to know Zhou Enlai very well and also knew Mao Zedong She lived in the old Italian Legation which had been changed into flats for the leading foreign friends
