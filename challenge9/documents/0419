Robert Anson Heinlein was a writer He was from the United States He mostly wrote science fiction books He won the Hugo Award four times Probably his best known novels are Starship Troopers and Stranger in a Strange Land Two other Hugo awards were for Double Star and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress Together with Isaac Asimov and Arthur C Clarke he is seen as one of the Big Three of Science Fiction 

There are many computer and video game genres Here is a list of some of them

A fable is a type of long story which teaches something in life or has a meaning to a word which is usually stated in the middle of the story The characters of a fable may be people gods animals or even lifeless objects When animals and objects are used in fables they think and talk like people even though they act like animals or objects For example in a fable a clay pot might say that it is frightened of being broken

The stories told by fables are usually very simple To understand a fable the reader or listener does not need to know all about the characters only one important thing For this reason animals are often used in fables in a way that is easily understood because it is always the same They keep the same characteristics from story to story

The most famous fables are those attributed to Aesop Many fables are so well known that their morals have become English sayings

For example

Drainage is the natural or artificial removal of surface and sub surface water from a given area Many agricultural soils need drainage to improve production or to manage water supplies 

The earliest archaeological record of an advanced system of drainage comes from the Indus Valley Civilization from around 3100 BC in what is now Pakistan and North India The ancient Indus systems of sewerage and drainage that were developed and used in cities throughout the civilization were far more advanced than any found in contemporary urban sites in the Middle East and even more efficient than those in some areas of modern Pakistan and India today All houses in the major cities of Harappa and Mohenjo daro had access to water and drainage facilities Waste water was directed to covered drains which lined the major streets

Wetland soils may need drainage to be used for agriculture In the northern USA and Europe glaciation created numerous small lakes which gradually filled with humus to make marshes Some of these were drained using open ditches and trenches 

The largest project of this type in the world has been in process for centuries in the Netherlands The area between Amsterdam Haarlem and Leiden was in prehistoric times swampland and small lakes Turf cutting subsidence and shoreline erosion gradually caused the formation of one large lake the Haarlemmermeer or lake of Haarlem The invention of wind powered pumping engines in the 15th century permitted drainage of some of the marginal land but the final drainage of the lake had to await the design of large steam powered pumps and agreements between regional authorities The elimination of the lake occurred between 1849 and 1852 creating thousands of km2 of new land

Empoldering is a method of reclaiming land from the sea Empoldering involves the use of polders and is also a way to control floods A polder is a piece of land in a low lying area that has been reclaimed from a body of water by building dikes and drainage canals

Although empoldering is usually carried out in low lying coastal areas it can be also carried out in inland areas such as lakes and rivers It is commonly carried out in countries like the Netherlands where much of the country is below sea level and subject to flooding About one fifth of the land in the Netherlands has been reclaimed from the sea Their largest and most successful project is the Zuider Zee project

Polders have 2 distinct features Firstly they are enclosed by dikes to keep the water out The dikes also serve to protect the polder from erosion Secondly polders are continually maintained by systems of drainage canals and pumps which prevent them from becoming waterlogged and hence suitable for cultivation

Stage 1 Dike constructed around the area to be reclaimed to keep water from coming in

Stage 2 The area is drained using pumps and drainage canals

Stage 3 Reeds are sown by aircraft to help the soil form

Stage 4 After 3 years reeds are burnt and the ash is used as fertilisers for the soil

Stage 5 After a period of up to 15 years the polder is ready for growing crops building houses and constructing roads

A resistor is an electronic component that restricts the flow of current in an electrical or electronic circuit It is used to control voltage It can also be used to protect sensitive components from explodingblowing The higher the resistance the less current there can be Some look like microchips and others look like a wire with a small colored cylinder of material around them

Resistors can be linked in various combinations to help make a circuit

1 Series  Where the resistors are linked one after another 2 Parallel  Where the resistors are linked over one another

There are many different types of resistors Not only do some have a higher resistance to electricity than others but resistors also have different ratings to tell electricians how much power they can handle before they break and how accurately they can slow the flow of electricity A lot of resistors have colored rings on them to help people knowledgeable about electronics quickly tell what their resistance and accuracy they are rated at

Resistors can be made out of many materials Older resistors are made out of solid carbon These are still being used but not very often because they do not hold up well to air moisture and because they are usually too expensive to make these days Resistors using carbon as a film however are newer and are still being made Other newer resistors can be made out of wire or metal Newer resistors can handle air moisture and the heat from all the electricity that has to go through them a lot better than the old ones could

The Death Star is a fictional space station that is in the Star Wars movies It is very big and has the shape of a ball It has a very strong laser cannon that can blow up planets The first Death Star was destroyed in A New Hope The second Death Star was not fully built It was destroyed in Return of the Jedi

The Doctor of Philosophy is a degree a person gets from a university by finishing a doctorate program In many areas of study the PhD is the highest degree that a person can earn There are PhD degrees for many different fields such as PhDs in literature philosophy history science mathematics and engineering Some PhD degrees have existed for hundreds of years such as the PhD in Canon Law Other PhD degrees were developed in the 1970s and 1980s such as the PhD in Womens Studies

To be admitted to a PhD program a person usually has to have completed a Masters degree that is related to the PhD degree For example a person applying to be admitted to a PhD degree in Theater would normally have to have a Masters degree such as a Master of Arts degree in Theater English Literature or a related area 

The PhD degree usually takes between three to six years of full time study to complete after a Masters degree Many PhD degrees begin with a period of graduate courses After the PhD student has passed a series of examinations called comprehensive exams they begin to do research for a long original research report called a dissertation Many PhD degrees also require students to pass exams in languages Most PhD students teach undergraduate students or assist professors with research during their PhD studies

A PhD is required to become a university professor in many fields such as English Literature Economics History and Biology In some fields there is no PhD and so another degree is required to become a university professor For example the highest degree in Fine Arts fields such as printmaking or graphic design is the Master of Fine Arts degree A person with an MFA degree can become a university professor in some Fine Arts fields 

Marine ecoregions are regions of the worlds oceans that are defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature to help activities for saving marine ecosystems

The scheme used to find out these ecoregions is more or less the same as that for terrestrial ecoregions Major habitat types are identified polar temperate shelfs and seas temperate upwelling tropical upwelling tropical coral pelagic abyssal and hadal which correspond to the terrestrial biomes Major biogeographic realms analogous to the seven terrestrial ecozones represent large regions of the ocean basins North Temperate Atlantic Eastern Tropical Atlantic Western Tropical Atlantic South Temperate Atlantic North Temperate Indo Pacific Central Indo Pacific Eastern Indo Pacific Western Indo Pacific South Temperate Indo Pacific Southern Ocean Antarctic Arctic and Mediterranean

The classification of Marine ecoregions is not developed to the same level of detail and comprehensiveness as that of the terrestrial ecoregions only the priority conservation areas of the Global 200 are listed

See Global 200 Marine ecoregions for a full list of marine ecoregions

In Physical Geography Freshwater ecoregion means the freshwater habitats of a particular geographic area including rivers streams lakes and wetlands Freshwater ecoregions are distinct from terrestrial ecoregions which have biotic communities of the land and marine ecoregions which are biotic communities of the oceans

The WWF speaks of seven major habitat types of freshwater ecoregions Large rivers large river headwaters large river deltas small rivers large lakes small lakes and xeric basins

Several freshwater ecoregions are listed in the Global 200 the WWFs priority ecoregions for conservation of biodiversity

The Global 200 is the list of ecoregions identified by the World Wide Fund for Nature as priorities for conservation According to the WWF an ecoregion is defined as a relatively large unit of land or water containing a characteristic set of natural communities that share a large majority of their species dynamics and environmental conditions

The WWF assigns a conservation status to each ecoregion in the Global 200 critical or endangered vulnerable and relatively stable or intact Over half of the ecoregions in the Global 200 are rated endangered

An ecoregion sometimes called a bioregion is the next smallest ecologically and geographically defined area beneath realm or ecozone Ecoregions cover relatively large area of land or water and contain characteristic geographically distinct natural communities and species When defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature the boundaries of an ecoregion approximate the original extent of the natural communities prior to any major recent disruptions or changes The WWF has identified 825 terrestrial ecoregions and approximately 450 freshwater ecoregions across the Earth

World Wide Fund for Natures full definition of an ecoregion which is widely accepted and used is the following

The Global 200 is the list of ecoregions identified by the World Wide Fund for Nature as priorities for conservation

In physical geography a wetland is an environment that combines the properties of land and water

That means wetlands are ecosystems They often have great biodiversity Therefore several of them belong to the Global 200 ecoregions that the World Wide Fund for Nature listed for conservation

In geography a marsh is a type of wetland featuring grasses rushes reeds typhas sedges and other herbaceous plants in a context of shallow water A marsh is different from a swamp which has a greater proportion of open water surface which is generally deeper than a marsh In the USA the term swamp is used for wetland dominated by trees rather than grasses and low herbs 

The water of a marsh can be fresh brackish or saline Coastal marshes may be associated with estuaries and along waterways between coastal barrier islands and the inner coast Estuarine marshes often are based on soils consisting of sandy bottoms or bay muds 

Marshes are critically important wildlife habitat often serving as breeding grounds for a wide variety of animal life

Ulan Ude formerly Verkhneudinsk the capital city of the Buryat Republic Russia The city is located about 100 km south east of Lake Baikal It sits at the foot of the Khamar Daban and Khrebet Ulan Burgasy mountain ranges next to the confluence of the Selenga River and its tributary the Uda The city is divided into two parts by the Uda Population 359391 352530 It is the third largest city in East Siberia It is served by Ulan Ude Airport as well as the smaller Ulan Ude Vostochny Airport

Ulan Ude was founded in 1666 by the Russian Cossacks Due to its geographical position the city grew rapidly and became a large trade centre which connected Russia with China and Mongolia There are old merchants mansions richly decorated with wood and stone carving in the historical center of Ulan Ude along the river banks They represent beautiful examples of Russian classicism There is also a large and highly unusual head of Lenin in the central square

The pelagic zone is the part of the open sea or ocean that is not near the coast or sea floor The name comes from the Greek which might be roughly translated as sea but is more accurately translated as open sea 

The pelagic zone is divided into a number of sub zones

The last three zones are similar in character and some marine biologists count them as a single zone or consider the latter two to be the one zone Some define the hadopelagic as waters below 6000 meters whether in a trench or not

Vitamin A is a vitamin Vitamin A can not be made by the body itself and must be taken in from food Carrots and liver are both rich in vitamin A Many parts of the body need vitamin A For example vitamin A helps sight and is good for the immune system It is also important for a growing embryo 

Too little vitamin A is dangerous to health People who do not get enough of the vitamin may lose the ability to see in poor light and suffer from a weakened immune system They may also have problems with memory because vitamin A is important for the brain People with malnutrition often have too little vitamin A This is common in poor countries 

Too much vitamin A is also dangerous to ones health This is because vitamin A is not soluble in water and the human body can not get rid of the excess vitamin A easily through urination Too much vitamin A can make someone very sick People may get too much vitamin A from taking too many vitamin pills or from eating too much rich food like liver 

If a pregnant woman has too little or too much vitamin A it may cause birth defects in the unborn baby

Vitamin D is a vitamin Vitamin D controls the levels of calcium ions and phosphates in the blood in the intestines It helps bones grow and form It is also good for the immune system In total there are 5 vitamins D1 to D5 The most common ones are D2 and D3 It is in fish liver oils and fortified milk If a person lacks vitamin D they have a higher chance of getting rickets and having soft bones Vitamin D is found in a narrow range of foods Good food sources are oily fish and eggs Other food sources include fortified foods such as margarine breakfast cereals and powdered milk But we get most of our vitamin D from sunlight on our skin This is because the vitamin forms under the skin in reaction to sunlight Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin This means you do not need it every day because any of the vitamin your body does not need immediately is stored for future use Most people get all the vitamin D they need from their diet and sun However if you are pregnant breastfeeding or elderly you should take 10 micrograms of vitamin D each day Vitamin D has a number of important functions For example it helps regulate the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body and calcium and phosphate are needed to help keep bones and teeth healthy

If you take too little It can lead to diseases such as rickets osteoporosis

In ecology a biome is a major regional group of distinctive plant and animal communities best adapted to the regions physical natural environment latitude elevation and terrain

A biome is made up of ecoregions or communities at stable steady state and all associated transitional disturbed or degraded vegetation fauna and soils but can often be identified by the climax vegetation type

The biodiversity characteristic of each biome especially the diversity of fauna and subdominant plant forms is a function of abiotic factors and the biomass productivity of the dominant vegetation Terrestrial biomes with higher net primary productivity moisture availability and temperature

A fundamental classification of biomes is into

Biomes are often given local names For example a temperate grassland or shrubland biome is known commonly as steppe in central Asia savanna or veld in southern Africa prairie in North America pampa in South America and outback or scrub in Australia Sometimes an entire biome may be targeted for protection especially under an individual nations Biodiversity Action Plan

Climate is a major factor determining the distribution of terrestrial biomes Among the important climatic factors are

Biodiversity generally increases away from the poles towards the equator and increases with humidity

The most widely used systems of classifying biomes correspond to latitude and humidity

In 1975 Miklos Udvardy published a system of biogeographic provinces that were divided into 12 terrestrial biomes

Robert G Bailey developed a biogeographical classification system for the United States in a map published in 1975 Bailey subsequently expanded the system to include the rest of North America in 1981 and the world in 1989 The Bailey system is based on climate and is divided into four domains with further divisions based on other climate characteristics

A team of biologists developed an ecological land classification system for the World Wide Fund for Nature that identified 14 biomes called major habitat types and further divided the worlds land area into 867 terrestrial ecoregions This classification is used to define the Global 200 list of ecoregions identified by the as priorities for conservation The WWF major habitat types are as follows

The Endolithic biome consisting entirely of microscopic life in rock pores and cracks kilometers beneath the surface has only recently been discovered and does not fit well into most classification schemes

Vitamin E is a vitamin There are eight forms of it E1 to E8 It can be found in vegetable oils Very often it is also added to lotions and creams for the skin It is supposed to help the healing of the skin after burns and injuries and lower the risk of heart disease and cancer

Vitamin E is claimed to help Anti AgingfactdateApril 2009

Vitamin K is a vitamin which is soluble in fat It is mostly needed for the coagulation of blood and stops bleeding Without Vitamin K there would be a loss of blood when you bleed which can lead to unconsciousness or even death Vitamin K can be found in green vegetables such as spinach lettuce broccoli or cabbage Vitamin K was discovered by Henrik Dam a Danish chemist who won the 1943 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine

The B vitamin complex are a group of 8 vitamins They have an important job in the metabolism of cells Originally people thought they were just different forms of one vitamin Later it turned out that they are separate vitamins that often can be found together Vitamin B deficiencies such asfactMarch 2010

They are Vitamin B1Thiamine Vitamin B2Riboflavin Vitamin B3Vitamin PVitamin PPNiacinVitamin B5Pantothenic acid Vitamin B6 Vitamin B7Vitamin HBiotin Vitamin B9Vitamin MVitamin B cFolic acid and Vitamin B12Cyanocobalamin

Regions having a subarctic climate are characterized by long usually very cold winters and brief warm summers It is found on large landmasses away from the moderating effects of an ocean generally at latitudes from 50 to 70N Due to the absence of any large landmasses at such latitudes it is not found in the Southern Hemisphere These climates represent Kppen climate classification Dfc Dwc Dfd and Dwd

This type of climate offers some of the most extreme seasonal temperature variations found on the planet In winter temperatures can drop to 40C and in summer the temperature may exceed 30C However the summers are short no more than three months of the year and must have a 24 hour average temperature of at least 10C to fall into this category of climate The subarctic climate is a subset of the continental climate The subarctic climate is found in the following areas

With 5 7 consecutive months where the average temperature is below freezing all moisture in the soil and subsoil freezes solidly to depths of many feet Summer warmth is insufficient to thaw more than a few surface feet so permafrost prevails under large areas Seasonal thaw penetrates from 2 to 14 ft depending on latitude aspect and type of ground Some northern areas with subarctic climates near oceans have milder winters and no permafrost and are thus more suited for farming 

The frost free season is very short varying from about 45 to 100 days at most and a freeze can occur during any month in many areas Vegetation in a subarctic climate is generally of low diversity because only hardy species can survive the long winters and make use of the short summers Trees are mostly limited to ferns and evergreen conifers as few broadleaved trees are able to survive the very low temperatures in winter  This type of forest is also known as taiga a term which is sometimes applied to the climate found therein as well Even though the diversity may be low numbers are high and the taiga forest is the largest forest biome on the planet with most of the forests in Russia and Canada 

Agricultural potential is generally poor due to the natural infertility of soils and because of the many swamps and lakes left by departing ice sheets and short growing seasons allow only the hardiest of crops 

There is very little precipitation no more than 15 to 20 inches over an entire year and away from the coasts occurs mostly in the warmer months Low precipitation by the standards of more temperate regions with longer and warmer winters is typically sufficient in view of the very low evapotranspiration to allow a water sogged terrain in many areas of subarctic climate

Poleward or even approaching polar seas the warmest month has an average temperature of less than 10C and the subarctic climate grades into a tundra climate even less suitable for trees

Sample locations with such climates 

Sample locations with the extreme Dfd climate include

The ONS coding system is a system used in the United Kingdom for dealing with census and other statistical data It is used by the Office for National Statistics as a way to label each area of England and Wales It is also used for parts of Northern Ireland The system uses a code for the larger census areas counties and districts It then breaks those areas down into smaller areas within the larger areas Each of the smaller areas get a code that is based on the larger area Areas are divided in this way until they get to the smallest size used for census data An area must have at least 40 households but they try to not divide an area into a size smaller than 100 households 

Sir Michael Kemp Tippett OM CH CBE was an English composer He is one of the greatest and most original composers of the 20th century He did not start to study music seriously until he was nearly grown up and only become famous when he was about 40 The rhythms in his music and the tonality are very original He is remembered for many kinds of music opera oratorio orchestral music chamber music and piano music His oratorio A Child of our Time is especially well known and often performed by choirs

Tippett spent his childhood in a small village in Suffolk His father had retired and had bought a hotel in Cannes France Michael and his brother learned to speak French when they were very young He was sent to school in Edinburgh when he was 13 but did not like it there so he went to the local Stamford Grammar School in Lincolnshire

The only musical training he had as a child were his piano lessons When he had finished his school years he decided he wanted to be a composer but neither he nor his parents knew the best way to become a composer He started having more piano lessons Then someone said he should go to the Royal College of Music He went there at the beginning of the summer term 1923 and spent five years there studying music He then moved to Oxted in Surrey and for six years he taught French at a school He composed in his free time

In Oxted there was a small choir Tippett had sung with them while he was a student Now he became their conductor and he learned a lot about music by getting the choir to sing English madrigals and other music including operatic music He took some more lessons in composition from ROMorris at the RCM He went to music camps where he learned more ideas about politics than about music He agreed with a lot of the ideas of Trotsky He became a pacifist and in 1940 he registered as a conscientious objector In 1943 he spent three months in prison because he refused to help with the war effort

Meanwhile Tippett had become director of music at Morley College He made the choir there into one of the best choirs in England He played a lot of music by Henry Purcell whose music was not as well known then as it is now He also worked with young musicians who later became famous the tenor Peter Pears the countertenor Alfred Deller and the Amadeus String Quartet 

In 1951 he became a broadcaster with the BBC Some of the talks he gave on the radio were published in his book Moving into Aquarius He continued a brilliant career as composer conductor and broadcaster He was director of the Bath Festival which he helped to improve a lot He became internationally famous especially in America His Symphony no 4 and his oratorio Mask of Time were written for performances in America His last opera New Year was written jointly for the Houston Grand Opera Glyndebourne and the BBC He was made a CBE in 1966 and was knighted in 1966 and was made a Companion of Honour in 1979 and received an Order of Merit in 1983 He received many honours from universities

Tippett died from pneumonia in 1998 after travelling to Stockholm for a festival which included all his works except his stage works Although he was able to return home he died shortly afterwards

It is unusual for a great musician to begin studying music properly at the age of 18 However he was old enough to realize that he had a lot to learn He studied counterpoint and was influenced by the way Classical composers had shaped their music Beethoven especially was an inspiration for him One of his best known works is the Concerto for Double String Orchestra It shows his love of folk music as well as interest in English music of the Renaissance This music is exciting because of its beats which keep changing and its dance like character

A Child of Our Time was an oratorio which used negro spirituals He combined these with his own style of music It is about something that really happened in 1938 A 17 year old Jewish Polish boy killed a Nazi diplomat because the Nazis had taken away his parents The Nazis were angry and killed lots of Jews in return It was something which helped to lead to the World War II Tippetts music is about the cruelty that humans show towards one another

Tippetts operas include A Midsummer Marriage King Priam The Knot Garden and The Ice Break and New Year He wrote several choral works His orchestral works include 4 symphonies a Fantasia concertante on a Theme of Corelli for strings a Piano Concerto and a Concerto for violin viola and cello His chamber music includes piano sonatas and string quartets 

Tippett published many of his writings Moving into Aquarius consists of talks given on the BBC In his autobiography Those Twentieth Century Blues he discusses many of his problems including his homosexuality which in his earlier years he could not talk about because it was illegal at that time 

A claw is a sharp object It is found at the end of a toe or finger in many mammals birds and some reptiles The word claws is most often used in reference to an invertebrate For example the crabs and lobsters claws or pincers 

A claw is made of hard protein called keratin They are used by some meat eating mammals such as cats and dogs to catch and hold prey but they may also be used for other things such as digging climbing trees and so on in those and other species

Similar appendages that are flat and do not come to a sharp point are called nails instead 

The correct name for an arthropods claw is chela Legs that have a chela are called chelipeds Chelae are also called pincers

Tetrapods claws are made of keratin and have of two layers The unguis is the outside hard layer which has keratin fibers arranged perpendicular to the direction of growth and in layers at an angle The subunguis is the soft flaky layer and the grain is parallel to the direction of growth The claw grows outward from the nail matrix at the base of the unguis and the subunguis grows thicker while traveling across the nail bed The unguis grows outward faster than the subunguis to make a curve and the thinner sides of the claw wear away faster than their thicker middle making a more or less sharp point Tetrapods use their claws in many ways such as grasping or killing prey digging climbing and hanging

A talon is the claw of a bird of preywhich it uses to hunt The talons are very important and if they did not have them most birds would not be able to catch their food

A nail is similar to a claw but it is flatter and has a curved edge instead of a point A nail that is big enough to hold weight is called a hoof see also Horse hoof 

Every so often the growth of claws stops and restarts just like the growth of hair In hair this causes the hair to fall out and it is replaced by a new one In claws this results in an old layer and it breaks off This takes several months for human thumbnails Cats are often seen working old layers off on wood or on boards made for the purpose Ungulates hoovestrim themselves when they walk on the ground Domesticated equids usually need regular trimming by a farrier

Many predatory mammals have claws that can hide inside the animals paw especially animals such as the cat

A primates nail only has the unguis the subunguis has disappeared Similar to the tail the claw in apes is not needed However in some primates the subunguis has redeveloped to make a claw like structure These certain animals do not have actual claws instead the unguis appears normal along with a thick growth of subunguis However some lemurs have a toilet claw

Max and Moritz are two naughty little boys in a story by Wilhelm Busch The stories were written in 1865 and are still extremely popular in Germany

Wilhelm Busch was an artist as well as a writer He wrote a lot of stories in rhyme and made drawings to go with them Max and Moritz are stories like these The two boys get up to lots of naughty pranks There are seven stories In the final prank they are caught and come to a sad end In the 19th century writers had to show that bad behaviour would be punished in the end The seven stories are stories with a moral

In the first story the boys tie pieces of bread onto pieces of string and put it down where an old woman Widow Bolte keeps her hens The hens each try to swallow a piece of bread which sticks in their throats and they end up hanging in the tree and die

In the second story Widow Bolte who is still crying decides she might as well roast the hens The boys take fishing rods climb onto the roof and pull the frying chickens up with their rods Widow Bolte finds the chickens gone thinks her little dog has eaten them and gives the poor dog a beating

In the third story they take a saw and make a hole in the tiny wooden bridge outside the tailors house They shout at the tailor calling him names He is furious and comes running out the bridge breaks and he falls into the stream Two flying geese save him He has a terrible tummy ache but his wife puts a hot iron on his tummy and he feels better

In the fourth story the boys put gunpowder in the pipe of the schoolmaster while he is in church When he lights his pipe there is an explosion

In the fifth story the boys collect beetles and put them under the mattress in their uncles bed In the middle of the night when the uncle is asleep the beetles creep up on him He wakes up and fights with them until he has killed them all

In the sixth story the boys try to steal some pretzels from the bakery but they fall into the tub of dough The baker comes in and finds them He bakes them in the oven but when they are taken out they eat their way through the dough and escape

Abstinence is a voluntary restraint from following a desire or appetite for certain bodily activities that are widely experienced as giving pleasure Most frequently the term refers to abstention from sexual intercourse alcohol or food The practice can arise from religious prohibitions or practical considerations

In India Buddhists Jains and some Hindus abstain from eating meat on the grounds both of health and of reverence for all sentient forms of life Total abstinence from feeding on the flesh of cows is a hallmark of Hinduism

Sexual abstinence is the practice of voluntarily refraining from some or all aspects of sexual activity Common reasons to deliberately abstain from the physical expression of sexual desire include religious or philosophical reasons material reasons or to conform to legal regulations

Sexual abstinence has been debated since ancient history both in terms of same sex and opposite sex relationships 

Many religious and ethical systems proscribe sexual activities between a person and anyone other than a spouse of that person including most denominational variations of Judaism Christianity and Islam as have historically many legal systems and societal norms 

Council of Jerusalem is a common name for a meeting of early Christian leaders reported in the Acts of the Apostles chapter bibleverse nbActs15 The meeting must have happened about the year 50 at the latest some time before the death of James the Just in 62

A common interpretation is that the council came together because there was disagreement within the Early Christian community between those who believed the church must observe the rules of traditional Judaism and Paul of Tarsus who believed there was no such necessity The rules of traditional Judaism the Halakha of Rabbinic Judaism were not finished at this time

The central issue was circumcision as the author of Acts relates the initial confrontation in Antioch where Paul had been preaching

Ironing means getting the creases out of clothes after they have been washed and dried Ironing is done with a tool called an iron It is called an iron because the bottom part is traditionally made of iron a type of metal The iron is heated before it is used This used to be done by putting the iron on a fire Nowadays electricity is used to warm the iron The water inside becomes steam 

Ironing clothes is usually easiest when the clothes are still very slightly damp but it depends on the material of the clothes There is normally a label on the clothes which shows whether it can be ironed and at what temperature The clothes to be ironed are put on an ironing board and the iron is pushed carefully along the clothes to get all the wrinkles out Ironing is usually done with an ironing board 

Central European Time is a time zone It is one hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time Most countries in the central part of Europe and some countries in Africa follow it 

In Europe the countries of Ireland Great Britain Iceland and Portugal use Western European Time All the other countries up to Norway Poland Slovakia Hungary Bosnia and Herzegovina Serbia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia use Central European Time 

Central European Summer Time is the name for a time zone Some of the countries that have Central European Time shift their clocks forward one hour during the summer months And shift it 1 hour backwards during winter months

James the Just also called James Adelphotheos James 1st Bishop of Jerusalem or James the Brother of the Lord and sometimes identified with James the Less was an important figure in Early Christianity 

According to tradition he was the first formal leader or bishop of Jerusalem the author of the James in the New Testament and the first of the Seventy of Luke 101 20 Paul of Tarsus in Galatians 29 characterized James as such James Cephas and John who seemed to be pillars He is described in the New Testament as a brother of Jesus and in the Liturgy of St James as the brother of God 

James was called the Just because of his ascetic practices which involved taking Nazarite vows The name also helps distinguish him from other important figures in early Christianity such as James son of Zebedee 

He is sometimes called James Adelphotheos based on New Testament descriptions James name was important in the genealogy of Jesus because he always appears first when someone lists Jesus brothers and sisters this means that James was the eldest brother of Jesus

The canonical writings of the New Testament as well as other written sources from the early church provide some insights into Saint James life and his role in the early church The Synoptics mention his name but nothing else about him whereas the Gospel of John and early chapters of the Acts of the Apostles do not even mention James

Acts of the Apostles in later chapters provides evidence that James was an important figure in the Christian community of Jerusalem When Peter having miraculously escaped from prison must flee Jerusalem he asks that James be informed When the Christians of Antioch are concerned over whether Gentile Christians need be circumcised to be saved and they send Paul and Barnabas to confer with the Jerusalem church there James played a prominent role in the formulation of the councils decision Indeed after Peter and Paul have made their case it is James who finally delivers what he calls his judgement  the original sense is close to my ruling  and afterwards all accept it James in other words is shown in charge of the Jerusalem group which conflicts with later claims of Peters primacy there And when Paul arrives in Jerusalem to deliver the money he raised for the faithful there it is to James that he speaks and who insists that Paul ritually cleanse himself at Herods Temple to prove his faith and deny rumors of teaching rebellion against the Torah

Paul further describes James as being one of the persons the risen Christ showed himself to then later in 1 Corinthians mentions James in a way that suggests James had been married and in Galatians Paul lists James with Cephas and John as the three pillars of the Church and who will minister to the circumcised in Jerusalem while Paul and his fellows will minister to the uncircumcised These terms are generally interpreted to mean Jews and Greeks who were predominant however it is an oversimplification as 1st century Iudaea Province also had some Jews who no longer circumcised and some Greeks and others such as Egyptians Ethiopians and Arabs who did

In Christianity the disciples were the students of Jesus during his ministry which means only the Twelve Apostles but the gospels speaks of different numbers of disciples In the Book of Acts the Apostles themselves have disciples The word disciple is used today as a way of self identification for those who seek to learn from Christianity

The term disciple comes from the New Testament Greek word

coming to English by way of the Latin discipulus Disciple should not be confused with apostle meaning 

Both the gospels of Mark and Matthew include passages where Jesus initially calls four fishermen from among those at the Sea of Galilee These are Simon and his brother Andrew and the brothers James and John A very similar report in the Gospel of Luke bibleverse nbLuke5111 does not speak of Andrew bibleverseJohn135 51 also includes an initial calling of disciples but these are an unnamed disciple Andrew Simon Philip and Nathanael

Since the Gospel of Luke does not include Andrew and through various passages in the four gospels where Simon Peter James and John are called to meet with Jesus separately from the twelve they are commonly termed the three The usage of the four over the three is still a point which some Christians debate but never as an essential doctrinal point

Most of the attention in the gospels is given to a specific group of disciples called by Jesus on the top of a mountain and commissioned by him as the Twelve Apostles These men are

The Gospel of John refers to one disciple as the one whom Jesus loved Since the apostle John unlike the other twelve is never named in that gospel the beloved disciple is assumed to be him

The number of or persons among Jesus disciples is not always given in the gospel accounts A much larger group of people is identified as disciples in the opening of the passage of the Sermon on the Plain that begins in Luke bibleverse nbLuke617

Additionally seventy people are sent out in pairs to prepare the way for Jesus They are sometimes referred to as the Seventy or the Seventy Disciples They are to eat any food offered heal the sick and spread the word that Gods reign is coming that whoever hears them hears Jesus whoever rejects them rejects Jesus and whoever rejects Jesus rejects the One who sent him In addition they are granted great powers over the enemy and their names are written in heaven

Cleopas is one of the two disciples to whom the risen Lord appeared at Emmaus Cleopas with an unnamed disciple of Jesus are walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus on the day of Jesus resurrection Cleopas and his friend were discussing the events of the past few days when a stranger asked them what they spoke of The stranger asked to join Cleopas and his friend for the evening meal There the stranger revealed himself after blessing and breaking the bread as the resurrected Jesus and then disappeared Cleopas and his friend hastened to Jerusalem to carry the news to the other disciples where Jesus subsequently appeared to them as well The incident is without parallel in Matthew Mark or John

In Luke Mary sister of Lazarus is contrasted with her sister Martha who was cumbered about many things while Jesus was their guest while Mary had chosen the better part that of listening to the masters discourse John names her as the one who had anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and dried his feet with her hair In Luke an unidentified sinner in the house of a Pharisee anoints Jesus feet Any pre existing relationship between Jesus and Lazarus himself prior to the miracle is unspecified by John In Catholic folklore Mary the sister of Lazarus is seen as the same as Mary Madgalene

Luke refers to a number of people accompanying Jesus and the twelve From among them he names three women Mary called Magdalene and Joanna the wife of Herods steward Chuza and Susanna and many others who provided for them out of their resources Mary Magdalene and Joanna are among the women who went to prepare Jesus body in Lukes account of the resurrection and who later told the apostles and other disciples about the empty tomb and words of the two men in dazzling clothes Mary Magdalene is the most well known of the disciples outside of the Twelve More is written in the gospels about her than the other female followers There is also a large body of lore and literature covering her

Other gospel writers differ as to which women witness the crucifixion and witness to the resurrection Mark includes Mary the mother of James and Salome at the crucifixion and Salome at the tomb John includes Mary the wife of Clopas at the crucifixion

Ahmed Jabril born in 1938 is the founder and co leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command He founded it in 1968 His son Jihad Jabril was to take over but was killed by a car bomb in Beirut in 2002

Jihad Jabril was the son of Ahmed Jibril founder of the PFLP G He was killed by a car bomb He was assassinated on May 20 2002 Jihad Ahmed Jibril was the leader of the military wing of the PFLP GC and was the heir apparent of the organization before he was killed in a car bombing in Beirut in 2002 The assassination was blamed on Israel although Jibril had many other enemies including the Lebanese Christian militia and other Palestinian nationalist organizations 

Ahmed Jabril was co leader of the militant Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command Israeli radio reports said that the son Jihad Jabril was involved in smuggling arms and explosives to Palestinian militants in the West Bank and Gaza Strip But there was no evidence to directly link him with terrorist attacks

Ahmed Jabril accused the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad of responsibility for the killing but a spokesman for Defense Minister Benjamin Ben Eliezer said Israel was not involved

In mid June 2006 Lebanon authorities arrested a group of alleged spies who reportedly confessed to working for Israel and carrying out the attacks

The Topkap Palace is a palace in Istanbul Turkey Topkap Saray in Turkish means the Cannongate Palace It was built in 1465 The palace was the administrative center of the Ottoman Empire It was turned into a museum at the request of Turkeys first President Mustafa Kemal Atatrk in 1924 It was built on the acropolis the site of the first settlement in Istanbul The palace has an very good view of the Golden Horn the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara The palace is surrounded by 5km of walls It has an area of 700000 sq m at the tip of the historical peninsula

The First Court spans over the entire Seraglio Point and is surrounded by high walls This court was also known as the Court of the Janissaries or the Parade Court

The main gate is called Bab Hmayun simply the Imperial Gate Apart from the Topkap Palace the First Court also contains the old imperial mint the church of Hagia Eirene the Archeology Museum and various fountains pavilions and gardens 

The inili Pavilion has many superb examples of Iznik tiles It now houses the Museum of Islamic Art

The Fountain of the Executioner is where the executioner washed his hands and sword after a beheading The Fountain of Ahmed III is an example of Rococo work 

The huge Gate of Greeting leads into the palace and the Second Court

The second court is a park surrounded by the palace hospital bakery Janissary quarters stables the imperial Harem and Divan to the north and the kitchens to the south The kitchens today contain one of the worlds largest collections of Chinese blue and white and celadon porcelain valued by the sultans because it was supposed to change color if the food or drink it contained was poisoned 

The Divan Salonu or Imperial Council Chamber was where the sultans counselors and functionaries met to discuss the empires affairs The Sultan could overhear from a concealed grille

Beyond the Gate of Felicity is the Third Court which is the heart of the palace a lush garden surrounded by the Hall of the Privy Chamber occupied by the palace officials the treasury the Harem and some pavilions with the library of Ahmed III in the center 

The Treasury holds some of the most famous and spectacular jewels in the world including the famous Topkap Dagger In 1747 the Sultan had this dagger made for Nadir Shah of Persia but the Shah was assassinated before the emissary had left the Ottoman Empires boundaries and so the Sultan retained it There are three large emeralds in the hilt and the sheath is worked with diamonds and enamel This dagger was the subject of the famous film Topkapi 

The Harem was home to the Sultans mother the Valide sultan the concubines and wives of the Sultan and the rest of his family including children and their servants There are approximately 300 rooms and the Harem housed as many as 500 people which sometimes amounted up to 300 women their children and the eunuchs 

Many of the rooms and features in the Harem were designed by Sinan a famous architect of the Ottoman Empire 

The Pavilion of the Holy Mantle holds the cloak of Mohammed his sword his teeth his beard and other relics which are known as the Sacred Trusts Even the Sultan and his family were permitted entrance only once a year on the 15th day of Ramadan during the time when the Palace was a residence Now any visitor can see these items and many Muslims come on pilgrimage for this purpose

The Acts of the Apostles is a book of the Bible which now is the fifth in the New Testament It is often simply called Acts

Leo III refers to

Leo III was Pope from 795 to 816 He is famous for the coronation of Charlemagne as emperor in 800

Leo reported his election to Charlemagne sent him the keys of Saint Peters tomb and the banner of Rome Charlemagne replied that it was his function to defend the church and the Popes to pray for the kingdom and for victory of the army

Charlemagne went to Rome in November 800 and on December 1 held a council there with representatives of both sides Leo on December 23 took an oath of purgation concerning the charges brought against him and his opponents were exiled Two days later Leo crowned Charlemagne at St Peters tomb Charlemagne did intervene in church affairs not always successfully

The reasons for the coronation the involvement beforehand of the Frankish court and the relationship to the Byzantine Empire are all matters of debate among historians

Satire was used long ago even as long ago as the Ancient Greeks It was widely known in Elizabethan times Swift used satire in his book Gullivers Travels to make fun of peoples stupidity Works like The Beggars Opera used satire to show how silly the politicians of the time were In modern times the German playwright Bertolt Brecht used a lot of satire in his plays

Satire is not possible under dictatorships It was not allowed for example in the Soviet Union Anyone trying to make fun of Stalin would have been put to death immediately 

Satire often points out bad things that powerful people are doing but may also harm disadvantaged or nonfamous people like you and me The adjective is satirical

The Iron Cross was a medal given to German soldiers for bravery during wartime The award was created by King Frederick William III of Prussia It was first given out on 10 March 1813 The Iron Cross was awarded during the Napoleonic Wars the Franco Prussian War the First World War and the Second World War This medal was received by Adolf Hitler after World War I

The medal is only given in wartime so no Iron Crosses have been given out since the end of the Second World War in 1945

During the Second World War an extra type of Iron Cross medal was given It was the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross and was given for acts of extreme battlefield bravery or successful leadership The Knights Cross was divided into five grades

Bryozoans or Ectoprocta are a phylum of small aquatic animals living in colonies The colonies usually have a skeleton of calcium carbonate Bryozoans have a long fossil history starting in the Ordovician In their life style they resemble the polyps which form coral Bryozoa are known informally as moss animals or sea mats They generally like warm tropical waters but live all over the world There are about 4000 living species and 15000 fossil species are known 

The colonies are formed by tiny members called zooids These secrete tubes usually of lime sometimes of chitin an organic compound All bryozoa have a lophophore This is a ring of ten tentacles surrounding the mouth each tentacle covered with cilia When feeding the zooid extends the lophophore outwards when resting it is withdrawn into the mouth to protect it from predators 

 Reproduction development  Bryozoans can reproduce both sexually and asexually All Bryozoans as far as is known are hermaphrodite

All members of a colony are clones they are genetically identical produced by asexual reproduction This occurs by budding off new zooids from the first zooid So the colony grows this is the way a colony expands in size If a piece of a bryozoan colony breaks off the piece can continue to grow and will form a new colony

All zooids in a colony are linked by strands of epithelial cells The individual members of a colony the zooids are in some species generalised they feed and they can reproduce on occasion But in most species the zooids are specialised to diffent functions In this case the feeding zooids are called autozooids and the non feeding members are called heterozooids Functions performed by heterozooids include sexual reproduction protection locomotion plumbing structural support The functions of some heterozooids is still unknown The commonest function is that eggs are developed in brooding chambers on female or hermaphrodite heterozooids There are variations in the details sometimes a little complex of heterozooids produce larvae in a cooperative effortp4

Another way to describe the bryozoa which develop heterozooids is to say they are polymorphic This term is used in biology to describe the way a genetically unified population develops into clearly distinct forms The polymorphism is usually controlled by genetic switching mechanisms but in bryozoa there is little knowledge of their genetics 

Most species of Bryozoan live in marine environments There are about 50 species which inhabit freshwater In their aquatic habitats bryozoans live on all types of hard substrates sand grains rocks shells wood blades of kelp pipes and ships may be heavily encrusted with bryozoans Some bryozoan colonies however do not grow on solid substrates but form colonies on sediment While some species live at depths of 8200 m most bryozoans live in much shallower water Most bryozoans are sessile and immobile but a few colonies are able to creep about and a few species of non colonial bryozoans live and move about in the spaces between sand grains One remarkable species makes its living while floating in the Southern Ocean Several bryozoan species live in the Midwestern United States especially in Ohio Indiana and Kentucky which used to be a part of a large ocean

Their diet consists of small microorganisms including diatoms and other unicellular algae In turn bryozoans are preyed on by grazing organisms such as sea urchins and fish 

Bryozoans are almost entirely colony forming animals Many millions of individuals can form one colony The colonies range from millimeters to meters in size but the individuals that make up the colonies are tiny usually less than a millimeter long In each colony different individuals have different functions Some individuals gather up the food for the colony others depend on them Some individuals are devoted to strengthening the colony and still others to cleaning the colony There is only a single known solitary species Monobryozoon ambulans which does not form colonies

Bryozoan skeletons grow in a variety of shapes and patterns mound shaped lacy fans branching twigs and even corkscrew shaped Their skeletons have many tiny openings Each opening is the home of zooid They have a body with a U shaped gut opening at the mouth and at the anus They feed with their lophophore The tentacles of the bryozoans are ciliated The beating of the cilia creates a current of water which drives food towards the mouth In some groups notably some ctenostomes a gizzard may be formed 

Bryozoans do not have a respiratory or a blood system because their small size allows diffusion of gases and nutrients However they do have a simple nervous system and muscles which together can quickly take the zooid down into its shelter

One species of bryozoan Bugula neritina is of current interest as a source of chemicals bryostatins which are under investigation as anti cancer agents

Fossil bryozoans live in rocks beginning in the early Ordovician They were from then on abundant in the Palaeozoic era They were major components of seabed communities and like modern day bryozoans played an important role in sediment stabilization and binding as well as providing sources of food for other benthic organisms During the Lower Carboniferous 354 to 323 million years ago bryozoans were so common that their broken skeletons form entire limestone beds Bryozoan fossil record comprises more than 15000 species 

Most fossil bryozoans have mineralized skeletons The skeletons of individual zooids vary from tubular to box shaped and contain a terminal aperture from which the lophophore is protruded to feed No pores are present in the great majority of Ordovician bryozoans but skeletal evidence shows that epithelia were continuous from one zooid to the next

Some bryozoa lack mineralized skeletons The statoblasts of freshwater Phylactolaemates have been recorded as far back as the Permian and the Ctenostome fossils date only from the Triassic

One of the most important events during bryozoan evolution was the acquisition of a calcareous skeleton and the related change in the mechanism of tentacle protrusion The rigidity of the outer body walls gave protection against predators a greater degree of zooid contiguity and the evolution of massive multiserial colony forms

In medicine the placebo effect basically means that if a person believes that a medicine diet or other treatment is good for himself or herself then it is good for the person

A placebo is a medicine or diet which may have a medical effect based solely on the power of suggestion an effect known as the placebo effect or placebo response It may be produced through ingestion injection inhalation insertion into a body cavity or applied topically

The term placebo effect was introduced by T C Graves in 1920 

Placebos are used to create blind trials They are not the only technique for this but are a very common and important one Blind trials work like this Some people are given the medicine or treatment being tested and others are given the placebo No one knows who gets the real treatment and who gets the placebo They are blind to their treatment

If researchers notice that the treatment group is different from the placebo group they will know that the difference is because of the treatment Without a placebo group then researchers cannot know if those changes would have happened anyway no matter which medicine people had taken Whether or not there is a placebo effect use of placebos will remain an important technique Recent skeptical meta analysis of placebo effects suggest that the effect does exist but only in very limited contexts

Placebos are often seen as posing ethical difficulties Essentially the issues are of two kinds neither about placebos alone Deceiving participants of experiments or at least withholding information Withholding treatment from patients The tension here is between the greater certainty a controlled experiment will give versus the prior guesses of people and experts After all a person probably wouldnt do an experiment unless he had some reason to hope a treatment worked but if he does have such grounds then his opinion of the best treatment should be given to all patients rather than give some a placebo

Ways of classifying and comparing such effects Can we organize these various reported effects in some useful way What are the effects that might be related

The word placebo has been used at various times and places to mean any of these 

Equality can mean several things

In sciences

In humanities

People and places

Identity could mean

Two mathematical objects are equal if and only if they are exactly the same in every way This defines a binary relation equality marked by the sign of equality in such a way that the statement x y means that x and y are equal

Equivalence in a more general sense is provided by the construction of an equivalence relation between two sets that is the two sets have exactly the same elements The sets do not need to be finite to be equal A statement that two expressions denote equal quantities is an equation

The term ministry could mean

Ministry in Christianity is the activity that is done by members of the church to serve the purposes of the church 

It can mean this activity as a whole or specific activities or organizations in a church that perform specific activities 

As churches attempt to meet the needs of their congregations they often separate their members into groups according to age categories Age specific groups meet for religious study including Sunday school programs fellowship and other activities These age divisions may include

Nearly all churches have some form of worship music whether from a choir orchestra or worship band 

Many churches sponsor ministries designed to reach out others on a local and global scale usually grouped under the heading of missions There are many organizations which perform missions on a fully funded and organized level such as North American Mission Board operated by the Southern Baptist Convention

A ministry is a department of a government led by a political minister Ministries are usually subordinate to the cabinet and prime minister president or chancellor A government will usually have several ministries each with a specialised field of service National ministries vary greatly between countries but some common ones include Ministry of Defence Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Health 

Some countries such as Switzerland the Philippines and the United States do not use the term ministry for their government departments and instead simply call them departments In Hong Kong the term bureau is used

In Canada some provincial level government departments are called ministries but most are called departments Their heads are referred to as ministers in both levels of government however

A strong nuclear force holds the nuclei of atoms together

It represents the interactions between quarks and gluons in the theory of quantum chromodynamics Quantum chromodynamics is the theory that explains different colours The strong force is the fundamental force mediated by gluons acting upon quarks antiquarks and the gluons themselves

Although the strong force only acts upon elementary particles directly the force is observed between hadrons as the nuclear force As has been shown by many failed free quark searches the elementary particles affected are unobservable directly This phenomenon is called confinement a theory which allows only hadrons to be seen

Galerius was Roman Emperor from 305 to 311

Galerius served as a soldier with distinction He became Caesar in 293 along with Constantius Chlorus when the Tetrarchy was introduced by Diocletian He married Diocletians daughter Valeria and took over the care of the Illyrian provinces

In 296 at the beginning of the Persian War he moved from the Danube to the Euphrates There his first campaign ended in a defeat by Narses near Callinicum which caused the loss of Mesopotamia 

Diocletian came to Antioch where the official version of events was made clear Galerius was to take all the blame In Antioch Diocletian forced Galerius to walk a mile in advance of his imperial cart while still clad in the purple robes of an emperorp17p2923 The message conveyed was clear the loss at Carrhae was not due to the failings of the empires soldiers but due to the failings of their commander and Galerius failures would not be accepted

In 298 Galerius got reinforcements from the Danube in the Spring He led the army to attack Narseh in northern Mesopotamia and Narseh retreated to Armenia

The rugged Armenian terrain was favorable to Roman infantry but unfavorable to Sassanid cavalry Local aid gave Galerius the advantage of surprise over the Persian forces and in two successive battles Galerius secured victories over Narsehp18p293 

During the second encounter Roman forces seized Narsehs camp his treasury his harem and his wife along with itp18 Narsehs wife would live out the remainder of the war in Daphne a suburb of Antioch serving to the Persians as a constant reminder of Roman victoryp293 Galerius advanced into Media and Adiabene winning victories particularly near Erzurump151 and securing Nisibis before 1 October 298 He moved down the Tigris taking Ctesiphon and looking at the ruins of Babylon before returning to Roman territory via the Euphrates

Narses asked for peace Mesopotamia was returned to Roman rule and even some territory east of the Tigris which marks the greatest extension of the Roman Empire in the east

In 305 on the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian Galerius got the title of Augustus together with Constantius his former colleague Two younger men were appointed as Caesars Maximus Daia and Severus II

His hopes were dashed when his colleague Constantius died at York in 306 and the legions elevated his son Constantine to the position of Augustus Galerius only discovered this when he got a letter from Constantine who told him of his fathers death modestly asserted his natural claim to the succession and respectfully lamented that the enthusiasm of his troops had not allowed him to get the Imperial purple in a regular manner The first emotions of Galerius were those of surprise disappointment and rage and as he could seldom restrain his passions he threatened to burn both the letter and the messengerp289p627980p160

But when he had time to reconsider his position he realised his chances of winning a war against Constantine was doubtful Therefore without commenting on the choice of the British army Galerius accepted the son of his deceased colleague as the ruler of the provinces beyond the Alps but he gave him only the title of Caesar and the fourth rank among the Roman princes whilst he conferred the vacant place of Augustus on his favourite Severus II

Suddenly Galerius had the unexpected loss of Italy to Maxentius Galerius need for additional revenue led him to make a strict and rigorous examination of the property of his subjects for the purpose of taxation A survey was taken of their estates and wherever there was the slightest suspicion of concealment torture was used to obtain a sincere declaration of their personal wealth 

Italy had traditionally been exempt from any form of taxation but Galerius ignored this Italy began to murmur against this indignity and Maxentius used this sentiment to declare himself emperor in Italy to the fury of Galerius Therefore Galerius ordered his colleague Severus to immediately march to Rome so that by his unexpected arrival he would easily suppress the rebellion Severus was quickly captured and executed by Maximian who had once again been elevated to the rank of co emperor this time by his son Maxentius

The importance of the occasion needed the presence and abilities of Galerius At the head of a powerful army collected from Illyricum and the East he entered Italy determined to revenge the death of Severus and to punish the rebellious Romansp122 But due to the skill of Maximian Galerius found every place hostile fortified and inaccessible and though he forced his way as far as Narni within sixty miles of Rome his control in Italy was confined to the narrow limits of his camp

Seeing that he was facing difficulties Galerius made the first advances towards reconciliation and dispatched two officers to tempt the Romans by the offer of a conference The offers of Galerius were rejected with firmness his friendship refused Unless he retreated he might meet the fate of Severus It was not a moment too soon large monetary gifts from Maxentius to his soldiers had corrupted the fidelity of the Illyrian legions When Galerius began his withdrawal from Italy it was only with great difficulty that he managed to stop his veterans deserting him

In frustration Galerius allowed his legions to ravage the countryside as they passed northwards Maxentius declined to make a general engagement

With so many emperors now in existence in 308 Galerius together with the retired emperor Diocletian and the now active Maximian called an imperial conference at Carnuntum on the River Danube to rectify the situation and bring some order back into the imperial government Here it was agreed that Galerius long time friend and military companion Licinius who had been entrusted by Galerius with the defense of the Danube while Galerius was in Italy would become Augustus in the West with Constantine as his Caesar In the East Galerius remained Augustus and Maximinus remained his Caesar Maximian was to retire and Maxentius was declared a usurper

Galerius plan soon failed The news of Licinius promotion was no sooner carried into the East than Maximinus who governed the provinces of Egypt and Syria rejected his position as Caesar and notwithstanding the prayers as well as arguments of Galerius exacted the equal title of Augustus For the first and indeed for the last time six emperors administered the Roman world Although the memory of a recent war divided the empire into two great hostile powers their fears and the fading authority of Galerius produced an apparent tranquility in the imperial government

The last years of Galerius saw him keep the position of first among equals He spent the rest of his time enjoying himself and ordering some important public works such as discharging into the Danube the superfluous waters of Lake Pelso and cutting down the immense forests around it

Christians had lived in peace during most of the rule of Diocletian The persecutions that began with an edict of 24 February 303 were credited by Christians to the influence of Galerius Christian houses of assembly were destroyed for fear of secret gatherings

But in in April 311 he issued the general edict of toleration from Nicomedia in his own name and in those of Licinius and Constantine Lactantius gives the text of the edict in De Mortibus Persecutorum This marked the end of official persecution of Christians Galerius died on 5 May 311

Square Foot Gardening is a type of gardening made popular by Mel Bartholemew It is based on the idea that the wide rows in traditional gardening are a waste of time work water and area It shows that quality vegetables can be grown in less space with less work In this method the garden space is divided into beds Each bed is 4 x 4 The beds are separated by paths These beds are further divided into squares of about one square foot Common spacing is one plant per square for larger plants such as broccoli and basil four per square for medium large plants like lettuce nine per square for medium small plants like spinach and sixteen per square for small plants such as onions and carrots The weeds are removed from the beds and the plants are watered from the pathways This stops the soil from being compacted

A blender is an electric kitchen appliance used for making drinks mixing liquids and pureing fruits and vegetables for sauces and soups 

A blender consists of a glass or plastic container with a mounted blade in the bottom and a base that has an electric motor and switches to turn on the motor or change its speed Blenders are used to make milk shakes and fruit smoothies 

Blenders are also used to make cold alcoholic drinks that include crushed ice or ice cream such as margaritas and Mississippi Mudslide drinks

A drinking straw is a utensil used to consume cold drinks such as milk shakes smoothies cola and fruit juice Drinking straws are usually made from plastic that is formed into a tube To use a drinking straw a person places the straw in a glass that contains a liquid and then sucks the straw with their mouth

In music a whole tone scale is a scale in which each note is separated from the next one by the interval of a whole tone There is always one note in between each pair of notes of the whole tone scale  There are only two combinations possible for a whole tone scale 

When one of these scales is played on a piano starting from a low note and moving up to high notes while at the same time pressing the sustaining pedal it makes a dreamy sound It does not sound in any particular key but floats along It also sounds very good on a harp

Debussy uses the whole tone scale a lot in his music but he was not the first to do so Russian composers such as Glinka in his opera Ruslan and Ludmila and Borodin in Prince Igor used the whole tone scale

Later composers to use it include Alban Berg in his Violin Concerto and Bla Bartk in his String Quartet No 5 It has also been used in jazz

In music a pentatonic scale is a scale with five notes in each octave Pentatonic scales are very common and are found in folk music from all over the world

Any scale using five notes is pentatonic However the pentatonic scale which is used in most Western music uses notes which do not have any semitones A pentatonic scale starting on C will use the notes CDEGA An easy way to find such a pentatonic scale is by using all the black notes of a keyboard

Using the pentatonic scale is a good way for children to make up their own tunes It does not matter too much which note is used for the start and the finish because there is no feeling of a clear key The notes always sound good when played together

Many folksongs are pentatonic or nearly pentatonic Well known songs such as Land of the Silver Birch or Auld Lang Syne are pentatonic tunes

Classical composers have sometimes used pentatonic scales especially Claude Debussy His piano piece La fille aux cheveux de lin has a tune which is pentatonic except for one note Maurice Ravel used it to write music which sounded Chinese and in his Mother Goose suite which sounds like a fairy tale

The pentatonic scales used in Indonesian gamelan music are called slendro and pelog

In music theory the major scale or Ionian scale is one of the diatonic scales It is made up of seven separate notes plus an eighth which is the same as the first an octave higher In solfege these notes correspond to the syllables Do Re Mi Fa Sol La TiSi The simplest major scale to write or play on the piano is C major the only major scale not to require sharps or flats using only the white keys on the piano keyboard

A major scale is a set of steps in the order WholeWholeHalfWholeWholeWholeHalf Western scales do not skip any line or space on the staff and they do not repeat any note with a different accidental This means that the key signature of the scale will feature just sharps or just flats

The Circle of Fifths was first described in 1728 by Johann David Heinichen in his book Der General bass It has been used ever since as a way to show the relations between scales

The numbers inside the circle show the number of sharps or flats in the key signature with the sharp keys going broken wikt linkclockwiseclockwise and the flat keys broken wikt linkcounterclockwisecounterclockwise from C major The circle depends on enharmonic relationships in the circle which is six sharps or flats for the major keys of Fmusicsharp Gmusicflat and Dmusicsharp Emusicflat for minor keys Seven sharps or flats make major keys that are more easy to spell with five flats or sharps

The major scale is used more often than the minor scale in Western music because of its unique harmonic properties For example the major third is much stronger in the harmonic series than the minor third

A minor scale in music theory is any scale that has at least three scale degrees the tonic the minor third above the tonic and the perfect fifth above the tonic Together they make the minor triad This includes many scales and modes such as Dorian mode and the Phrygian mode

Usually when people talk about minor scales they mean natural minor harmonic minor or melodic minor scales which are the most common in Western music 

The natural minor scale is the same as the 6th mode of the major scale For example the white notes of a keyboard from one C to the next C up makes a C major scale If the white notes are played starting from the sixth step of that C scale then an A natural minor scale is produced

The harmonic minor scale is the same as the natural minor but with the seventh note raised up a semitone

For example in the key of A minor the harmonic minor scale is

Budding is a way of asexual reproduction With budding a new organism grows on another one It stays attached while it grows Only when it is fully grown does it detach from the parent organism Since the reproduction is asexual the newly created organism is a clone and is genetically identical to the parent organism

Budding is very common in plants and fungi Sometimes it can also be found with animals for example with hydras or sponges

 Binary fission meaning division in half refers to a method of asexual reproduction It is common in prokaryotes A living cell divides into two cells The two cells should be identical but since mutation can occur there might be slight differences This process is basically when a prokaryotic organism divides into two parts The parent cell divides to give rise to two daughter cells the daughter cells then each develop into individual parent cells and give rise to two more daughter cells each and so on and so forth However in some organisms fission occurs through a specific axis Also it is similar to MitosisBinary fission is most common in algae fungi and bacteria It generally occurs when the environmental conditions are most favourable that is there is plenty of food water and suitable temperatures Example Amoeba

Cnidaria is a phylum with about 11000 species of animals All of them are simple and aquatic and most of them live in the sea Some are colonial composed of zooids which may be clones Cnidarian zooids may take the form of polyps or medusae at different phases of their life

Cnidaria take their name from special cells which have organelles that sting the nematocysts This device is largely responsible for their success it is their main specialised and distinctive cell form

There are five classes in the group Jellyfish occur in four of the classes 

The last four classes are sometimes joined as the sub phylum Medusozoa

The Cnidaria often have complex life cycles with both sexual and asexual reproduction If this is the case a generation that reproduces asexually will follow a generation that reproduces sexually which is known as alternation of generations

Some Cnidarians such as Polypodium hydriforme and the group Myxozoa are parasites Some live in symbiosis with algae that do photosynthesis Most of these algae are Dinoflagellates but sometimes they are Green algae The algae take the carbon dioxide and produce oxygen and carbohydrates which the Cnidarian uses as source of food

There is a long fossil record for the corals and soft bodied forms appear in some exceptional strata Some are believed to be among the Ediacaran biota

Calvinism belongs to the Reformed tradition of Protestantism This tradition goes back to John Calvin and other theologians 

Important Calvinists from Europe include Martin Bucer Heinrich Bullinger Peter Martyr Vermigli and Huldrych Zwingli and from England reformers Thomas Cranmer and John Jewel Because John Calvin had great influence and played an important role in the confessional and ecclesiastical debates throughout the 17th century the tradition generally became known as Calvinism 

Today this term also means the doctrines and practices of the Reformed churches of which Calvin was an early leader and the system is perhaps best known for its doctrines of predestination and total depravity

John Calvins international influence on the development of the doctrines of the Protestant Reformation began at the age of 25 when he started work on his first edition of the Institutes of the Christian Religion in 1534 Together with his contributions to confessional documents for use in churches it founded the direct personal influence on Protestantism of Calvin He is only one of many to influence the doctrines of the Reformed churches but he eventually became the most prominent

The rising importance of the Reformed churches and of Calvin belongs to the second phase of the Protestant Reformation when evangelical churches began to form after Luther was excommunicated from the Catholic Church Calvin was a French exile in Geneva He had signed the Lutheran Augsburg Confession in 1540 but his importance came from the Swiss Reformation This was not Lutheran but followed Huldrych Zwingli and then Calvin 

Although much of Calvins practice was in Geneva his publications spread his ideas of a correctly reformed church to many parts of Europe Calvinism became the theological system of the majority in Scotland the Netherlands and parts of Germany and was influential in France Hungary Transylvania and Poland Calvinism was popular as well for some time in Scandinavia especially Sweden but was rejected in favor of Lutheranism after the synod of Uppsala in 1593

Most settlers in the American Mid Atlantic and New England were Calvinists including the Puritans and Dutch settlers of New Amsterdam Dutch Calvinist settlers were also the first successful European colonizers of South Africa beginning in the 17th century who became known as Boers or Afrikaners

Some of the largest Calvinist communions were started by 19th and 20th century missionaries especially large are those in Korea and Nigeria

Jean Cauvin also Jean Calvin was a French Protestant theologian during the Protestant Reformation and was a central developer of the system of Christian theology called Calvinism or Reformed theology In Geneva he rejected Papal authority established a new scheme of broken wikt linkciviccivic and ecclesiastical governance He is famous for his teachings and writings and infamous for his role in the execution of Michael Servetus 

Calvin was born with the name Jean Chauvin in Noyon Picardie France to Grard Cauvin and Jeanne Lefranc In 1523 Calvins father a lawyer sent his fourteen year old son to the University of Paris to study humanities and law By 1532 he had attained a Doctor of Law degree at Orlans In 1536 he settled in Geneva Switzerland After being expelled from the city he served as a pastor in Strasbourg from 1538 until 1541 before returning to Geneva where he lived until his death in 1564

Calvin was trained to be a lawyer He studied under some of the best legal minds of the Renaissance in France Part of that training involved the newer humanistic methods of exegesis which dealt with a text directly via historical and grammatical analysis as opposed to indirectly via layers of commentators His legal and exegetical training was important for Calvin because once convinced of the evangelical faith he applied these exegetical methods to the Scripture He self consciously molded his thinking along biblical lines and he labored to preach and teach what he believed the Bible taught

While Reformers such as Jan Hus and Martin Luther may be seen as somewhat original thinkers that began a movement Calvin was a great logician and systematizer of that movement but not an innovator in doctrine Calvin was very familiar with the writings of the early Church Fathers and the great Medieval schoolmen and he was also in debt to earlier Reformers Calvin did not reject the Scholastics of the Middle Ages outright but rather made use of them and reformed their thoughts in accordance with his understanding of the Bible

Calvin is often associated with the doctrines of predestination and election but he differed very little with the other magisterial Reformers regarding these difficult doctrines

Calvins power was very great in his last years He was known all around the world as a broken wikt linkreformreformer different from Martin Luther Mainly Luther and Calvin respected each other However Luther and a Zrich reformer Huldrych Zwingli thought differently about the eucharist Calvins thoughts about it made Luther believe that Calvin agreed with Zwingli At the same time Calvin was sad that the reformers were not all together He tried to join them together by signing the Consensus Tigurinus This was an agreement between the Zrich and Geneva churches

Calvins greatest help to the English speaking people was by giving Marian exiles in Geneva protection He did this starting in 1555 With the citys protection they could make their own reformed church under John Knox and William Whittingham They later carried many of Calvins ideas back to England and Scotland However Calvin was most interested in trying to change his homeland France He helped the building of churches by giving out literature and offering ministers Between 1555 and 1562 over one hundred ministers were sent to France

Inside Geneva Calvins mainly wanted to make a collge He wanted a place to educate children A place to build the school was picked on 25 March 1558 It was opened the next year on 5 June 1559 Even though the school was one it was divided into two parts One part was a grammar school The grammar school was called the collge or schola privata The other part was an advanced school called the acadmie or schola publica In five years there were 1200 students in the grammar school and 300 in the advanced school The collge later became the Collge Calvin one of the college preparatory schools of Geneva The acadmie became the University of Geneva

In autumn 1558 Calvin became ill with a fever He was afraid he might die before finishing his last revision of the Institutes Because of this he forced himself to work The last edition became much longer so Calvin called it a new work It was 21 chapters in the edition before the last one However in the last one it was 80 This was because of more detail in the material that was already there more subjects were not really added Soon after he became better he strained his voice while preaching This made him cough violently He burst a blood vessel in his lungs His health became much worse after this He preached his last sermon in St Pierre on 6 February 1564 On 25 April he made his will In his will he left a little money to his family and to the collge A few days later the ministers of the church came to visit him He said his last goodbyeBefore dying of testicular cancer This goodbye is recorded in Discours dadieu aux ministres He remembered his life in Geneva Calvin died on 27 May 1564 He was 54 On the next day he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Cimetire de Plainpalais People are not sure where the grave is exactly However a stone was added in the 19th century to mark a grave traditionally thought to be Calvins

A Trebuchet was a device used in wars and sieges in the Middle Ages It could be used to throw stones at ramparts trying to break them down It could also be used to throw things over the walls of a city These could be corpses of animals or people that had died of the plague Trebuchets were more accurate than other medieval catapults

The trebuchet works in a simple way The basket of the trebuchet is filled with heavy rocks This acts as a counterweight for the other end which is usually filled with one large rock Several men arm the trebuchet by raising the counterweight up and the firing arm down At this point the arm is released the heavy basket swings down and the arm swings up launching the rock far and fast

Carcassonne is a fortified French town in the Aude dpartement in the Languedoc It is separated into the fortified Cit de Carcassonne and the more expansive lower city the ville basse

This bastide which was thoroughly restored from 1853 by the theorist and architect Eugne Viollet le Duc was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1997 In 1999 the city had a population of 43950 people 

The town is 90 km southeast of Toulouse in the gap between the Pyrenees and the Massif Central of France Carcassonne is at the crossing of two major traffic routes the route leading from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean and that from the Massif Central to Spain skirting the Pyrenees Both routes exist since ancient history

Romans fortified the hilltop of Carcassonne around 100 BC and eventually made it the colonia of Julia Carsaco later Carcasum The main part of the lower courses of the northern ramparts dates from Gallo Roman times

In 462 the Romans officially left and the Visigothic king Theodoric II built more fortifications at Carcassonne some of them still stand In 760 Pippin was unable to take Carcassonne although he was able to most of the south of France

In 1067 Carcassonne became the property of Raimond Bernard Trencavel viscount of Albi and Nmes Carcassonne became famous in its role in the Albigensian Crusades when the city was a stronghold of occitan cathars In August 1209 the crusading army of Simon de Montfort forced its citizens to surrender He added to the fortifications Carcassonne became a border citadel between France and Aragon

The fortifications consist of a double ring of ramparts and 53 towers 1849 the architect Eugne Viollet le Duc took over restoration works At his death in 1879 his pupil Paul Boeswillwald and later the architect Nodet continued the rehabilitation of Carcassonne The restoration was strongly criticized during Viollet le Ducs lifetime because he made the error of using slates and restoring the roofs as pointed cones where local practice was traditionally of tile roofing and low slopes as in this region snow was very seldom But today Viollet le Ducs work at Carcassonne is thought to be a work of genius even if it is not exactly the same as it was

The Colosseum Coliseum originally Flavian Amphitheatre is a large amphitheatre in the city of Rome The construction of the Colosseum started around 7072 AD and was finished in 80 AD Emperor Vespasian started the works and Emperor Titus completed them Emperor Domitian made some changes to the building between 8196AD It had seating for 70000 people It was convert846ftm0lkonabbron wide It is the biggest amphitheatre built by the Roman Empire

The Colosseum was first called the Flavian Amphitheatre or in Latin the Amphitheatrum Flavium This was after Vespasian and Titus who had the family name of Flavius It was used for gladiatorial contests and other shows like animal hunts in which animals would hunt and eat prisoners or in which gladiators would fight against animals There were also executions of prisoners plays and battle scenes sometimes it was filled with water to fight sea battles The people of Rome could go into the Colosseum without any costs it was free

In the Middle Ages it was no longer used for performances It was then used as housing workshops a Christian shrine and as a supply of building stones

It has been worked out that about 500000 people and over a million wild animals died in the Colosseum games 

It is now a ruin because of earthquakes and from people taking away the stones The Colosseum is an iconic symbol of the Roman Empire It is one of Romes most popular tourist attractions On Good Fridays the Pope leads a torch lit Way of the Cross procession around the various levels of the amphitheatre

The Colosseum is shown on the five cent euro coins used in Italy

The building of the Colosseum began under the rule of the Emperor Vespasian in around 7072AD The area was flat in a valley between the Caelian Esquiline and Palatine Hills There was a stream flowing through the valley but this had been made into a canal People had been living in this area for over 200 years but the houses were destroyed in the Great Fire of Rome in 64AD The Emperor Nero took much of the land for his own use He built a grand palace the Domus Aurea which had a lake gardens paths covered with a roof held up by columns and large shelters to sit in He had the Aqua Claudia aqueduct made longer to supply water to the area There was also a big bronze statue of Nero the Colossus of Nero at the front of the Domus Aurea In 68AD Nero lost control of the government The Senate made him a public outlaw and he killed himself soon after

To celebrate the end of Neros rule the Emperor Vesapasian built the Colosseum on the site of Neros lake This was seen as giving back the land to the people of Rome The Romans often built monuments to celebrate important events and the Colosseum is a part of that tradition 

Most of the Domus Aurea was torn down The lake was filled in and the land used for the Colosseum Schools for gladiators and other buildings were put up in the old gardens of the Domus Aurea The Colossus was left in place but Neros head was replaced Vespasian renamed it after the sun god Helios Many historians say that the name of the Colosseum comes from the statue the Colossus Usually in Roman cities the amphitheatres were built on the edge of the city The Colosseum was built in the city centre in effect placing it in the real and symbolic heart of Rome

The Colosseum had been completed up to the third story by the time of Vespasians death in 79 The top level was finished and the building opened by his son Titus in 80 Dio Cassius said that over 9000 wild animals were killed during the opening games The building was changed by Vespasians younger son Emperor Domitian He added the hypogeum underground tunnels used to hold the animals and slaves used in the games He also added a fourth level at the top of the Colosseum to add more seats

In 217 the Colosseum was badly damaged by fire Dio Cassius said the fire was started by lightning The fire destroyed the wooden upper levels inside the amphitheatre It was not fully repaired until about 240 and underwent further repairs in 250 or 252 and again in 320 Theodosius II and Valentinian III repaired damage caused by an earthquake in 443 more work followed in 484 and 508 The last record of gladiator fights is about 435 while animal hunts continued until at least 523

The Colosseum went through big changes of use during the medieval period At the end of the 500s a small church had been built into a part of the building The arena was used as a cemetery The areas under the seating was used for houses and workshops There are records of the space being rented as late as the 1100s About 1200 the Frangipani family took over the Colosseum and made it into a castle 

During the great earthquake in 1349 the outer south side fell down Most of the fallen stones were used to build palaces churches hospitals and other buildings in Rome In the middle of the 1300s a religious group moved into the north part and were still there in the 1800s The inside of the Colosseum was used to supply building stones The marble facade was burned to make quicklime The bronze clamps which held the stonework together were ripped off the walls leaving marks that can still be seen today

During the 16th and 17th century Church officials looked for a use for the big and ruined building Pope Sixtus V wanted to turn the building into a wool factory to provide jobs for Romes prostitutes but he died and the idea given up In 1671 Cardinal Altieri said it could be used for bullfights Many people were upset by this idea it was quickly dropped 

In 1749 Pope Benedict XIV said that the Colosseum was a sacred place where early Christians had been martyred He stopped people from taking any more building stones away He set up the Stations of the Cross inside the building He said the place was made sacred with the blood of the Christian martyrs who had died there However there is no historical evidence that any Christians had been killed in the Colosseum 

Later popes started projects to save the building from falling down They took out the many plants which had overgrown the building and were causing more damage The faade was made stronger with triangular brick wedges in 1807 and 1827 The inside was repaired in 1831 1846 and in the 1930s The underground area was partly dug out in 18101814 and 1874 This digging was finished by Benito Mussolini in the 1930s

The Colosseum is a free standing building quite different to the earlier Greek theatres which were built into the sides of hills It is really two Roman theatres joined together It is oval shaped 189 meters long and 156 meters wide It covers an area of convert6acreha0lkonabbron The outer wall is 48 meters high The distance around the building was 545 meters The arena is an oval convert287ftm0lkonabbron long and convert180ftm0lkonabbron wide surrounded by a wall convert15ftm0lkonabbron high Around the arena were raised rows of seating 

The outer wall was made from about 100000 cubic meters of travertine stone This was held together by 300 tons of iron clamps There was no mortar used to hold the wall together The outside wall has been badly damaged over the years Large sections have fallen down after earthquakes The north side of the outside wall is still standing It has triangular brick wedges at each end added in the early 1800s to hold up the wall The rest of the outside wall that can be seen today is in fact the original inside wall

An amphitheatre is a type of structure It can be either man made or natural It is a flat area surrounded by an area that ascends gradually In the ascending area people can be seated Today such structures are used for presentations but also spectator sports In Ancient Rome these structures were used to entertain the population Gladiator combats animal hunts and executions were staged there

Davies still wanted to study with other composers so he went to the United States to study with Roger Sessions Milton Babbitt and Earl Kim Then he moved to Australia where he was Composer in Residence at the University of Adelaide from 1965 to 1966 

He then returned to the United Kingdom and moved to the Orkney Islands Davies who is openly gay still lives there on the island of Sanday with his partner Colin Parkinson In 1977 he started a big arts festival on Orkney called the St Magnus Festival This still takes place every year He often uses it to give first performances of new works

Davies has written a lot of music Some of his first works use serial techniques sometimes combined with ideas from Mediaeval and Renaissance music including bits of plainsong

Pieces from the late 1960s combine these ideas with expressionism and a violent character for example Eight Songs for a Mad King which is about King George III Written for a singer and a small group of instruments the singer has to shout and screech at times and also act He wrote an opera Taverner about the Renaissance composer John Taverner The orchestral piece St Thomas Wake uses many different styles of music including foxtrots a pavan by John Bull and Daviess own modern style Many works from this period were performed by the Pierrot Players which Davies founded with Harrison Birtwistle in 1967

Henry IV was King of Germany from 1056 and Holy Roman Emperor from 1084 till he was forced to step down in 1105 He was the third emperor of the Salian dynasty and one of the most interesting and important figures of the eleventh century His reign was marked by the Investiture Controversy with the Papacy and several civil wars with pretenders to his throne in Italy and Germany 

Henry was the eldest son of the Emperor Henry III by his second wife Agnes de Poitou and was probably born at the royal palace at Goslar When Henry III unexpectedly died in 1056 the six year old Henry IV became king without problems The Empress Agnes acted as regent and the German pope Victor II was named as her counsellor

Unlike Henry III Agnes could not influence the election of the new popes Stephen IX and Nicholas II These popes worked together with the Normans of southern Italy But the first great problem started when Nicholas claimed influence in the election of Germany

Gregory VII a reformist monk was elected as pope in 1073 This is when the controversy between emperor and pope began

In the higher ranks of the German clergy Gregory had many enemies Therefore King Henry declared Gregory was no longer pope and the Romans should choose a new pope When Gregory heard of this he excommunicated Henry IV declared he was no longer emperor and canceled the oaths the people had sworn to King Henry 

The excommunication of the king made a deep impression both in Germany and Italy Thirty years before Henry III had broken wikt linkdeposedeposed three popes but when Henry IV tried to copy this procedure he did not have the support of the people The Saxons began a second rebellion and the anti royalist party grew in strength

The situation now became extremely critical for Henry It became clear that at any price he had to get his absolution from Gregory At first he tried this by an embassy but when Gregory rejected this he went to Italy in person 

The pope had already left Rome Henry tried to force the pope to grant him absolution by doing penance before him at Canossa where Gregory stayed For a Christian it seemed impossible to deny a penitent re entrance into the church and therefore Gregory removed the ban But a new conflict followed because Henry IV thought the end of excommunication meant he was king again But Gregory did not decide that

The rebellious German nobles used the excommunication of Henry to set up a rival king Duke Rudolph of Swabia At first Gregory seemed to be neutral because the two parties were of fairly equal strength But finally he decided to support Rudolph of Swabia after his victory at Flarchheim and declared the excommunication and deposition of King Henry again 

This was widely felt to be an injustice When Rudolph of Swabia died on October 16 of the same year Henry began to fight to be king In 1081 he opened the conflict against Gregory in Italy Gregory had now become less powerful and thirteen Cardinals stopped supporting him Rome surrendered to the German king and Guibert of Ravenna was enthroned as Clement III Henry was crowned emperor by his rival while Gregory himself had to flee from Rome in the company of his Norman vassal Robert Guiscard

Henrys wife Bertha died on December 27 1087 She was also buried at the Speyer Cathedral Their children were

Tristan und Isolde is an opera in three acts by Richard Wagner As always Wagner wrote the words for the opera himself  He took the famous old legend which had been told by the German poet Gottfried von Strassburg 

Wagner composed the opera between 1857 and 1859 It was first performed with Hans von Blow conducting in Munich on 10 June 1865 Many musicians think it is the greatest opera of the 19th century Wagners dramatic handling of the story had enormous influence on many composers of the time His harmonies were also an extremely important development in the language of Romantic music Not everybody liked it In particular the music critic Eduard Hanslick said that he could not understand it

The story of Tristan and Isolde was one of the great romances of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance Several poets told the story and each told it slightly differently The themes of chivalry and courtly love are always there 

Act I Isolde an Irish princess and her maid Brangaene are on Tristans ship being taken to King Markes lands in Cornwall where Isolde is to be married to the King The opera opens with a young sailor singing about a wild Irish maid Isolde thinks he is singing about her She is furious and wishes the sea would rise up and sink the ship killing all on board She is particularly furious with Tristan the knight who is taking her to the king She asks her maid to get Tristan but he will not come because his is steering the ship His henchman Kurwenal speaks crossly to Brangaene reminding her that Isoldes previous fianc Morold had been killed by Tristan and his head sent back to Ireland

Brangaene returns to Isolde to tell her about what was said Isolde sadly tells her how after Morold had died a man called Tantris had been brought to her because he was seriously injured and that she had made him better using her powers of healing However she then found out that his real name was Tristan He was Irelands worst enemy and he was the man who had killed Morold Isolde had tried to kill him with a sword but when Tristan had looked into her eyes her heart had become full of love and she had dropped the sword Tristan had been allowed to go back to Cornwall However it seemed now he had told his uncle King Marke all about the beautiful Isolde and had come to get her so that his uncle could marry her Brangaene tries to make Isolde see that Tristan is doing an honourable thing to make her Queen of Ireland but Isolde will not listen She is furious and wants him to drink a potion which had been intended by her mother for King Marke and Isolde as a love potion but for Tristan it would be death 

Kurwenal now appears and says that Tristan has agreed after all to see Isolde When he arrives Isolde tells him that she now knows that he was Tantris and that he owes her his life Tristan agrees to drink the potion now prepared by Brangaene even though he knows it may kill him As he drinks Isolde snatches the rest of the potion from him and drinks it herself They both believe they are about to die and they declare their love for one other Kurwenal comes and says that King Marke is arriving Isolde asks Brangaene which potion she prepared and is told that it was not the death poison but a love potion Outside the sailors welcome the arrival of King Marke

A group are hunting and night King Markes castle is empty except for Isolde and Brangaene who stand by a lighted torch Isolde keeps thinking that the hunting horns are far enough away for her to put out the flames giving the sign for Tristan to join her Brangaene warns Isolde that one of King Markes knights Melot has seen Tristan and Isolde looking at one another lovingly Isolde however thinks that Melot is Tristans best friend and desperate to see Tristan she puts out the flames Brangaene goes to the castle walls to keep a look out as Tristan arrives

Tristan and Isolde can now tell one another they are madly in love They do not notice the night is ending and Melot leads Marke to find the two lovers in one anothers arms Marke is desperately sad because Tristan has been betrayed and also because he himself had come to love Isolde 

Tristan now asks Isolde if she will follow him again into the night and she agrees Melot and Tristan fight but then Tristan throws his sword to the side and is seriously wounded by Melot

Act III Kurwenal has brought Tristan home to his castle at Kareol in Brittany A shepherd plays a sad tune on his pipes and asks if Tristan is awake Kurwenal says that only Isoldes arrival can save Tristan The shepherd says he will keep watch and pipe a happy tune to mark the arrival of any ship Tristan now wakes up and is sad that it is daylight His sadness turns to joy when Kurwenal tells him that Isolde is coming He asks if her ship is in sight but only the shepherds sorrowful tune is heard 

Tristan sinks back again He remembers that the shepherds tune is the one he had heard when his father and then his mother died He collapses The shepherd now pipes the arrival of Isoldes ship and as Kurwenal rushes to meet her Tristan in his excitement tears the bandages from his wounds As Isolde arrives at his side Tristan dies while speaking her name 

Isolde collapses beside him as the appearance of another ship is announced Kurwenal sees Melot Marke and Brangaene arrive and furiously attacks Melot because he had killed Tristan In the fight both Melot and Kurwenal are killed Marke and Brangaene finally reach Tristan and Isolde Marke is terribly sad He explains that he has heard about the love potion from Brangaene and he had come because he had decided that Tristan and Isolde should be united Isolde seems to wake but in a last aria describing her vision of Tristan risen again dies of grief

The very first chord in the piece is very famous It has become known as the Tristan chord Although it had been used before the way Wagner used it here was quite new It makes the harmony very hazy and the listener does not know for many bars what key the music is in It creates a lot of tension There are many other moments like this in the opera The tension goes right through the opera The story tells of a tension that can only come to rest through death

The Prelude and Liebestod is a concert version of the overture and Isoldes Act 3 aria arranged by Wagner which was first performed in 1862 before the first performance of the opera itself in 1865 The Liebestod can be performed either in a purely orchestral version or with a soprano singing Isoldes vision of Tristan brought back to life

The Master of the Queens Music has the job of composing music for special royal occasions such as anniversaries marriages and deaths and for special ceremonies

The title was created in 1626 by Charles I It was spelt Master of the Kings Musick and was always spelt that way until the time of Sir Edward Elgar who was Master from 1924 to 1934

The Investiture Controversy also known as the lay investiture controversy was the most important conflict between secular and religious powers in medieval Europe It began as a dispute in the 11th century between the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII The question was who would control appointments of bishops 

The controversy lead to nearly fifty years of civil war in Germany This war ended with the triumph of the great dukes and abbots and the falling apart of the German empire in the end 

When Gregory VII a reformist monk was elected as pope in 1073 the controversy between emperor and pope began

In the higher ranks of the German clergy Gregory had many enemies Therefore King Henry declared Gregory was no longer pope and the Romans should choose a new pope When Gregory heard of this he excommunicated Henry IV declared he was no longer emperor and absolved his subjects from the oaths they had sworn to him 

The excommunication of the king made a deep impression both in Germany and Italy Thirty years before Henry III had broken wikt linkdeposedeposed three popes but when Henry IV tried to copy this procedure he had not the support of the people The Saxons began a second rebellion and the anti royalist party grew in strength from month to month

The word palm can mean

Cycas is a genus of plants It is the only genus currently known in the cycad family About 95 species are currently known 

Probably the best known of these is marketed as Sago Palm or King Sago Palm The plant is not a true palm however The generic name comes from Greek kykas and means palm tree

The genus is native to the Old World with most species around the equatorial regions It is native to eastern and southeastern Asia including the Philippines with 6 species eastern Africa northern Australia Polynesia and Micronesia Australia has 26 species while the Indo Chinese area has about 30 The northernmost species is found at 31N in southern Japan The southernmost is found at 26S in southeast Queensland Australia

The plants have often been considered to be a living fossil The earliest fossils of the genus Cycas appear in the Cenozoic but Cycas like fossils occur well into the Mesozoic Cycas is not closely related to other genera of cycads Phylogenetic studies have shown that Cycadaceae is the sister group to all other extant cycads

Heliconia is a genus of flowering plants They are native tropical South America as well as the Pacific Ocean Islands west to Indonesia There are between 100 and 200 species in the genus Other common names include lobster claw wild plantain and false bird of paradise 

The plants have very decorative flowers For this reason they are often sold decorative plants

Ive been doing some work on categorizing older years and I had a thought Many of the individual years dont have pages I was wondering what the community thinks about redirecting individual year pages to the decade in which they occur If someone eventually wants to do the page for that specific year they could In the meantime it might encourage people to help add info to the decades pages Someone whos discouraged from creating the 44 BC page to say Julius Caesar died in this year may decide to add that comment to the 40s BC page simply because 44 BC is a blue link instead of a red one Tygartl1 2218 28 February 2007

Well perhaps we could do individual years up to a certain point going back in history What I had sort of envisioned was as you continue travelling backwards along the timeline going from having pages for individual years to summarizing by decade to perhaps eventually summarizing by century Obviously the further back in time you go the more gaps there are going to be in between events It just doesnt make sense to me to have a page for a year where history only recognizes a handful of events It makes more sense to me to have a summary on a decade page The only thing I dont know exactly is to where to make the cutoff Starting in 1st century BC seems like a logical place to begin the decade summary 

As far as a template we have something but Im not sure if theres a simpler template that exists Whats there is kind of confusing and seems like it might take a lot of work to change for each page Tygartl1 1503 1 March 2007

Im sorry for the somewhat silly question I want to know how to write my future changes Is this the Wikipedia or the Simple I had thought that the ideas we write about should be explained with simple words and sentences that are not complex Many articles seem to have simple content as well Should we simplify topics Or should we explain the complex nature of topics with simple wording  Selket 1714 2 March 2007

TemplateSuccession box now works different from the enWP one alone That means no start box end box is needed The problem with this setup is that stacking succession boxes over each other does not work Another problem is that succession boxes which got copied over from enWP also dont work nicely  they get a little additional box on top Therefore I want to change the template back to its original version and adapt all needy pages accordingly Because this is a rather substantial change to a widely used template I wanted to ask for objections first So  does anyone object  rimshottalk 1031 6 March 2007

Full communion is a term used in Christian ecclesiology to describe relations between two distinct Christian communities or Churches that recognise that each other shares the same communion and the same essential doctrines That does not mean that there would be no differences at all between them 

The meaning of full communion is different in on the one hand Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christian theology and on the other hand in the theology of other Western Christians 

A queue is a line of people standing behind one another who are waiting for something The person at the front of the queue will have his turn next then the next person and so on When someone comes to join the queue they have to go to the back of the queue and wait until it is their turn Sometimes people try to jump the queue or push in They are usually told off and have to go to the back of the queue

The word queue comes from the French word for tail but when talking about a queue of people in English it is pronounced kyoo The word queue can be a noun or a verb

A queue may also be a queue of vehicles waiting to get passed something or to go in somewhere

People may queue to be served in a shop or queue for a bus or taxi or to go into something like a museum Queueing is much better than pushing ones way in

Sometimes in places where a lot of people are queueing there may be a system of numbered tickets When someone arrives they take a number and wait until their number is shown on a display board This system is often used in banks doctors surgeries passport offices etc

People waiting in a queue are not always standing around There may be people who for example are waiting to have an operation but they have to wait in a queue until one day they receive a letter from the hospital telling them when to come in for their operation

Russians often make jokes about queues because in the days of the Soviet Union there was not much in the shops When a shop had a delivery there would suddenly be a long queue of people People joined a queue even if they did not know what the queue was for If they bought something they did not want they could always sell it

Perhaps the most famous queue in Britain is the queue for promenade tickets at the BBC Proms People enjoy chatting to one another in the queue The people who are at the front of the queue can have the first choice of where to stand for the concert

In Christian theology ecclesiology is the study of doctrine about the Church itself as a community and about the churches own view of its mission and role

That neans that ecclesiology looks at the role of the church in salvation at its origin its relationship to the historical Christ its discipline its destiny and its leadership 

In addition to describing a broad discipline of theology ecclesiology may be used in the specific sense of a particular church or denominations character self described or otherwise This is the sense of the word in such phrases as Roman Catholic ecclesiology Lutheran ecclesiology and ecumenical ecclesiology 

Ecclesiology asks the questions

Ecclesia in Christian theology means both a particular body of faithful people and the whole body of the faithful Latin ecclesia from Greek ekklesia had an original meaning of assembly congregation council literally convocation

If one speaks of the whole body of Christian faithful then there are included not only the members of the Church who are alive on earth but all who were members of the church before Some churches therefore describe the Church as being composed of the Church Militant and the Church Triumphant In Catholic theology there is also the Church Suffering 

The Christian family the most basic unit of Church life is sometimes called the domestic Church

Finally The Church may sometimes be used especially in Catholic theology to speak of those who exercise the office of teaching and ruling the faithful the Ecclesia Docens or again the governed as distinguished from their pastors the Ecclesia Discens 

The term Communion comes from Latin communio The corresponding term in Greek is which is often translated as fellowship

In Christianity the basic meaning of the term communion is an especially close relationship of Christians as individuals or as a Church with God and with other Christians

But the term is also used of a group of Christian Churches that have this close relationship of communion with each other An example is the Anglican Communion 

If the relationship between the Churches is complete involving fulness of those bonds of communion  faith sacraments and pastoral governance  that permit the Faithful to receive the life of grace within the Churchit is called full communion But the term full communion is often used as well in that sense that these Christian Churches are not united but have only an arrangement where members of each Church have certain rights within the other

If a Church recognizes that another Church with which it lacks bonds of pastoral governance shares with it some of the beliefs and essential practices of Christianity it may speak of partial communion between it and the other Church

The communion of saints is the relationship that according to the belief of Christians exists between them as people made holy by their link with Christ This relationship is generally understood to mean not only those still in earthly life but also to those who have gone past death to be at home with the Lord 

In a special way the term communion is applied to sharing in the Eucharist

In the Bible the Greek term is only used in the New Testament It does not appear at all in the ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament known as the Septuagint As a noun or in its adjectival or verbal forms it is found in 43 verses of the New Testament In addition the noun is found in some manuscripts in Ephesians 39

The word is applied according to the context to communion sharing or fellowship with

A natural resource qualifies as a renewable resource if its stock can increase over time 

Natural resources which qualify as renewable resources are for example oxygen fresh water solar energy timber and biomass But they can become non renewable resources if more of them is used than nature can reproduce in the same time at that place For example ground water may be removed from an aquifer at a greater rate than that of new water flowing to that aquifer Removal of water from the pore spaces may cause permanent compaction that cannot be reversed Human consumption and use at sustainable levels primarily uses renewable resources versus non renewable resources

Renewable resources may also include goods commodities such as wood paper and leather

Gasoline coal natural gas diesel and other commodities that come from fossil fuels are non renewable Some commodities like plastics and diesel are mostly made from fossil fuel but ways have been developed for biodegradable plastic and biodiesel made from renewable resources such as corn soybeans and canola 

Solar power is the technology of obtaining usable energy from the light of the sun Solar energy has been used in many traditional technologies for centuries and has come into widespread use where other power supplies are absent such as in places far off from the national electrical grid and in space Solar energy is currently used in a number of applications

Wind power is the conversion of wind energy into more useful forms usually electricity using wind turbines As of April 2008 worldwide wind farm capacity was 100000 megawatts and wind power produced some 13 of global electricity consumption accounting for approximately 19 of electricity use in Denmark 9 in Spain and Portugal and 6 in Germany and the Republic of Ireland United States is an important growth area and latest American Wind Energy Association figures show that installed US wind power capacity has reached 16800 MW which is enough to serve 45 million average households

Most modern wind power is generated in the form of electricity by converting the rotation of turbine blades into electrical current by means of an electrical generator In windmills wind energy is used to turn mechanical machinery to do physical work like crushing grain or pumping water

Wind power is used in large scale wind farms for national electrical grids as well as in small individual turbines for providing electricity to rural residences or grid isolated locations Wind energy is ample renewable widely distributed clean and works against the greenhouse effect if used to replace the use of fossil fuel

Hydropower is the conversion of the energy of moving water into more useful forms Already in ancient history hydropower was used for irrigation and milling of grain and afterwards also for textile manufacture and the operation of sawmills

The energy of moving water has been exploited for centuries in Imperial Rome water powered mills produced flour from grain and in China and the rest of the Far East hydraulically operated pot wheel pumps raised water into irrigation canals In the 1830s at the peak of the canal building era hydropower was used to transport barge traffic up and down steep hills using inclined plane railroads

Direct mechanical power transmission made it necessary that industries that used hydropower had to be near the waterfall For example during the last half of the 19th century many grist mills were built at Saint Anthony Falls utilizing the 50 foot drop in the Mississippi River The mills contributed to the growth of Minneapolis Today the largest use of hydropower is for electric power generation which allows low cost energy to be used at long distances from the watercourse

Hot chocolate is a hot drink It is usually made by mixing chocolate or cocoa powder and sugar with warm milk or water Hot chocolate is usually drunk to make the drinker feel happier or warmer Some studies have shown that hot chocolate may be healthy because of antioxidants that are in cocoa Until the 1800s hot chocolate was also used by doctors as a medicine against some diseases

It is believed that the hot chocolate drink was first made by the Mayan people about 2000 years ago Another cocoa drink was made by the Aztecs by 1400 CE The drink became popular in Europe after being brought from Mexico into the New World and has changed a lot since then Today hot chocolate is used around the world It comes in many different types such as the very thick cioccolata densa in Italy and the thinner hot cocoa that is usually drunk in the United States 

Chocolate is made from cocoa the dried and partly fermented seeds of the cacao tree The cacao tree is a small pine tree found in the deep tropical areas of the Americas New studies show that the most found type of the plant first came from the Amazon basin It was slowly moved by humans to other places in South and Central America to farm Early kinds of another type have also been found in what is now Venezuela The scientific name theobroma means food of the gods The fruit called a cacao pod is shaped like an oval 1530 cm long and 810 cm wide It gets ripe from yellow to orange and weighs about 500 g when ripe

The first known use of cacao is chocolate found in jars at the site of Puerto Escondido in Honduras It was used there around 1100 BC An early Classic Period Mayan grave from Ro Azul Guatemala had cups with the Mayan words for cacao on them with traces of an old chocolate drink The Maya are usually given credit for making the first chocolate drink over 2000 years ago The drink would be changed even more in Europe

To make the drink the Maya ground cocoa seeds into a paste and mixed it with water cornmeal chile peppers and spices They then poured the drink back and forth from a cup to a pot until a foam was created The drink was served cold Maya of all social classes could get the drink but the rich drank chocolate from fancy vessels or cups

By the 1400s the Aztecs took over a large part of Mesoamerica and took cacao into their culture They thought of chocolate with Xochiquetzal the goddess of pregnancy They also used chocolate drinks as sacrifices to gods The Aztec kind of the drink was bitter and spicy and was called xocolatl It was made a lot like the Mayan chocolate drinks Vanilla chile pepper and achiote were added to the drink and it was believed to fight tiredness which is because of the theobromine content a mood enhancer Because cacao would not grow in central Mexico and had to be brought into the empire chocolate was an important luxury good in the Aztec empire Because of this cocoa beans were used as money

The first time Europeans saw chocolate was in the 16th century when Montezuma showed xocolatl to Hernn Corts a Spanish conquistador What the Spanish then called chocolatl was said to be a drink made of a chocolate base with vanilla and other spices that was served cold Montezumas rulers were said to drink about 2000 cups of xocolatl per day 50 of which were drank by Montezuma himself

Because sugar had not come to the Americas xocolatl was said to be something that one did not like in the beginning The drink tasted spicy and bitter unlike todays hot chocolate As to when xocolatl was first made warm sources are not sure about when and by whom However Jose de Acosta a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century described xocolatl as a drink with a bitter taste that the natives liked a lot

After defeating Montezumas warriors and taking the Aztecs riches Corts went back to Spain in 1528 He brought cocoa beans and chocolate drink making equipment At this time chocolate still was only the bitter drink made by the Mayans Sweet hot chocolate and bar chocolate were not made yet

After coming to Europe the drink slowly got popularity The court of King Charles V soon began drinking it and what was then only called chocolate became a popular drink with the Spanish upper class Also cocoa was given as a gift when the Spanish Royal Family married other royalty Then chocolate cost a lot in Europe because the cacao beans only grew in South America

The first shipment of chocolate to Europe for sale purposes was a shipment from Veracruz to Sevilla in 1585 It was still a drink but the Europeans added sugar to sweeten it and took out the chili pepper They also added vanilla cinnamon and other spices Sweet hot chocolate was then made making hot chocolate a luxury item with the European royalty in the 17th century Even when the first Chocolate house opened in 1657 the drink still cost a lot A pound cost 50 to 75 pence

In the late 1600s Hans Sloane president of the Royal College of Physicians went toJamaica There he tried chocolate and did not like it but found it was better with milk When he came back to England he brought the recipe with him bringing milk chocolate to Europe

In 1828 Coenraad Johannes van Houten made the first cocoa powder making machine in the Netherlands The press took apart the greasy cocoa butter from cacao seeds leaving a chocolate powder behind This powder like the cocoa powder used now was easier to stir into milk and water and led to solid chocolate By using cocoa powder and a little bit of cocoa butter bar chocolate was then able to be made The term chocolate then came to mean solid chocolate instead of hot chocolate

Today hot chocolate is used around the world However there are two main types of the drink The main difference between the two is that one is thicker than the other

The words hot chocolate and hot cocoa are sometimes used instead of each other but there is actually a difference between the two Hot cocoa is made from a mix of cocoa sugar and ingredients all powdered to make the drink thick without cocoa butter Hot chocolate is made right from bars of chocolate which has cocoa sugar and cocoa butter in it The biggest difference between the two is the cocoa butter which makes hot cocoa have less fat than hot chocolate so it is better for ones health 

Hot chocolate can be made with dark semisweet or bittersweet chocolate It is cut into small pieces and stirred into milk with sugar American hot cocoa powder can be made with powdered milk so it can be made without milk In the United Kingdom hot chocolate is a sweet chocolate drink made with hot milk or water and powder with chocolate sugar and powdered milk Cocoa usually means a similar drink made with just hot milk and cocoa powder then made sweeter with sugar

In the United States the drink is most popular in powdered or crushed form It is made with hot water or milk This is the thinner of the two main types It is very sweet and often is served with marshmallows whipped cream or a piece of solid chocolate European hot chocolate first came to the US as early as the 1600s by the Dutch but the first time colonists began selling hot chocolate was around 1755 Hot chocolate is usually drank in cold weather and winter in the United States It is not taken with meals very often

In Mexico hot chocolate is still popular Besides the instant powder form Mexican hot chocolate uses semi sweet chocolate cinnamon sugar and vanilla Hot chocolate of this type is often sold in tablets or bars which can be put into hot milk water or cream It is then mixed until the drink gets a creamy foam Mexican cinnamon hot chocolate is often served with a variety of Mexican breads or pastries called pan dulce and churros

In Europe most kinds of hot chocolate are very thick This is because they are made from pure chocolate In the United Kingdom hot chocolate is usually thinner As Europe was where hot chocolate was first made popular there are many different types 

Among the thick types of hot chocolate served in Europe is the Italian cioccolata densa German types are also known for being very thick and heavy Hot chocolate and churros is the normal working mans breakfast in Spain This style of hot chocolate can be very thick often being like warm chocolate pudding 

There are even more types of thick hot chocolate in Europe Some cafes in Belgium and other areas in Europe serve a warme chocolade or chocolat chaud This is a cup of heated milk and a small bowl of bittersweet chocolate chips to put in the milk In England some kinds of powdered drinks are as thick as pure chocolate kinds

Even though hot chocolate is usually drunk for enjoyment it can also be good for the health Hot chocolate has a lot of antioxidants that may be good for the health From the 16th to 19th centuries hot chocolate was used as a medicine and a drink Explorer Francisco Hernndez wrote that chocolate drinks helped fever and diseases of the liver Another explorer Santiago de Valverde Turices thought that large amounts of hot chocolate were good for fixing chest problems and small amounts could help stomach problems When chocolate first came to France in the 17th century it was used to fight against fits of anger and bad moods This may be because of a chemical that makes a persons mood better in chocolate There are also a few bad health effects Hot chocolate has a lot of calories saturated fat and sugar Caffeine in the cocoa that is in hot chocolate may also make bad health effects

A diuretic is a chemical substance This substance is either in a herb or it has been separated and made into a drug Diuretics increase the amount of urine that is secreted from the body Diuretics are used as a treatment for heart failure liver cirrhosis hypertension and certain problems with the kidneys Diuretics are often abused by people suffering form bulimia nervosa as a way to lose weight

 Meningitis is an infection of certain membranes and tissues of the nervous system Those are called meninges Their function is to protect the central nervous system Most often this infection is caused by microorganisms like viruses bacteria fungi or parasites The most common cause of meningitis are viruses followed by bacteria Meningitis is a life threatening condition It affects all age groups

Some kinds of meningitis are very easy to spread For this reason in certain countries like Germany doctors have to tell the authorities that someone might have meningitis 

Some signs of meningitis can be high fever sometimes with chills very strong headache nauseas and vomiting drowsiness or confusion twitching sleepiness sore throat delirium seizures and stiff neck

The two main forms of meningitis are bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis In bacterial meningitis most patients die without treatment whereas in viral meningitis most patients get better on their own Herpes virus meningitis may respond to an antiviral drug

Mental confusion is a symptom People suffering from it have problems finding their way around in the world They have troubles remembering who they are where they are or what time it is Additionally they may have trouble remembering things or memorizing new things This may be linked to problems focusing their attention Confusion can also be a sign of someone being sick with various illnesses when its coupled with things like fever chills or exhaustion

The Nicene Creed Niceno Constantinopolitan Creed or IconSymbol of the Faith is the most widespread or ecumenical Christian statement of faith

Since its original formulation it continues to be used in the Roman Catholic Syrian Orthodox Eastern Orthodox Oriental Orthodox Assyrian Anglican Lutheran and most other Protestant Churches

The following table displays side by side the earlier and later forms of this Creed in the English translation given in Schaffs Creeds of Christendom which indicates by brackets the portions of the 325 text that were omitted or moved in 381 but uses no typographical mark to indicate what phrases absent in the 325 text were added in 381

The following table presents in the same way the texts of the two Councils as given in the original Greek language on the Web site Symbolum Nicaeno Constantinopolitanum  Greek

There were certain problems with the Nicene creed In 529 the so called filioque clause was added to the creed This clause is one of the main differences between the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church The Catholic Church has this clause the Eastern Orthodox Church does not The clause is about how godly the Father is compared to the Son Where the original Nicene Creed reads We believe in the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father the altered Roman Catholic version reads We believe in the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father and the Son Roman Catholic Christians accept this change but Eastern Orthodox Christians reject it Many Eastern Catholic churches do not use the clause in their creed The do think the doctrine it represents is true though as this is a dogma of the Roman Catholic faith Many Protestant churches who take a position in this matter usually accept the filioque

After the schism of 1054 the Eastern and Western churches attempted to reunite at two separate medieval councils and the filioque was an issue at each Despite Greek concessions neither the Second Council of Lyon nor the Council of Ferrera Florence achieved the desired union

The clause is most often referred to as the filioque or simply filioque

The Apostles Creed sometimes titled Symbol of the Apostles is an early statement of Christian belief a creed or symbol 

It is widely used by a number of Christian denominations for both liturgical and catechetical purposes most visibly by liturgical Churches of Western tradition including the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church Lutheranism the Anglican Communion and Western Orthodoxy It is also used by evangelical Protestant denominations such as Presbyterians Methodists Congregationalists and many Baptists 

This creed seems to have been made as an argument against Gnosticism Gnosticism was a heresy in the early days of the Church This can be seen in almost every phrase For example the creed states that Christ was born and suffered and died on the cross This seems to be a statement directly against the heretical teaching which states that Christ only appeared to become man and that he did not truly suffer and die but only appeared as if he did The Apostles Creed as well as other creeds was made to be like an example of the apostles teachings and to defend the Gospel of Christ 

The creed is named Apostles Creed because it is made of twelve articles People believed every apostle inspired the Holy Ghost after Pentecost wrote one article Because of its early origin it does not address some issues defined in the later Nicene and other Christian Creeds This makes it acceptable to many Arians and Unitarians

Many hypotheses exist concerning the date and nature of the origin of the Apostles Creed Many suppose it comes from the Old Roman Symbol of the 1st or 2nd century and was influenced later by the Nicene Creed

For more information on the origin of the Apostles Creed see the detailed discussion in the Catholic Encyclopedia

Credo in Deum Patrem omnipotentem Creatorem caeli et terrae Et in Iesum Christum Filium Eius unicum Dominum nostrum qui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto natus ex Maria Virgine passus sub Pontio Pilato crucifixus mortuus et sepultus descendit ad nferos tertia die resurrexit a mortuis ascendit ad caelos sedet ad dexteram Dei Patris omnipotentis inde venturus est iudicare vivos et mortuos Credo in Spiritum Sanctum sanctam Ecclesiam catholicam sanctorum communionem remissionem peccatorum carnis resurrectionem vitam aeternam Amen

The English version in the Catechism of the Catholic Church maintains the traditional division of the Creed into twelve articles presenting it as follows

In the Church of England there are currently two authorized forms of the creed that of the Book of Common Prayer and that of Common Worship

Book of Common Prayer

Common Worship

The United Methodists commonly incorporate the Apostles Creed into their worship services It is special because it does not have the line he descended into hell but is otherwise very similar to the Book of Common Prayer version The 1989 Hymnal has both the traditional version and the ecumenical version which includes he descended to the dead 

The United Methodist Hymnal also contains what it terms the Ecumenical Version of this creeda version which is identical to that found in the Episcopal Churchs current Book of Common Prayer This form of the Apostles Creed can be found incorporated into the Eucharistic and Baptismal Liturgies in the Hymnal and in The United Methodist Book of Worship and hence it is growing in popularity and use

The English Language Liturgical Consultation is an international ecumenical group whose primary purpose is to provide ecumenically accepted texts for those who use English in their liturgy In 1988 it produced a translation of the Apostles Creed distinguished among other things by its avoidance of the word his in relation to God The text is as follows

Matcha also spelt maccha is a fine powdered green tea It is used in Japanese tea ceremony and for dying and flavouring foods such as mochi and soba noodles green tea ice cream and different types of wagashi The most famous Matcha producing regions are Uji in Kyoto Nishio in Aichi both on the main island of Honsh Shizuoka and Kyushu 

Matcha costs more money than other kinds of tea Its price depends on its quality It can be hard to find outside Japan and also the special things that are used to make it and drink it

Powdered tea stored and traded as tea bricks seems to have been invented in China during the Song Dynasty Making and drinking powdered tea was formed into a ritual by the Chan Buddhists These Buddhists use to drink from the same bowl as a sacrament

Chan Buddhism and powdered tea were brought to Japan in 1191 by the monk Eisai Powdered tea was slowly forgotten in China but the 16th century tea master Sen no Rikyu made the rules of the Japanese tea ceremony He said that matcha was the correct tea to use

The preparation of matcha starts several weeks before harvest At that time the tea bushes are covered so that they do not get direct sunlight This makes it grow slower and turns the leaves a darker shade of green It also causes amino acids to be made and these make the tea taste sweeter

After harvesting if the leaves are rolled out before drying as usual the result will be gyokuro tea However if the leaves are laid out flat to dry they will crumble and become known as tencha Tencha can then be de veined de stemmed and ground with a stone until it becomes the fine bright green talc like powder known as matcha

Only ground tencha can be called matcha other powdered teas are known as konacha 

Nearly all the flavour of matcha comes from the amino acids The best matcha has more sweetness and a deeper flavour than the normal grades of tea harvested later in the year

The way that watcha is graded depends on several things

Leaves that are going to be made into tencha have to come from certain parts of the tree 

The very top of the tree has developing leaves that are soft and supple This gives a finer texture to higher grades More developed leaves are harder giving lower grades a sandy texture The better flavour is due to the tree sending all its nutrients to the growing leaves 

Chlorophylls relationship to tannin is also important Younger growth is greener and stronger in colour while more developed leaves farther down the plant have had their chlorophyll changed gradually into tannin which gives a more bitter flavour and duller brown green colour

Tencha leaves are traditionally dried outside in the shade and are always kept away from direct sunlight However these days drying has mostly moved indoors Quality matcha is very green because of this treatment

Stone grinding is quite difficult to do well Without the right tools and technique matcha can become burnt and is not such good quality

Matcha must be kept away from oxygen Oxidation smells like hay and affects colour and texture

Before it is served the matcha is often forced through a sieve in order to break up clumps There are special sieves available for this purpose These sieves are usually made of stainless steel and combine a fine wire mesh sieve and a temporary storage container A special wooden spatula is used to force the tea through the sieve or a small smooth stone may be put on top of the sieve and shaken gently 

If the sieved matcha is to be served at a Japanese tea ceremony then it will be put into a small tea caddy called a chaki Otherwise it can be poured directly from the sieve into a tea bowl

A small amount of matcha is placed into the bowl traditionally using a bamboo scoop called a chashaku and a small amount of hot water is added The mixture is then whisked until it is all the same consistency This is traditionally done with a special kind of whisk made of bamboo known as a chasen There must be no lumps left in the liquid Ideally no ground tea should remain on the sides of the bowl 

Usucha or thin tea is prepared with half a teaspoon of matcha and about 75 ml of hot water Some drinkers prefer to whip the mixture to produce a light frothy head while others prefer as little foam as possible Schools also vary on the amount of water and matcha Usucha makes a lighter and slightly more bitter tea

Koicha or thick tea needs much more matcha as many as six teaspoons to 34 cup of water Because the mixture is much thicker blending it needs a slower stirring movement which does not produce foam Koicha produces a sweeter tea and is almost always only served as part of Japanese tea ceremonies Special chasen made for this purpose are often used

Because matcha can be bitter it is traditionally served with a small Japanese sweet

Matcha is now a common ingredient in sweets It is used in castella manju and monaka as a topping for kakigori mixed with milk and sugar as a drink and mixed with salt and used to flavour tempura in a mixture known as matcha jio It is also used as flavouring in many Western style chocolates candy and desserts such as cakes and pastries cookies pudding mousse and ice cream Even the Japanese snack Pocky has a matcha flavoured version

The use of matcha in modern drinks has also spread to North American caf culture Here as in Japan it is put into latts iced drinks milkshakes and smoothies as well as alcoholic drinks

The drink green tea is a true tea It comes from the plant species Camellia sinensis Green tea is a tea that has undergone little oxidation while it was processed Green tea is popular in China Taiwan Hong Kong Japan Korea and the Middle East Recently it has been drunk more widely in the West where usually black tea is consumed

In the Kamakura era a Buddhist monk Eisai and his follower Dogen first brought tea to Japan He had learned about tea on a visit to China Eisai taught people to grow the tea plants and how to prepare the tea leaves People drank tea for its benefit as a medicine rather than as a refreshment Tea drinking gradually spread as part of Zen Buddhism The tea ceremony was part of the training for mental discipline Green tea kept the mind pure and relaxed an effect caused by the caffeine in the tea The custom of drinking tea gradually spread throughout Japan

In the Muromachi era tea tasting competitions were popular People also gambled on these competitions Zen Buddhist master Juko Murata stopped these competitions He broke with the grand tradition and developed a small ceremony performed around the tatami mat The tea ceremony was perfected afterward in the Azuchimomoyama era by Jou Takeno and Sen no Rikyu They removed all extra movements and unnecessary decoration and objects from the tea room The idea based on Zen was to concentrate your attention on the wealth inside your mind

In the Edo era the tea ceremony spread out to the public and it became an artistic accomplishment Therefore to draw out the beauty from inside the persons heart which was its original purpose came to be emphasized The words meaning harmony respect purity and broken wikt linktranquilitytranquility are the basis of the tea ceremony Wa harmony is shown by sharing the tea between the host and the guest Kei respect is shown by accepting and sharing with others Sei purity is treating yourself and others openly Jaku tranquility is the feeling of stillness in the ceremony Modern tea ceremonies which last for four hours are still based on these ideas

In the Meiji era the tea ceremony died out for while They were restarted when it was added in a kind of education for girls The ceremony also changed to being beautiful and gorgeous

Green Tea seems to lower heart disease expectancy 

The different substances contained in Green tea also seem to help against cancer low bone density cognitive function and kidney stones

Green tea contains ascorbic acid and different minerals such as chromium manganese selenium or zinc It is a better antioxidant than black tea Black tea contains certain substances which cannot be found in green tea such as theaflavin

Studies done on animals have shown that it can reduce cholesterol Trials done on humans have not confirmed this effect however In 2003 a randomized clinical trial found that a green tea extract with added theaflavin from black tea reduced cholesterol

In a study performed at Birmingham University it was shown that average fat oxidation rates were 17 higher after drinking of green tea extract than after a placebo was used 

In a recent study of the eating habits of 2018 women consumption of mushrooms and green tea was linked to a 90 lower occurrence of breast cancer

Tatami were originally a luxury item for the wealthy at a time when lower classes had mat covered dirt floors Tatami were gradually popularized They finally reached the homes of commoners towards the end of the 17th century

Japanese people have used tatami since the Nara Era They were knitted and became thicker like modern tatami People who lived in the Heian Era stepped onto tatami to show their power and they spread the tatami only in a necessary part of the room

The use of tatami was a little different from now The shoin style of traditional Japanese residential architecture began in the Kamakura Era During this time people stopped spreading tatami around the room and placing them in the middle They started to spread tatami through the room People decided to spread tatami by the hearth and sit erect with their legs folded under

Tatami has been changing together with peoples life style Tatami became common for people in the middle of the Edo Era Farmers started to use them in the Meiji Era The removal of tatami regulation made them more common in the Meiji Era Japanese people often dry the tatami If the tatamis surface was discolored people often turned them over With the economic growth after World War Two people started to use chairs and carpets Japanese people think flooring is not relaxing or soundproof enough so people still use tatami now

Tatami is made with a rush plant igusa Rush is planted in the rice fields in August The seedlings are dug out in November and a good seedling is chosen The chosen seedlings are planted in the rice fields again in December By the end of June to the middle of July the high quality rush grows up to about one meter tall and it will be harvested the next year

The rush should be dry after harvesting and keep the peculiar smell and the color of the rush The rush is selected according to length and the thickness and it is checked for bruising 

After the harvest ends tatami is made Because Japanese rooms are different sizes the tatamis are made in different sizes The base of the tatami is made first Tatami is woven with a special machine It similar to the weaving on a kimono The next part is the wick of tatami called toko When the toko is 40 centimeters or more thick and the shape is straightened The mat is complete and that is called mushiro The tatami is complete when it is joined to the toko and the decoration on the mat edges are sewn

Igusa is a perennial plant of the family of igusa Igusa smells good It has a fresh grassy smell In English they are called rushes Igusa blooms from May through June The plant grows up to a length of 100 centimeters or less They grow in marshes where sunshine is good In Japan there are 30 kinds of igusa growing in many different areas

Tatami is made from natural igusa that must be flexible from the root to the tip and the thickness and the color varies slightly About 4000 to 7000 igusa are used for the tatami Generally the best tatami uses more and longer igusa rushes

There are many benefits in using igusa such as air purification heat insulation elasticity cooling eco friendly and sound absorbing qualities Igusa tatami is also smooth to the touch so it is comfortable for babies and young children Most Japanese like tatami Many homes have at least one tatami room

Tatamiberi is the cloth that covers the edge and also decorates the tatami Some tatami dont have it In English it is called the mat edge The width of tatamiberi is about three centimeters The material on the tatamiberi is cotton yarn a synthetic material string and a gold thread The features change according to what strings are combining with tatamiberi The woven beautiful color handle sets off the room There are two types and the atmosphere of the room changes by the tatamiberi

There are many kinds of tatamiberi But tatamiberi was used to show status For example the emperor ministers priests and scholars had different styles It was recorded in Amanomokuzu in 1420

Japan has etiquette about tatamiberi Japanese are taught not to step on the tatamiberi It is easy to tear tatamiberi when stepping in the weakest part Stepping on tatamiberi fades the color on the edge of cotton and hemp in the tatami Therefore etiquette means not to hurt the mat carelessy stepping when you visit another house pay it attention Also family crests were embroidered on the tatamiberi in old times too Stepping on the family crest was taboo

Sake is a Japanese word for alcoholic drink In English sake means one kind of alcoholic drink made from rice In Japan people call this drink nihonshu or sake This article uses the word sake as it is used in English

Sake is a fermented drink Most sake is made from rice water kji and yeast Sometimes a small amount of lactic acid is used in brewing Water or small amounts of pure alcohol can be added at the end of production Sake can have from 12 to 22 alcohol but is usually around 15 or 16 Lower quality mass produced sake can have added sugar or flavorings

Sake is usually sold in bottles that are either 720ml or 18L Drinkers or servers in a restaurant may pour small cups called chokko directly from the bottle Sake is also served in smaller bottles called tokkuri A typical serving in a bar or restaurant is 180ml People may share that amount When drinking together people often pour drinks for each other rather than for themselves

Majority means the greater number of something The opposite is minority

If more than half the people are right handed we can say that the majority of people are right handed A minority of people are left handed In fact nearly everyone is right handed so we can say that the vast majority are right handed and only a small minority are left handed

If a political party gets a majority of votes it means that they get more than any of the other parties Example if there are three parties the winning party may have a majority of 40 while the other two each have 30 An absolute majority means more votes than all the other parties together ie more than half the total votes

Charles Koechlin was a French composer teacher and writer on music He wrote a very large amount of music but very little of it was published because he was more interested in helping younger composers than making himself well known Some of his best works include his symphonic poems and his film music

Koechlin was born in Paris the youngest child of a large and wealthy family His mothers family came from the Alsace near the French border with Germany and he was proud of his Alsation background His grandfather on his mothers side had started a cotton textile firm in Mulhouse and his father worked in the textile business When Koechlin was 14 his father died He showed an interest in music but his family wanted him to be an artillery officer However he had tuberculosis and had to spent six months getting better in Algeria After finishing his schooling he was allowed to enter the Paris Conservatoire in 1890 Two years later he was studying composition with Massenet and in 1896 he was a pupil of Gabriel Faur Ravel was a pupil in the same class Faur had a big influence on Koechlin who wrote a book about him and helped him to arrange some of his music for orchestra

Koechlin became a freelance composer and teacher He married Suzanne Pierrard in 1903 and they had five children At first he was comfortably off but after World War I the family lost a lot of money and they had to sell their country house

Koechlin had very free views about music and this is probably why he never got a teaching job at the Piano Conservatoire He also agreed with some things that the Communists thought He did not like modern inventions like the telephone and radio He looked like an old Russian patriarch with his long beard He dressed in velvet trousers sandals and a shepherds cape for bad weather  He liked outdoor activities such as swimming and mountaineering He was offered the Legion dHonneur in 1940 but refused it

Koechlin composed in a variety of styles even changing the style during a piece He often liked quiet music with long chords which are played for the sounds they make rather than for giving the music a traditional shape Sometimes there were no barlines in his music He often composed in his head while on a train or climbing a mountain

His works for orchestra include Les Bandarlogs which was based on the Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling Kiplings Bandarlog are a troupe of monkeys in the forest The music describes the monkeys but Koechlin also gives it another meaning he is criticising music critics comparing them to monkeys  In the Seven Stars Symphony each movement is about a famous film star They include Greta Garbo Marlene Dietrich and Charlie Chaplin He wrote a lot of chamber music and piano music including some dances for Ginger Rogers

Standard time is putting all clocks in a time zone to the same time

Standard time can also be used to mean the time without daylight saving time Standard time happens from autumn to early spring Daylight saving time happens from early spring to autumn

Standard time was first used by British railways on December 11 1847 when they switched from local mean time to Greenwich Mean Time Almost all of Great Britains public clocks were using GMT by 1855

Before 1883 local mean time was used in all of North America This meant there were many different local times This caused problems for train schedules Sandford Fleming a Canadian proposed standard time at a meeting of the Royal Canadian Institute on February 8 1879 The owners of the major railroads met in Chicago to make the Standard Time System Most states began using the system soon after the railroads The US government officially began using the system almost fifty years later

Some people do not like standard time Some people do not like it because they do not trust in government Others believe that it disturbs circadian rhythms Others simply like traditional natural markers of time like sunsets noon and sunrise

Electric power transmission is one process in the transmitting of electricity to consumers The term refers to the bulk transfer of electrical power from place to place Typically power transmission is between the power plant and a substation near a populated area Electricity distribution is the delivery from the substation to the consumers Due to the large amount of power involved transmission normally takes place at high voltage Electricity is usually transmitted over long distance through overhead power transmission lines Underground power transmission is used only in densely populated areas because of the high cost of installation and maintenance and because the power losses increase dramatically compared with overhead transmission unless superconductors and cryogenic technology are used 

A power transmission system is sometimes referred to colloquially as a grid however for reasons of economy the network is rarely a true grid Redundant paths and lines are provided so that power can be routed from any power plant to any load center through a variety of routes based on the economics of the transmission path and the cost of power 

The Darfur conflict is an ongoing military conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan the largest country in Africa a continent It is a conflict along ethnic and tribal lines that began in 2003 Many people including the United States Government consider it to be a genocide The United Nations currently does not see this as genocide

One side of the conflict is composed mainly of the Janjaweed a militia group recruited from the Arab tribes who move from place to place herding camels The Sudanese government tells the public that it does not support the Janjaweed However it has provided cash and assistance and has even participated in joint attacks

The other side of the conflict is made up of a number of rebel armies including the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement These armies are recruited from Black ethnic groups who make a living farming the land

The conflict is caused by the Arab farmers who need to find water for their camels So they take their camels farther and farther south In doing so the Arab tribes take over the land occupied by the white farming communities this ment that there was a lot less water and provisions to be shared between the people of the community Many droughts desertification and overpopulation have occurred in the last decades This has made the problem worse

The African Union sent a 7000 troop peacekeeping force to Sudan However this force was poorly funded and under equipped So the United Nations decided to send an additional 17300 troop peacekeeping force to help them Sudan was strongly against this decision and saw the UN forces as foreign invaders The next day the Sudanese military launched a major offensive in the region

The Sudanese government may have suppressed information about the conflict Some witnesses have been jailed others may have been killed This started in 2004 Also some evidence such as mass graves was tampered with so that it became unusable Some people say this was done by forces which are close to the Sudanese government In addition by obstructing and arresting journalists the Sudanese government has been able to obscure much of what has gone on The United States government has described it as genocide The UN has declined to do so In March 2007 the UN mission accused Sudans government of gross violations in Darfur and called for urgent international action to protect civilians there

There are many different guesses about how many people have died in the conflict According to Sudans government 9000 people have been killed On the other hand many other people say that it could be from 2000000 to over 4000000 As of October 2006 as many as 25 million people have had to move because of the conflict

The United Nations says that about 200000 people have been killed in the conflict so far Most non governmental organizations use 200000 to more than 400000 the latter is a figure from the Coalition for International Justice that has since been cited by the UN Sudans government claims that more than 9000 people have been killed although this figure is seen as a gross underestimate

The WWE Championship was introduced in 1963 with Buddy Rogers becoming the inaugural champion on April 29 However its origin is attributed to events that began in the National Wrestling Alliance a promotion with various subsidiaries In the 1950s Capitol Wrestling Corporation was a subsidiary to the NWA and by 1963 CWC executives held a controlling stake over NWA operations During this time Buddy Rogers held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship the world title of the NWA and its subsidiaries until January 24 when Lou Thesz defeated Rogers for the championship Following a dispute over the result CWC seceded from the NWA and became the World Wide Wrestling Federation The WWWF World Heavyweight Championship was then established as having spun off from the NWA title when the recognition was awarded to Buddy Rogers following an apocryphal tournament in Rio de Janeiro defeating Antonino Rocca in the finals Affiliated with the NWA once again the WWWF was renamed to World Wrestling Federation in 1979 and after conclusively ending its affiliation with the NWA in 1983 the championship became known as the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and later simply as the WWF Championship by the 1990s

In 1991 World Championship Wrestling another subsidiary to the NWA established the WCW World Heavyweight Championship to complement the NWAs world title WCW then seceded from the NWA and grew to become a rival promotion to the WWF Both organizations grew into mainstream prominence and were eventually involved in a television ratings war dubbed the Monday Night Wars Near the end of the ratings war WCW began a financial decline which culminated in March 2001 with the WWFs purchase of WCW1 As a result of the purchase the WWF acquired the video library of WCW select talent contracts and championships among other assets The slew of former WCW talent joining the WWF roster began The Invasion which effectively phased out the WCW name Following this the WCW Championship was unified with the WWF Championship at Vengeance 2001 in December2 At the event Chris Jericho defeated The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin to win the WCW Championship and WWF Championship respectively Consequently Chris Jericho was named the final WCW Champion and the subsequent Undisputed WWF Champion as the WWF Championship became the Undisputed Championship in professional wrestling34

By 2002 the WWF roster had doubled in size due to the overabundance of contracted workers from the original WWF as well as those who had come across from WCW and ECW As a result of the increase the WWF divided the roster through its two main television programs Raw and SmackDown assigning championships and appointing figureheads to each brand This expansion became known as the Brand Extension5 In May 2002 the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment and the championship became known as the WWE Undisputed Championship Following these changes the WWE Undisputed Championship remained unaffiliated with either brand as competitors from both brands could challenge the WWE Undisputed Champion Following the appointment of Eric Bischoff and Stephanie McMahon as General Managers of the Raw and SmackDown brands respectively Stephanie McMahon contracted then WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar to the SmackDown brand leaving the Raw brand without a world title67 On September 2 after disputing the brand designation of the Undisputed title Eric Bischoff announced the creation of the World Heavyweight Championship spun off from the Undisputed title Immediately afterward the WWE Undisputed Championship returned to being known as the WWE Championship8 In 2011 There were two WWE Champions John Cena and CM Punk on August 1st edition of Raw the Chief operating officer Triple H announced a match to determine who will be the Undisputed WWE Champion between John Cena and CM Punk at Summerslam CM Punk defeated John Cena to unify the two WWE titles to become the Undisputed champion Later Kevin Nash returned at Summerslam to attack CM Punk then the Raw Mr Money in the Bank Winner Alberto Del Rio cashed in his briefcase on Punk in a wining effort and Del Rio became the new Undisputed Champion

Following the events of the WWE Brand Extension an annual WWE Draft was established in which select members of the WWE roster are reassigned to a different brand9 After three years on the SmackDown brand the WWE Championship switched brands during the 2005 WWE Draft Lottery in which the WWE Champion John Cena was drafted to Raw while the World Heavyweight Champion Batista was drafted to SmackDown10 On June 11 2006 Rob Van Dam used his Money in the Bank contract at ECW One Night Stand for a WWE Championship match against the WWE Champion John Cena The holder of the contract is guaranteed a WWE World Heavyweight or ECW Championship match at anytime of their choosing Rob Van Dam defeated John Cena to win the WWE Championship moving the title to the ECW brand a WWE brand established from purchased assets of the Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion On July 3 Edge defeated John Cena and Rob Van Dam in a Triple Threat Match to win the WWE Championship However with Edge being a member of the Raw brand at the time the title returned to Raw due to the circumstances After the 2008 WWE Draft the WWE Champion Triple H was drafted to SmackDown moving the WWE Championship to the SmackDown brand11 The following year the title returned to Raw after Triple H was drafted back to the brand during the 2009 WWE Draft and remained exclusive to the Raw brand since When SmackDowns Batista won the title from Raws John Cena at Elimination Chamber it remained exclusive to Raw while Batista was transferred to the Raw roster

In July 2011 CM Punk was involved in a storyline where he vowed to leave WWE with the WWE Championship when his contract expired on July 17 2011 At the event Punk succeeded in defeating the defending champion John Cena to win the championship and legitimately left the company with the physical title belt With the championship seemingly vacated by Vince McMahon the following night on Raw Rey Mysterio won an 8 man Championship Tournament by defeating The Miz in the finals on the July 25 episode of Raw to be crowned the new WWE Champion only to subsequently lose it later that night to Cena for the latters record ninth reign However following Cenas win Punk returned to WWE with his own title belt thereby creating both an ambiguity and a dispute in WWE over the presence of two WWE Championships On the July 29 2011 episode of SmackDown new WWE COO Triple H announced that CM Punks claim to the WWE Championship was legitimate meaning there were two WWE champions12 At the subsequent SummerSlam pay per view Punk defeated Cena to solidify his claim on the title only to lose the title moments later to Alberto Del Rio who opportunistically cashed in his Money in the Bank contract after Kevin Nash attacked

Special custom belts have been created to match the gimmicks of some champions

A much larger version of the belt was created for Andr the Giant before WrestleMania III although he never wore it as champion A custom championship belt was designed and constructed for The Rock which featured his trademark Brahma Bull logo in the center but it was lost and thus never appeared on television13 Similarly Edge had originally designed an entirely different custom belt than the Rated R Spinner design he used for his second reign however the plans were scrapped due to time constraints14

The Spinner belts design has become the WWE Championships primary design since April 11 2005 although since No Mercy 2007 the centerpiece no longer spins The physical belt itself originally indicated the brand it was designated to When it was first introduced it featured a unique side plate design that read SmackDown though it was then replaced with one that read Mon Nite Raw when John Cena was drafted to the Raw brand When the title once again became SmackDowns primary championship after Triple H was drafted to the brand in 2008 the Raw plate was replaced with a second WWE Champion side plate Furthermore the belt also features a silver tip on the end of the leather strap

The current champion is CM Punk who is in his second reign He won it by beating Alberto Del Rio for the championship at Survivor Series on November 20 2011

In cell biology an organelle is a part of a cell that does a specific job 

Organelles typically have their own plasma membrane round them Most of the cells organelles are in the cytoplasm

The name organelle comes from the idea that these structures are to cells what an organ is to the body 

There are many types of organelles in eukaryotic cells Prokaryotes were once thought not to have organelles but some examples have now been found They are not organised like eukaryote organelles and are not bounded by plasma membranes They are called bacterial microcompartments

The term is now widely used to refer to cellular structures surrounded by single or double plasma membranes However the older definition of a subcellular functional unit still coexists That is the term is sometimes used for structures which are not membrane bound

Mitochondria and chloroplasts which have double membranes and their own DNA are believed to have originated from incompletely consumed or invading prokaryotic organisms which were adopted as a part of the invaded cell This idea is supported in the endosymbiotic theory

PlotData

The Masque of the Red Death is a short story written by Edgar Allan Poe and first published in 1842

The story takes place at the abbey of Prince Prospero Prospero and one thousand other nobles have broken wikt linkfleefled to a walled abbey to escape the Red Death a terrible plague that started in the country The symptoms of the Red Death are terrible the victim has convulsions and sweats blood instead of water The plague is said to kill within half an hour Prospero and his court show their indifference to the sufferings of the population and intend to await the end of the plague in luxury and safety behind the walls of their abbey 

The development of the plot shows that their attitude is wrong

Poe first published this story in the May 1842 edition of Grahams Ladys and Gentlemans Magazine as The Mask of the Red Death A revised version was published in the July 19 1845 edition of the Broadway Journal under the now standard title The Masque of the Red Death The story has been published in The Gold Bug and Other Tales as well as in many later collections of Poes stories

Darfur is region of far western Sudan

It borders the Central African Republic Libya and Chad It is divided into three federal states within Sudan Gharb Darfur Janub Darfur and Shamal Darfur It is currently in the midst of an ongoing humanitarian crisis that developed from the conflict between Ganjaweed militias and rebel groups

Darfur covers an area of about 493 180 kmjust over two thirds the size of France and more than half the size of Kenya It is largely an arid plateau with the Marrah Mountains a range of volcanic peaks rising up to 3000 m in the center of the region The regions main towns are Al Fashir Nyala and Geneina 

There are four main features of the physical geography The whole eastern half of Darfur is covered with plains and low hills of sandy soils known as goz and sandstone hills In many places the goz is waterless and can only be inhabited where there are water reservoirs or deep boreholes To the north the goz is overtaken by the desert sands of the Sahara A second feature are the wadis seasonal watercourses ranging from small rivulets that flood only occasionally during the wet season to large wadis that flood for most of the rains and flow from western Darfur hundreds of miles west to Lake Chad Many wadis have pans of alluvium with rich soil that are also difficult to cultivate The west of Darfur is dominated by the third feature basement rock sometimes covered with a thin layer of sandy soil Basement rock is too infertile to be farmed but provides sporadic forest cover that can be grazed by animals The fourth and final feature are the Marrah Mountains that rise up to a peak at Deriba crater where there is a small area of temperate climate high rainfall and permanent springs of water 

The rainy season is from June through September transforming much of the region from dusty brown to green Because much of the population of Darfur is agricultural the rains are vital In normal years a crop is ready to be harvested by November Once harvested the dry stalks may be fed to domestic livestock In the far northern desert years may pass between rainfall In the far south annual average rainfall is 700 mm and many trees remain green year round 

Darfur has an estimated population of 74 million people Darfurs economy is primarily based on subsistence agriculture producing cereals fruit and tobacco as well as livestock in the drier north In addition to this Darfur also suffers from frequent droughts during the summer and heavy rainfall in the winter This has caused many farmers to provide inadequate crops causing the deaths of thousands of people

The Darfur conflict is an ongoing armed conflict between the Janjaweed militia group and the tribes of the region The United Nations estimates that over 400000 people have lost their lives since the beginning of this conflict

Mill could mean

People named Mill

A grinding mill is a tool that is designed to break a solid material into smaller pieces There are many different types of grinding mills and many types of materials processed in them Small mills can be powered by hand such as a mortar and pestle or a pepper grinder Large grinding mills were usually powered by working animals wind or water in the past In the 2000s most large grinding mills are powered by electricity

People who need to grind a small amount of a food such as spices or grain for their own cooking often use a hand powered mortar and pestle or a hand powered grinder such as a pepper grinder In the 2000s many people also used electric powered grinding mills These kitchen appliances have a metal blade that grinds the food into small pieces Electric powered grinding mills are often used for grinding nuts or coffee

For thousands of years humans have ground their grains into flour using grain mills powered by working animals wind or the running water of a stream or river In the 2000s most grain mills are powered by electricity 

The grinding of solid matters occurs under exposure of mechanical forces that trench the structure by overcoming of the interior bonding forces After the grinding the state of the solid is changed the grain size the grain size disposition and the grain shape

For process engineering several factors are importantmagnification of the surface area of the solid manufacturing of solid with wanted grain size and broken wikt linkpulppulping the material to the desired state

A windmill is an engine that is powered by the wind to produce energy Often they are in a large building like traditional post mills smock mills and tower mills The energy windmills produce can be used in many ways traditionally for grinding grain or spices pumping water sawing wood or hammering seeds Modern wind power machines are used for generating electricity and are more commonly called wind turbines

A windwheel that operated an organ was described as early as the 1st century AD by the Greek engineer Hero That could have been the first machine in history that used wind power Vertical axle windmills were used in eastern Persia by the 9th century AD as described by Muslim geographers Horizontal axle windmills of the type generally used today were invented in Northwestern Europe in the 1180s

The first windmills had long vertical shafts with rectangle shaped blades and appeared in Persia in the 9th century The authenticity of an earlier anecdote of a windmill involving the second caliph Umar is questioned on the grounds of being a 10th century amendment Made of six to twelve sails covered in reed matting or cloth these windmills were used to grind corn or draw up water they were quite different from the European versions A similar type of vertical shaft windmill with rectangle blades used for irrigation can also be found in 13th century China

Miguel de Cervantes book Don Quixote de La Mancha  which helped cement the modern Spanish language and is one of the greatest works of fiction ever published  features an important scene in which Don Quixote attacks windmills that he believes to be violent giants This gave worldwide fame to La Mancha and its windmills and is the origin of the phrase tilting at windmills to describe an act of uselessness The Moulin Rouge translated directly in French to mean the Red Windmill

Blood transfusion is a medical term It means a procedure used to transfer blood from the circulatory system of one human to that of another human 

Blood transfusions can save the life of a person if that person has suffered from a severe blood loss This blood loss can occur due to an injury a trauma or if that person had a medical operation performed Blood transfusions can also be applied as a treatment to certain diseases of the blood

Blood is not collected and used straight away Instead it is kept until it is needed The storage area is informally called a blood bank By adding anti coagulant to keep the blood from clotting and refrigerating the blood it is possible to store it for a few days Information about transfusion and donation is available at the National Institutes of Health website 

Delirium is a medical term Doctors use it to describe patients who have lost parts or all of their ability to focus attention Such people may also have problems to concentrate or to remember things or people Delirium is a medical symptom It is not a disease It can have many causes which are

Deliria are always a medical emergency because it is impossible to predict how they develop Worst case scenarios include cardiac arrest and malfunctions of the metabolism In order to be able to treat a delirium its cause must usually be found In the case of alcoholism the most common cause for a delirium is the withdrawal of alcohol This condition is known as Delirium tremens

Jaundice is when the skin and the whites of the eyes become a yellow color People with jaundice have a problem with their liver which stops it from removing dead red blood cells properly These blood cells contain a chemical called bilirubin Bilirubin causes the yellow coloring of the skin Jaundice is common in newly born babies It usually starts the second day after birth 

Jaundice can also be caused by other diseases like malaria hepatitis or gallstones

Jaundice is the most common of all liver problems The yellow colour of the skin and mucous membranes happens because of an increase in the bile pigment bilirubin in the blood

The bile made by the liver is a vital digestive fluid needed for proper nutrition It also stops decaying changes in food If the bile is stopped from entering the intestines there is an increase in gases and other products Normally the production of bile and its flow is constant

There are three types of jaundice

Yellow discoloration of the skin and the whites of the eyes happens in all types of jaundice

The symptoms of jaundice are

Jaundice is a sign that the liver is not working It may be caused by a blockage of the bile ducts which release bile salts and pigment into the intestines The bile then gets mixed with blood and this gives a yellow colour to the skin The blockage of the bile ducts could be caused by

Other causes of jaundice are pernicious anaemia and diseases affecting the liver such as typhoid malaria yellow fever and tuberculosis

The simple form of jaundice can be cured quickly by diet and exercises Recovery will be slow in serious cases which have been caused by a blockage or pressure in the bile ducts The patient should rest until the acute symptoms of the disease subside

The patient should be put on a juice diet for a week The juice of oranges lemons grapes pears carrots beets and sugarcane can be used A hot water enema should be given every day during this period to make sure the bowel empties completely This stops decomposed poisonous material going into the blood stream The juice diet may be continued till the acute symptoms subside

After the juice diet the patient may start an all fruit diet for further three to five days The patient should have three meals a day of fresh juicy fruits such as apples pears grapes oranges and pineapples but no bananas 

Afterward a simple diet may be started on the following lines 

Getting up A glass of warm water with juice of half a lemon

Breakfast One fresh juicy fruit such as apple pear mango papaya or some grapes or berries One cup wheat dalia or one slice of whole meal bread with a little butter

Mid morning Orange or pear juice

Lunch Raw vegetable salad two small chapatis of whole wheat flour a steamed leafy vegetable such as spinach methi saag or carrot and a glass of buttermilk

Mid afternoon Coconut water or apple juice

Dinner One cup strained vegetable soup two chapatis of whole meal baked potato and one other leafy vegetable like methi spinach etc

Before bed A glass of hot skimmed milk with honey if desired

All fats like ghee butter cream and oils must not be eaten for at least two weeks After that a little butter and olive oil may be used in the diet A light carbohydrate diet without fats best obtained from vegetables and fruits should be eaten

The patient should take plenty of fresh vegetables and fruit juices Dandelion leaves radishes with leaves endive should be added to the daily raw vegetable salad Raw apples and pears are especially helpful Barley water drunk several times during the day is considered good for jaundice One cup of barley should be boiled in six pints of water and simmered for three hours

Digestive upsets must be avoided No food that will ferment or decay in the lower intestines like pulses and legumes should be included in the diet Drinking a lot of water with lemon juice will protect the damaged liver cells

A person with jaundice can get better quite easily with the above diet and build up his sick liver until it works normally once again A repeat of liver trouble can be stopped with

Research has shown that the liver has an excellent ability to fix itself provided all essential nutrients are eaten Diets high in complete proteins Vitamin C and Vitamin B particularly Choline which helps digest fats and Vitamin E can help the liver recover It is essential to keep the diet for a long time to prevent a repeat of the trouble

Hildegard of Bingen was a German writer composer and mystic She was an abbess who is well known for her literary works and her songs She also wrote about medical and scientific things and wrote letters to many important politicians

Hildegard was born into a noble family Her parents sent her to a monastery because she was the tenth child of the family She took the veil at the age of 15 By the time she was 38 she had the title of mother superior She founded a monastery on the Rupertsberg in the Rhine valley near Bingen Later she founded a daughter house on the other side of the river near Rdesheim She travelled a lot and talked to many important people She later had the title of abbess After she died several popes suggested she should be made a saint but this never happened

Hildegard had many visions many of which she wrote down She wrote lyrical poetry which was very colourful and had lots of visionary ideas Her music does not use plainchant like the music of many other medieval composers at the time It mostly has small patterns of melody which are repeated many times in slightly different ways She wrote a morality play in verse with 82 melodies

Alternative medicine describes practices used in place of conventional medical treatments 

It can also describe practices used along with conventional medicine

Alternative medicine includes practices that incorporate spiritual metaphysical or religious belief non evidence based practices non European medical traditions or newly developed approaches to healing

Divaldo Pereira Franco or simply Divaldo Franco is a Brazilian medium born in Feira de Santana Bahia on May 5th 1927

He has been for almost 60 years an important spiritual speaker and writer having devoted more than 50 years to spirituality and more than 40 years dedicated taking care of the street children of Salvador Bahia

On the 15th of August 1952 he founded the House of Assistance responsible for the orientation and education of over 33000 devoid children and adolescents

Divaldo graduated from the Escola Normal Rural de Feira de Santana where he received his Primary School Professor diploma in 1943 Since his infancy he claimed to be able to communicate with spirits

When he was young he was traumatized by the death of his two older brothers so much so that he became sick He was taken to several Medical specialists none of them could give a satisfactory diagnosis After this he met Dr Ana Ribeiro Borges who persuaded him to take up the spiritist doctrine During his period of convalescence he dedicated himself to the study of spiritism After the body health be restored he continued studying the spiritism

One Supreme God is worshipped within Hinduism The Supreme God is regarded as an entity that exists in and gives life to all things He is believed to have created the universe and many other Gods or Devas to be his helpers Different aspects of the Supreme God are worshipped depending on the Hindu tradition The other Gods helpers of the Supreme God are also worshipped Gods in Hinduism are highly advanced spiritual beings often represented in humanoid or partially humanoid forms

In Hinduism Narayanan is the supreme god and it tells he was produced Brahma and Shiva In Indian history of religion Lord Shiva was being worshiped in pre historic time The first concept of supreme being comes from HinduismPre historic India attest first supreme being as Shiva which literally means The supreme one

Another manifestation of Shiva is Mahadeva literally means Lord of all godShiva is also known as Maheshvara the great Lord Mahadeva the great God Shambhu Hara Pinakadhrik bearer of the axe and Mrityunjaya conqueror of death He is the spouse of Shakti the goddess He also is represented by Mahakala and Bhairava the terrible as well as many other forms including Rudra

All Hindus worship one Supreme Being though by different names This is because the peoples of India with different languages and cultures have understood the one God in their own distinct way Regional and family traditions can play a large part in influencing this choice Through history four principal Hindu denominations arose Saivism Shaktism Vaishnavism and Smartism For Saivites God is Siva For Shaktas Goddess Shakti is supreme For Vaishnavites Lord Vishnu is God For Smartaswho see all Deities as reflections of the One Godthe choice of Deity is left to the devotee According to Adherentscom there are 580000000 Vaishnavas 220000000 Shaivites and 22000000 neo Hindus and reform Hindus

Later on vedas were written in which the three manifestation of God was scripted as BrahmaMaha Vishnu and Mahesh The Vedas are a large body of texts originating in Ancient India The texts are composed in Vedic Sanskrit and form the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and the oldest sacred texts of Hinduism

Most Hindus in their daily devotional practices worship some form of a personal aspect of God although they believe in the more abstract concept of a Supreme God as well They generally choose one concept of God and cultivate devotion to that chosen form while at the same time respecting the chosen ideals of other people The many different names given to the Supreme God in Hinduism encourage a multiplicity of paths as opposed to conformity to just one The unique understanding in Hinduism is that God is not far away living in a remote heaven but is all pervasive and energizes the entire universe He is also inside each soul waiting to be discovered Knowing the one Supreme God in this intimate and experiential way is the goal of Hindu spirituality For example shopkeepers frequently keep a statue or picture of the devi Lakshmi in their shops 

The concept of Goddess Durga as the supreme goddess emerged in historical religious literature as a term to define the powerful and influential nature of female deities in India Throughout history goddesses have been portrayed as the mother of the universe through whose powers the universe is created and destroyed The gradual changes in belief through time shape the concept of Bhuvaneswari and express how the different Goddesses though very different in personality all carry the power of the universe on their shouldersShe is almighty There is a suggestion that she took avatars as Parvati to join with her husband Shiva

Coheed and Cambria is an American rock band from New York Coheed and Cambria have made four studio albums two live albums and some special albums Their studio albums are concept albums showing one story broken into parts The band wants to make five albums telling the story of The Amory Wars Now four albums have been released The Second Stage Turbine Blade In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth 3 Good Apollo Im Burning Star IV Volume One From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness and Good Apollo Im Burning Star IV Volume Two No World for Tomorrow and Year of the Black Rainbow These albums make the first second third and fourth part of the four part story of Coheed and Cambria The albums have been made out of order the second part was made first and the first part has been made last

When a band called Toxic Parents with Claudio Sanchez and Travis Stever in it broke up about the same time as Nate Kelleys band Moe The Boogie Cats the members of these bands came together to form a new band in March 1995 This band was called Beautiful Loser It had Travis Stever singing and playing guitar Claudio Sanchez on guitar Nate Kelley on drums and Jon Carleo on bass The group did not last long it broke up in June of 1995 they had an argument about gas money Stever left the band and Kelley was kicked out but he came back when Sanchez asked him to Without Stever the band only had three people so Sanchez started to sing and play guitar

They changed their name to Shabtie a chant taken from the film The Naked Prey The band constantly changed and experimented with different genres and styles never properly deciding a set genre When Carleo left the band in August 1996 Kelley asked Michael Todd to join the band who he had worked with in an acoustic project called Esme 9 Todd a guitar player started playing bass because of Shabtie

After Kelley left Sanchez and the other people picked Josh Eppard who was in the band 3 to take his place In 2001 shortly after The Delirium Trigger EP was made they changed their name to Coheed and Cambria and Shabtie was finished The band was now a four piece Claudio Sanchez Travis Stever Michael Todd and Josh Eppard When playing live Dave Parker sometimes plays too

Josh Eppard could not play at Coheed and Cambrias June 9 slot at the Download Festival in the UK because he was ill A few days later the band canceled the Barcelona and Essen parts of their European tour 

In November 2006 it was announced that both Josh Eppard and Mic Todd had left the band 

A few months after Mic Todd returned to work on the No World For Tomorrow with the band

It was announced a few days before the band embarked on Warped Tour 07 that Chris Pennie the  former drummer for Dillinger Escape Plan is working with the band in studio 

The band debuted their first single from No World For Tomorrow The Running Free during Warped Tour 07

In July a website registered to Sony appeared on the internet wwwnoworldfortomorrowcom This website contained a countdown

After this countdown ended a message was released and another countdown appeared This showed that a message would be released weekly An archive of the messages released can be found here

On October 23 2007 The bands forth studio album was released under the name Good Apollo Im Burning Star IV Volume Two No World for Tomorrow It was met with positive reviews from online zines such as Rollingstonecom and Absolutepunknet

Sanchez has said that he is influenced by bands like Pink Floyd Led Zeppelin Thin Lizzy Black Sabbath Iron Maiden Yes and many people say that they sound like Rush But Claudio Sanchez has said that he never listened to the band until he heard people say that they sounded like each other Metal Hammer magazine called the band the new Led Zeppelin on the front cover of issue 153 They also have hardcore punk influences such as Bad Brains and The Misfits Claudio also said in an interview he learned to play guitar by listening to the Misfits Legacy of Brutality

 Discography  Work done as Shabtie is noted

The Coheed and Cambria albums are coming out out of sequence the last album to come out will be the first part of the series The first CD made was The Second Stage Turbine Blade the second part in the story the third and fourth parts came out next The next album has been called Most Anticipated Album of 2007 by the Alternative Press magazine The February 2007 issue of Kerrang says Among the songs that may or may not appear on the album are Gravemakers And Gunslingers and The Hound Of Blood And Rank Also the issue says that a release should come out in either late spring or early summer

A cover of Night Rangers Sister Christian was released by the band via the bands official website as an MP3 download as a Christmas present to their fans Similarly a cover of The Bands I Shall Be Released was uploaded onto the bands MySpace page as a Christmas Present to their fans in 2006 The band also used to play a cover of Iron Maidens The Trooper at concerts A song called The Glass was in the process of being written for the movie Spiderman 2s soundtrack but the song was not finished in time and it was scrapped Many Shabtie songs are circulated on the internet Some were recorded in a studio but others were recorded on a 4 track resulting in poor quality audio There is also a live bootleg on the internet of a song played by Shabtie that fans named Nauraushaun It was assumed that this song was one song in full but former drummer Nate Kelley has recently told fans that the song was in fact two songs played in a medley These two songs are Origins and Life Without You These two songs were never recorded except for the bootleg that has been circulating although Life Without You was almost recorded instead of Cassiopeia In the end the band decided they liked Cassiopeia more and this was recorded instead

A watermill is an engine that uses a water wheel or turbine to drive a mechanical process such as flour or lumber production or metal shaping A watermill that only generates electricity is more usually called a hydroelectric plant

The watermill was invented in China during the Han dynasty in order to grind grain as well as to powerpiston bellows of a blast furnace in forging cast iron

In the text known as the Xin Lun written by Huan Tan about 20 AD it states that the legendary mythological king known as Fu Xi was the one responsible for the pestle and mortar or tilt hammer device

In 31 AD a Chinese engineer named Du Shi invented the first water powered bellows This was a complicated machine containing gears axles and levers that was powered by a waterwheel In essence Du Shis invention aided the forging of cast iron smelted from the blast furnace Du Shis invention was continued by Chinese living in subsequent dynastic periods of China although the bellows of his device were improved upon in later periods

The ancient Greeks and Romans have used the technology In the 1st century BC the Greek epigrammatist Antipater of Thessalonica was the first to make a reference to the waterwheel He praised it for its use in grinding grain and the reduction of human labor

The Romans used both fixed and floating water wheels and introduced water power to other countries of the Roman Empire So called Greek Mills used water wheels with a vertically mounted shaft A Roman Mill features a horizontally mounted shaft Greek style mills are the older and simpler of the two designs but only operate well with high water velocities and with small diameter millstones Roman style mills are more complicated as they require gears transmit the power from a shaft with a horizontal axis to one with a vertical axis An example of a Roman era watermill would be the early 4th century site at Barbegal in southern France where 16 overshot waterwheels were used to power an enormous flour mill

The Cistercian Order built huge mill complexes all over Western Europe during the medieval period

In a 2005 survey the scholar Adam Lucas identified the following first appearances of various industrial mill types in Western Europe Noticeable is the preeminent role of France in the introduction of new innovative uses of waterpower

Typically water is diverted from a river or impoundment or mill pond to a turbine or water wheel along a channel or pipe The force of the waters movement drives the blades of a wheel or turbine which in turn rotates an axle that drives the mills other machinery Water leaving the wheel or turbine is drained through a tail race but this channel may also be the head race of yet another wheel turbine or mill The passage of water is controlled by sluice gates that allow maintenance and some measure of flood control large mill complexes may have dozens of sluices controlling complicated interconnected races that feed multiple buildings and industrial processes

Watermills can be divided into two kinds one with a horizontal waterwheel on a vertical axle and the other with a vertical wheel on a horizontal axle The oldest of these were horizontal mills in which the force of the water striking a simple paddle wheel set horizontally in line with the flow turned a runner stone balanced on the rynd which is atop a shaft leading directly up from the wheel The bedstone does not turn The problem with this type of mill arose from the lack of gearing the speed of the water directly set the maximum speed of the runner stone which in turn set the rate of milling

Coma is a medical term It is a state of deep unconsciousness People who are in that state can not be woken up They also do not react to pain or light Coma can result from various conditions Some of these are intoxication poisons or damages or diseases of the nervous system It can also be the result of certain drugs Doctors sometimes put patients that have very bad injuries into a coma There are different levels of coma Comas usually do not last more than several weeks but those several weeks could be disastrous Sometimes only basic bodily functions are left over Intensive hospital care is often needed to recover some of these functions Some comas can last years but these are usually not woken up from The family of a coma victim can sign papers so that they are taken off of life support and die

A water wheel is a hydropower system a machine for extracting power from the flow of water Water wheels and hydropower was widely used in the Middle Ages powering most industry in Europe along with the windmill The most common use of the water wheel was to mill flour in gristmills but other uses included foundry work and machining and pounding linen for use in paper 

A water wheel consists of a large wooden or metal wheel with a number of blades or buckets arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface Most commonly the wheel is mounted vertically on a horizontal axle but the tub or Norse wheel is mounted horizontally on a vertical shaft Vertical wheels can transmit power either through the axle or via a ring gear and typically drive belts or gears horizontal wheels usually directly drive their load A channel created for the water to follow after leaving the wheel is commonly referred to as a tailrace

Main article Watermill

The technology of the water wheel had long been known but it was not put into widespread use until the Middle Ages when an acute shortage of labor made machines such as the water wheel cost effective However the water wheels in ancient Rome and ancient China found many practical uses in powering mills for pounding grain and other substances The Romans used both fixed and floating water wheels and introduced water power to other countries of the Roman Empire The Romans were known to use waterwheels extensively in mining projects with enormous Roman era waterwheels found in places like modern day Spain In the 1st century BC the Greek epigrammatist Antipater of Thessalonica was the first to make a reference to the waterwheel

By at least the 1st century AD the Chinese of the Eastern Han Dynasty began to use waterwheels to crush grain in mills and to power the piston bellows in forging iron ore into cast iron 

In the text known as the Xin Lun written by Huan Tan about 20 AD it states that the legendary mythological king known as Fu Xi was the one responsible for the pestle and mortar which evolved into the tilt hammer and then trip hammer device Although the author speaks of the mythological Fu Xi a passage of his writing gives hint that the waterwheel was in widespread use by the 1st century AD in China

In the year 31 AD the engineer and Prefect of Nanyang Du Shi applied a complex use of the waterwheel and machinery to power the bellows of the blast furnace to create cast iron Waterwheels in China found practical uses such as this as well as extraordinary use The inventor Zhang Heng was the first in history to apply motive power in rotating the astronomical instrument of an armillary sphere by use of a waterwheel The mechanical engineer Ma Jun once used a waterwheel to power and operate a large mechanical puppet theater for Emperor Ming of Wei

Cistercian monasteries in particular made extensive use of water wheels to power watermills of many kinds An early example of a very large waterwheel is the still extant wheel at the early 13th century Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda a Cistercian monastery in the Aragon region of Spain Grist mills were undoubtedly the most common but there were also sawmills fulling mills and mills to fulfill many other labor intensive tasks The water wheel remained competitive with the steam engine well into the Industrial Revolution 

The main difficulty of water wheels was their inseparability from water This meant that mills often needed to be located far from population centers and away from natural resources Water mills were still in commercial use well into the twentieth century however

Overshot pitchback waterwheels are suitable where there is a small stream with a height difference of more than 2 meters often in association with a small reservoir Breastshot and undershot wheels can be used on rivers or high volume flows with large reservoirs  ImageMiddenslaand waterrad MeyerspngBreastshot waterwheel ImageOnderslaand waterrad Meyerspngundershoshot waterwheel ImageParque Sao Lourenco watermill Curitiba BrasiljpgOvershot waterwheel The most powerful waterwheel built in the United Kingdom was the 100 hp Quarry Bank Mill Waterwheel near Manchester A high breastshot design it was retired in 1904 and replaced with several turbines It has now been restored and is a museum open to the public

Modern Hydro electric dams can be viewed as the descendants of the water wheel as they too take advantage of the movement of water downhill

Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is a hereditary disease This means it is passed on through the genes from a parent to the child It leads to a form of anaemia There are some means to treat it though the focus of the doctors now lies on prevention As it is linked to the X chromosome most people who suffer from it are male 

Sufferers can not make the enzyme glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase This will mean the circulation of sugar in their body is different More red blood cells will be destroyed because of it About 200 million people suffer from this condition Very often it can be found in regions where there is also malaria 

Hydropower is the capture of the energy of moving water for some useful purpose 

In the 1830s at the peak of the canal building era hydropower was used to transport barge traffic up and down steep hills using inclined plane railroads For direct mechanical power transmission industries that used hydropower had to be near the waterfall For example during the last half of the 19th century many grist mills were built at Saint Anthony Falls to use the 50 foot drop in the Mississippi River The mills were important for the growth of Minneapolis Today the largest use of hydropower is for electric power generation That allows low cost energy to be used at long distances from the watercourse 

There are many forms of water power

Main article Hydroelectricity

Hydroelectric power now supplies about 715000 MWe or 19 of world electricity Large dams are still being designed Apart from a few countries with plenty of it hydro power is normally applied to peak load demand because it is readily stopped and started Nevertheless hydroelectric power is probably not a major option for the future of energy production in the developed nations because most major sites within these nations are either already being exploited or are unavailable for other reasons such as environmental considerations

Hydropower produces essentially no carbon dioxide or other harmful emissions in contrast to burning fossil fuels and is not a significant contributor to global warming through CO2

Hydroelectric power can be far less expensive than electricity generated from fossil fuel or nuclear energy Areas with abundant hydroelectric power attract industry Environmental concerns about the effects of reservoirs may prohibit development of economic hydropower sources 

The chief advantage of hydroelectric dams is their ability to handle seasonal high peak loads When the electricity demands drop the dam simply stores more water Some electricity generators use water dams to store excess energy by using the electricity to pump water up into a basin Electricity can be generated when demand increases In practice the utilization of stored water in river dams is sometimes complicated by demands for irrigation which may occur out of phase with peak electrical demands

Harnessing the tides in a bay or estuary has been achieved in France Canada and Russia and could be achieved in other areas with a large tidal range The trapped water turns turbines as it is released through the tidal barrage in either direction Another possible fault is that the system would generate electricity most efficiently in bursts every six hours This limits the applications of tidal energy 

A relatively new technology tidal stream generators draw energy from currents in much the same way that wind generators do The higher density of water means that a single generator can provide significant power This technology is at the early stages of development and will need more research before it can produce any higher amount of energy

But several broken wikt linkprototypeprototypes were tested in the UK in France and the USA Already in 2003 a turbine that produces 300 kW was tested in the UK

The Canadian company Blue Energy has plans for installing very large arrays tidal current devices mounted in what they call a tidal fence in various locations around the world based on a vertical axis turbine design

Power from ocean surface wave motion might produce much more energy than tides It has been tested that it is possible to produce energy from waves particularly in Scotland in the UK But there are still a lot of technical problems

A prototype shore based wave power generator is being constructed at Port Kembla in Australia and is expected to generate up to 500 MWh annually Wave energy is captured by an air driven generator and converted to electricity For countries with large coastlines and rough sea conditions the energy of waves offers the possibility of generating electricity in utility volumes Excess power during rough seas could be used to produce hydrogen

South Pacific is the name for a geographical region of the world It includes regions of the Pacific Ocean which lie south of the Equator Australia New Zealand New Guinea and parts of Oceania

Guido List was a writer His works were influenced very much by ideas of race He was influenced by Arthur de Gobineau Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and others He believed there was a global jewish conspiracy He thought that the conspiracy threatened those he believed to be the Aryan race He also believed that Runes had magic power His beliefs were not unpopular in Western Europe in the 19th century He was an occultist A contemporary of his was Houston Steward Chamberlain Chambelain lived at the same time as he did One of his successors was Jrg Lanz von Liebenfels

Franklins is a cheap supermarket company that can be found all over the state of New South Wales in Australia It used to have shops all over Australia

The name of the shops is named after Frank Lindstrom who started Franklins in 1941 in the city of Sydney in Australia The shops had been cheap from the start created in a time when other supermarkets were also cheap simply by cutting back on what was keeping the shops expensive It grew to cover much of New South Wales Queensland Victoria and South Australia with a reputation for low prices on groceries It claims to be Australias Original Discount Grocer

Franklins was the first supermarket in Australia to have brand name products These products are called No Frills In fact the companys shops only sold these products when it first came about It started out with a few products but now they have 800 products This ranges from everything from bread to window cleaners Today a mascot of Franklins called Red Sock advertises these products

Franklins offers a wide range of products including No Frills Franklins mostly deals in food and everyday articles But some stores also sell a wider range of fresh food articles than Aldi ever had It even has Franklins brand name products like bread and meat

A wide range of people shop at Franklins to buy a wide range of articles In some shops people can buy their food and everyday articles at Franklins They can then buy their fresh food outside of the store In other stores people can get fresh food articles as well as food and everyday articles all in the one place Franklins even has a bottle shop inside a few stores where people can get their beer and wine from These places are both cheap and convenient to shop in

When Franklins first started their business philosophy was like Aldis No extras no service no music and no electronic cash  only articles at extremely low prices or as Franklins had put it Strictly No Frills Because of big competition with other good looking shops it no longer follows this philosophy instead making the articles cheaper and cheaper

Franklins is still cheap but Coles and Woolworths are also becoming cheaper This is why Franklins was less profitable over the years When Aldi came to Australia Franklins went broke and almost disappeared Today Franklins is owned by the Pick n Pay supermarket company from the country of South Africa It has opened Franklins Family Supermarkets in 2006 independently franchise shops of both Franklins and Pick n Pay

A water turbine is a rotary engine that takes energy from moving water

Water turbines were developed in the nineteenth century and were widely used for industrial power prior to electrical grids Now they are mostly used for electric power generation They harness a clean and renewable energy source

Water wheels have been used for thousands of years for industrial power Their main shortcoming is size which limits the flow rate and head that can be used 

The migration from water wheels to modern turbines took about one hundred years Development occurred during the Industrial revolution using scientific principles and methods They also made extensive use of new materials and manufacturing methods developed at the time

The word turbine was coined by the French engineer Claude Bourdin in the early 19th century and is derived from the Latin word for whirling or a vortex  The main difference between early water turbines and water wheels is a broken wikt linkswirlswirl component of the water which passes energy to a spinning rotor This additional component of motion allowed the turbine to be smaller than a water wheel of the same power They could process more water by spinning faster and could use much greater heads

Jn Andrej Segner developed a reactive water turbine in the mid 1700s It had a horizontal axis and was a precursor to modern water turbines It is a very simple machine that is still produced today for use in small hydro sites Segner worked with Euler on some of the early mathematical theories of turbine design

In 1820 Jean Victor Poncelet developed an inward flow turbine

In 1826 Benoit Fourneyron developed an outward flow turbine This was an efficient machine that sent water through a runner with blades curved in one dimension The stationary outlet also had curved guides 

In 1844 Uriah A Boyden developed an outward flow turbine that improved on the performance of the Fourneyron turbine Its runner shape was similar to that of a Francis turbine

In 1849 James B Francis improved the inward flow reaction turbine to over 90 efficiency He also conducted sophisticated tests and developed engineering methods for water turbine design The Francis turbine named for him is the first modern water turbine It is still the most widely used water turbine in the world today

Inward flow water turbines have a better mechanical arrangement and all modern reaction water turbines are of this design Also as the swirling mass of water spins into a tighter rotation it tries to speed up to conserve energy This property acts on the runner in addition to the waters falling weight and swirling motion Water pressure decreases to zero as it passes through the turbine blades and gives up its energy

Around 1890 the modern fluid bearing was invented now universally used to support heavy water turbine spindles As of 2002 fluid bearings appear to have a mean time between failures of more than 1300 years

Around 1913 Victor Kaplan created the Kaplan turbine a propeller type machine It was an evolution of the Francis turbine but revolutionized the ability to develop low head hydro sites

All common water machines until the late 19th century were reaction machines waters pressure head acted on the machine and produced work A reaction turbine needs to fully contain the water during energy transfer

In 1866 California millwright Samuel Knight invented a machine that worked off a completely different concept Inspired by the high pressure jet systems used in hydraulic mining in the gold fields Knight developed a bucketed wheel which captured the energy of a free jet which had converted a high head of water to kinetic energy This is called an impulse or tangential turbine The waters velocity roughly twice the velocity of the bucket periphery does a u turn in the bucket and drops out of the runner at 0 velocity

In 1879 Lester Pelton experimenting with a Knight Wheel developed a double bucket design which exhausted the water to the side eliminating some energy loss of the Knight wheel which exhausted some water back against the center of the wheel In about 1895 William Doble improved on Peltons half cylindrical bucket form with an elliptical bucket that included a cut in it to allow the jet a cleaner bucket entry This is the modern form of the Pelton turbine which today achieves up to 92 efficiency Pelton had been quite an effective promoter of his design and although Doble took over the Pelton company he did not change the name to Doble because it had brand name recognition

Turgo and Crossflow turbines were later impulse designs

Flowing water is directed on to the blades of a turbine runner creating a force on the blades Since the runner is spinning the force acts through a distance In this way energy is transferred from the water flow to the turbine 

Water turbines are divided into two groups reaction turbines and impulse turbines

Reaction turbines are acted on by water which changes pressure as it moves through the turbine and gives up its energy They must be encased to contain the water pressure or they must be fully submerged in the water flow

Newtons Third Law of Motion describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines 

Most water turbines in use are reaction turbines They are used in low and medium head applications

Impulse turbines change the velocity of a water jet The jet pushes the turbines curved blades which reverse the flow The resulting change in momentum causes a force on the turbine blades Since the turbine is spinning the force acts through a distance and the diverted water flow is left with diminished energy 

Some water turbines are designed for Pumped storage hydroelectricity They can reverse flow and operate as a pump to fill a high reservoir during off peak electrical hours and then revert to a turbine for power generation during peak electrical demand This type of turbine is usually a Deriaz or Francis in design

Large modern water turbines operate at mechanical efficiencies greater than 90

Reaction turbines

Impulse turbines

Turbine selection is based mostly on the available water head and less so on the available flow rate In general impulse turbines are used for high head sites and reaction turbines are used for low head sites Kaplan turbines are well adapted to wide ranges of flow or head conditions since their peak efficiency can be achieved over a wide range of flow conditions

Small turbines may have horizontal shafts and even fairly large bulb type turbines up to 100 MW or so may be horizontal Very large Francis and Kaplan machines usually have vertical shafts because this makes best use of the available head and makes installation of a generator more economical Pelton wheels may be either vertical or horizontal shaft machines because the size of the machine is so much less than the available head Some impulse turbines use multiple water jets per runner to increase specific speed and balance shaft thrust

Turbines are designed to run for decades with very little maintenance of the main elements overhaul intervals are on the order of several years Maintenance of the runners and parts exposed to water include removal inspection and repair of worn parts

Normal wear and tear is pitting from cavitation fatigue cracking and abrasion from suspended solids in the water Steel elements are repaired by welding usually with stainless steel rod Damage areas are cut or ground out then welding back up to their original or an improved profile Old turbine runners may have a significant amount of stainless steel added this way by the end of their lifetime Elaborate welding procedures may be used to achieve the highest quality repairs

Other elements requiring inspection and repair during overhauls include bearings packing box and shaft sleeves servomotors cooling systems for the bearings and generator coils seal rings wicket gate linkage elements and all surfaces 

Water turbines have had both positive and negative impacts on the environment

They are one of the cleanest producers of power replacing the burning of fossil fuels and eliminating nuclear waste Burning fossil fuels produces smoke and ash and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide Nuclear waste emits dangerous radiation and is difficult to dispose of They use a renewable energy source and are designed to operate for decades They produce significant amounts of the worlds electrical supply

Historically there have also been negative consequences The rotating blades or gated runners of water turbines can interrupt the natural ecology of rivers killing fish stopping migrations and disrupting peoples livelihoods For example American Indian tribes in the Pacific Northwest had livelihoods built around salmon fishing but aggressive dam building destroyed their way of life Since the late 20th century it has been possible to construct hydropower systems that divert fish and other organisms away from turbine intakes without significant damage or loss of power such systems require less cleaning but are substantially more expensive to construct In the United States it is now illegal to block the migration of fish so fish ladders must be provided by dam builders

The AWD Arena is a football stadium in Hanover a city in north Germany It is the home stadium of the football club Hannover 96 The AWD Arena was built from 1952 to 1954 and called Niedersachsenstadion Lower Saxony is a German federal state and Hanover is its capital

Originally the Niedersachsenstadium was large enough to hold about 80000 people It was changed for international football championships in 1974 and 1988 especially changing standing room into seats In 2003 it became changed to be used only for football and the name was sold to the German company of AWD Today it can hold 49000 people

In 2006 the Football World Championships were played there

Renewable energy comes from renewable resources It is different from fossil fuels as it does not produce as many greenhouse gases and other pollutants as fossil fuel combustion

There are a lot of traditional uses of wind power hydropower biofuel and solar energy in developed and developing countries But the mass production of electricity using renewable energy sources is now becoming more common 

In 2008 about 19 of global final energy consumption came from renewables with 13 coming from traditional biomass which is mainly used for heating and 32 from hydroelectricity New renewable energy sources accounted for another 27 and are growing very rapidly

At the end of 2009 worldwide wind farm capacity was 157900 megawatts representing an increase of 31 percent during the year and wind power supplied some 13 of global electricity consumption Wind power is widely used in European countries and more recently in the United States and Asia Wind power accounts for approximately 19 of electricity generation in Denmark 11 in Spain and Portugal and 9 in the Republic of Ireland These are some of the largest wind farms in the world as of January 2010

Solar photovoltaic cells convert sunlight into electricity and many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built mainly in Europe As of December 2010 the largest photovoltaic power plants in the world are the Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant Montalto di Castro Photovoltaic Power Station Finsterwalde Solar Park Rovigo Photovoltaic Power Plant Olmedilla Photovoltaic Park the Strasskirchen Solar Park and the Lieberose Photovoltaic Park Larger power stations are under construction some proposed will have a capacity of 150 MW or more

Many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use innovative tracking systems that follow the suns daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed mounted systems There are no fuel costs or emissions during operation of the power stations

Large solar thermal power stations include the 354 megawatt Solar Energy Generating Systems power installation in the USA Solnova Solar Power Station Andasol solar power station Nevada Solar One PS20 solar power tower and the PS10 solar power tower The 370 MW Ivanpah Solar Power Facility located in Californias Mojave Desert is the worlds largest solar thermal power plant project currently under construction

The solar thermal power industry is growing fast with 12 GW under construction as of April 2009 and another 139 GW announced globally through 2014 Spain is the epicenter of solar thermal power development with 22 projects for 1037 MW under construction all of which are projected to come online by the end of 2010 In the United States 5600 MW of solar thermal power projects have been announced In developing countries three World Bank projects for integrated solar thermalcombined cycle gas turbine power plants in Egypt Mexico and Morocco have been approved

Brazil has one of the largest renewable energy programs in the world involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane and ethanol now provides 18 percent of the countrys automotive fuel As a result Brazil which years ago had to import a large share of the petroleum needed for domestic consumption recently reached complete self sufficiency in oil 

Most cars on the road today in the US can run on blends of up to 10 ethanol and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends Ford DaimlerChrysler and General Motors Corporation are among the automobile companies that sell flexible fuel cars trucks and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85 ethanol By mid 2006 there were approximately six million E85 compatible vehicles on US roads

The Aral Sea is a lake in Central Asia it lies between Kazakhstan in the north and Karakalpakstan an autonomous region of Uzbekistan in the south Since the 1960s the Aral Sea has been shrinking The rivers that feed it were used by the Soviet Union for irrigation The Aral Sea is heavily polluted largely as the result of weapons testing industrial projects and fertilizer runoff before and after the breakup of the Soviet Union

There is a project to save at least the northern part of the Aral Sea For this a dam was built in the 1990 to stop water running off Climate improved in the following years and water levels rose again However that dam broke and is currently being rebuilt with international funding 

Another problem was that the Island of Rebirth had been used for the testing of biological weapons until 1993 It is currently contaminated with Anthrax the Plague and Tularemia Since 2001 this is no longer an island but a peninsula

Radiation is when energy moves through space away from a source Radiation is one of the best understood parts of physics There are two broad classes of radiation ionizing radiation which comes from radioactive materials and x ray machines and non ionizing radiation which comes from other sources Ionizing radiation which carries a large energy in each particle can change things that it hits hurting people or animals or causing chemical changes Non ionizing radiation does not cause microscopic damage but some types can cause chemical changes or make things hotter

There are many different ways that energy can travel through space in this way One way is in the form of shifting electrical and magnetic fields This is why some common types of radiation are referred to as Electromagnetic radiation also known as light Another way that radiation can travel is in the form of tiny particles These are pieces of atoms like neutrons or protons When radiation is made up of quickly moving particles it is referred to as particle radiation

Many people are already familiar with different kinds of electromagnetic radiationlight Scientists categorize this type of radiation based on its wavelength and frequency Some kinds of electromagnetic radiation are

Most people hear terms like radiation and immediately think of it as a bad or dangerous thing It turns out that only certain types of radiation are ordinarily harmful to humans For example ultraviolet radiation can give people sunburn X rays and gamma rays can make a person sick or even die if they are exposed to them for a very long time Some types of particle radiation can also make people sick and lead to burns Any type of radiation that causes changes in world like these is referred to as ionizing radiation If radiation does not carry high enough levels of energy though then these changes will not happen when something is hit by the radiation This is referred to as non ionizing radiation which is not as dangerous 

One can distinguish between various types of radiation by looking at the source of the radiation its wavelength the amount of energy being carried any particles involved etc Radioactive material is a physical material that emits radiation Uranium and plutonium are examples of radioactive materials The atoms they are made of tend to fall apart and give off different kinds of radiation like gamma rays and lots of types of particle radiation

Ionising radiation can kill living things It can cause genetic mutations as shown by HJ Muller It can destroy cells in the body which divide and thus indirectly kill a person

Non ionizing radiation means any type of electromagnetic radiation that does not carry enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules  that is to completely remove an electron from an atom or molecule 

The composition of this radiation can vary depending on what may be ionized Visible light near ultraviolet infrared microwave and radio waves are all examples of non ionizing radiation though visible and near ultraviolet can also ionize some molecules The light from the Sun that reaches the earth is largely composed of non ionizing radiation with the notable exception of some ultraviolet rays However most ionizing radiation is filtered out by the atmosphere

Because it is lower energy radiation the use of this type of radiation in medical fields and everyday life poses fewer health risks than ionizing radiation in forms such as X rays 

The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible electromagnetic radiation Electromagnetic radiation can be divided into octaves as sound waves are winding up with eighty one octaves The electromagnetic spectrum of an object is the frequency range of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths from thousands of kilometres down to fractions of the size of an atom 

It is commonly said that EM waves beyond these limits are uncommon although this is not actually true The short wavelength limit is likely to be the Planck length and the long wavelength limit is the size of the universe itself though in principle the spectrum is infinite 

Nearly all objects in the universe emit reflect or transmit some light The distribution of this light along the electromagnetic spectrum is determined by the objects composition Several types of spectra can be distinguished depending upon the nature of the radiation coming from an object

Electromagnetic spectroscopy is the branch of physics that deals with the characterization of matter by its spectra

NOTE The AUDIO entry in this graphic is there for comparison only Sound waves and light are two different things entirely

A spectrum is a condition or value that is not limited to a specific set of values but can vary infinitely within a continuum

Spectrum may refer more specifically to

A Continuum is a continuous series where all parts are very similar to their nearest neighbour but the ends or extremes of it are different from each other 

This describes something that changes gradually from one condition to a different condition but without any sudden changes or discontinuities

The difference between a continuum and something with very different changes that can be measured is important for all continuum theories

Continuum may also refer to

Revenge is a studio album by the American hard rockheavy metal band Kiss It was released on May 14 1992

Continuum theories or models explain variation as involving a gradual quantitative transition without abrupt changes or discontinuities It can be contrasted with categorical models which propose qualitatively different states 

In physics for example the space time continuum model explains space and time as part of the same continuum rather than as separate entities A spectrum in physics is often termed either a continuous spectrum or discrete spectrum

In psychology theories of mental phenomena can propose discrete differences between individuals or a continuum This can also apply to fields such as law or sociology or ethics in explaining or judging variation in human behavior

In psychiatry categorical models seek to distinguish and define particular mental disorders or illnesses but continuum or dimensional models propose that some people are more extreme than others on particular dimensions

He was a close friend of Adolf Hitler Goebbels stayed with Hitler in the Fhrerbunker until Hitlers suicide on 30 April 1945 After Hitlers death Goebbels was chancellor of Germany for one day before he and his wife Magda Goebbels were killed by an SS officer on Goebbels orders Just before she died Magda killed their six children with poison

Joseph Goebbels was born as Paul Joseph Goebbels in Mnchengladbach on 29 October 1897 His father Friedrich Goebbels was a bookkeeper and his mother was Maria Goebbels He was the third child of the family and grew up with five siblings Due to an illness in his childhood in 1901 Goebbels right foot was malformed He went to a Roman Catholic school in Rheydt in 1908 In 1914 Goebbels went to high school in Rheydt When the First World War started in August 1914 he volunteered to be part of the Army This was refused because of his limp

Goebbels took his Abitur in 1917 He was the best in his class He gave a speech at the end of the school year However his headteacher said that he would not become a good speaker Later in 1917 he broken wikt linkmatriculatedmatriculated at the university of Bonn Goebbels studied ancient philology history and German philology He received his PhD in Drama from the Heidelberg university in 1921 In 1923 Goebbels worked for the Deutsche Bank

Goebbels joined the National Socialist German Workers Party in 1926 In the same year Hitler made him a Gauleiter for Berlin and Brandenburg In 1927 Goebbels published the first the Nazi newspaper Der Angriff in Berlin The newspaper was printed twice a week In 1928 he became a member of the German Reichstag He kept this position until 1945 In 1929 Goebbels saw his first movie with sound The Singing Fool He said it would be the future of propaganda

In 1930 he became the Reichspropagandaleiter and the deputy of Heinrich Himmler Goebbels married Magda Quand in 1931 Franz Ritter von Epp and Adolf Hitler were the witnesses at the wedding

When Hitler became Chancellor in 1933 Goebbels became the Reich Minister for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda

In 1934 Goebbels moved to a villa near Berlin On 30 June 1934 he was an broken wikt linkeye witnesseye witness of the arrest of Ernst Rhm in Bad Wiessee Goebbels gave the order to confiscate about 650 art exhibits in 1937 He put them on display in show called Degenerate Art On 9 November 1938 a German diplomat was killed in France by a Jewish teenager Because of this murder Goebbels gave the order to the SS for what is now called Kristallnacht

At the start of the Second World War Goebbels ordered to broadcast special broken wikt linkannouncementsannouncements at the cinema and on the radio On 26 May 1940 he published the new weekly newspaper Das Reich for the first time In 1942 Goebbels took part in the Wannsee Conference He was one of the Nazi leaders who planned the Final Solution to kill all the Jewish people In 1943 he gave a well known speech in the Berlin Sportpalast where he called the Germans to support total war The coup on 20 July 1944 failed because of Goebbels quick thinking He broadcast on radio that the coup had failed before the plan of Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg could succeed

On 22 April 1945 two days after Adolf Hitlers birthday he arrived in the Fhrerbunker in Berlin He was one of the witnesses to the marriage of Hitler to Eva Braun On the same day Hitler made him his broken wikt linksuccessorsuccessor After Hitlers suicide on 30 April he became the Chancellor of Germany He only held this job for one day because on 1 May 1945 his wife poisoned their six children with the help of an SS doctor Immediately afterward he and his wife were shot dead by an SS officer

Carl Maria von Weber 5 June 1826 in London was one of the most important German composers of the early Romantic period  He wrote many operas of which Der Freischtz Euryanthe and Oberon are especially famous He wrote instrumental music especially for the clarinet and wrote very well for orchestra

Weber was the eldest of the three children of Franz Anton von Weber The word von in front of a German surname normally means that the family had noble ancestry but the Weber family do not appear to be of noble blood Weber was never a strong healthy child He had a damaged hip bone and always walked with a limp His father worked in the theatre and the family often moved from one town to another This was difficult for his education His mother was called Rosa she influenced him to go to military school at the age of 20 but his love for music meant that he would go to Cranbrook in Germany His daughter Laurel was well known for playing the viola in many Orchestras

Webers mother died of tuberculosis when he was eleven Later that year Weber went to Salzburg to study with Michael Haydn and later to Munich He started to publish some piano music and even composed an opera When he was 14 the family moved to Freiberg in Saxony He had an opera performed there and he started to write articles as a critic in a Leipzig newspaper

In 1801 the family went back to Salzburg and Weber had more lessons from Michael Haydn He also studied in Vienna with a famous musician called Abb Vogler Through him he got to know another of his pupils Giacomo Meyerbeer who became a famous composer and was a close friend of Weber

Success Vogler thought Weber was very talented and helped him to get a job in Breslau Weber had lots of good ideas about how to improve the music there by changing the way that the orchestra sat having more rehearsal time not playing bad pieces of music and pensioning off old singers A lot of people there did not like these ideas and made life difficult for him One night he absent mindedly drank from a wine bottle The bottle had engraving acid inside and it made him ill for two months He was never able to sing again When he tried to go back to work all the good changes he had made had been undone so he resigned He had a job in Karlsruhe for a short time then went briefly back to Breslau but because he owed people money there he disappeared and got a job in Stuttgart

His lifestyle was rather wild and he even got arrested once for debt and fraud However he continued to become well known as a composer and wrote a lot of instrumental and religious music He spent some time in several large cities including Prague and Berlin In Dresden he worked hard to make German Opera a success

Weber was not well He was suffering from tuberculosis but needed money to support his family So when he was invited to go to London to compose and produce his opera Oberon he accepted the offer He had already been having English lessons and learned to speak the language quite well In 1826 he travelled to England where he finished composing Oberon and conducted its first performance on 12 April He stayed on in England to earn some more money He was looking forward to going home but on 5 June the night before he was due to go back to Germany he died He was buried in London 18 years later Richard Wagner arranged for Webers body to be brought back to Germany to be buried in Dresden 

Weber left an opera Die Drei Pintos unfinished Meyerbeer was going to finish it but in the end it was Gustav Mahler who finished it and conducted the first performance of the completed work in Leipzig in 1888

His music  Weber was not only a great composer but a very skilled pianist and conductor He wrote a very large number of works including cantatas and songs but most of these are not often heard today One of his most popular works is called Invitation to the Dance It was written for piano but later Hector Berlioz arranged it for orchestra and this is how it is often heard nowadays 

Weber wrote two Concertos for clarinet and orchestra and also a Concertino Another one movement concerto was the Konzertstck in F minor for piano and orchestra His opera Der Freischtz is probably his best work and the overture is often heard separately as a concert piece The story of the opera is full of magic It is written in German and has some spoken words as well as sung music This opera in particular influenced Richard Wagner who developed German opera in the 19th century

A turbine is an engine that turns fluid into energy 

Simple turbines have a shaft with a blade on it Moving fluids such as water or air push the blades so that they turn around with the shaft The turning movement can be used to make energy Early turbine examples are windmills and water wheels Turbine blades can also be turned to move a fluid This is how simple propeller airplanes work

A casing can be placed around the turbine to control the movement of the fluid

Hydraulic head is a specific measurement of water pressure or total energy per unit weight above a datum 

It is usually measured as a water surface elevation expressed in units of length but represents the energy at the entrance of a piezometer In an aquifer it can be calculated from the depth to water in a piezometric well and given information of the piezometers elevation and screen depth 

Even though it is conventional to use gauge pressure in the calculation of hydraulic head it is more correct to use total pressure since this is truly what drives groundwater flow Often detailed observations of barometric pressure are not available at each well through time so this is often disregarded

Biological warfare is when pathogens are used as a weapon This is called a biological weapon Pathogens are organisms that can cause disease If non living things are used this is considered to be chemical warfare 

Biological warfare has been used throughout history The first form of biological warfare may have been when the plague hit the Mongols During battle they were said to have thrown plague victims bodies at their enemies Before the 20th century it took some of the following forms

During the Second Sino Japanese War biological weapons were used by the Japanese army against China The Japanese army usually launched contaminated fleas or food from planes

Today pathogens for diseases like anthrax or smallpox could be used as agents for biological weapons

The production and stockpiling of such weapons was forbidden in the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972

A Bikini is a type of swimsuit for women It consists of two parts pants and a bra top leaving an uncovered area between the two The bikini is an ancient invention reinvented after the Second World War 

The bikini is perhaps the most popular female beachwear around the globe 

By the mid 2000s bikinis had become a US811 million business annually according to the NPD Group a consumer and retail information company The bikini has boosted spin off services like bikini waxing and the sun tanning industries

Predecessors of the bikini date back to antiquity in atalhyk and the Greco Roman world Artwork dating back to the Diocletian period in Villa Romana del Casale Sicily depicts women in garments resembling bikinis in mosaics on the floor The images of ten women dubbed the Bikini Girls exercising in clothing that would pass as bikinis today are the most replicated mosaic among the 37 million colored tiles at the site Archeological finds especially in Pompeii show the Roman goddess Venus wearing a bikini A statue of Venus in a bikini was found in a cupboard in the southwest corner in Casa della Venere others were found in the front hall 

By the early 1940s two piece swimsuits were frequent on American beaches Hollywood stars like Ava Gardner Rita Hayworth and Lana Turner tried similar swimwear or beachwear 

Finally the modern bikini was introduced by French engineer Louis Rard and fashion designer Jacques Heim in Paris in 1946 Rard was a car engineer but by 1946 he was running his mothers lingerie boutique near Les Folies Bergres in Paris Heim was working on a new kind of beach costume It comprised two pieces the bottom large enough to cover its wearers navel Rard named his swimsuit the bikini taking the name from the Bikini Atoll one of a series of islands in the South Pacific where testing on the new atomic bomb was occurring that summer Rard could not find a model to wear his design He ended up hiring Micheline Bernardini a nude dancer from the Casino de Paris That bikini a string bikini with a g string back of convert30sqincm20 of cloth with newspaper type printed across was introduced on July 5 at Piscine Molitor a public pool in Paris Heims design was the first worn on the beach but the clothing was given its name by Rard

Jimi Hendrix was born in Seattle on November 27 1942 He was called Johnny Allen Hendrix when he was born Later his parents named him James Marshall Hendrix instead He grew up without much money or attention his parents divorced when he was nine years old and his mother died when he was 16 At about the age of 14 Hendrix found his first guitar It was a broken broomstick with one string that had been thrown away by another boy He still managed to play several tunes on it Soon after at around 15 he managed to buy a proper acoustic guitar for 5 from a friend of his fathers His first electric guitar was a white Supro Ozark that his father Al Hendrix had bought him He did not have lessons and learned basic tunes and improvisation from watching Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley play live He played without an amplifier

Hendrix finished middle school but did not graduate from his high school Garfield High School Hendrix told some reporters in the late 1960s that he had failed because people were racist there and did not like him because he was black Others claim it was just because he could not get good enough grades and was unorganized Hendrix later told the reporters that he was thrown out for being impolite to a teacher

When Hendrix was young he was a fan of Elvis Presley He went to see Presley play at Sicks Stadium on September 1 1957 and he drew a color picture of him holding an acoustic guitar The original drawing can be seen in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland Ohio Even as an adult he still loved Presley He went to a see a Presley movie King Creole in Paris in late 1968 to give him inspiration to write songs He also liked famous blues musicians such as Muddy Waters Bo Diddley and Lightning Hopkins and he played in the band of RB star Little Richard However Hendrix and Richard did not get along Richard did not like Hendrixs clothes his being late and him showing off on stage

After getting in trouble for stealing cars twice Hendrix had to choose between going to prison for two years or joining the US Army Hendrix chose the army and on May 31 1961 was sent to Fort Campbell Kentucky While in the army his officers said that he was often caught sleeping on duty and needed to be watched at all times He could not use a gun well and an officer said that his mind apparently cannot function cannot work properly while performing duties and thinking about his guitar However his time in the army was important for Hendrix because it was there that he met another soldier and bass guitar player called Billy Cochs They would later play together in a small group called The King Kasuals

On May 31 1962 Hendrixs officers thought it would be best for him to leave the army because he caused too much trouble Hendrix agreed and he left after only a year of service Hendrix later said he had been let go from the army after breaking his ankle when he was landing his 26th parachute jump He also spoke about his time in the army in interviews for a magazine Melody Maker in 1967 and 1969 He said that he did not like serving the army and did not agree with their ways of doing things When he was interviewed in America Hendrix never talked about his time in the army When it was brought up in a television interview Hendrix only said that he had been based at Fort Campbell

Hendrixs left handed playing on a guitar made for right handed people made him popular His first proper concert was with a small band without a name playing in a Synagogue He later joined a band called The Velvetones

After leaving the army Hendrix and Cox moved to Clarksville in Tennessee where they played in their group The King Kasuals They played in small bars but they did not make much money So eventually he and Cox moved to Nashville They played many blues style songs in Nashville In November 1962 Hendrix went to his first studio performance While in Nashville Hendrix played in many other bands as rhythm and lead guitarist and vocals This did not get him much money but did give him experience of how bands worked

Later Hendrix left Nashville and went to Northern New York City By January 1964 he moved to Harlem where he played at bars and clubs for money Hendrix also won first prize in an amateur guitar contest at The Apollo Theatre In 1966 Hendrix formed his own band called Jimmy James and The Blues Flames The members were people that he met around town One of them was a 15 year old boy called Randy Hendrix played many gigs around New York City and many songs at a cafe called Caf Wha In 1966 Hendrix became friends with the girlfriend of Keith Richards guitarist for The Rolling Stones Linda Keith She liked his music and introduced him to Chas Chandler the manager for The Animals Chandler told Hendrix to write a rock version of the song Hey Joe and when he did Chandler brought him to London to sign a contract with him Hendrix had to make a new band It was called The Jimi Hendrix Experience a name found by their business manager Mike Jeffery

The Jimi Hendrix Experience made its first album in 1967 It was called Are You Experienced When the album was being produced and sold Hendrix travelled around the UK and some of Europe On June 4 1967 The Jimi Hendrix Experience played their last concert in London before going to America In America many famous people came to see Hendrix play including Paul McCartney George Harrison Eric Clapton Jack Bruce and Brian Epstein

The album reached number two in the UK charts In 2001 VH1 named Are You Experienced as the fifth greatest album of all time Rolling Stone magazine put it at number 15 on a list of the 500 greatest albums of all time in 2003

Hendrix second album came out in 1967 It was called Axis Bold as Love It had famous songs in it most famous being Little Wing There have been several other versions of the song by other musicians like Stevie Ray Vaughan Henry Hank Marrion Metallica Eric Clapton Sting and Pearl Jam An important difference in the album from other albums he made was that Hendrix tuned his guitar down a semi tone The album reached number three in the US charts and number five in the UK charts

The album almost did not sell since Hendrix lost the master tape of side one of the LP in the back of a taxi in London Hendrix Chas Chandler and an engineer called Eddie Kramer had to re mix the songs in one night They could not get the song If 6 was 9 right but Hendrixs bassist Noel Redding had a copy of it on tape When the album was released Hendrix was disappointed that the album was finished so quickly and he thought it could have been done better

Hendrix finished his third album called Electric LadyLand  a double album with two LPs  in 1968 In this year Chas Chandler decided to leave Hendrix and so did Noel Redding When Chandler left Hendrix changed everything in his music He began using different musicians and instruments He used guitars with flutes and trombones all with distortion to get strange sounds The album reached number one in the US It reached number five in the UK In 2003 VH1 named the album the 72nd best album of all time and the Rolling Stones magazine gave it 54th greatest album of all time

Hendrix went to play at Woodstock on August 18 1969 That year Woodstock made over 18000 and has since become one of the most famous concerts in the world Hendrix was told to play on Sunday evening but did not arrive until Monday morning which was unfortunate because of the 500000 people that had paid to see him around 180000 were left and did not plan on staying his whole concert they just wanted to see him in person for a few minutes Hendrix then went on to play a two hour concert that was described as awful Hendrixs large band had not practiced enough and could not keep up with Hendrixs fast guitar playing But to make up for all of this Hendrix played a version of Star Spangled Banner He played this anthem with heavy distortion and screams from his guitar and people thought that he was being anti American and making fun of their anthem and country Hendrix in an interview said that he did not intend for his performance to be a political statement he just wanted it to be another version of the national anthem

On September 18 1970 Hendrix was found dead in a basement of the Samarkand Hotel in London He died after drinking too much and then taking too many sleeping pills He vomited and choked on his vomit because he could not regain consciousness There are many different theories that were thought up His girlfriend who was with him at the time that he died said that he was alive when she put him in the back of the ambulance but hospital records say that Hendrix had been dead for some time before the ambulance had reached him Some people say that Hendrix was alive but that the paramedics did not properly hold his head while he was unconscious so he choked on his own vomit A sad poem that was found in Hendrix apartment written by him made some think that he committed suicide The most likely explanation is that Hendrix just took too many sleeping pills while he was drunk and then could not wake up as he vomited and choked as a result There has been recent speculation that he may have been murdered by his manager

Hendrix was buried in Renton Washington in Greenwood Memorial Park on October 1 1970 His headstone was wrong because it shows a picture of Hendrix playing a Stratocaster but the Stratocaster is right handed Hendrix played left handed Because Hendrix had so many fans people were worried that the crowds of people wanting to look at his grave would damage other graves so Hendrix father Al Hendrix had another memorial site built far from other graves The memorial is a granite dome architecture held up by three pillars and Hendrix is buried underneath His autograph is at the foot of each pillar and a brass sundial is at the top of the dome There is also a memorial statue of Hendrix playing a Stratocaster on the corner of Broadway and Pine in Seattle

Hendrix had unique fashion and a Bob Dylan style haircut He wore scarves rings and brooches In his early career he wore a dark suit with a silk shirt Later he wore bright blue velvet suits red suits and flared trousers In 1967 he started to wear a cowboy style hat he called The Westerner 

In 1968 Hendrix started tying scarves to his legs and arms In 1969 he wore his famous bandana

Hendrix used drugs like LSD to get hallucinations He also smoked marijuana and drank alcohol Hendrix would become angry and violent when he was drunk

However no one knows if Hendrix took heroin or not At his autopsy there was no heroin in his body and he had no needle marks on his body

Incendiary devices or incendiary bombs are bombs These bombs have been designed to start a fire Sometimes they are also called firebombs They were used very frequently in World War II Materials such as Napalm White phosphorus thermite chlorine trifluoride are often employed in such bombs A very crude such bomb is the Molotov cocktail 

The United States still uses such bombs called Mark 77 bomb They were used during the invasion of Iraq in 2003 Most other countries no longer use them since they are banned by Section III of the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons This treaty was ratified in 1980

Napalm is the name for a number of flammable liquids that have been used in warfare Often it is jellied gasoline Napalm is actually the thickener in such liquids When it is mixed with gasoline the thickener makes a sticky incendiary gel It was developed by the US in World War II by a team of Harvard chemists The team leader was Louis Fieser The name napalm has comes from the ingredients that were first used to make it Coprecipitated aluminum salts of naphthenic and palmitic acids These were added to the flammable substance to cause it to gel

One of the major problems of early incendiary fluids was that they splashed and drained too easily The US found that flamethrowers that use a gasoline gel are able to shoot farther and are more useful Gasoline gel was difficult to manufacture because it used natural rubber which was in high demand and expensive Napalm provided a far cheaper alternative It solved the problems involved with rubber based incendiaries

Nowadays napalm is mostly made of benzene and polystyrene and is known as napalm B

Napalm was used in flamethrowers and bombs by the US and Allied forces to increase the usefulness of flammable liquids Napalm is made to burn at a specific rate and stick to materials This is done by mixing different of amounts of napalm and other materials Another useful effect primarily involving its use in bombs was that napalm rapidly deoxygenates the available air It also creates large amounts of carbon monoxide causing suffocation Napalm bombs were also used in the Vietnam War to clear landing zones for helicopters

Though napalm was a 20th century invention it is part of a long history of incendiary materials in warfare However historically it was primarily liquids that were used An infantry based flammable liquid fuel weapon the flamethrower was introduced in World War I by the Germans variations of which were soon developed by other sides in the conflict

On July 17 1944 napalm incendiary bombs were dropped for the first time by American P 38 pilots on a fuel depot at Coutances near St L France Napalm bombs were first used in the Pacific Theatre during the Battle of Tinian by Marine aviator Its use was complicated because of problems with mixing fusing and the release mechanisms In World War II Allied forces bombed cities in Japan with napalm and used it in bombs and flamethrowers in Germany and the Japanese held islands It was used by the Greek army against communist guerrilla fighters during the Greek Civil War by United Nations forces in Korea by Mexico in the late 1960s against guerrilla fighters in Guerrero and by the United States during the Vietnam War

The most well known method of delivering napalm is from air dropped incendiary bombs A lesser known method is the flame throwers used by combat infantry Flame throwers use a thinner version of the same jellied gasoline to destroy gun emplacements bunkers and cave hideouts US Marines fighting on Guadalcanal found them very effective against Japanese positions The Marines used fire as both a casualty weapon as well as a psychological weapon Men have a natural fear of fire They found that Japanese soldiers would abandon positions in which they fought to the death against other weapons Prisoners of war confirmed that they feared napalm more than any other weapon thrown at them

Napalm became one of the preferred weapons of the Korean War Pilots returning from the war zone often remarked they would rather have a couple of gasoline tanks full of napalm to drop than any other weapon bombs rockets or guns The US Air Force and Navy used napalm with great effect against all manner of targets to include troops tanks buildings and even rail road tunnels The demoralizing effect napalm had on the enemy became apparent when scores of North Korean troops began to surrender to aircraft flying overhead Pilots noted that they saw surviving enemy troops waving white flags on subsequent passes after dropping napalm The pilots radioed to ground troops and the North Koreans were captured 

Napalm has been used recently in wartime by or against Iran Israel Nigeria Brazil Egypt Cyprus Argentina Iraq Serbia Turkey Angola United States

In some cases napalm disables and kills its victims very quickly Those who do survive suffer up to 5th degree burns These damage parts of the skin which do not have pain receptors However victims who suffer 2nd degree burns from splashed napalm will be in significant amounts of pain

Philip Jones Griffiths describes its use in Vietnam

Phuc had third degree burns to half her body and was not expected to live But thanks to assistance from South Vietnamese photographer Nick Ut and after surviving a 14 month hospital stay and 17 operations she became an outspoken peace activist

International law does not prohibit the use of napalm or other incendiaries against military targets but use against civilian populations was banned by the United Nations inhumane weapons convention in 1981 Protocol III of the CCW restricts the use of incendiary weapons but a number of states have not acceded to all of the protocols of the CCW According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute states are considered a party to the convention which entered into force as international law in December 1983 if they ratify at least two of the five protocols The United States for example is a party to the CCW but did not sign Protocol III

Reports by the Sydney Morning Herald suggested that napalm has been used in the Iraq War by US forces The US Department of Defense denied this In August 2003 the San Diego Union Tribune said that US Marine pilots and their commanders confirmed the use of Mark 77 firebombs on Iraqi Republican Guards during the start of combat Official denials of the use of napalm were however disingenuous as the Mk 77 bomb that is currently in service at this time the Mk 77 Mod 5 does not use actual napalm The last US bomb to use actual napalm was the Mark 77 Mod 4 the last of which were destroyed in March 2001 The substance used now is a different incendiary mixture It is sufficiently analogous in its effects that it is still a controversial incendiary and can still be referred to colloquially as napalm 

We napalmed both those approaches said Col Randolph Alles in a recent interview Unfortunately there were people there because you could see them in the video They were Iraqi soldiers there Its no great way to die he added The generals love napalm It has a big psychological effect  San Diego Union Tribune August 2003

These bombs did not actually have napalm in them The napalm B used in Vietnam was gasoline based The Mk 77 firebombs used in the Gulf were kerosene based It is however a napalm like liquid in its effect

Recipes how to make napalm like substances can be found on the Internet Very often the recipes say that they will make a thick substance using gasoline with soap or polystyrene as a thickening agent However inexperienced people following these instructions often handle the substance improperly and cause accidents In addition making incendiary devices is illegal in many countries

Napalm is usually a mixture of gasoline with suitable thickening agents The earliest thickeners were soaps aluminum and magnesium palmitates and stearates Depending on how much thickener is added the resulting viscosity may range between syrupy liquid and thick rubbery gel The content of long hydrocarbon chains makes the material highly hydrophobic making it more difficult to extinguish Thickened fuel also rebounds better from surfaces making it more useful for operations in urban terrain

There are two types of napalm oil based with aluminium soap thickener and oil based with polymeric thickener

The United States military uses three kinds of thickeners M1 M2 and M4

A later variant napalm B also called super napalm is a mixture of low octane gasoline with benzene and polystyrene It was used in the Vietnam War Unlike conventional napalm which burns for only 1530 seconds napalm B burns for up to 10 minutes with fewer fireballs It also sticks better to surfaces and offers improved destruction effects It is not as easy to ignite This reduces the number of accidents caused by soldiers smoking When it burns it develops a characteristic smell

Starting in the early 1990s various websites including The Anarchist Cookbook advertised recipes for homemade napalm These recipes were predominantly equal parts gasoline and styrofoam This mixture closely resembles that of napalm B but lacks a percentage of benzene

Napalm reaches burning temperatures of approximately 1200 C Other additives can be added eg powdered aluminium or magnesium or white phosphorus

In the early 1950s Norway developed its own napalm based on fatty acids in whale oil The reason for this development was that the American produced thickening agent performed rather poorly in the cold Norwegian climate The product was known as Northick II

Napalm itself became well known by the American public after its use in the Vietnam war Since then it has been mentioned in the media and arts multiple times This summary is not meant to be all inclusive

The Midwestern United States is a name for the north central states of the United States of America The states that are part of the Midwest are Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Michigan Minnesota Missouri Nebraska North Dakota Ohio South Dakota Wisconsin and Eastern Colorado 

The word Midwest has been in common use for over 100 years Other names for the area are no longer used These names include the Northwest or Old Northwest Mid America or the Heartland Since 1929 sociologists have often used the Midwest as typical of the entire nation

The land in the Midwest is generally thought of as being flat This is true of several areas in the Midwest but there are parts that are not flat For example the eastern Midwest near the Appalachian Mountains the Great Lakes basin and northern parts of Wisconsin Minnesota and Iowa are not flat Also the northern part of the Ozark mountain range is in southern Missouri Prairies cover most of the states west of the Mississippi River Less rain falls in the western Midwest than in the eastern part This causes different types of prairies Most of the Midwest can now be called either urban areas or agricultural areas Areas in northern Minnesota Michigan and Wisconsin and the Ohio River valley are not very developed

Chicago is the largest city in the region followed by Detroit and Indianapolis Some other important cities in the region are Minneapolis St Paul Cleveland St Louis Kansas City Milwaukee Cincinnati Columbus Wichita Des Moines Madison and Omaha

Europeans began to settle the area in the 17th century French explorers and settlers created a network of fur trading posts along the Mississippi River and the upper Great Lakes French control of the area ended in 1763 after the French and Indian War British colonists began to expand into the Ohio Country during the 1750s The Royal Proclamation of 1763 restricted people from moving west of the Appalachian Mountains but it did not stop them completely

Early settlers came to the Midwest from eastern states through routes over the Appalachian Mountains or through the waterways of the Great Lakes After the American Revolutionary War many more settlers began to come from eastern states In the 1790s people moved there because the United States government was offering land grants

By the time of the American Civil War many European immigrants were settling in the Midwest instead of the East German Lutherans and Jews settled in Ohio Wisconsin Illinois and eastern Missouri Swedes and Norwegians in Wisconsin Minnesota and northern Iowa Poles Hungarians and German Catholics and Jews founded or settled in Midwestern cities Many German Catholics also settled throughout the Ohio River valley and around the Great Lakes

The regions soil is very good for farming Midwest farmers can produce lots of grain crops such as corn oats and most importantly wheat In the early days the region was soon known as the nations breadbasket

Midwesterners are sometimes viewed as open friendly and straightforward or sometimes broken wikt linkstereotypestereotyped as stubborn and uncultured Midwest values were shaped by religious beliefs and the agricultural values from the people who settled in the area The Midwest today is a mix of Protestantism and Calvinism untrusting of authority and power factdateApril 2009

Between 19 and 29 of the Midwest is Catholic 14 of the people in Ohio Indiana and Michigan 22 in Missouri and 5 in Minnesota are Baptists 22 24 of people in Wisconsin and Minnesota are Lutherans 1 or less of the people in the Midwest are Jewish and Muslim with slightly more Jewish or Muslim people in major cities such as Chicago and Cleveland 16 of the Midwest do not have a religion

Politics in the Midwest are often conservative The Great Lakes area which has more large cities than the rest of the Midwest tends to be the most liberal area of the Midwest 

Because of 20th century African American migration from the South many African Americans live in most of the areas large cities However there are still more African Americans living in the Southern United States than in the Midwest The mix of industry and cultures in those cities led to new types of music in the 20th century in the Midwest including jazz blues rock and roll Techno music came from Detroit and house music and blues came from Chicago 

Today the population of the Midwest is 65971974 or 222 of the total population of the United States

The accents of the Midwest are often clearly different from the accents of the South and many urban areas of the American Northeast The accent of most of the Midwest is thought by many to be standard American English Many national radio and television shows in the US like this accent more than many other accents This may have started because many television show hosts such as Walter Cronkite Johnny Carson David Letterman Tom Brokaw and Casey Kasem came from this area 

In some parts of the Midwest the accents are quite different from the neutral accent of the rest of the Midwest These accents usually are because of the broken wikt linkheritageheritage of the area For example Minnesota western Wisconsin and Michigans Upper Peninsula have strong Scandinavian accents which get stronger the farther north one goes Many parts of Michigan have Dutch flavored accents Also people from Chicago are known to have their own broken wikt linknasalnasal accent The same is true of St LouisIn the most southern parts of the Midwest such as southern Indiana Southern accents are common in addition to the standard Midwest accent The same can be said of Southern Illinois particularly below US Highway 50 and south of St Louis Missouri is also an example of a Midwest state with southern culture Missourians can have either a southern or Midwestern accent or a combined dialect but accents tend to be distinctly Southern in the Southeastern and Bootheel sections of the state

White phosphorus is an incendiary weapon It makes a bright light and smoke Its main ingredient is one of the allotropes of the chemical element phosphorus White phosphorus is toxic to humans It can burn deep into soft tissue it can be breathed in or it can be ingested Over time these can cause death

The use of incendiary weapons against civilians is forbidden since 1949 Were used by US forces in Iraq in 2004 White Phosphorous was also used in the Israeli invasion of Gaza during December 2008 through January 2009 These actions were supported by the US government 

 

Mothballs are small balls of chemical pesticide and deodorantThey are used when clothing and other articles susceptible to damage from mold or moth larvae are stored Older mothballs were made primarily of naphthalene Because naphthalene can catch fire easily modern mothballs use 14 dichlorobenzene instead Both of these ingredients have a strong pungent smell often associated strongly with mothballs Camphor an insect repellent can also be used in mothballs

Their use when clothing is stored out of season led to the colloquial usage of the terms mothballed and put into mothballs to refer to anything which is put into storage or whose operation is suspended Some claim that the use of the word in this sense derives from naval usage When warships were laid up the open ends of their gun barrels and other openings were covered in white material to prevent the entry of water These white circles suggested mothballs

Anarcho capitalism is a libertarian and anarchist philosophy that is against the idea of political government and for economic government through free market capitalism by means of the natural law of supply and demand

Anarcho capitalists think that people can protect themselves without any political government Instead of putting a stop to intrusion with politics and bureaucracy people naturally want to protect themselves and their things so they agree to pay other people such as arbitrators insurers and private security companies to protect them through the marketplace Anarcho capitalists say that the government is a thief because it takes taxes away from people against their will and keeps them from making agreements between themselves

Walther von der Vogelweide was a famous German poet and composer He was the greatest of the German Minnesinger These were people who wrote and sang songs about courtly love Walther himself may have added von der Vogelweide to his name

The German courtly love songs that had been written at the time were all very similar but Walther gave these songs new life and made them very beautiful Unfortunately we do not know any of his music because he did not write it down But he wrote his poems down They are very original sometimes humorous sometimes serious often just gently suggesting ideas carefully

We do not know where Walther was born but he wrote in a document that he had learned to sing and write poetry in Austria The dialect he spoke shows that he must have come from Bavaria or Austria He spent some time at the court of Duke Leopold V of Babenberg in Vienna This was about 1190 He took part in public singing contests and had long discussions with other people about love and the way it should be written about in poetry

In about 1198 he left Vienna and spent many years travelling around visiting courts in Europe entertaining dukes and princes and singing his songs He always wrote the words himself he never used other poets words That would have made him a simple Spielmann but Walther was of noble birth He often spent several weeks or months in a castle where he entertained people and where he probably also fell in love with one of the ladies He wrote about these love affairs in his poetry

Walther also wrote verses called Sprche These were about the history of the time They were a kind of political propaganda and were used in political debates Walther supported Emperor Otto IV in his arguments against the pope persuading the emperor to go on the crusade which the pope had forbidden We do not know whether Walther went with him on the crusade

By this time Walther had became very famous not just as a poet and musician but as a kind of political adviser Walther was the first poet to write national and patriotic poetry He also wrote a type of love poem which was new in German literature Unter der Linde is the most famous of these Here are the first two verses

Striptease is an art some people practice Striptease is about undressing in an erotic way This is usually done before an audience Very often it is done in night clubs The art of it is the broken wikt linkteaseteasing It is about sexually arousing the audience The teasing is usually done by delaying to take something off It can also be done by hiding certain parts of the body with hands or pieces of clothing While undressing the person doing the striptease also dances around Sometimes plays are arranged the strippers are disguised as Arabic dancers Salome Lolita or other well known people The spectator sometimes identifies with the stripper Erotic dreams and exhibitionist fantasies are projected into the striptease A naked body can never fulfill these projections 

Today most striptease dancers are women

There are different possibilities how striptease could have started One of them is that the erotic dance Salome did for Herodes was in fact a striptease But neither Salome nor her dancing are mentioned in the Bible Therefore this can only be seen as a try to give striptease a history

Lydia Thompson and the British Blondes were the first to no longer use long robes but rather tight stockings and skirts In 1868 they showed what had been hidden until then The legs of a woman Another sensation came from Paris at that time A dance called Cancan This dance was seen as very wild even as an obscenity 

The first professionally done striptease dance was done in 1894 in Paris It resulted in a fine for the dancer 

Starting in 1905 a lady calling herself Mata Hari entered the scene On the invitation of Emile Guimet she danced before a carefully chosen audience The scene at the end of the show where she was nakedbecame a sensation Similar performances at the requests of Baron von Rothschild Ccile Sorel Gaston Menier and Natalie Clifford Barney followed Mata Hari had never learned how to dance and had never studied Indian and oriental dancing Her dances were a product of her imagination In 1917 Mata Hari was charged with espionage and sentenced to death She was shot on October 151917 in Vincennes near Paris 

Many women danced as Salome at the end of the 19th century Salome was taken as a pretext to be able to show off the female body Many of these dancers undressed but some kept their clothes on 

In the 1920s Anita Berber became known in Berlin because of her dances Anita Berber was a dancer and performing artist Most of her dances she did in the nude Many of her performances provoked tumultous scenes In practically no time she was well known but already had an image laden with scandal 

After the war in the 1950s striptease became the motor of an emerging sex industry Paris saw the opening of the high society strip clubs like the Alcazar or the Crazy Horse 

In modern times the art of it gets lost more and more In the 1990s a German private TV channel made a strip show called Tutti Frutti Since then during the night many private TV stations have women who try to get rid of their clothes while they advertise some phone sex numbers 

There is also a film called Striptease It plays in US strip clubs without giving much background information

Originally striptease was only done by women They wanted to seduce male voyeurs Today a very small number of male strippers are there Among the most notable of them are the Chippendales

Electrical energy can refer to several closely related things It can mean

In any of these cases the SI unit of electrical energy is the joule The unit used by many electrical utility companies is the watt hour which is the amount of energy used by a one watt load such as a tiny light bulb drawing power for one hour The kilowatt hour which is 1000 times larger than a watt hour is a useful size for measuring the energy use of households and small businesses and also for the production of energy by small power plants A typical household uses several hundred kilowatt hours per month The megawatt hour which is 1000 times larger than the kilowatt hour is used for measuring the energy output of large power plants 

The terms electrical energy and electric power are frequently used interchangeably However in physics and electrical engineering energy and power have different meanings Power is energy per unit time The SI unit of power and electricity is the watt One watt is a joule per second In other words the phrases flow of power and consume a quantity of electric power are both incorrect and should be changed to flow of energy and consume a quantity of electrical energy

In physics power is the rate at which work is performed or energy is transferred In the SI system of measurement power is measured in watts 

It may take a certain amount of work to effect a change in the world like lifting a heavy weight to a higher level It makes no difference if the weight is lifted slowly or quickly the same amount of work will have been performed The difference between a slow lift and a quick lift is that a quick lift requires more Power That is the work can be done in a shorter time if there is more power available

where

Power is also equal to force times velocity

In optics or radiometry the term power sometimes refers to radiant flux the average rate of energy transport by electromagnetic radiation measured in watts But the term power is also used to express the ability of a lens or other optical device to focus light It is measured in dioptres and is equal to one over the focal length of the optical device

This is a list of the Emperors of the late Eastern Roman Empire called Byzantine by modern historians This list does not include many of the emperors that rules with someone else

The title of all Emperors before Heraclius was Augustus but other titles such as Dominus were also used After Heraclius the title was changed to the Greek Basileus This title used to mean king sovereign but now was used in place of Augustus The emperors of the 15th century called themselves Basileus ton Hellinon but they were still Roman Emperors

This list begins with Constantine I the Great the first Christian emperor reigning from Constantinople 

At around this time the emperors began using the title   that is King of Kings ruling over Kings

In 1453 Mehmed II overthrew the Byzantine Empire and claimed the title of Kaisar his successors continued this claim See Ottomans for the complete list of Ottoman sultans

A tide is the periodic rising and falling of Earths ocean surface caused by the tidal forces and the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans Tides cause changes in the depth of marine and estuarine waters Tides also make broken wikt linkoscillateoscillating currents known as tidal streams This means that being able to predict the tide is important for coastal navigation The strip of seashore that is under water at high tide and exposed at low tide called the intertidal zone is an important ecological product of ocean tides

Tidal force is caused by gravity and makes tides happen This is because the gravitational field changes across the middle of a body 

Tidal energy sometimes called tidal power is the power achieved by capturing the energy contained in moving water in tides and open ocean currents 

There are two types of energy systems that can be used to extracted energy kinetic energy the moving water of rivers tides and open ocean currents and potential energy from the difference in height between high and low tides The first method  generating energy from tidal currents  is becoming more and more popular because people believe that it does not harm the environment as much as barrages or dams Many coastal sites worldwide are being examined for their suitability to produce tidal energy

Tidal power is classified as a renewable energy source because tides are caused by the orbital mechanics of the solar system and are considered inexhaustible The root source of the energy is the orbital kinetic energy of the earth moon system and also the earth sun system Tidal power has great potential for future power and electricity generation because of the essentially inexhaustible amount of energy contained in these rotational systems Tidal power is reliably predictable In Europe Tide Mills have been used for nearly 1000 years mainly for grinding grains

Courtly love was a special idea of love that people had in Europe in the Middle Ages The word court in this sense means the courts where princes or dukes lived Courtly love is usually when a young man who may be a knight or even a simple musician falls in love with a rich lady and tries to make himself broken wikt link worthyworthy of her by doing brave things or by singing beautiful love songs

The idea of courtly love can be found in a lot of literature of that time eg in works by Geoffrey Chaucer Dante Gottfried von Strassburg Walther von der Vogelweide Wolfram von Eschenbach Malory and William Shakespeare 

A royal court or noble court is a place where an important ruler such as a king prince or duke live The building is often called a palace but the royal court means not just the buildings but all the royal household

It is called a court because in early times the palace would have a court at the front

In history there were great rulers who held important courts eg Charlemagne

A famous example is Hampton Court on the river Thames in London where Henry VIII had his court Today the Queen holds court at Buckingham Palace

People who work at court are court officials

Chris Gueffroy was the last person to die while trying to escape across the Berlin Wall

Gueffroy and his friend Christian Gaudian tried to escape from East Berlin to West Berlin on the night of 5 to 6 February 1989 They tried to cross near the Britz district canal

Gueffroy and Gaudian thought that the Schiebefehl the order to shoot anyone who attempted to cross the wall had been stopped Climbing the last metal fence the two were seen and shot at by the National Peoples Army border troops Gueffroy was hit in the chest by ten shots and died in the border strip

Gaudian was badly injured and was arrested and was sentenced on 24 May 1989 to imprisonment for three years by the Pankow district court for trying illegally to cross the border

In September 1989 Gaudian was freed on bail by the East German government and on 17 October 1989 he was transferred to West Berlin

The four border guards at first got an award from the chief of the local border guards Erich Wllner and a prize of 150 East German Marks each After the reunification of East and West Germany they were prosecuted by Berlin regional court Two of them were released in January 1992 Ingo Heinrich who fired the shot that killed Gueffroey was sentenced to three and a half years in jail The Bundesgerichtshof reduced the penalty to a suspended sentence of two years in 1994

In 2000 two SED officials Siegfried Lorenz and Hans Joachim Bhme were tried for the death of Gueffroy and two other young men but acquitted as the judge could find no evidence that they might have been able to lift the shoot to kill order The case was retried on 7 August 2004 and the two men were found guilty and given suspended sentences of 15 months each The judge explained that the short sentences were due to the length of time since the events This was the last case concerning deaths on the inner German border

On 21 June 2003 which would have been his 35th birthday a monument to Gueffroy was built on the banks of the Britz district canal The monument was designed by Berlin artist Karl Biedermann

Electricity generation is the making of electricity for use by people

Making electricity in one central place became possible with the use of power transformers which could change voltage Electricity could be sent as alternating current along electric power lines for great distances cheaply

Electricity has been generated for powering human technologies for at least 120 years Different sources of energy have been used to run generators including coal nuclear natural gas hydroelectric and petroleum power and a small amount from solar energy tidal harnesses wind generators and geothermal sources

The demand for electricity can be met in two different ways The main method is to build large centralized projects to generate and transmit the electricity required Many of these projects have caused unpleasant environmental effects such as air or radiation pollution and the flooding of large areas of land

Distributed generation creates power on a smaller scale at locations on the electricity network These sites often generate electricity as a byproduct of other industry such as using gas from landfills to power turbines

Rotating turbines attached to electrical generators produce most commercially available electricity Turbines are driven by a fluid which acts as an intermediate energy carrier The fluids typically used are

Combined cycle gas turbine plants are driven by both steam and gas They generate power by burning natural gas in a gas turbine and use residual heat to generate additional electricity from steam These plants offer efficiencies of up to 60

Small electricity generators are often powered by reciprocating engines burning diesel biogas or natural gas Diesel engines are often used for back up generation usually at low voltages Biogas is often combusted where it is produced such as a landfill or wastewater treatment plant with a reciprocating engine or a microturbine which is a small gas turbine

Unlike the solar heat concentrators photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly to electricity Although sunlight is free solar panels cost a lot of money to make and have only a 10 20 conversion efficiency Until recently photovoltaics were most commonly used in remote sites where there is no access to a commercial power grid or as an extra electricity source for individual homes and businesses Recent advances in manufacturing efficiency and photovoltaic technology combined with subsidies driven by environmental concerns have dramatically accelerated the deployment of solar panels Installed solar capacity is growing by 30 per year in several regions including Germany Japan California and New Jersey

If a book or a TV show is about science but its made so its easy for everyone to understand then it is popular science It has popular in its name because its made for the whole population not just for scientists Nature documentaries are examples of popular science

Popular science is non fiction so it is not the same as science fiction

Popular science is also not the same as Science journalism Science journalism is what journalists write to report the newest theories and discoveries made in science but popular science is not always about what is newest

Some famous people who make popular science are Isaac Asimov Jared Diamond Stephen Hawking Bill Nye and Carl Sagan factdateJuly 2010

When scientists write about their work first they write books and periodicals meant for the same kind of scientists to read  scientific literature The purpose of popular science is to show scientific literature in a way that different types of scientists and people who are not scientists will easily understand When people take an idea from scientific literature and change it into popular science important things about that idea are often left out or added in

Scientific literature is made to seem like the ideas in it are not very new and that the writer is not sure the idea is true That way other scientists will agree with the idea more But popular science is made to be like other media so many people will enjoy it In popular science ideas are made to sound like they are new and like scientists all agree with the ideas If scientific literature and popular science are compared there is often a big difference Even if most people agree about the subject there is still a difference

Some popular science is made by people who do not understand the subject well Some is made by people who have a strong bias Some is part science and part pseudoscience It can be hard for someone who is not an expert to tell which works of popular science are misleading

A lullaby is a song which is sung to help a baby or small child go to sleep Composers of classical music often wrote pieces for instruments to play which they called lullaby They also used the French word Bereuse Brahms wrote his famous Wiegenlied originally for a young singer Bertha Faber when she gave birth to her second son

Max Reger was a German composer organist pianist and teacher

Regers father was a schoolteacher who was an amateur musician When he was a boy Max helped his father to rebuild an organ that was going to be thrown away This was the instrument on which he learned to play It was some time before he started proper lessons but by the time he was a teenager he was playing the organ for church services When he was 15 he went to Bayreuth to hear Wagners operas This was the moment when Reger decided he wanted to become a musician

Reger studied music in Munich and Wiesbaden with a famous teacher Hugo Riemann He composed a lot of music especially for the organ His musical style was similar to that of Brahms but he also learned a lot from the music of Bach Mendelssohn and Schumann He liked the symphonic poems of Liszt and these gave him the ideas for writing chorale fantasies for the organ although he never wrote music that tells a story

In 1902 Reger married He and his wife adopted two children In 1907 he became professor of composition at the University of Leipzig He was a very good teacher He became well known abroad He travelled to London where he spent hours in the art galleries Then he bored his friends by talking all the time about the paintings He conducted the orchestra at Meiningen performing works by many composers especially Brahms Bruckner and his own

Reger enjoyed eating and drinking He regularly went to his local caf where he would eat ten large sausages and drink ten glasses of beer His health got bad and he died of a heart attack in Leipzig where he was visiting friends on his way home from the Netherlands

Reger wrote an enormous amount of music but very little of it is played nowadays He wrote in a late Romantic style He is best remembered for his organ music He liked to write fugues and sets of Variations His Fantasy and Fugue on BACH is one of the hardest pieces ever written for organ He wrote a lovely song called Marias Wiegenlied

This category has ideas that are important to helping describe the physical world around us

A rotor is the rotating part of a helicopter which generates lift either vertically in the case of a main rotor or horizontally in the case of a tail rotor

Before the development of powered helicopters in the mid 20th century autogyro pioneer Juan de la Cierva researched and developed many of the basics of the rotor Cierva is credited with successful development of multi bladed fully articulated rotor systems This type of system is widely used today in many multi bladed helicopters

In music variation is a way of organizing a piece of music by taking a tune and then repeating it in several different ways It is often called Theme and Variations

Many composers wrote pieces which are examples of Theme and Variations Sometimes the theme is one they made up at other times they took a theme that another composer had already written and then made variations on it

There are lots of ways of varying a tune and each variation will change it in a different way A variation may play the tune much faster or much slower it may change the tune by adding extra sharps and flats or other ornamental notes or by playing the tune in octaves It may change the harmony or the rhythm or use different instruments It may combine the tune in different parts

Composers have used variations in music for centuries In the Renaissance and Baroque periods composers wrote variations on a short tune in the bass which was repeated again and again This was called a ground bass or sometimes it was a passacaglia or chaconne Renaissance composers also liked writing what they called divisions This meant varying a tune by playing it for example at twice the speed or half the speed etc so that crotchets became minims or quavers

George Frideric Handel wrote a famous set of variations for harpsichord called Harmonious Blacksmith and Johann Sebastian Bach wrote the Goldberg Variations which was a set of 30 variations a very long piece of music It was written for a man who found it difficult to sleep at night so he would ask his harpsichord player whose name was Goldberg to play to him

Many composers from the Classical Romantic and modern periods wrote sets of variations Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote several one of which was based on a French folktune which we know in Britain as Twinkle twinkle little star Beethoven wrote several wonderful sets of variations Many of them were for piano but he also used the form in other pieces eg the slow movement of his Ninth Symphony Schubert often wrote variations on tunes from his own songs

Other composers who wrote variations include Brahms Elgar Schoenberg Britten and many more 

Logo is a programming language that is easy to learn It is used to teach students and children to program a computer It was developed to process lists of words It was like the language LISP 

In 1967 the first Logo ran on a mainframe computer a machine called a teletype was used to type in and printout the results There was no screen 

In 1969 it was used to control a Floor Turtle Commands were added to send the turtle forwards and backwards and to turn the turtle to left or right This turtle had pen with different colors When it moved it left a trail on the floor 

This was very useful When a new version of Logo was developed to draw graphics on a screen it used the same commands This was called Turtle graphics 

There are 170 versions of Logo Many of them are open source and free There are three Logo textbooks that can be downloaded free Logo is usually an interpreted language

LISP is the name for a programming language It is among the oldest programming languages that are still used today Only Fortran is one year older LISP was designed by John McCarthy in 1958 The best known versions of LISP are Common Lisp Scheme and Clojure Many concepts that are used in modern programming languages were first created in Lisp Linked lists are a very important data structure in LISP The basic concepts behind LISP are easy to learn Logo is another version of Lisp that was made for children Logo can help young children develop skills and become efficient within the programming language

In mathematical logic and computer science lambda calculus also calculus is a formal system It was designed to investigate the definition of functions and how to apply them It is also a tool for analysing recursion It was introduced by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s Church used lambda calculus in 1936 to give a negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem Lambda calculus can be used to define what a computable function is No general algorithm can answer the question of whether two lambda calculus expressions are equivalent This was the first question even before the halting problem for which undecidability could be proved Lambda calculus has greatly influenced functional programming languages such as LISP ML and Haskell

Lambda calculus can be called the smallest universal programming language It consists of a single transformation rule and a single function definition scheme Lambda calculus is universal in the sense that any computable function can be expressed and evaluated using this formalism It is thus the same as the Turing machine formalism However lambda calculus emphasizes the use of transformation rules It does not care about the actual machine that implements them It is an approach more related to software than to hardware

Power transmission is the movement of energy from its place of generation to a place where it can be used for work

Power is defined formally as units of energy per unit time In SI units 1 watt 1 joules 1 newton metresecond

Since the development of technology Transmission and storage systems have been of immense interest to technologists and technology users

With widespread establishment of power grids power transmission has came to be associated most often with electric power transmission 

Electrical power transmission has replaced mechanical power transmission in all but the very shortest distances From the start of the industrial revolution until the end of the 19th century mechanical power transmission was the norm Factories were fitted with overhead driveshafts providing rotary power Drivebelts would provide power to individual machines on the shop floor

Mechanical power may be transmitted directly using a solid structure such as a driveshaft transmission gears can adjust the amount of torque or force vs speed in much the same way an electrical transformer adjusts voltage vs current

Power may be transmitted by physically transporting chemical or nuclear fuels Possible artificial fuels include radioactive isotopes wood alcohol grain alcohol methane synthetic gas cryogenic gas hydrogen gas and liquefied natural gas

Ocean surface waves are surface waves that occur in the upper layer of the ocean They usually result from wind or geologic effects like earthquakes or vulcanicity and may travel thousands of miles before striking land They range in size from small ripples to huge tsunamis There is little actual forward motion of individual water particles in an unbroken wave despite the large amount of energy and momentum it may carry forward

The great majority of large breakers one sees on an ocean beach result from distant winds Three factors influence the formation of wind waves

All of these factors work together to determine the size and shape of ocean waves The greater each of the variables the larger the waves Waves are measured by

Waves in a given area typically have a range of sizes For weather reporting and for scientific analysis of wind wave statistics their size over a period of time is usually expressed as significant wave height This figure represents the average height of the highest one third of the waves in a given time period or in a specific wave or storm system Given the variability of wave size the largest individual waves are likely to be twice the reported significant wave height for a particular day or storm

A crest is the point on a wave with the greatest positive value or upward displacement in a cycle A trough is the opposite of a crest

When the crest and the trough of two waves of equal magnitude and frequency intersect or collide when in phase with each other the result is called constructive interference and the magnitudes double when 180 out of phase the result is destructive interference with each other the resulting wave is the undisturbed line that is in the middle of the diagram having zero amplitude

In other words the wave crest is called a peak

A trough is a box like drinking vessel for farm animals Other senses of the word refer to things that are lower than their surroundings like a trough

In physics a surface wave can refer to a mechanical wave that propagates along the interface between differing media usually two fluids with different densities A surface wave can also be an electromagnetic wave guided by a refractive index gradient In radio transmission a ground wave is a surface wave that propagates close to the surface of the Earth

Nausea is a general feeling of unease and discomfort in the stomach often with the urge to vomit The word nausea comes from the Latin word for seasickness

Nausea is a symptom rather than an illness or disease The causes for it very often are not in the stomach itself but somewhere else in the body Nausea is often caused by a stomach virus Nausea is usually harmless in the short term A good treatment for it can be not to take solid food Nausea can also occur during pregnancy and is quite normal in that context 

Anxiety is an unpleasant emotional state It can include fear Very often people with anxiety also feel worries There can also be physical symptoms like having a headache or an upset stomach

Some people have a lot of anxiety that controls them This can be treated by therapy and medicine

A lumbar puncture is a medical method to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid This can be either done to analyse the sample to find some hints to diseases It can also be done to lower the pressure of the fluid inside the skull

Wave power means the feet of ocean surface waves and the capture of that energy to do useful work  including electricity generation desalination and the pumping of water 

Power from ocean surface wave motion might produce much more energy than tides It has been tested that it is possible to produce energy from waves particularly in Scotland in the UK But the technology is not as well developed as wind power or solar power

Port Royal was a city in Jamaica It was the focus of trade in Jamaica in the 17th century It was known for its piracy but also for the riches accumulated and for the very bad moral values that could be found in the city An earthquake in June of 1692 largely destroyed the city Two thirds of the city sank into the Caribbean Sea Today the city is covered by at least 8 metres of water The city is among the most important archaeological sites in the Ocean Its role as a center for trade was taken over by Spanish Town Jamaica and later by Kingston

Osbornes bull was created as an advertisement for a sherry in 1956 Many people see it as the unofficial image of Spain The bull is seen in semi profile The bulls used today are about 14 metres high and are made out of about 70 plates of iron

Desalination means any process that removes the excess salt and other minerals from water in order to obtain fresh water suitable for animal consumption or irrigation

If almost all of the salt is removed for human consumption sometimes the process produces table salt as a by product 

Desalination of brackish water is done in the United States in order to meet treaty obligations for river water entering Mexico Several Middle Eastern countries have energy reserves so great that they use desalinated water for agriculture Saudi Arabias desalination plants account for about 24 of total world capacity The worlds largest desalination plant is the Jebel Ali Desalination Plant in UAE It uses multi stage flash distillation dual purpose and it is capable of producing 300 million cubic meters of water per year

The traditional process used in these operations is vacuum distillation essentially the boiling of water at less than atmospheric pressure and thus a much lower temperature than normal Due to the reduced temperature energy is saved

Solar energy is energy that is present in sunlight It has been used for thousands of years in many different ways by people all over the world As well as its traditional human uses in heating cooking and drying it is used today to make electricity where other power supplies are absent such as in remote places and in space It is becoming cheaper to make electricity from solar energy and in many situations it is now competitive with energy from coal or oil 

Solar energy is used today in a number of ways

After passing through the Earths atmosphere most of the Suns energy is in the form of visible light and infrared light radiation Plants convert the energy in sunlight into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis Humans regularly use this store of energy in various ways as when they burn wood or fossil fuels or when simply eating plants fish and animals

Solar radiation reaches the Earths upper Earths atmosphere with the power of 1366 watts per square meter Since the Earth is round the surface nearer its poles is angled away from the sun and receives much less solar energy than the surface nearer the equator 

At present solar cell panels convert at best about 15 of sunlight hitting them into electricity 

The dark disks in the third diagram on the right are imaginary examples of the amount of land that if covered with 8 efficient solar panels would produce slightly more energy in the form of electricity than the world needed in 2003 

Many technologies have been developed to make use of solar radiation Some of these technologies make direct use of the solar energy while others produce electricity

Solar power plants strive to convert sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics or indirectly using concentrated solar power Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam Photovoltaics converts light into electric current using the photoelectric effect

 Solar cooking uses the sun as the source of energy instead of standard cooking fuels such as charcoal coal or gas Solar cookers are an inexpensive and environmentally sound alternative to traditional ovens They are becoming widely used in areas of the developing world where deforestation is an issue financial resources to purchase fuel are limited and where open flames would pose a serious risk to people and the environment

 The sun may be used to heat water instead of electricity or gas There are two basic types of active solar heating systems based on the type of fluid either liquid or air that is heated in the solar energy collectors

Liquid based systems heat water or an antifreeze solution in a hydronic collector whereas air based systems heat air in an air collector Both air and liquid systems can supplement forced air systems

Solar cells can be used to generate electricity from sunlight It is a device that converts light energy into electrical energy Sometimes the term solar cell is reserved for devices intended specifically to capture energy from sunlight while the term photovoltaic cell is used when the light source is unspecified

Solar cells have many applications They have long been used in situations where electrical power from the grid is unavailable such as in remote area power systems Earth orbiting satellites and space probes consumer systems eg handheld calculators or wrist watches remote radiotelephones and water pumping applications

Photovoltaics are arrays of cells containing a solar photovoltaic material that converts solar radiation into direct current electricity Due to the growing demand for renewable energy sources the manufacturing of solar cells and photovoltaic arrays has advanced considerably in recent years

Solar photovoltaics is growing rapidly from a small base to a total global capacity of 40000 MW at the end of 2010 More than 100 countries use solar PV Installations may be ground mounted or built into the roof or walls of a building

As of December 2010 the largest photovoltaic power plants in the world are the Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant Montalto di Castro Photovoltaic Power Station Finsterwalde Solar Park Rovigo Photovoltaic Power Plant Olmedilla Photovoltaic Park the Strasskirchen Solar Park and the Lieberose Photovoltaic Park Larger power stations are under construction some proposed will have a capacity of 150 MW or more

A solar cell or photovoltaic cell is a device that converts light energy into electrical energy Sometimes the term solar cell is reserved for devices intended specifically to capture energy from sunlight while the term photovoltaic cell is used when the light source is unspecified The device needs to fulfill only two functions photogeneration of charge carriers in a light absorbing material and separation of the charge carriers to a conductive contact that will transmit the electricity This conversion is called the photovoltaic effect and the field related to solar cells is known as photovoltaics

Solar cells have many applications They have long been used in situations where electrical power from the grid is unavailable such as in remote area power systems Earth orbiting satellites and space probes consumer systems eg handheld calculators or wrist watches remote radiotelephones and water pumping applications More recently they are starting to be used in assemblies of solar modules connected to the electricity grid through an inverter often in combination with a net metering arrangement 

Solar cells are regarded as one of the key technologies towards a sustainable energy supply

The first generation photovoltaic consists of a large area single layer p n junction diode which is capable of generating usable electrical energy from light sources with the wavelengths of sunlight These cells are typically made using a silicon wafer First generation photovoltaic cells are the dominant technology in the commercial production of solar cells accounting for more than 86 of the solar cell market

The second generation of photovoltaic materials is based on the use of thin film deposits of semiconductors These devices were initially designed to be high efficiency multiple junction photovoltaic cells Later the advantage of using a thin film of material was noted reducing the mass of material required for cell design This contributed to a prediction of greatly reduced costs for thin film solar cells Currently there are different technologiessemiconductor materials under investigation or in mass production such as amorphous silicon poly crystalline silicon micro crystalline silicon cadmium telluride copper indium selenidesulfide Typically the efficiencies of thin film solar cells are lower compared with silicon solar cells but manufacturing costs are also lower so that a lower price in terms of watt of electrical output can be achieved Another advantage of the reduced mass is that less support is needed when placing panels on rooftops and it allows fitting panels on light materials or flexible materials even textiles

Third generation photovoltaics are very different from the other two broadly defined as semiconductor devices which do not rely on a traditional p n junction to separate photogenerated charge carriers These new devices include photoelectrochemical cells Polymer solar cells and nanocrystal solar cells

Companies working on third generation photovoltaics include Xsunx Konarka Technologies Inc Nanosolar and Nanosys Research is also being done in this area by the USAs National Renewable Energy Laboratory

An alternating current is an electric current of which magnitude and direction vary unlike direct current whose direction remains constant 

The usual waveform of an AC power circuit is a sine wave because this leads to the most efficient transmission of energy However in certain applications different waveforms are used such as triangular or square waves

When one speaks of alternating current one mostly refers to the form in which electricity is delivered to businesses and residences But audio and radio signals carried on electrical wire are also examples of alternating current In these applications an important goal is often the recovery of information encoded onto the AC signal

William Stanley Jr designed one of the first practical devices to transfer AC power efficiently between isolated circuits Using pairs of coils wound on a common iron core his design called an induction coil was an early precursor of the modern transformer The system used today was devised in the late nineteenth century largely by Nikola Tesla Contributions were also made by George Westinghouse Lucien Gaulard John Dixon GibbsWilhelm Siemens and Oliver Shallenger AC systems overcame the limitations of the direct current system used by Thomas Edison to distribute electricity efficiently over long distances 

The first modern commercial power plant that used three phase alternating current was at the Mill Creek hydroelectric plant near Redlands California in 1893 Its designer was Almirian Decker a brilliant young engineer Deckers innovative design incorporated 10000 volt three phase transmission and established the standards for the complete system of generation transmission and motors used today 

Direct current is the flow of electricity in a single direction from the positive to the negative terminals

The direct current always flow in the same direction distinguishing it from the alternating current Direct current used to be called Galvanic current

Batteries is one of the main sources of direct current but many other sources also exist such as bridge rectifiers in power supply solar panels etc

Typically the current goes through a conductor such as a wire but it can also go through semiconductors insulators or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams

The first commercial electric power transmission was developed by Thomas Edison in the late nineteenth century using direct current Today nearly all electric power distribution uses alternating current because of the advantages with transformers and transmission For applications requiring direct current the alternating current is typically distributed to a substation and then converted to direct current

Note Long after the usage of direct current had been established physicists realized that the current was made of negative electric charges the electrons and that the actual flow was from the negative to the positive pole but by convention the usage of the term was never changed

In astrophysics a white hole is the opposite of a black hole Where a black hole attracts and sucks in any nearby matter a white hole does the opposite and pushes nearby matter away A theory about white holes is that they act as an exit for matter sucked in by a black hole suggesting that black holes are a type of teleporter The black and white holes are connected by a wormhole

A snowmobile is a motorized vehicle used for travelling over snow It is like a car only instead of wheels it has treads Some snowmobiles have skis in the front for steering 

Adding snowmobile studs to the tread decreases the time and distance it takes to stop a snowmobile Once you make a decision to stop a snowmobile the distance it will take to stop will be a combination of the speed of the machine weight of the machine and the available friction and or the mechanical damping between the snowmobile and the surface on which it is trying to stop If the surface is icy or hard packed the mechanical damping portion of the effective drag factor is decreased leaving you with only the friction provided by the tread to stop

Snowmobile studs made from steel or stainless steel with carbide tips are installed in the tread The studs are designed for specific terrains in varying lengths shapes and materials The studs control acceleration deceleration and maneuverability The correct amount and type of stud installed in an effective pattern will produce the best traction results

The Remo Four were a rock band from Liverpool England from the late 1950s and early 1960s at the same time the Beatles were starting their musical careers

While the Beatles gained experience performing in Hamburg Germany the Remo Four played at American Air Force bases in France Members of the two bands were friends and often played at the same places back in Liverpool or would go to watch each other perform

After the Beatles became famous under Brian Epsteins management Epstein signed up the Remo Four also He worked hard to promote the band but they never achieved massive success as the Beatles had Epstein paired the Remo Four with a singer he also managed called Tommy Quickly They made a series of singles together but none became hits Quickly retired from music and the Remo Four went on to work with other singers including Billy J Kramer They also released an album titled Smile on a German record label

George Harrison was invited to record a movie broken wikt linksoundtracksoundtrack late in 1967 Instead of working with the Beatles he invited the Remo Four to work with him The movie Wonderwall got little exposure but the soundtrack album Wonderwall Music became a minor hit the next year

The magnitude of a mathematical object is its size a property by which it can be larger or smaller than other objects of the same kind

In mathematical language one would say It is an ordering of the class of objects to which it belongs

The Ancient Greeks broken wikt linkdistinguishdistinguished between several types of magnitude including

They had proven that the first two could not be the same or even isomorphic systems of magnitude They did not consider negative magnitudes to be meaningful and magnitude is still chiefly used in contexts in which zero is either the lowest size or less than all possible sizes  

The magnitude of a real number is usually called the absolute value or modulus It is written x and is defined by

This gives the numbers distance from zero on the real number line For example the modulus of 5 is 5

A magnitude is never negative When comparing magnitudes it is often helpful to use a logarithmic scale Real world examples include the loudness of a sound the brightness of a star or the Richter scale of earthquake intensity

To put it another way often it is not meaningful to simply add and subtract magnitudes

Buckethead has created music for films such as Saw II Ghosts of Mars Beverly Hills Ninja and Last Action Hero

In mathematics a quotient is the end result of a division problem For example in the problem 6 3 the quotient would be 2 Then 6 would be called the dividend and 3 the divisor The quotient can also be expressed as the number of times the divisor divides into the dividend

A quotient can also mean just the integral part of the result of dividing two integers For example the quotient of 13 5 would be 2 while the remainder would be 3

Quotients also come up in certain tests like the IQ test which stands for intelligence quotient In this case your quotient is basically your score In recent decades as people begin to emphasize full personal development other similar quotients appeared 

Norman is a language spoken in Normandy  It is a Romance language closely related to French After the Norman Conquest Norman changed the English language a lot

Forms of the Norman are still used in the Channel Islands

No one now uses Sercquiais or Auregnais as there first language but Jerrais and Guernsiais are still used

Each of those three means 6 divided by 3 giving 2 as the answer The first number is the dividend and the second number is the divisor The result is the quotient Whole numbers any left over amount is called the remainder

The numbers can be very big such as with two hundred 2005 40 or with 7 billion 7000000000 1000 7000000

This is the usual way to specify division in most computer programming languages since it can easily be typed as a simple sequence of characters

A typographical variation which is halfway between these two forms uses a slash but elevates the dividend and lowers the divisor

Any of these forms can be used to display a fraction A fraction is a division expression where both dividend and divisor are integers A fraction is an accepted way of writing numbers It is not always expected that the result of the division is written in decimals

But in elementary arithmetic this form is used rather often The obelus is also used alone to represent the division operation itself as for instance as a label on a key of a calculator

In some non English speaking cultures a divided by b is written a b However in English usage the colon is restricted to expressing the related concept of ratios

Division could mean

In mathematics a divisor of an integer n also called a factor of n is an integer which evenly divides n without leaving a remainder Any number is always evenly divisible by 1 and itself which are two of the divisors A prime number has no other divisors

Finding one or more factors of a given number is called factorization 

For example 7 is a divisor of 42 because 427 6 We also say 42 is divisible by 7 or 42 is a multiple of 7 or 7 divides 42 or 7 is a factor of 42 and we usually write 7 42 For example the positive divisors of 42 are 1 2 3 6 7 14 21 42

In general we say mn for non zero integers m and n iff there exists an integer k such that n km Thus divisors can be negative as well as positive although often we restrict our attention to positive divisors 

1 and 1 divide every integer every integer is a divisor of itself and every integer is a divisor of 0 except by convention 0 itself Numbers divisible by 2 are called even and numbers not divisible by 2 are called odd

A divisor of n that is not 1 1 n or n is known as a non trivial divisor numbers with non trivial divisors are known as composite numbers while prime numbers have no non trivial divisors

The name comes from the arithmetic operation of division if ab c then a is the dividend b the divisor and c the quotient

There are properties which allow one to recognize certain divisors of a number from the numbers digits Those properties can be used as math tricks to quickly spot some divisors of a number

For example if the last digit is even then 2 is a divisor If the last digit is 0 or 5 then 5 is a divisor If the digits add up to a multiple of 3 then 3 is a divisor For the number 340 ending in 0 then both 2 and 5 are divisors plus 25 10 is also a divisor Dividing by 10 34010 34 as finally 217 Combining all the smaller numbers the 12 divisors of 340 are

Note that any number is always evenly divisible by 1 and itself

In arithmetic the result of the division of two integers usually cannot be expressed with an integer quotient unless a remainder an amount left over is also accepted

If a and d are natural numbers with d non zero it can be proved that there exist unique integers q and r such that a qd r and 0 r d The number q is called the quotient while r is called the remainder

If a and d are integers with d non zero then a remainder is an integer r such that a qd r for some integer q and with 0 r d

When defined this way there are two possible remainders For example the division of 42 by 5 can be expressed as either

or

So the remainder is then either 3 or 2

This ambiguity in the value of the remainder is not very serious in the case above the negative remainder is obtained from the positive one just by subtracting 5 which is d This holds in general When dividing by d if the positive remainder is r1 and the negative one is r2 then

When a and d are real numbers with d non zero a can be divided by d without remainder with the quotient being another real number If the quotient is constrained to being an integer however the concept of remainder is still necessary It can be proved that there exists a unique integer quotient q and a unique real remainder r such that aqdr with 0r d As in the case of division of integers the remainder could be required to be negative that is  d r 0 

Extending the definition of remainder for real numbers as described above is not of theoretical importance in mathematics however many programming languages implement this definition see modulo operation

Remainder is the amount left over when dividing two integers

Remainder could also mean

An anaerobic organism is any living thing that does not need oxygen for growth 

Microaerophiles are organisms that may use oxygen but only at low concentrations their growth is inhibited by normal oxygen concentrations Nanaerobes are organisms that cannot grow in the presence of micromolar concentrations of oxygen but can grow with and benefit from nanomolar concentrations of oxygen

Obligate anaerobes may use fermentation or anaerobic respiration In the presence of oxygen facultative anaerobes use aerobic respiration without oxygen some of them ferment some use anaerobic respiration Aerotolerant organisms are strictly fermentative Microaerophiles carry out aerobic respiration and some of them can also do anaerobic respiration

Some anaerobic bacteria produce toxins that are highly dangerous to higher organisms including humans

Tetanus is a disease that leads to muscle contractions that stay that way for some time

Infection generally occurs through wound contamination and often involves a cut or deep puncture wound The primary symptoms are caused by tetanospasmin a neurotoxin produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium tetani As the infection goes on muscle spasms develop in the jaw This led to the common name of the condition lockjaw This is usually followed by difficulties with swallowing The condition leads to general muscle stiffness and spasms in other parts of the body Infection can be prevented by proper immunization and by post exposure prophylaxis 

For treatment and more see Tetanus treatment

Immunization is a way of preventing a person from getting a disease This is done by making the persons body come into contact with a bit of the disease so that the body learns how to fight it The bodys ability to fight off a disease is called its immune system 

The material is known as an immunogen Immunization is the same as inoculation and vaccination because inoculation and vaccination use an infecting agent in the same way that immunization does

When the human immune system is exposed to an infection once it can learn how to cope quickly if it is exposed to it again By exposing an individual to an immunogen in a controlled way the body will be able to protect itself from that infection later on in life

Tetanospasmin is the neurotoxin produced by the vegetative spore of Clostridium tetani in anaerobic conditions causing tetanus It is sometimes called spasmogenic toxin tetanus toxin or abbreviated to TeTx or TeNT 

A neurotoxin is a toxin that acts specifically on nerve cells neurons usually by interacting with membrane proteins and ion channels 

Many of the venoms and other toxins that organisms use in defense against vertebrates are neurotoxins A common effect is paralysis which sets in extremely rapidly The venom of bees scorpions pufferfish spiders and snakes can contain many different toxins Many neurotoxins act by affecting voltage dependent ion channels

Paralysis is the complete loss of muscle function for one or more muscle groups when the thing that is paralised can not move 

Paralysis is most often caused by damage to the nervous system or brain especially the spinal cord Major causes are stroke trauma poliomyelitis amyotrophic lateral sclerosis botulism spina bifida multiple sclerosis and Guillain Barr syndrome Partial paralysis can also occur in the REM stage of sleep Paralysis often includes loss of feeling in the affected area

A membrane protein is a protein molecule that is attached to or associated with the membrane of a cell or an organelle More than half of all proteins interact with membranes Membrane proteins can be classified into two groups based on the strength of their association with the membrane

As with many other punctuation marks the usage of colon varies among languages and for a given language among historical periods As a rule however a colon informs the reader that what follows proves clarifies explains or simply lists items in what is referred to before

The following classification of the functions that a colon may have given by Luca Serianni for Italian usage is generally valid for English and many other languages

This last was once a common means of indicating an unmarked quotation on the same line 

A colon may also be used for the following

In English a colon may be followed by text with either a capital letter or by a lower case letter depending on usage where speech follows a capital letter is used where an acronym or proper noun follows a capital is used otherwise a lower case letter is used Some examples of text following a colon

In European languages the colon is usually followed by a lowercase letter Exceptions are Dutch and German where an uppercase letter must be used if the colon is followed by a complete sentence or a noun although in all other cases a lowercase letter should be used

No space is put before a colon except in French

In Finnish and Swedish the colon can appear inside words in a manner similar to the English apostrophe between a word and its grammatical suffixes It occurs in names for example Antonia Axson Johnson It is done in loanwords and abbreviations eg USAhan for the illative case of USA But for loanwords ending orthographically in a consonant but phonetically in a vowel the apostrophe is used instead eg shown for the genitive case of the English loan show

The colon was established in the English language well before 1700

The colon is also used in mathematics cartography model building and other fields to denote a ratio or a scale as in 31 Unicode provides a distinct ratio character Unicode U2236 for mathematical usage

In computing the colon character is represented by ASCII code 58 and is located at Unicode code point U003A The full width equivalent is located at Unicode code point UFF1A

The colon is quite often used as a special control character in many operating systems commands URLs computer programming languages and in the path representation of several file systems It is often used as a single post fix delimiter signifying a token keyword had immediately preceded it or the transition from one mode of character string interpretation to another related mode Some applications such as the widely used MediaWiki utilize the colon as both a pre fix and post fix delimiter

For a double colon the meaning has included the use of ellipsis as spanning over omitted text however there have been other meanings as well

On the Internet a colon or multiple colons is sometimes used to denote an action or emote In this use it has the inverse function of quotation marks denoting actions where unmarked text is assumed to be dialog For example

Fresco is a way of painting pictures A fresco is a painting that is done on a wall All wall paintings are sometimes called frescoes by mistake A true fresco is painted onto plaster that is fresh The plaster has been laid on the wall that day and is still damp The word fresco comes from the Italian for fresh 

Advantages and disadvantages of fresco painting 

Fresco is a very good way of painting pictures on walls It is much easier than painting on dry plaster because when paint is put onto dry plaster it sinks straight in Painting on fresh plaster means that the artist can spread the paint much easier 

Another reason why it is a good way to paint pictures on plastered walls is that the paint joins with the plaster so that the colours will not rub off Frescoes last for hundreds of years If they are kept clean and dry the colours will stay bright for a very long time 

Fresco is the green method of painting because it does not use dangerous chemicals The water the calcite and the colours do not cause pollution 

The bad things about fresco painting The problems with painting frescos come from the plaster It must be mixed up and put on the wall freshly every day and left to partly dry before it can be used As the plaster begins to dry or set the artist can start the picture The plaster becomes very hot while it is drying giving off steam and a plastery smell The artist must work very quickly and carefully If heshe makes a mistake the plaster must be scraped off Unlike most other types of painting frescos can not be moved from place to place or rearranged

Method  the way to paint frescoes 

The artist must plan the work carefully It starts with a small drawing of the picture The artists then makes a large drawing called a cartoon and works out the right order to paint the picture because a big picture might take more than a week to paint Each days work is called by the Italian name giornata Giorno means day 

When the days work starts the artist needs to work fast so there is usually another worker or assistant who mixes the plaster and helps the artist 

The artists pins up a drawing and uses a sharp point to mark the lines of the drawing onto the plaster Heshe then paints the outlines of the picture onto the plaster Accuracy is very important the artist must get it right in one go 

As the painting dries the artist works over the whole giornata again putting in details of the faces and the clothing and painting shadows 

At the beginning of the next days work the plaster edge of the last giornata is scraped so that the new plaster joins well Often it is possible to see the joins and work out how many giornata it took to do a single painting

History of frescoes 

Not all wall paintings are frescoes In Ancient Egypt for example many of the wall paintings were done on dry plaster and are not true frescoes 

The Royal Palace at Knossos in Crete c 1500 BC had many frescoes The scene of athletes dancing with a bull is the most famous 

Many Ancient Roman wall paintings can be seen at Pompeii from the 1st century AD but these are not true frescoes 

There are many frescoes dating from the late Middle Ages about 1000 1400 AD when it was the fashion to paint the inside of churches with people and stories from the Bible The order of the pictures was carefully planned by the artists and priests Above the altar is usually seen a picture of Jesus Christ On the west wall is often a frightening picture of The Last Judgement to remind people to turn to Jesus Many frescoes like this can be seen in Greece Spain Portugal Serbia Armenia Romania and Russia There are a few in Germany France and Italy

Renaissance 

In Italy around 1300 AD the artist Giotto painted frescoes that were so full of life that people were amazed Each picture was like looking onto a stage where real people told the story This was the beginning of the period of art history called the Renaissance Giottos frescoes became so famous that he had many pupils and followers Giottos most famous frescoes are in the Arena Chapel in Padua He also painted in the Church of St Francis at Assisi and at Santa Croce in Florence

A hundred years later about 1400 AD two artists called Masolino and Masaccio worked in the city of Florence painting a chapel Their names translate as Little Tom and Fat Tom Masaccios way of painting was the biggest change since Giotto in particular the two weeping naked figures of Adam and Eve Everyone thought that Masaccio was one of the greatest painters alive But he died at only 27 years old These frescoes are in the Church of the Carmine in Florence

In the 1400s many other artists in Italy were given the job of painting churches or chapels They were paid by patrons rich people who could afford an artist The most important patron was the Pope Pope Sixtus IV had built a new chapel in the Vatican in Rome In 1481 he got some of the best artists in Italy to decorate the walls for him See Sistine Chapel 

In 1508 the work continued in the Sistine Chapel when Pope Julius II made the great artist Michelangelo go to Rome to paint the ceiling It took him four years and he became sick from the strain and the smell But when he had finished he had painted one of the greatest artworks in the world Then 1537 1541 he painted the west wall of the same chapel with The Last Judgement

For the next 200 years painted ceilings were in fashion But artists soon discovered that it was easier to paint in oil on canvas and put it up on the ceiling than to paint on the ceiling in fresco The fashion for fresco painting began to fade

In 1924 Adolf Hitler was released early from prison He restarted the NSDAP He wanted to gain power legally by elections The next elections to the Reichstag were in 1928 Until then the NSDAP was only one of a few nationalist parties from the extreme right There were many other parties with similar ideas then Among people supporting the party were Fritz Thyssen and Emil Kirdorf both leaders of big industries

In the 1928 election the party won 26 percent of the vote The party decided to reduce antisemitic slogans in order to do better next time The party focused on terrorising the people as well as more on international policy and got around 10 of the vote in local elections in 1929 and 1930

In 1930 President Paul von Hindenburg dissolved the Reichstag This was seen as an opportunity for the NSDAP In the elections on September 14 1930 the NSDAP won 183 of the vote and was the second biggest party What people wanted was to put away with the Weimar Republic Weimarer Republik Weimar was the German city where the constitution for Germany was written after the First World War People also wanted a stronger Germany with more troops Germany banned from having some types of weapons and ships by the Treaty of Versailles All those points were in the programme of the NSDAP That is why so many people voted for them

On the 30 January 1933 Franz von Papen offered to make Adolf Hitler Chancellor in a nationalist cabinet This was done in secret This was a Machtbergabe or transfer of power but later the NSDAP started to call this event the Machtergreifung because it was better for Nazi propaganda to say that they came and took over from the Weimar Republic in stead of being made the legal government of the Weimar Republic

In the last free election in Weimar Germany was in March 1933 the NSDAP won 44 of the vote This was not the majority Nevertheless they managed to get the required two thirds majority to pass the Ermchtigungsgesetz Based on this they dissolved parliament gave Hitler the power to do anything he wanted and made all parties illegal

After this the NSDAP became very important People had to be party members to get some jobs or to get promoted The NSDAP was busy until the surrender of Germany on 8 May 1945

The NSDAP dissolved itself on 8 May 1945 and ceased to exist

The made some reforms which still exist today

But the Nazis did so many bad things that in Germany today it is illegal to display the Swastika symbol or use slogans such as Sieg Heil In November 2010 a UK member of the European Parliament Godfrey Bloom was forced to leave the building He had shouted the Nazi slogan Ein Volk ein Reich ein Fhrer at a German member of the parliament

Carl Nielsen was a Danish composer He is the most famous composer from Denmark and one of the most important composers of symphonies from the late 19th and early 20th centuries

Carl Nielsen was the 7th in a family of 12 children His fathers name was Niels Jrgensen It was Danish tradition for a child to get his fathers first name as his surname so Carl became Carl Nielsen

The family was very poor and Carl had to help in the home During the school holidays he looked after the geese His father who was a simple painter played the violin and cornet in the village band Carl soon learned to play the violin and joined in with his fathers band He listened to music by Haydn and Mozart and became very interested in general knowledge All his life he tried to learn new languages and was interested in literature art and philosophy He loved animals and the nature around him

When he was 14 he had a job in the military orchestra in the nearby town of Odense He played the horn and trombone In 1884 some wealthy people in Odense paid for him to go to the Conservatory in Copenhagen He studied music there and did quite well but there was nothing yet to show that he would be a brilliant composer He got a job as violinist in the Royal Chapel a good orchestra which was conducted by Johan Svendsen He got to know the music of Wagner and he went to Germany to study it Later he was not so keen on Wagners music and he was not much influenced by it

In 1891 he married Anne Marie Brodersen who was a sculptress They travelled together to Italy where they saw lots of great art When they returned to Denmark Nielsen started composing some of the music that was to make him famous In 1901 the Danish government paid him money every year so that he did not have to teach and could spend his time composing He also conducted the Royal Theatre when Svendsen retired He often travelled to other countries and later did some teaching and examining at the Copenhagen Conservatoire He was made director of the conservatoire in 1931 shortly before he died

Nielsen suffered for several years from heart trouble He died from this disease on October 3 1931

Carl Nielsen wrote nearly every kind of music opera chamber music symphony concerto songs His music was different from the Romantic music that other composers were writing at that time Nielsen liked the music of the Classical period especially Haydn and Mozart He learned from them but also used a lot of chromaticism and interesting orchestral sounds which made his music much more modern

He wrote a serious opera called Saul og David and a comic opera Maskarade He wrote a lot of Danish songs which are very popular in Denmark

By far the most important of his works internationally are his six symphonies and three concertos The Fourth and Fifth Symphonies especially are performed very often by orchestras all over the world

He wrote a very large work for organ called Commotio

Nielsen always said how important his simple village background was for his music This can be heard clearly in his popular cantata Fynsk Foraar which shows his love of the countryside where he grew up

The Madonna and Child or The Virgin and Child is often the name of a work of art which shows the Virgin Mary and the Child Jesus The word Madonna means My Lady in Italian Artworks of the Christ Child and his mother Mary are part of the Roman Catholic tradition in many parts of the world including Italy Spain Portugal France South America and the Philippines Paintings known as icons are also an important tradition of the Orthodox Church and often show the Mary and the Christ Child They are found particularly in Eastern Europe Russia Egypt the Middle East and India Types of art work 

Paintings Works of art which show the Madonna and Child can be paintings or sculptures Some paintings are very large and show the Madonna on a throne with saints standing around it These paintings are altarpieces they are designed to go above the altar in a church 

In some churches particularly in Italy and in Eastern Orthodox Churches there are many wall paintings and mosaics of the Madonna and Child

Most Madonna and Child paintings are small They have been painted for private owners and would usually have been kept in houses They might be hung on the wall above a table where flowers and candles could be placed to honour the Virgin Mary Most of the famous ones are now in art galleries 

Many Catholic churches have statues of the Virgin Mary with the Christ Child These are sometimes life sized and are painted with real hair and glass eyes so that they look lifelike 

Other statues of the Madonna and Child are very small In the Middle Ages small statues were carved from ivory These precious statues are often very beautifully and delicately made They can often be seen in museums 

In Florence in the early 1400s an artist called Luca della Robbia began making terracotta statues and sculptured altarpieces from clay which were fired and glazed with colours most often blue and white but also purple green and yellow This family business lasted for 120 years

Many statues of the Madonna and Child may be factory made and sold as souvenirs This tradition of small statues has been around for hundreds of years Many of them were made in artists workshops in the Early Renaissance 

Icons In the Orthodox Church there is also a long tradition of painting images of the Virgin Mary with the Christ Child These pictures which are often quite small and are painted on wooden panels are often very careful copies of particular famous icons This tradition continues to the present day

Gppingen is a town in Baden Wrttemberg Germany In 2005 there were 57771 people living in Gppingen It is at the bottom of the convert684mft0lkonabbron high Kaiserberg or Emperors Mountain

The first settlement at Gppingen was in the Hallstatt period 800 480 BC A Roman settlement from about 250 BC was found near the present day Oberhofen Church An Alemannic prince by the name of Geppo is believed to have started the town after the sometime in the 3rd or 4th century The town is named after him

A fire on August 25 1782 destroyed most of the town but it was immediately rebuilt During the 1800s many factories were built in the area Companies such as Mrklin and Schuler are still based in the town

In 1930 an air field was built north of Gppingen This was taken over by the Luftwaffe in 1935 and was called the Fliegerhorst Kaserne From 1945 to 1949 displaced persons and refugees were housed in the buildings In 1949 it was renamed Cooke Barracks after Charles H Cooke Jr who been killed in action and given the Silver Star and Soldiers Medal for bravery

In late 1950 the 7th Army had been reformed in Stuttgart and US Army units began to be stationed at Cooke Barracks The barracks were made bigger for the 28th Infantry Division headquarters The 28th Infantry was renamed as the 9th Infantry Division in 1954 and was replaced by the 8th Infantry Division in 1956 They were then replaced by the 4th Armored Division in 1957 which was renamed as the 1st Armored Division in 1971 and moved to Hindenburg Kaserne in Ansbach in 1972 The 1st Infantry Division moved from Augsburg in 1972 until 1991 

Cooke Barracks were given back to the German government in 1992 The barracks were again used to house refugees for some time then returned to civilian use

The National Gallery London is an art gallery in London England which has one of the finest collections of European paintings in the world What makes this gallery so important is that although there are bigger galleries The National Gallery has many paintings of very high quality and also because it has paintings by famous artists whose works are very rare These rare paintings include works by Duccio Masaccio Uccello Piero della Francesca Leonardo Giorgione Michelangelo Caravaggio Vermeer Chardin Klimt Rousseau and Redon 

The National Gallery is on Trafalgar Square which is one of the busiest tourist places in London It is a grand building of pale grey limestone with a central dome and a large Classical style porch like an Ancient Greek temple To the left side the gallery has a large new building called The Sainsbury Wing 

In 1823 a collector called Sir George Beaumont offered to give his famous collection of paintings to the British Government to start a public art gallery In 1824 another famous collection of paintings was on sale The owner John Julius Angerstein had died It looked as if his paintings would be sold outside England Then there was another offer of paintings from a third collector The Reverend Holwell Carr The Parliament had to make a quick decision 

The Parliament voted that a national collection should be started and a gallery should be built They gave 60000 Pounds Sterling to buy the Angerstein paintings They got 38 pictures and were able to display them publicly in the Angerstein House 

The collection grew quickly with the Beaumont and Holwell Carr paintings and others being bought or given A new gallery was needed In 1831 the plans of the architect William Wilkins were accepted The site which looks over Trafalgar Square was chosen old buildings were demolished and the magnificent new gallery was opened on April 9 1838 

When the National Gallery opened there was a strong opinion that paintings of the High Renaissance period of the late 1400s to Baroque paintings of the 1600s were the finest type of art The word primitive was used to describe Italian paintings from the 1300s and early 1400s Luckily the director of the Gallery Sir Charles Eastlake thought it was important to collect some of these primitive paintings as well as the more popular High Renaisance paintings That is how the National Gallery came to own so many very rare works from the Late Middle Ages and Early Renaissance periods 

In the 1870s the Gallery was lucky to get two collections of paintings by famous Dutch artists The building had to be made larger to house them The Gallery was also given paintings by famous British artists soon there were so many that most of them were moved out to a new gallery called the Tate Museum of British Art 

By the 20th century it was getting more difficult to buy very important paintings there were other galleries in the United States and Germany who were trying to buy the same paintings So the National Gallery began to buy works by more modern painters and soon had a collection of 19th and early 20th century paintings This is not a large part of the National Gallerys collection but it does show small works by many very important artists particularly the French Impressionists

In the George Orwell book Nineteen Eighty Four an Unperson is someone who has been vaporized Vaporization is when a person is murdered by being turned into vapors Not only has an unperson been killed they have also been erased from society the present the universe and existence Such a person would be taken out of books photographs and articles so that no trace of them is found in the present anywhere no record of them would be found The point of this was that such a person would be gone from all citizens memories even friends and family There is no Newspeak word for what happened to unpeople therefore it is thoughtcrime to say an unpersons name or think of unpeople This is like the Stalinist Soviet Party erasing people from photographs after death this is an example of real unpeople

A similar punishment damnatio memoriae was used in the Roman Empire The Stalin era Soviet Union also provided real world examples of unpersons in its treatment of Leon Trotsky and other members of the Communist party who became politically inconvenient In his 1960 magazine article Pravda means Truth reprinted in Expanded Universe Robert A Heinlein argued that John Paul Jones and a mysterious May 15 1960 cosmonaut had also received this treatment

A sawmill is a facility where lumber is cut into boards

A sawmills basic operation is much like those of 100 years ago a log enters on one end and dimensional lumber exits on the other end 

Sawmills seem to have existed in the medieval period as one was sketched by Villard de Honnecourt in c1250 On the other hand people think they were introduced to Madeira following its discovery in c1420 and spread widely in Europe in the 16th century 

The Dutchman Cornelis Corneliszoon invented his type of sawmill by applying a pitman arm onto a wind mill which converted a turning motion into an up an down motion Corneliszoon patented the sawmill on December 15 1593 and the pitman on December 6 1597 He built the first sawmill there in 1594 

Before to the invention of the sawmill boards were sawn by two men with a whipsaw using saddleblocks to hold the log and a pit for the pitman who worked below Sawing was slow and required strong and enduring men The topsawer had to be the stronger of the two because the saw was pulled in turn by each man and the lower had the advantage of gravity The topsawyer also had to guide the saw so that the board was of even thickness This was often done by following a chalkline

Early sawmills simply adapted the whipsaw to mechanical power generally driven by a water wheel to speed up the process The circular motion of the wheel was changed to back and forth motion of the saw blade by a Connecting rod known as a pitman A pitman is similar to a crankshaft but in reverse a crankshaft converts back and forth motion to circular motion

Generally only the saw was powered and the logs had to be loaded and moved by hand An early improvement was the development of a movable carriage also water powered to steadily move the log through the saw blade

A small mill such as this would be the center of many rural communities in wood exporting regions such as the Baltic countries and Canada The output of such mills would be quite low perhaps only 500 boards per day They would also generally only operate during the winter the peak logging season

In the United States the sawmills was introduced soon after the colonisation of Virginia by recruiting skilled men from Hamburgh Later the metal parts were obtained from the Netherlands where the technology was far ahead of that in England where the sawmill reamiend largely unknown until the late 18th century The arrival of a sawmill was a large and stimulative step in the growth of a frontier community 

Early mills were taken to the forest where a temporary shelter was built and the logs were skidded to the nearby mill by horse or ox teams often when there was some snow to provide lubrication As mills grew larger they were usually established in more permanent facilities on a river and the logs were floated down to them by log drivers 

Technology has changed sawmill operations significantly in recent years emphasizing increasing profits through waste minimization and increased energy efficiency as well as improving operator safety

Convenience food is a type of food This kind of food has been made so it can save the consumers time to prepare it Usually such foods just need to be heated They are designed for a long shelf life so that they can stay in the store for a long time One thing to remember is that you may have to pay for the convenience as this food is often expensive

Many people criticise these products because

Water heating is a thermodynamic process using an energy source to heat water above its initial temperature Typical domestic uses of hot water are for cooking cleaning and bathing and space heating In industry both hot water and water heated to steam have many uses

The most common energy sources for heating water are fossil fuels natural gas liquefied petroleum gas oil or sometimes solid fuels These fuels may be consumed directly or by the use of electricity Alternative energy such as solar energy heat pumps hot water heat recycling and sometimes geothermal power may also be used as available usually in combination with gas oil or electricity

Solar collectors for solar powered water heaters are installed outside dwellings typically on the roof or nearby Nearly all models are the direct gain type They consist of flat panels in which water circulates 

In countries like Iceland and New Zealand and other volcanic regions water heating may be done using geothermal power rather than combustion

Room temperature does not have an exact scientific definition It means a temperature that is normal in rooms used by human beings 

A comfortable room temperature depends on individual needs and other factors According to the West Midlands Public Health Observatory 21 C is the recommended living room temperature and 18 C is a good bedroom temperature

However this might not be true for countries found near the equator As the temperature is higher the room temperature is around 30C

For scientific work room temperature is taken to be about 20 to 25 degrees Celsius with an average of 23C For numerical convenience either 20 C or 300 K is often used

The progress and results of many scientific and industrial processes can sometimes depend on the temperature of the surroundings of the equipment For example a measurement of the charge of the electron does not depend upon the temperature of the test equipment In this case if scientists mention temperature at all they usually only mention room temperature which means that what is being measured has not been cooled or heated

Baptist is a word describing a tradition within Christianity and may also refer to individuals belonging to a Baptist church or a Baptist denomination The tradition takes its name from the belief that followers of Jesus Christ should be placed in water to show their faith Baptists do not practice infant baptism

In 1639 Roger Williams began a Baptist church in Providence Rhode Island and John Clarke began a Baptist church in Newport Rhode Island It is not clear which church opened first Records for both churches are missing information

Baptist churches do not have a central principal authority Therefore beliefs are not the same from one Baptist church to another mainly beliefs that may be considered minor However on major issues most are held in common among almost all Baptist churches

Baptists share so called orthodox Christian beliefs with most other moderate or conservative Christian denominations Some of them are beliefs about one God Jesus death burial and bodily resurrection the Trinity the need for salvation grace and evangelism and missions

There are over 90 million Baptists in the world in nearly 300000 churches There are about 47 million members in the United States Other large populations of Baptists also exist in Asia Africa and Latin America There are 24 million Baptists in India 23 million in Nigeria 19 million in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 15 million in Brazil

In a poll in the 1990s about 20 of Americans said they are Baptist

Many people outside the community see them as Protestant but some baptists do not In their view Baptists have existed separately since early church days Those holding this view believe that Baptists have never been a part of the Roman Catholic Church and that Baptists are not protesting against Catholicism 

They also point out that Baptists have no connections with the Reformationists like Luther Calvin or Zwingli Other Baptists accept the Protestant label as a category for churches who have similar religious views of sola scriptura sola fide the priesthood of all believers and other positions that Luther or Calvin had in contrast to the Roman Catholic Church in the 1500s

The tag denomination is broken wikt linkrejectionrejected by some because of the autonomous system used by Baptist churches for control Being a denomination is viewed by them as having a hierarchy instead of the Roman Catholic Church Another reason for the rejection of the tag is the influence of the Restoration period on Baptist churches which tore down denominational barriers Other Baptists accept the tag They feel that it does not lie or have any bad meanings It is just used as a synonym for a Christian or religious group with common beliefs

The tag Evangelical is rejected by some fundamentalist Baptists who think that the term is not fundamentalist enough It is also rejected by some liberal Baptists who think that the term is too conservative It is accepted by moderate Baptists believing in the revival in the United States in the 1700s called the First Great Awakening Some Evangelicals also reject the tag fundamentalist because they think that it is too extreme

Techno is a form of electronic dance music that became popular in Detroit Michigan during the mid 1980s It was influenced by synthpop funk post disco and futuristic fiction ideas that were important during the end of the Cold War in the United States at that time Juan Atkins is generally thought to be the founder of Techno musicfactdateApril 2009 Detroit Techno first became successful locally and then became popular around the world in the 1990s 

The word techno comes from technology Fans of Techno music are careful in their use of the word They are careful not to confuse it with other types of music that are similar but different At the same time the word techno is commonly used when talking about all forms of electronic music and dance music especially in the Americas and Australia Despite the common usage of the term to refer to all electronic dance in general techno is a specific genre with its own distinguishable sound By nature techno tends to be highly repetitive instrumentally oriented music which follows a regular four on the floor beat The genre places a strong emphasis on rhythm and techno tends to have a very beat based sound

A dog sled is a sled that is pulled by sled dogs and can go over ice and snow Dog sleds were first made by First Nations people in Canada before the English and French got there because they had no horses so they used dogs to travel They were also made by people in Norway Sweden Finland and Russia because it was also easier to travel with dogs in parts of those countries

Racing dog sleds is a popular sport which a lot of people enjoy watching or actually going in the sleds to race It is more popular in places where there is not much horse racing

A multiset is a concept from mathematics In many ways multisets are like sets Certain items are either elements of that multiset or they are not However multisets are different from sets The same type of item can be in the multiset more than once For this reason mathematicians have defined a relation that tells how many copies of a certain type of item there are in a certain multiset They call this multiplicity For example in the multiset a a b b b c the multiplicities of the members a b and c are respectively 2 3 and 1 

A multiset is illustrated by means of a histogram

A multiset can also be considered an unordered tuple

Another is the multiset of solutions of an algebraic equation A quadratic equation for example has two solutions However in some cases they are both the same number Thus the multiset of solutions of the equation could be 3 5 or it could be 4 4  In the latter case it has a solution of multiplicity 2

In mathematics a tuple is a finite sequence of objects Sometimes the finite sequence is also called an ordered list Each of the objects in the list has a certain type A tuple consisting of n entries is called an n tuple Tuples are used to describe mathematical objects that are made of certain well defined components They are also used very frequently with databases Tuples are different from sets

In other words tuples are like ordered multisets

Manure is organic matter used as fertilizer in agriculture Manures improve the fertility of the soil by adding organic matter and nutrients such as nitrogen that is trapped by bacteria in the soil Higher organisms then feed on the fungi and bacteria in a chain of life

The term manure was used for inorganic fertilizers in the past but this usage is now very rare

The word manure came from Middle English manuren meaning to cultivate land and initially from French main oeuvre hand work alluding to the work which involved manuring land

A nutrient is either a chemical element or compound used in an organisms metabolism or physiology A nutrient is essential to an organism if it cannot be produced by the organism and must be obtained from a food source

A histogram is a concept from statistics It is a graphical display that tells about the distribution of the samples involved They are commonly a picture made from a table with many categories The table tells how many samples there are in each category The word histogram is derived from histos and gramma in Greek Histos means web or mast Gramma means drawing record or writing A histogram of something is therefore etymologically speaking a drawing of the web of this something 

The histogram is one of the seven basic tools of quality control which also include the Pareto chart check sheet control chart cause and effect diagram flowchart and scatter diagram 

A generalization of the histogram is kernel smoothing techniques This will construct a smooth probability density function from the supplied data

Typically a green manure crop is grown for a specific period and then plowed under and incorporated into the soil Green manures usually perform several functions that include soil improvement and soil protection

Historically the practice of green manuring can be traced back to the fallow cycle of crop rotation which was used to allow soils to recover

Organic farming relies on soil health and cycling of nutrients through the soil using natural processes such as the addition of animal manures If animal manures are not available in a stockless rotation green manures perform a vital function of fertilization

The normal distribution is a probability distribution It is also called Gaussian distribution because it was discovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution It is very important in many fields of science Normal distributions are a family of distributions of the same general form These distributions differ in their location and scale parameters the mean of the distribution defines its location and the standard deviation defines the scale

The standard normal distribution is the normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of one It is often called the bell curve because the graph of its probability density looks like a bell

Many values follow a normal distribution These include

Biomass is a basic term in ecology and in the energy production industry

In ecology biomass means the accumulation of living matter It is the total living biological material in a given area or of a biological community or group Biomass is measured by weight or by dry weight per given area

In the energy industry it refers to biological material which can be used as fuel or for industrial production Biomass includes plant matter grown for use as biofuel and also includes plant or animal matter used for production of fibres chemicals or heat Biomass may also include biodegradable wastes which can be burnt as fuel It excludes organic material which has been transformed by geological processes into substances such as coal or petroleum It is usually measured by dry weight 

The term biomass is especially useful for plants where some internal structures may not always be considered living tissue such as the wood of a tree 

Biofuels include bioethanol biobutanol biodiesel biogas 

Biomass is grown from several plants including switchgrass hemp corn poplar willow and sugarcane The particular plant used is usually not very important to the end products but it does affect the processing of the raw material Though biomass is a renewable fuel its use can still contribute to global warming This happens when the natural carbon equilibrium is disturbed for example by deforestation or urbanization of green sites

Biomass is part of the carbon cycle Carbon from the atmosphere is converted into biological matter by photosynthesis On decay or combustion the carbon goes back into the atmosphere This happens over a relatively short timescale and plant matter used as a fuel can be constantly replaced by planting for new growth Therefore a reasonably stable level of atmospheric carbon results from its use as a fuel

Although fossil fuels have their origin in ancient biomass they are not considered biomass by the generally accepted definition because they contain carbon that has been out of the carbon cycle for a very long time Their combustion therefore disturbs the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere

Other uses of biomass besides fuel

Plastics from biomass like some recently developed to dissolve in seawater are made the same way as petroleum based plastics are actually cheaper to manufacture and meet or exceed most performance standards But they lack the same water resistance as conventional plastics

The variance in probability theory and statistics is a way to measure how much something changes For example temperature has more variance in Moscow than in Hawaii More exactly variance describes how much a random variable differs from its expected value The variance is defined as the average of the squares of the differences between the individual and the expected value That means it is always positive 

The variance is not simply the average difference from the expected value The standard deviation which is the square root of the variance and comes closer to the average difference also is not simply the average difference Variance and standard deviation are used because it makes the mathematics easier when adding two random variables together

In accountancy a variance refers to the difference between the budget for a cost and the actual cost

Salome or Salom the Daughter of Herodias like Dismas or the various names of the Three Magi is a name given to a character in the New Testament one whose name is not given there itself She is however an entirely historical person whose name is preserved in non biblical literature In scholarly works she tends to be referred to as the Daughter of Herodias

The name Salome is given to the stepdaughter of Herod Antipas in Josephus Jewish AntiquitiesHerodias was married to Herod the son of Herod the Great who was born of Mariamne the daughter of Simon the high priest who had a daughter Salome after whose birth Herodias took upon her to confound the laws of our country and divorced herself from her husband while he was alive and was married to Herod her husbands brother by the fathers side he was tetrarch of Galilee but her daughter Salome was married to Philip the son of Herod and tetrarch of Trachonitis and as he died childless Aristobulus the son of Herod the brother of Agrippa married her they had three sons Herod Agrippa and Aristobulus

Despite the early date of this account she was not consistently called Salome until the nineteenth century when Gustave Flaubert referred to her as Salome in his play HerodiasSalome was also a Belly Dancer

According to Mark 621 29 Salome was the stepdaughter of Herod Antipas and danced before Herod and her mother Herodias at the occasion of Herods birthday and by doing so caused the death of John the Baptist The New Testament suggests that Salome caused John to be executed because of his complaints that Herods marriage to Herodias was adulterous and that Herodias put her up to the demand that John be executed something the king was initially reluctant to do 

Some ancient Greek translations of Mark read Herods daughter Herodias To scholars using these ancient texts both mother and daughter had the same name However scholars using the Latin Vulgate Bible did not confuse the two thus western Church Fathers tended to refer to Salome as Herodiass daughter or just the girl Nevertheless because she is otherwise unnamed in the Bible the idea that both mother and daughter were named Herodias gained some currency in early modern Europe 

This Salome is not the same Salome who is said to be a witness to the Crucifixion of Jesus in Mark 1540jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjfriiaofieofhfjfjskdlks

Sucrose is a disaccharide with the molecular formula C12H22O11 Its systematic name is D glucopyranosyl  D fructofuranose It is best known for its role in human nutrition and is formed by plants but not by higher organisms

Pure sucrose is most often prepared as a fine white odorless crystalline powder with a pleasing sweet taste 

A disaccharide is a sugar composed of two monosaccharides It is formed when two sugars are joined together and a molecule of water is removed For example milk sugar is made from glucose and galactose whereas cane sugar is made from glucose and fructose

Maltose and cellobiose are hydrolysis products of the polysaccharides starch and cellulose respectively

A biological hazard or biohazard is anything coming from living organisms that could be a threat to someones health It is represented by the biohazard symbol which is used everywhere in the world When people see this sign they know to take precautions and to follow proper conduct for science labs

There are four biosafety levels made by the Center of Disease Control These are used in laboratories so only people who have the right skills can enter Different levels mean scientists must wear different uniforms and take special care when dealing with dangerous things like viruses

Biosafety Level 1 The viruses handled in BSL 1 are not very dangerous and usually only cause mild sickness Diseases in BSL 1 include chicken pox and some E Coli strains People in BSL 1 have to wash their hands with soap wear gloves and put waste materials in specially marked bins

Biosafety Level 2 BSL 2 is filled with slightly more hazourdous diseases than BSL 1 They have to take more safety precautions has a result Hepatitis influenza HIV AIDS and salmonella are handled here

Biosafety Level 3 BSL 3 is for diseases that may kill but are less deadly than those in Level 4 SARS and yellow fever A lot of them are airborne and the lab must be in an closed off area in case of an incident

Biosafety Level 4 BSL 4 is for very hazardous diseases that kill many people and are hard to treat BSL 4 workers must be careful and alert at all times and wear suits with special air filters A lot of hemorrhagic fevers are dealt with in BSL 4 like Ebola Marburg and Lassa Virus

A petri dish is a small dish shaped like a cylinder Scientists use it to grow cells from animals fungus and diseases so they can study them They are usually made of glass or plastic The glass ones can be used again if they are heated at 160F Sometimes people fill them with agar which helps cells grow These are called agar plates Many people use them in science classes at school They have lids so germs in the air can not get into them or contaminate them and ruin the experiment

The dealer may choose to shuffle the deck The previous dealer on the left must cut the deck He must deal the all deck in three time

Once the card are dealt players start to bet on the number of point To bet the player need to tell the trump he wants and bet at least 10 point higher than the previous player The first player have to bet at least 80 half of all the point If a player have King and queen from the trump color the team get 20 bonus points Even though there is only 4 color in the game there is 6 kind of trump Clubs Diamonds Hearts Spades No trump All trumps When a player chooses no trump or all trump he must choose a color the points of this color will be count as trump all the other will be count as No trump

Every kind of belote share some basic rules

Trump J20 914 A11 1010 K4 Q3 80 70 Non trump A11 1010 K4 Q3 J2 90 80 70

The basic strategy of this game is to count the trump cards But it is also recommend to count all the other color the deck is small only 32 cards

Betting is the only way to communicate with a team mate that is why even if a hand is weak betting will help a fellow teammate to bet or play

A team will have to play a defending strategy if they have less trump than the other team The only rules with a defensive game is to save every point One should not expect more than one trick for each colors 

The usual strategy for the attacking team is to try make the opponent lose their trumps so they will not be able to cut the other trick Once it is done they may start to think about trying to get the ace or 10 card There is only one way to get an ace to cut it That is why whenever a team mate is about to take the current trick someone should play the colour in which someone has one less card To get a ten someone may play an ace at the second trick or cut it

Monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbohydrates They consist of one sugar and are usually colorless water soluble crystalline solids Some monosaccharides have a sweet taste 

Examples of monosaccharides include glucose fructose galactose and ribose Monosaccharides are the building blocks of disaccharides like sucrose and polysaccharides Further each carbon atom that supports a hydroxyl group is chiral giving rise to a number of isomeric forms all with the same chemical formula For instance galactose and glucose are both aldohexoses but they have different chemical and physical properties

Lactose is a disaccharide that consists of galactose and glucose molecules Lactose makes up around 2 8 of the solids in milk The name comes from the Latin word for milk plus the ose ending used to name sugars Lactose is found in milk products

Infant mammals are fed on by milk from their mothers To digest it an enzyme called lactase cleaves the lactose into its two subunits glucose and galactose for absorption

Glycogen is a polysaccharide that is the principal storage form of glucose in animal cells 

Glycogen is found in the form of granules in the cytosol in many cell types and plays an important role in the glucose cycle Glycogen forms an energy reserve that can be quickly mobilized to meet a sudden need for glucose but one that is less compact than the energy reserves of triglycerides Only the glycogen stored in the liver can be made accessible to other organs 

Pollutants are compounds which are dangerous to the environment

They can also be harmful to humans in the long term range They come from mineral and fossil sources or are produced by humans themselves

Many pollutants have a poisonous effect on the body Carbon monoxide is an example of a substance which is damaging to humans This compound is taken up in the body instead of oxygen That makes the body broken wikt linksuffocatesuffocate and in severe cases may lead to death

Some pollutants became dangerous by reaction with other naturally occurring compounds The oxides of nitrogen and sulfur are released from impurities in fossil fuels when they are burnt They react with water vapor in the atmosphere to become acid rain Acid rain damages buildings and makes lakes unable to support marine life which causes fish and water plants to die

Gabriel Pascal was a Hungarian movie producer and director

Gabriel Pascal was born in Transylvania in 1894 Pascal is best known for having turned some of the best plays by the famous Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw into successful movies His most famous movie made from one of Shaws plays was Pygmalion in 1938 Pygmalion tells the story of a bet that two rich men made over whether one of them Professor Higgins could turn a poor uneducated girl into a sophisticated lady The movie was so successful that after Gabriel Pascal died it was made into a huge Broadway musical called My Fair Lady and amazingly this musical was then made into another movie So Pygmalion was first a play then a movie based on the play then a play based on the movie and then a new play based on the movie made from the old play It is therefore quite a remarkable history and it was Gabriel Pascals idea to make the play a musical though he did not live long enough to do it himself

Gabriel Pascal invented his name and no one seems to know his real one He claimed to have memories of being rescued by Gypsies from a burning building when he was a tiny child and that the Gypsies taught him to beg steal and do acrobatic tricks but no one knows if this is true It is unclear what parts of his fabulous account of his childhood are true as there are no formal records of him prior to the age of 17 when he was enlisted in military school in Holics Hungary by a mysterious Catholic priest Gabriel Pascal who was decidedly unfit for military life became interested in theater and studied at the Academy of the Hofburg Theater in Vienna Later his interest expanded into the newly burgeoning cinema and he made films in Germany and Italy with sporadic success

Pascal had one son Peter conceived in Germany during the delirium of a fever with his landladys sister Elsie Unable to care even for himself Pascal fled to Holland After WWII ended at last on his feet with the success of Pygmalion and Major Barbara Pascal rushed to Germany to search for his son Peter but he was listed among the missing Hitler Youth Elsie had been killed by a bomb

As a young man Pascal found a job tending horses in Hungary Leading the horses through the forest to a stream each day Pascal developed the habit of riding bareback naked through the Hungarian countryside One day he accidentally rode stark naked through the outdoor set of a silent movie in production and was discovered The films director asked him to repeat the ride for the cameras and he joined the group Soon he was making his own movies

Pascal had another auspicious encounter when he was young while walking along the shore of the Mediterranean An old man George Bernard Shaw was swimming naked holding onto a buoy A conversation ensued and Shaw dared the young Pascal on the shore to take off his clothes and join him in the water He was impressed when Pascal immediately did so and this began their friendship Shaw was impressed with Pascals youthful enthusiasm for art and his bravado and invited him to come visit him one day when he was entirely broke This chance meeting was to play a major role in Pascals later career

Pascal began his producing career making silent movies in Italy for German distribution through UFA Studios in Berlin His directorial debut was Populi Morituri in which he also starred He later produced horror movies in Germany His most famous was Unholy Tales in 1932 It was an anthology of short spooky stories including some by Edgar Allan Poe tied together by the adventures of a black cat and is considered by some to be a forgotten horror classic

In 1933 during a trip to Hollywood Pascal was contacted by Princess Norina Matchabelli about a film project based on the teachings of her guru Meher Baba Pascal got very caught up in this project bringing movie writers Hy Kraft and Karl Vollmller into helping him work up treatments and even making a trip to India to discuss the project further with Meher Baba By the time Pascal arrived in India however Meher Baba did not seem in any hurry to complete the film saying it could wait and inviting Pascal to live with him in India Most ordinary men would have been discouraged but Pascal took energetically to the austere life of an eastern ascetic even shedding his western garb for eastern clothing He took a liking to Meher Baba and maintained a correspondence with him all of his life Meher Baba nicknamed Pascal Phoenix and alternately Panther 

Pascal remained in contact with his guru Meher Baba right up to the end of his life and met with him in person one last time in New York in 1952 Even in this final meeting there was mention of the film that Pascal had agreed to try to make for Baba

In time however Pascals desire to make his mark on cinema returned and Pascal took a ship back to America penniless but undaunted He landed in San Francisco where he spent some time deciding what to do next Then it struck him to approach George Bernard Shaw whom Pascal had met auspiciously many years earlier During that earlier meeting Shaw who had been impressed with the young Pascals passion for art and cinema had told him to pay him a visit when he was entirely penniless Pascal was now exactly that He then sought out Shaw first by going to NY hidden in the toilet of the train then convincing a sea captain to give him a lift to England

Somehow he did convince Shaw to give him the rights to his plays beginning with Pygmalion which was an enormous international hit both critically and financially Pascal followed up Pygmalion with Major Barbara which he directed as well as produced Major Barbara was filmed in London during the bombing by the Nazis During air raids the crew and cast had to dodge into bomb shelters Pascal never stopped the production and the film was completed on schedule But Pascal became more and more extravagant finally losing his credibility with Caesar and Cleopatra which was the most expensive British movie ever made at that time and a terrible financial and critical flop although it is more highly regarded today Pascal famously insisted on importing sand from Egypt to achieve the right cinematic colors for this extravaganza Shaw had become more difficult to work with also After the success of Pygmalion which was shortened in its transition from stage to screen as plays generally are he increasingly refused to let his plays be cut The result was that Major Barbara and Caesar and Cleopatra were not only filmed virtually complete but with additional scenes by Shaw himself Each of the two films ran over two hours

Pascal did manage to produce one more movie Androcles and the Lion in 1952 By this time he was increasingly sick with cancer of the liver

In spring of 1954 in New York City just before his passing Pascal had planned a trip to India to see Meher Baba one last time He was having an affair and divorcing his wife at the time One day he impulsively wrote on a piece of hotel stationery to his mistress If I die on my trip to India I leave my entire estate to you He signed and dated it before two witnesses a cook and a maid in the hotel who did not speak English but only Chinese This was an absurd gesture since Pascal was totally in debt He died within a short time of this letter in July 1954 and within two years of his death the musical My Fair Lady which Pascal had managed to retain an option on by borrowing money from a Baba follower named Margaret Scott opened on Broadway Thus soon after his death his estate which had been worth nothing on his deathbed grew to an estimated value of two million dollars There was a large court battle in which his wife Valerie and the mistress fought over his estate His odd last will and testament on the hotel stationery was entered as evidence in support of his mistress and the case was well publicized Several Meher Baba followers were involved in his life at the end including Harold Rudd who testified at his trial The result of the trial was an even split of Pascals royalties from My Fair Lady between the mistress and Pascals estranged wife each receiving well over one million dollars in settlement His wife Valerie attempted to pay back the borrowed option money to Margaret Scott but by the time the settlement came through Mrs Scott had fallen from a New York apartment window to her death Valerie therefore paid the money to Margarets daughter instead

Pascal is best remembered as one of the big Hungarian movie producers like the famous Alexander Korda He was the only producer ever to have major movie deals with seven separate countries on three continents Hungary Italy Germany China India England and the US He was also the only man to ever convince George Bernard Shaw to adjust his scripts to the new medium of cinema gaining concessions from Shaw that no other man could Pascal even invented the famous line for Pygmalion later appearing in the theatrical and film versions of My Fair Lady The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain and Shaw by now publicly referring to Pascal as a genius wrote the line into the script He was one of the most extravagant men of his time named in 1938 as one of the worlds most famous men by Time magazine along with Adolf Hitler He is less known for his deep interest in the spiritual and his boundless enthusiasm for art as a direct and honest route to God He is even less known for his lifelong devotion to spiritual master Meher Baba His life is well documented in the beautifully written biography by his wife Valerie The Disciple and His Devil published by McGraw Hill in 1970 and republished by iUniverse in 1984 After Pascals death Valerie married the famous publisher and philanthropist George T Delacorte Jr and spent the rest of her life supporting charitable foundations under the name Valerie Delacorte

John Taverner was the most important English composer of his time He was also an organist

We cannot be sure exactly when Taverner was born Some people think that he was a boy chorister at the church of Tattershall in Lincolnshire but his name does not appear on the list of choristers there People now think that he worked there later as a lay clerk

He got a job at Cardinal College in Oxford but he could not stay very long because King Henry VIII made lots of changes to the way people had to worship in church Taverner even hid some books which the king had forbidden under the floor and he got into trouble for doing this In the end the Cardinal did not punish him because he said he was only a musician

In 1530 he seems to have gone back to Lincolnshire and stayed there for the rest of his life He probably wrote no more music but he was quite rich

Taverner composed eight masses The most famous one is called the Western Wynde It was a parody mass which meant that it used a popular tune with that title Another mass was called Gloria tibi trinitas This work set a fashion for pieces which were called In Nomines because the tune was from the Benedictus in the mass which sets the words in nomine domine In nomines were compositions for instruments which used this tune

Taverner also wrote magnificats and motets

Sir John Tavener is an English composer He is one of the most important composers of today Most of his music is inspired by religion in some way

John Tavener went to Highgate School in North London Another pupil there at the time was John Rutter At school he studied piano organ and composition and wrote music for the school orchestra He also wrote music for the Presbyterian church where his family went and where his father was organist In 1962 he went to the Royal College of Music where he studied the piano at first but then changed to composition One of his early successes was a cantata called Cain and Abel which was performed by the London Bach Society It was the performance of The Whale by the London Sinfonietta in 1968 that made him really famous This work used collage pre recorded tape amplified percussion and a chorus who used loudhailers This kind of thing was very fashionable in the 1960s

Another work written in 1968 was In Alium It was performed at the Proms It was an unusual concert three works by living composers were played in the first half The audience were asked to vote for which one they wanted to hear again after the interval They chose In Alium

The Beatles became interested in Taveners music John Lennon heard The Whale and he decided to issue Taveners music on the newly formed Apple label

Tavener became professor of composition at Trinity College He continued to compose although he often had difficulty finishing pieces He was often worried that he might not be able to think of any new music In 1977 he became a member of the Russian Orthodox Church This changed his life His music was very religious He married his second wife and had two children He was also very ill with heart trouble and even died on the operating table in hospital but he brought back to life by the doctors

He made a very important friend Mother Thekla She was an 80 year old nun in the Orthodox Church and she gave John a lot of advice and encouragement in his life

Tavener was knighted in 2000

Escape velocity is the initial speed that something would need to completely escape the gravity of a large body like a star or a planet by mere inertia

If a ball is thrown upwards while standing on the ground the ball will reach a certain height and fall back down But imagine if ball is thrown fast enough that it never falls back down and instead travels into space farther and farther away from the Earth The minimum speed at which this could happen is called the escape velocity

The escape velocity at the surface of the Earth is 112 kilometers per second assuming there is no drag

This is of cause a very high speed compared to how fast a ball can be thrown Even a bullet shot into the sky will fall back down because its initial speed of nearly 1 kilometer per second is far from escape velocity

Spacecraft starting from the surface of Earth has a zero initial speed But if it has enough fuel it may be permanently accelerated by its engine until it reaches escape velocity Then it will travel into space even after the engine is shut off

A razor is a tool with one or more blades used by men for shaving the hair from their face and by women for shaving hair from their legs and underarms The earliest razors known are from the Bronze Age They were made of bronze and had an oval shape There are different kinds of razors today including straight razors which are rarely used and safety razors and electric razors

A slightly different type of electric razor is used to trim and cut hair from the head because hair can be cut much more quickly with electric haircutting razors than with scissors

Before the 20th century straight razors were widely used A straight razor consists of a knife blade which can be reused Since this blade is usually very sharp there is a high risk of cutting oneself with the razor while scraping off the hair Today such razors are rarely used any more 

In the late 18th century a French engineer Jean Jacques Perret With this system the skin is protected from all but the edge of the blade This makes cutting much harder The first such razor was released in 1875 by the Campfe Brothers In 1901 King Camp Gillette invented the first razor with disposable razor blades The blades were thrown away after each use The company Gilette still makes such razors today They sell the razor relatively cheap and make big profits on the razor blades

The electric razor was the next big step With electric razors shaving cream soap or water is no longer needed Electric razors use electricity to either make blades rotate or oscillate That is the blades are either moved in circles or they are moved up and down The razor is usually powered by a rechargeable battery Prof Alexandre Horowitz invented the concept of rotating blades which is still marketed as Philishave by Philips

A slightly different type of electric razor is used to trim and cut hair from the head Haircutting electric razors have comb like attachments which determine the length of the hair Electric haircutting razors are widely used by military and prison barbers because hair can be cut much more quickly with electric haircutting razors than with scissors

Shaving using any of the shaving methods can have side effects including cuts abrasions and irritated skin Razor bumps can also occur from removing ingrown hairs To reduce the likelihood of cuts abrasions and irritated skin people can use a fresh razor blade and prepare their faces by washing in hot soapy water and then applying a shaving cream lather

Like all echinoderms sea cucumbers have an endoskeleton just below the skin calcareous structures that are usually reduced to isolated ossicles joined by connective tissue These can sometimes be enlarged to flattened plates forming an armour In pelagic species the skeleton is absent

Sea cucumbers communicate with each other by sending hormone signals through the water

A remarkable feature of these animals is the collagen which forms their body wall This can be loosened and tightened at will If the animal wants to squeeze through a small gap it can undo the collagen connections and pour into the space To keep itself safe in these crevices the sea cucumber hooks up all its collagen fibres to make its body firm again 

The animals have an internal respiratory tree which floats in the internal watery cavity At the rear water is pumped in and out of the cloaca so gaseous exchange takes place with the resiratory tree in the gutp80 

Some species of coral reef sea cucumbers defend themselves by expelling sticky cuvierian tubules to entangle potential predators These tubules are attached to the respiratory tree in the gut When startled these cucumbers may expel the tubules through a tear in the wall of the cloaca In effect this squirts sticky threads all over a predator Replacement tubules grow back in one and a half to five weeks depending on the species The release of these tubules can also be accompanied by the discharge of a toxic chemical known as holothurin which has similar properties to soap This chemical can kill any animal in the vicinity and is one more way in which these sedentary animals can defend themselves Other cucumbers lacking this device can split their intestinal wall and spew out their gut and respiratory tree They regenerate them later Zoologists who experience this believe it to be an impressive deterrent The mess one individual can make must be seen to be believedp81

The existence of these defences explains why the holothurians were able to do without the strong skeleton of their ancestors

Highly modified tube feet around the mouth are always present These are branched and retractile tentacles much larger than the regular tube feet Sea cucumbers have between ten and thirty such tentacles depending on the species There is a ring of larger ossicles round the mouth and oesophagus to which the muscles of the tube feet are attached With their sticky tentacles the animal collects detritus and small organisms

Polysaccharides are relatively complex carbohydrates

They are polymers made up of many monosaccharides They are very large often branched molecules They tend to be amorphous insoluble in water and have no sweet taste

When all the constituent monosaccharides are of the same type they are termed homopolysaccharides when more than one type of monosaccharide is present they are termed heteropolysaccharides

Examples include storage polysaccharides such as starch and glycogen and structural polysaccharides such as cellulose and chitin

Starches are insoluble in water They can be digested by hydrolysis catalyzed by enzymes called amylases Humans and other animals have amylases so they can digest starches Potato rice wheat and maize are major sources of starch in the human diet

The structural components of plants are formed primarily from cellulose Wood is largely cellulose and lignin while paper and cotton are nearly pure cellulose Cellulose is a polymer made with repeated glucose units Humans and many other animals do not digest cellulose Certain animals can digest cellulose because bacteria possessing the enzyme are present in their gut The classic example is the termite

The Chincilla is a small rodent They live in the Andes in South America They are active during dusk and dawn Such an activity pattern is called crepuscular Together with the Viscacha they form the Chinchillidae family 

In their usual habitat chinchillas live either in burrows or in crevices of rocks They are good jumpers and can jump very high Chinchillas live in colonies The females are much bigger than the males Predators in the wild include hawks skunks felines and canines Wild chinchillas seem to feed on plants fruits seed and small insects

Chinchillas have been domesticated and are sometimes kept as pets Their diet is mostly based on hay Chinchillas make a variety of vocalizations including chirps squeaks and barks They can be found in a variety of colors and mutations 

There are two species of chinchilla Chinchilla brevicaudata and chinchilla lanigera The difference between the two species is small Currently Chinchilla brevicaudata seems to be facing extinction Chinchilla lanigera can still be found in the wild but has become rare Domesticated chinchillas seem to come from the lanigera species

Incisors are special kinds of teeth that can be found in some mammals such as humans They are the eight large flat teeth with straight edges that are at the front of a persons mouth in between the canine teeth which are pointed The straight edges of the incisors are useful for biting because they cut sharply They come together like a pair of pincers In a human the two teeth at the middle of each jaw are called the central incisors and the side ones are the lateral icisors Some humans never grow lateral incisors or have very small ones particularly at the top

In many herbivores these front teeth are uses to cut off stems of grass and other growing things that are then ground up by the molars at the back of the mouth Some omnivores like humans have incisors like herbivores In carnivores like cats the incisors are often quite small and the canine teeth are very long and suitable for tearing meat Carnivores use their incisors for many jobs that need fine control such as catching fleas carrying a kitten or peeling the skin off a fish If a dog or a member of the cat family needs to cut something with their teeth they use their back teeth like scissors

Pierre Boulez is one of the most important French composers of modern classical music He is also a very famous conductor

Boulez started his university studies by studying mathematics He then gave that up and went to the Paris Conservatoire to study music One of his teachers was Olivier Messiaen He wrote music in an atonal style similar to the serial music of Anton Webern Gradually his music became completely serial so that everything about the music the pitches of the notes the length of the notes the louds and softs the accents were all organized in a mathematical way This is called total serialism or integral serialism This kind of music is very strange to listen to

Boulez belonged to a group of composers who met in the summer at Darmstadt in Germany This group is often called the Darmstadt School He wrote music which was extremely hard to play eg Structures book 1 for two pianos

Perhaps his most famous piece is Le marteau sans matre This piece finished in 1957 is for a small group of instruments flute guitar vibraphone xylorimba percussion and viola and a singer It has very complicated rhythms and is influenced by jazz gamelan music African and Japanese music

Boulez then tried out new ideas He wrote works which would sound different at each performance because the players could improvise some ideas Pli selon pli was a work for orchestra and soprano It was based on a poem by Stphane Mallarm about a swan that could not fly away because it was stuck on the frozen lake His piece Eclat also uses improvisation The conductor is free to decide on how certain bits could be played and makes signs to the players to improvise in certain ways that the composers has written down This kind of composition is sometimes called Chance music because it is different each time it is played The American composer John Cage also experimented with Chance music

In the 1970s he became interested in electronic music The French president Georges Pompidou supported the building of a big Arts Centre in Paris This centre included a large underground set of studios for music It became known as IRCAM A lot of composers worked in IRCAM They used computers tape recorders etc to compose music

Boulez is also a world famous conductor He has conducted many of the worlds greatest orchestras He was the chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra from 1971 1975 the New York Philharmonic from 1971 1977 and now he is Conductor Emeritus of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra His concerts usually consist of music by the great 20th century composers such as Alban Berg Claude Debussy Gustav Mahler Arnold Schoenberg Igor Stravinsky Bla Bartk Anton Webern and Edgard Varseas well as lots of new music which he conducted when it had just been written 

Boulez has also written several books and articles on music 

The Old World rats and mice is a subfamily in the family Muridae It has about 560 species This subfamily is larger than all mammal families except the Cricetidae It is also larger than all mammal orders except the bats and the remainder of the rodents

Probably the best known genera are rats and mice 

The Murinae are native to Africa Europe Asia and Australia They are the only terrestrial placental mammals native to Australia They have also been introduced to all continents except Antarctica They are serious pest animals This is particularly true in island communities where they have contributed to the endangerment and extinction of many native animals

Two prominent murine human commensals have become vital laboratory animals The Brown Rat and House Mouse are both used for medical tests They are among a handful of animals where the full genome has been sequenced

The murines have a distinctive molar pattern that involves three rows of cusps instead of two the primitive pattern seen most frequently in muroid rodents

The first known appearance of the Murinae in the fossil record is about 14 million years ago with the fossil genus Antemus Antemus is thought to come directly from Potwarmus which has a more primitive tooth pattern Likewise two genera Progonomys and Karnimata are thought to derive directly from Antemus Progonomys is thought to be the ancestor of Mus and relatives while Karnimata is thought to lead to Rattus and relatives All of these fossils are found in the well preserved and easily dated Siwalik fossil beds of Pakistan The transition from Potwarmus to Antemus to Progonomys and Karnimata is considered an excellent example of anagenic evolution 

Most of the Murinae have been poorly studied Some genera have been grouped such as the hydromyine water rats conilurine or pseudomyine Australian mice or the phloeomyine Southeast Asian forms No tribal level taxonomy has been attempted for the complete subfamily It looks like genera from southeast Asian islands and Australia may be early offshoots compared to mainland forms The vlei rats in the genera Otomys and Parotomys are often placed in a separate subfamily Otomyinae They have been shown to be closely related to African murines in spite of their uniqueness

Castorimorpha is the suborder of rodents containing the beavers the pocket gophers and the kangaroo rats

In music an arpeggio is a group of notes in a chord which are played one after the other instead of all at the same time The arpeggio may either go up or go down but it is more common going up 

The word arpeggio comes from the Italian word arpeggiare which means to play on a harp This is because harps are very good at playing arpeggiated chords 

An arpeggio is a type of broken chord but there are many different kinds

Learning many musical instruments include playing scales and arpeggios They are often played as part of music examinations especially for piano and the string instruments This is because these skills are useful for playing a lot of music For example Bachs Prelude in C is made of many different arpeggios Guitarists sometimes play arpeggios instead of strumming and banjo players do it a lot 

An arpeggiated chord means a chord which is spread This means the notes do not start exactly at the same time This is sometimes called arpeggiato and in modern music is called a rolled chord An arpeggiated chord is written with a wiggly line going from top to bottom in front of the chord An arpeggiated chord is spread from the lowest to the highest note Occasionally composers such as Bla Bartk ask for them to be played from top to bottom This is shown by adding an arrow pointing down

The NKVD or Peoples Commisariat for Internal Affairs was a government department which handled a number of the Soviet Unions affairs of state 

The NKVD is best known for the Main Directorate for State Security which came after the OGPU and the Cheka as the secret police agency of the Soviet Union and which became KGB Many think of the NKVD as a criminal group This is mostly because of the activities of GUGB officers and investigators The NKVD was also in charge of Stalins foreign intelligence service and overseas special operations These NKVD sub branches hired spies and gathered of political military and economic information from other countries They also got rid of political enemies who lived outside of the Soviet Union and enforced Stalins policies within Communist Party movements in other countries 

In addition to its state security and police functions some of its departments handled other matters such as transportation fire guards border guards etc These jobs were usually assigned to the Ministry of the Interior

Duccio di Buoninsegna was one of the most important painters in Italy in the Late Middle Ages He worked mainly in the city of Siena in Tuscany but one of his largest works was done for a church in Florence He is most famous for his altarpieces of the Madonna and Child Duccio painted in the Byzantine style similar to Greek icons 

The first written record of Duccio is dated 1278 when he was painting in Siena His paintings of which only a few remain are all Holy pictures Two of them are very large and were painted as altarpieces Some of them are very small and were for a private owner not for a church 

At that time many artists did painting that were made specially for people to look at they were praying The pictures are most often of the Madonna and Child They often have gold backgrounds which glow when they are lit by candlelight The figures in the paintings do not look very solid or realistic They look very still calm and holy These paintings had been done in the same style for many hundreds of years in Greece Constantinople and many other countries where the Greek Orthodox Church was the main church The style which was called the Byzantine style had also spread to Italy where several Orthodox icons had become famous and were copied by many artists 

Duccio was one of the greatest painters in the Byzantine style in Italy at the time He had a famous rival who worked in Florence His name was Cimabue One of Cimabues pupils Giotto was to become even more famous and is remembered as having begun the Renaissance style of painting in Florence Even though Duccio probably saw Giottos paintings in which the figures look solid and three dimensional like actors on a stage Duccio was not very influenced by him 

Duccio had several students who also became famous painters of the 1300s They include Simone Martini and the Lorenzetti brothers who were also influenced by Giotto 

In 1285 Duccio was asked to go to Florence to paint an altarpiece of the Madonna and Child for the church of Santa Maria Novella which had been rebuilt for the Domincan friars It was a very large church and for it Duccio painted the biggest ancient altarpiece of this type that is known It is called the Rucellai Madonna because the Rucellai who were a very rich family paid for the decoration of the main chapel of the church where this altarpiece was hung in the 1600s 

Duccio painted the Madonna sitting on a throne with the Christ Child in her lap raising his hand in blessing Around them are six kneeling angels in robes of delicate colours The robe of the Madonna is very dark blue and looks almost black it is painted with ground up semi precious stone called lapis lazuli The robe of the baby looks quite transparent Duccio was one of the first painters to try to paint transparent material One of the important parts of Duccios design is the gold border of the Madonnnas robe which seems to wander around the painting in a waving line and frames the Madonnas face in a way that holds the attention of the viewer 

The Rucellai Madonna is no longer in the Church of Santa Maria Novella In 1948 it was moved to the Ufizzi Gallery where it is shown in the same room as Cimabues Trinita Madonna and Giottos Ognisanti Madonna 

The Maest In Duccios own city there was a large cathedral In 1308 he was given the job of making an enormous altarpiece of the Madonna on a throne for the cathedral It was not to be as tall as the Rucellai Madonna but was much wider because it showed two rows of saints and a row of angels on either side of the throne The four saints the kneel at the front of the picture are those who were particularly remembered in the city of Siena The altarpiece was to have a very fancy Gothic gold frame with more figures at the top and small pictures at the bottom but unfortunately the frame has been destroyed 

Because the painting stood above an altar that was right in the middle of the cathedral and not against a wall it was easy for people to walk around to see the back of the altarpiece So Duccio painted the back as well The back of the altarpiece had lots of small scenes which tell the life of Jesus These small scenes which have gold backgrounds and bright colours in the usual way are very lively illustrations to the Bible stories 

After three years the altarpiece was finished It was carried in a great procession from Duccios workshop up the hill to the cathedral which stood on the highest point of the city It was called the Maest Four other artists were asked to do smaller altarpieces to go in the four chapels that were nearby

Unfortunately in the 1700s people at the cathedral thought that Duccios altarpiece was old fashioned It was taken to pieces and some of the smaller parts were sold They can be seen in the National Gallery London and other places Luckily most of the pieces were kept together and can now be seen in the Cathedral Museum which is near Siena Cathedral

The bacillus was discovered by the physician Alexandre Yersin during an epidemic of the plague in Hong Kong in 1894 Yersin worked for the Pasteur Institute at the time Originally the microoganism was named Pasteurella pestis It was renamed in 1967

Currently three varieties of Y pestis are known 

Historians are currently divided about the role of Ypestis in the Black Death Some historians said that the Black Death spread far too fast Therefore Ypestis could not have caused it DNA from Ypestis has been found in the teeth of some of the victims of the Black Death For this reason Ypestis must have been at least a factor in some European plague epidemics

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease It is caused by spirochaetes of the genus Leptospira This bacterium affects humans and many animals including mammals birds amphibians and reptiles It was first described by Adolf Weil in 1886 At the time he reported an acute infectious disease with enlargement of spleen jaundice and nephritis The pathogen Leptospira genus bacteria was isolated in 1907 from a post mortem kidney slice

Leptospirosis is a relatively rare bacterial infection in humans The infection is commonly transmitted to humans by allowing fresh water that has been contaminated by animal urine to come in contact with the skin eyes or with the mucous membranes 

It usually causes heart failure kidney failure or liver failure and most suffers die if they are not treated urgently Dont worry its quite rare 

Except for tropical areas Leptospirosis seems to occur most often in the months August to September in the Northern Hemisphere

In 1762 Gossec became the conductor of a private theatre of the Prince of Cond at Chantilly A lot of German and Bohemian wind players at that time went to Paris and Gossec gave them jobs in his orchestra

Gossec wrote a lot of music for the French Revolution When the Paris Conservatoire was opened in 1795 he became a teacher of composition there

Gossec composed lots of different kinds of music His music for instruments was very successful He wrote operas which suited the taste of French people at the time but he did not have a good sense of drama and the words of his operas were uninteresting He was an important man in the history of music because he organized a lot of musical events in Paris He was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour A lot of composers went to his funeral

An oath is a promise An oath is spoken out loud in front of other people who can see and hear what is done and said They are witnesses to the oath A person who cannot speak can make a sign that they are taking an oath Another way of saying that a person is taking an oath is to say that they are swearing an oath 

A person can say I promise that I will do this or I swear that I will do this 

When a person swears an oath they often show that the oath is very important to them by calling God to see and remember the promise and to show that the promise is true and cannot be taken back later When a person takes an oath they sometimes raise their right hand or put their hand on their heart on the Bible or on another holy book

Oaths are used in many situations when a person needs to be true to what they say 

The word oath is often used to mean any angry expression which includes religious or other strong language and promises that the person will do something horrible

Originally a firewall was a wall that was built to stop the spread of a fire In terms of computer security a firewall is a piece of hardware or software The firewall is there to look at the traffic passing through it Based on a set of rules traffic can be allowed or it can be blocked A firewall therefore protects one part of the network against unauthorized access

Data travels on the internet in small pieces these are called packets Each packet has certain metadata attached like where it is coming from and where it should be sent to The easiest thing to do is to look at the metadata Based on rules certain packets are then dropped or rejected All firewalls can do this

In addition to the simple packet filtering this kind of firewall also keeps track of connections A packet can be the start of a new connection or it can be part of an existing connection If it is neither of the two it is probably useless and can be dropped

Application layer firewalls do not just look at the metadata they also look at the actual data transported They know how certain protocols work for example FTP or HTTP They can then look if the data that is in the packet is valid If it is not it can be dropped

Firewalls can provide a secure connection between two networks This is called tunnelling The data may be encrypted It is unencrypted at the other end Since the firewalls are doing this the rest of the network is unaware of it An alternative is to provide a secure access

Very often firewalls can translate IP addresses That way many computers can share a few public IP addresses The firewall translates between the public and the private IP addresses

In general there are two types of firewalls

Firewalls can protect against some problems that come from the internet They cannot protect against viruses that come from infected media

Flurbereinigung is a word used in Germany to refer to the rearranging of fields in agriculture During the second half of the 20th century Flurbereinigung has led to major changes in the landscape in the German countryside

Many German farmers used to have several small fields which were not together but were in different places some of them maybe two or three miles away from where they lived This was particularly a problem in the area to the left of the Rhine which had been ruled by Napoleon because in the 19th century when a farmer and his wife had died their land was shared between all their children so it got divided into smaller pieces In other parts of Germany only the eldest son inherited the land 

Since the 1960s people understood that it would be much easier for a farmer to have all his fields together so that he did not have to keep making journeys between lots of small fields Larger fields are easier to manage and more economical The German government encouraged farmers to swap some of their fields among themselves so that each farmer had his land all in one place

In the last few years the government have realized that the way the changes have been made are not always good Nature often suffers when hedgerows are taken away to make fields bigger Flurbereinigung today tries to keep some of the hedgerows and small groups of trees which sometimes stand in the middle of fields They are good places for birds to nest and other animals like to live there too

Winegrowers do not always find it a good thing to have all their land together This is because the soil in one field may be slightly different from the soil in a field just farther up the road and this gives the wine a slightly different taste Also if all their land is on one hillside and a storm hits that hillside and ruins the crops then they have lost everything If they have several pieces of land in different places they are less likely to lose all their crops because of one disaster

An ecozone or biogeographic realm is the largest scale biogeographic division of the earths surface

These divisions are based on the historic and evolutionary distribution of plants and animals Ecozones represent large areas of the earths surface where plants and animals developed in relative isolation over long periods of time and are separated from one another by geologic features such as oceans broad deserts or high mountain ranges that formed barriers to plant and animal migration Ecozones correspond to the floristic kingdoms of botany or zoogeographic regions of mammal zoology

Ecozones are characterized by the evolutionary history of the plants and animals they contain As such they are distinct from biomes also known as major habitat types which are divisions of the earths surface based on life form or the adaptation of plants and animals to climatic soil and other conditions Biomes are characterized by similar climax vegetation regardless of the evolutionary lineage of the specific plants and animals Each ecozone may include a number of different biomes A tropical forest in Central America for example may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type but these forests are inhabited by plants and animals with very different evolutionary histories

The patterns of plant and animal distribution in the worlds ecozones was shaped by the process of plate tectonics which has redistributed the worlds land masses over geological history

The term ecozone as used here is a fairly recent development and other terms including kingdom realm and region are used by other authorities with the same meaning J Schultz uses the term ecozone to refer his classification system of biomes

In 1975 Miklos Udvardy proposed a system of 203 biogeographical provinces which were grouped into eight biogeographical realms Udvardys goal was to create an integrated ecological land classification system that could be used for conservation purposes

imageEcozonespngthumb250pxrightMap of six of the worlds eight ecozones

The WWF ecozones are based largely on the biogeographic realms of Pielou and Udvardy A team of biologists convened by the World Wide Fund for Nature developed a system of eight biogeographic realms as part of their delineation of the worlds over 800 terrestrial ecoregions

The WWF scheme is broadly similar to Udvardys system the chief difference being the delineation of the Australasian ecozone relative to the Antarctic Oceanic and Indomalayan ecozones In the WWF system The Australasia ecozone includes Australia Tasmania the islands of Wallacea New Guinea the East Melanesian islands New Caledonia and New Zealand Udvardys Australian realm includes only Australia and Tasmania he places Wallacea in the Indomalayan Realm New Guinea New Caledonia and East Melanesia in the Oceanian Realm and New Zealand in the Antarctic Realm

In ecology biomass means the cumulation of living matter That is it is the total living biological material in a given area or of a biological community or group Biomass is measured by weight or by dry weight per given area 

The most successful animal in terms of biomass is the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba with a biomass of probably over 500 million tons roughly twice the total biomass of humans Biomass may also be a measure of the dried organic mass of an ecosystem 

An amorphous solid is a solid in which there is no long range order of the positions of the atoms Most classes of solid materials can be found or prepared in an amorphous form For instance common window glass is an amorphous ceramic many polymers are amorphous and even foods such as cotton candy are amorphous solids

Amorphous materials are often prepared by rapidly cooling molten material such as glass Examples Glass candle wax cotton candy 

Climate commitment describes the fact that climate reacts slowly to factors such as greenhouse gases Climate commitment studies attempt to measure the amount of future warming that is committed under the assumption of some constant level of forcings

Nuclear energy is the energy that holds together the nucleii of atoms Atoms are the most simple blocks that make up matter Every atom has in its center a very small nucleus Normally nuclear energy is hidden inside the atoms However some atoms are radioactive and send off part of their nuclear energy as radiation Radiation is given off from the nucleus of unstable isotopes of radioactive substances 

Nuclear energy can also be freed in two other ways nuclear fusion and nuclear fission Nuclear fusion is the combining of two atoms into one and nuclear fission is the splitting of an atom Both ways make big amounts of energy They sometimes take place in nature Fusion is the source of heat in the sun Fission is also used in nuclear power plants to make electricity Both fusion and fission can be used in nuclear weapons

The Employment Non Discrimination Act is a proposed US law in the US Congress If voted into law it would stop an employer from firing an employee because he or she is gay lesbian bisexual or transgender The law would not apply to churches and other religious organizations It is also known as HR 2015 It was introduced on April 24 2007

The first proposed law to protect gay workers was introduced in the US Congress in 1974 but none were voted into law In 1996 the proposed law failed in the Senate by one vote This is the first time a law has included gender identity in addition to sexual orientation

Currently California Connecticut the District of Columbia Hawaii Illinois Maine Maryland Massachusetts Minnesota Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York Rhode Island Vermont Washington and Wisconsin have state laws that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation andor gender identity

This is intended to address cases where gay lesbian bisexual andor transgender employees have been discriminated against by their employer because of their sexual orientation or gender identity These employees are not currently protected by the US federal courts 

Opponents of the law often argue that sexual orientation and gender identity are a choice unlike other protected factors such as gender race and religion and thus should not be equally protected They also often argue that homosexuality is unnatural or immoral They also often present religious arguments against the law 

Previous bills have not included transgender people The new bill would protect transgender people and its inclusion has been debated in the GLBT community In August 2004 the Human Rights Campaign an important LGBT organization in favor of the bill said it will only support the bill if it includes transgender people 

In 1999 the ngltforg National Gay and Lesbian Task Force was the first gay civil rights group to stop work on ENDA because it did not include transgender people The group has worked to build approval in the community to support a bill that includes transgender people It participated in redrafting the current trans inclusive bill

If there is no ADH in the blood the kidneys leave the water in the urine and the bladder holds more liquid This means you need to go to the toilet more often

Caecilians completely lack limbs For this reason the smaller species resemble worms while the larger species with lengths up to 15 m are similar to snakes The tail is short and the cloaca is near the end of the body Their skin is smooth and usually dark in colour Some species have colorful skins though Inside the skin are calcite scales This suggests that they may be related to the fossil StegocephaliaScientists believe that the scales are a secondary development If this was the case they would not directly have been inherited from Stegocephalia Due to their underground life the eyes are small Skin often covers them to protect them This has led to the idea that they are blind which is not the case Because of the skin cover their seeing is limited to simple dark light perception They can tell the difference between dark and light All Caecilians have two tentacles at their head The tentacles are probably used for a second smelling capability in addition to the normal sense of smell based in the nose

Most Caecilians have lungs So far only one species named Atretochoana eiselti is known that does not have lungs As of 2007 there was only one sample of this species That sample had been collected somewhere in South America Those that have lungs also use the skin or the mouth to get oxygen Often the left lung is much smaller than the right one This is an adaptation to the shape of the body It can also be found in snakes

Caecilians can be found in most of the tropical regions of South East Asia Africa the Seychelles islands and South America except the dry areas and high mountains In South America they can be found well into the temperate north of Argentina They can be seen as far south as Buenos Aires when they are carried by the flood waters of the Parana river coming from farther north No studies have been made in central Africa but it is likely that caecilians are found in the tropical rainforests there The northernmost distribution is of the species Ichthyophis sikkimensis of Northern India In Africa caecilians are found from Guinea Bissau until Northern Zambia In South East Asia the Wallace Line is not crossed and they are not found in Australia or the islands in between Ichthyophis is also found in South China and North Vietnam

Caecilians are the only order of amphibians which only use internal insemination The male Caecilians have a penis like organ the phallodeum which is inserted into the cloaca of the female for 2 to 3 hours About 25 of the species are oviparous the eggs are guarded by the female For some species the young caecilians are already metamorphosed when they hatch other hatch as larvae The larvae are not fully aquatic but spend the daytime in the soil near the water

75 of the species are viviparous meaning that they give birth to already developed offspring The fetus is fed inside the female with special cells of the oviduct which are eaten by the fetus with special scraping teeth Some larvae such as those of Typhlonectes are born with enormous external gills which are shed almost immediately The egg laying species Boulengerula taitanus feeds its young by developing a special outer layer of skin which the young peel off with similar teeth Ichthyophis is oviparous and is also known to show maternal care

The diet of caecilians is not known well though it seems it mostly consists of insects and invertebrates found in the habitat of the respecitive species The stomach content of 14 specimens of Afrocaecilia taitana consisted of mostly undefinable organic material and plantal remains Where identifiable remains were most abundant they were found to be termite heads While it was suggested that the undefinable organic material shows that the caecilians eat detritus others believe these are in fact the remains of earthworms Caecilians in captivity can be easily fed with earthworms and worms are also common in the habitat of many caecilian species

The name Caecilian derives from the Latin word caecus blind referring to the small or sometimes non existing eyes The name dates back to the taxonomic name of the first species described by Carolus Linnaeus which he gave the name Caecilia tentaculata The taxonomic name of the order derives from the Greek words and as the caecilians were originally thought to be related to snakes

Taxonomically the caecilians are divided into 6 families The species numbers are approximate and many of these species are identified on the basis of only one specimen It is likely that not all species have been described yet and that some of the species described below as different may be combined into one species in future reclassifications

A Swiss researcher Daniel Hofer has recently found that certain caecilians produce potent skin poisons from specialized poison glands The poison prevents predation and the poison of the bright yellow caecilian of So Tom Island in West Africa kills other animals kept in the same tank within a few days The chemical contents of caecilian poison have not been well studied Werner Himstedt has shown that the skin glands of Ichthyophis protects the eggs from germs and fungi It has also been shown that these poisons are very different from those from other amphibians such as the arrow poison frogs

The hatchlings of the oviparous East African Boulengerula taitanus have special teeth that allow them to peel and eat their mothers skin The mothers skin in this species was found to be thicker than normal and contained a high level of fat and other nutrients

A bullet proof vest is a protective piece of clothing that covers the torso of a person It protects the wearer from most pistol and revolver bullets and from fragments of explosive devices such as grenades Bullet proof vests are worn by police officers soldiers security guards and people who are at risk of being shot

Bullet proof vests contain many layers of tightly woven fabric such as Kevlar which can stop the metal pistol or revolver bullets or metal shell fragments from going into a persons body

When a bullet hits a bullet proof vest the force of the bullet can seriously hurt the person wearing the vest even if the bullet does not pierce the vest 

A bullet from a strong sniper or machine gun can pierce a bullet proof vest 

If a bullet hits a body part that the bullet proof vest does not cover the bullet can hurt or kill the person wearing the vest

The bullet proof vests worn by most police officers and security guards are made with many layers of tightly woven fabric such as Kevlar

Bullet proof vests for soldiers are heavier and stronger than the bullet proof vests worn by police officers and security guards because soldiers need protection from rifle and machine gun bullets Bullet proof vests for soldiers often have flat pieces of ceramic material or a strong metal such as titanium These materials can stop bullets from many rifles and machine guns

A dry suit is a type of protective clothing worn by scuba divers who are swimming in very cold water such as in the Arctic ocean or the North Atlantic ocean A dry suit is similar to a wetsuit in that it helps to insulate the divers body from the cold of the ocean However a wetsuit lets water to touch the divers body but a dry suit is sealed so it does not allow water to touch the divers body This means that a dry suit offers more protection from the cold ocean water

A gauntlet is a protective covering that is used in some gloves and mittens A gauntlet protects the wrists and the lower part of the forearm Gloves or mittens for motorcycle drivers snowmobile drivers construction workers forestry workers and mountain climbers often have gauntlets The gauntlet helps to protect the wrist and forearm from cold and from being scraped or cut if there is an accident

The gauntlet of a glove or mitten is usually made from a material that is similar to the protective fabric or material used elsewhere on the glove or mitten A pair of leather motorcycle gloves with gauntlets will usually have leather gauntlets A pair of insulated nylon snowmobilers mittens with gauntlets will usually have gauntlets made from insulated nylon fabric

The word gauntlet is sometimes used in the following figure of speech to throw down the gauntlet If a person says that Fred threw down the gauntlet at the committee meeting last night they mean that Fred issued a public challenge at the committee meeting

Another figure of speech is the phrase run the gauntlet This means to face a trial or test For example if a sailor commits an offense his comrades may form a line and each comrade will hit the sailor as he passes by the line This is called running the gauntlet

Nylon is one of the most commonly used polyamides Nylon is a silky material which was first used in toothbrushes It is found in clothes most polyamide that is produced is used for synthetic fibres in clothing Nylon can also be used to make war materials such as parachutes and ropes Nylon was first produced on February 28 1935 by Wallace Carothers at Du Pont Nylon is like silk in appearance It is strong hard and water resistant It is used in manufacture of string ropesstring for tyres carpet net for fishing and cloth or parachute

A mitten is a type of protective clothing used to cover the hand The word is usually used in its plural form since people have two hands Mittens are similar to gloves in that they cover the hand and help to keep it warm in cold weather However while gloves have coverings for four fingers and a thumb mittens only have a covering for all of the fingers and for the thumb 

Mittens keep a persons hands warm in very cold weather better than gloves For this reason people who do sports in very cold temperatures often wear mittens instead of gloves Arctic explorers and snowmobile drivers in Northern Canada usually wear mittens in the extreme cold

A mountain climber is a person who goes up mountains and cliffs Mountain climbers use the strength of their arms and legs to climb up mountains Many mountain climbers use ropes and wear special shoes and safety equipment

Most mountain climbers go up mountains as a hobby or recreational activity A small number of mountain climbers do mountain climbing as an occupation They get paid by outdoor clothing companies or universities to climb up mountains or they are hired as a guide by recreational mountain climbers

Climbing mountains can be dangerous each year people are seriously injured or killed from falling being covered in an avalanche of snow or getting too cold To reduce the risks mountain climbers learn how to climb safely As well they wear safety equipment such as helmets and use ropes compasses and first aid kits 

Mountain climbers in snowy areas who face the danger of being buried in an avalanche of snow also bring other equipment such as shovels radio transmitters and long poles

A figure of speech is an way of saying a message Many figures of speech are not meant to be understood exactly as they are said 

A common figure of speech in North America is to say that someone threw down the gauntlet This does not usually mean that a person threw a protective wrist covering down on the ground Instead it usually means that the person issued a public challenge to another person

In Object oriented programming languages inheritance is a way to add functionality Object oriented programming has the notion of classes A derived class inherits most fields and methods from its parent class It can modify the behaviour of the parent by adding new fields and methods or by modifying existing ones Depending on the programming language used there may be certain restrictions when extending a class 

Inheritance can be used to solve different types of problems

An example can be a Car class You could create a Ferrari class which would inherit from Car and also make a Toyota class which would also inherit from Car This way all the fields and methods would also be inside of Ferrari and Toyota and you wouldnt need to copy the code twice However maybe inside of Car you could have a brand field This brand field would be equal to nothing but inside of Ferrari the field might be equal to ferrari and in Toyota to toyota Of course you couldnt just create a Car because otherwise that field would be missing In order to prevent people from just creating a Car you turn the Car into an abstract class

Dingo is a mammal found in Australia and South East Asia Dingos are similar to domestic dogs Dingos were brought to Australia from South East Asia about 4000 years ago They are not found in Tasmania as the sea levels cut the island off from mainland Australia about 10000 years ago Most dingos in the wild are no longer purebreed dingos Their scientific name Canis lupis dingo changed recently from Canis familiaris dingo This was to show it is related to the white footed wolf which lives in Asia

Dingos are usually between 117cm to 124cm in length Their tail is about 30cm in length They usually weigh between 10kg and 20kg The colour of their fur is usually yellow ginger but can sometimes include tan black white or sandy colours They live for about 14 years

Dingos live in packs of between 3 and 12 but they can be seen alone as well The leaders are the alpha male and the alpha female and are usually the only pair to breed Young dingos are called cubs The breeding season is in March and April After a gestation of 63 days the adult females usually give birth to 4 5 cubs in a litter Mothers will regurgitate food for the cubs to eat They become independent of their mother after four to eight months of age

Dingos do not bark like other dogs but they do howl

Dingos are carnivores and eat other animals such as kangaroos wallabies wallaroos rabbits rodents lizards sheep calves poultry and carrion It believed to have hunted several animal species to extinction including some species of bandicoots and rat kangaroos They often hunt in packs

While some people keep dingos as pets they are regarded as a pest by farmers They are controlled by trapping shooting poisoning and fences The dingo fence which runs through South Australia and then along the New South Wales border through to central Queensland is the worlds longest fence Dingos are protected in national parks and reserves

It is illegal to have a dingo as a pet in South Australia Queensland and Tasmania In Victoria and the Northern Territory you have to nave a special permit to keep a dingo The dingo can be a dangerous animal and have attacked people at times On April 30 2001 a nine year old boy was attacked and killed on Fraser Island by a dingo A dingo is believed to have killed a baby Azaria Chamberlain at Uluru in August 1980 This became a world famous case when her mother was sent to jail for murdering the baby She was later found innocent and released Evil Angels a book about Azaria by John Bryson was made into a movie starring Meryl Streep

Silk Road was a group of trade routes that went across Asia to the Mediterranean Sea This let China trade with other places 

It was named the silk road because there was a lot of silk traded along it Silk was then only made in China Because the traders came from many places different ideas were brought to China and Chinas ideas were taken to other places The Silk Road earned China a lot of money Some of the things the Chinese traded were silk porcelain rice and spices

Trade on the Silk Road was a big part in the growth of the ancient cultures of China Egypt Mesopotamia Persia India and Rome and helped to make the beginning of todays world Silk road is English for the German word Seidenstrae The first person who called it that was a German geographer in 1877

The Silk Road first travels west from North China The part of the Silk Road on land splits into north and south roads to move around the Tibetan Plateau

After the two parts come back together it goes in an almost straight line west through mountains in north Iran and the north tip of the Syrian Desert to the Levant From there Mediterranean trading ships took routes to Italy and land routes went north through Anatolia or south to North Africa

The part of the Silk Road on water stretches from South China to the Philippines Brunei Siam Malacca Ceylon India Pakistan and Iran

In Europe it stretches from Israel Lebanon Egypt and Italy In the Mediterranean Sea it goes to Portugal and Sweden

The Buddhist religion and the Greco Buddhist culture started to move east on the Silk Road going to China from around the 100s BCTrading also helped make many arts and crafts brought different religions and food to China Chinese people helped build the Silk Road They bought and sold with other people and built up their culture The Kushan empire in the northwest part of India was in the middle of these trades

The Silk Road brought other cultures into Central Asia and China It also helped the rise of the Mongol Empire the largest land empire ever

The Roman Empire which bought a lot of Chinese goods began to fall from power in the West around the 5th century In Central Asia Islam expanded starting in the 7th century This brought a stop to Chinese west growth at a battle in 751 AD More growth of the Islamic Turks in Central Asia from the 10th century stopped trade in that part of the world

Isis was a goddess in Egyptian mythology She was the sister and wife of Osiris and they had a son named Horus Isis also protected children and was one of the greatest goddesses She was also the greatest magician and goddess of magic

The English pronunciation used ass comes from the pronunciation of the Greek name which changed the Egyptian name by adding a final s because of the grammatical requirements of Greek noun endings

The Egyptian name was recorded as st or st and meant Throne However the true Egyptian pronunciation is not known because their writing system left out vowels Based on recent studies the reconstructed pronunciation of her name is sat Later the name in Coptic dialects was se or si

To make it easier to say Egyptologists choose to say the word as ee set Sometimes they may also say ee sa This is because the last t in her name was a feminine suffix which is known to have been dropped in speech in the last stages of the Egyptian language

Isis had great healing powers along with her being a magician and a protector She could even cast spells on Ra An example of her powers is when Isis brought Osiris back to life for one night Though the powers of Isis are strong there are even things she could not do like she could only bring back Osiris to life for a night

Isis had a sun disk and horns on her head She appeared as a queen Sometimes Isis is called the egg of the goose because Geb is the father of Isis and goose represents him She also had the throne sign on her head

Many Egyptian gods and goddesses started in one place and all through their history had their own city where they were worshipped and many big cities and towns are known as the hometowns of their god or goddess However no local cities where Isis was worshipped have been found all through her early history there are no known temples to her Worship of Isis did not start until as late as the 30th dynasty until that time Isis was worshiped in temples of other gods or goddesses However even in the 30th dynasty Isis was worshiped together with Horus and Osiris Temples to Isis became common in the Roman times There was a temple built to her at Philae

By this time temples to Isis began to spread outside of Egypt In many places her followers took over the worship to the Semitic goddess Astarte because of the similarity of names In the Hellenic era because she was known as a protector and mother she also became the goddess of sailors

In all parts of the Graeco Roman world Isis became one of the most important figures of the mystery religions and many classical writers sometimes wrote about her temples and followers Temples to Isis were built in Iraq Greece Rome even as far north as England where the remains of a temple were found at Hadrians Wall At Philae she was worshiped until the 6th century after the rise of Christianity The fall of her temples is usually said to mark the end of ancient Egypt

Little information on Egyptian priests of Isis has been found but we know that there were both priests and priestesses of her followers all through her history By the Graeco Roman era many of them were healers and were said to have many other powers including explaining dreams and the power to control the weather by braiding or combing their hair

In Egyptian mythology Osiris was the god of life death and the flooding of the Nile He was the brother and husband of Isis They had a son named Horus Osiris was murdered by his brother Seth because Osiris was pharaoh which Seth wanted to be Osiris was killed when Seth tricked him into getting into a box then pouring lead onto the box to seal it so Osiris could not get out of it However Isis brought Osiris back to life for one night After Horus was old enough he defeated Seth and became the pharaoh Osiris mother was goddess Nut father Geb sister Nephthys and wife and sister Isis

By the Hellenic era Greek awareness of Osiris had grown and attempts had been made to merge Greek philosophy such as Platonism and the cult of Osiris resulting in a new mystery religion Gradually this became more popular and was exported to other parts of the Greek sphere of influence However these mystery religions valued the change in wisdom personality and knowledge of truth rather than the exact details of the accepted myths on which their teachings were overlayed Thus in each region that it was exported to the myth was changed to be about a similar local god resulting in a series of gods who had originally been quite distinct but who were now synonymous with Osiris These gods became known as Osiris Dionysus

Egyptian civilization loved Osiris because he was a wise and gentle king He taught them law and order and led them away from savage practices like cannibalism and human sacrifice Osiris also taught them the art of agriculture and the appropriate rites for worshipping the gods When he was done civilizing the people in Egypt he left the country to his wife Isis and made peace in many other places When finished his job he then returned to Egypt

Osiris was the god of the Underworld He was also one of the Nine Gods One of his duties as Lord of the Dead was to do the very last judgment of the Dead and after that to protect people from the dangers of the Underworld The transition between life and death must have been a great experience but still perilous

Osiris was shown in the form of a mummified pharaoh He wore a white atef crown with feathers on the side and held a crook and flail tools of a pharaoh Osiris had green skin symbolizing rebirth to the Egyptians

Her Majestys Most Honourable Privy Council is a group of advisors to the British Monarch A lot of its most important work is done by two committees 

Some laws need to be made by the Queen in Council that is at a meeting of the Queen and the Privy Council Some jobs are filled by the Queen in Council too For example when the Queen appoints a new Bishop or Lord Lieutenant she announces her choice at a meeting of the Privy Council

Once someone is made a member of the Privy Council they are a member for life but only members of the government are asked to meetings except for special occasions such as when a new monarch takes the Accession Oath a promise to do their best at a meeting when the Privy Council called the Accession Council 

In the past some kings and queens were bored by long meetings of the Privy Council so they made everyone stand instead of sitting comfortably The tradition carries on today

Sometimes the Prime Minister shares information with other politicians on Privy Council Terms This means that the information must stay secret

The Law Lords and retired Law Lords also form the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council It is the final court of appeal from British colonies an dependent territories and some commonwealth realms These countries call it an appeal to The Queen in Council

Four republics in the commonwealth also use the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as a court of appeal

From the Court of Appeal of Brunei the only appeal is to the Sultan of Brunei The Queen and the Sultan have agreed that the cases are heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council who then advise the Sultan directly

The committee hears Appeals to Her Majesty in Council

Very rarely the Committee hears

The committee must also report to the Queen about anything she ask For example investigating which members of the House of Lords supported the enemy in World War I

The Virginia Tech massacre was a school shooting incident on April 16 2007 which took place at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University a college in Blacksburg Virginia United States Cho Seung Hui a senior English major at Virginia Tech who had been diagnosed with and was treated for a severe anxiety disorder in the past killed 32 people before killing himself The killings occurred in two separate attacks on the campusThe first at around 715 am when two students were shot and killed at West Ambler Johnston Hall a co ed residence hall that houses 894 students More than two and a half hours later 31 others including Cho were shot and killed across Norris Hall which houses the Engineering Science and Mechanics program among others where three main doors had been chained Victims were found in different locations around the building

The number of people that died was more than any other mass shooting in modern US history Up until today the deadliest campus shooting in United States history was in 1966 at the University of Texas where Charles Whitman climbed to the 28th floor observation deck of a clock tower and opened fire killing 16 people before he was gunned down by police In the Columbine High attack in 1999 two teenagers killed 12 fellow students and a teacher before killing themselves

Joe Louis was an American boxer He was the world heavyweight champion from 1937 to 1949 Louis won the title from James Braddock He made a record twenty five title defenses before giving up the title in 1949

Perhaps his most famous fight was his one round knockout of Max Schmeling the German former heavyweight champion in 1938 Schmeling had given Louis his only loss up to that point and was widely seen at that time as a representative of Nazi Germany The buildup to the fight was wrapped up in the politics of the United States versus Nazi Germany

When World War II began Louis signed up for the US Army While in the army Joe boxed 100 exhibition bouts

Louis died of a heart attack on April 12 1981 He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery

He has an arena named after him the Joe Louis Arena where the Detroit Red Wings playfactdateJuly 2010

The Eye of Horus was a powerful amulet It was a sign of protection It was also called the Wadjet Eye The ancient Egyptians worshiped Horus partly because he had the Eye of Horus

Horus was worshiped all over Egypt especially in Pe Bendet and Khem There were many falcon gods before Horus but eventually Horus represented all of them He was worshiped until the end of the Pre Dynastic period In Upper Egypt in the town of Edfu was Ptolemaic a temple for Horus In Kom Ombo there was another temple for Horus called the Kom Ombo temple Horus was a good friend of Sobek

Shaka Sankofa aka Gary Graham born Gary Lee Graham Sankofa was put to death for the murder of fifty three year old Bobby Lambert in Houston Texas on May 13 1981 The murder happened when Sankofa was seventeen

Sankofa was found guilty of shooting Lambert in the parking lot of a Houston supermarket He told police that he had done ten robberies that week but did not kill Lambert The government believed he has done as many as 22 robberies which had happened in that area during that time One of these included Graham using a shotgun to rob a man who Graham gave a ride to when the mans car stopped working on the highway During that robbery the man tried to escape and was shot by Graham but he did live While there was no physical evidence to link Graham to the murder one woman was in the parking lot at the time and saw him do it She said she heard the gunshot and turned on the lights of her car She saw Graham as he started running and followed him out of the parking lot with her car There were several other people inside the store but none of them saw the shooting Sankofas supporters brought his case international attention aruging that his conviction was based on the testimony of a single eyewitness who said she saw him for a few seconds in the dark parking lot committing the murder and she was 30 feet away from the murder scene The jury did not hear testimony from six other apparent eyewitnesses who believed that Sankofa was not the killer

Sankofa put to death after many legal tries by his lawyers to stop it These including an appeal to the US Supreme Court By a vote of 5 to 4 the Supreme Court refused to stop the execution Sankofas lawyers also filed a civil suit saying the execution was against his civil rights District Court Judge James Nowlin rejected that claim

Many people believe that Sankofa did not kill Lambert They believe that his lawyers did not do a good job because they thought he was guilty Sankofa was put to death on an evidence of one person alone None of the people that saw the man in the store and said this man was 6 inches shorter and thinner than Sankofa were used in the court case Sankofas lawyer at the time of his execution believed that the only person who saw the crime was not to be trusted because of how the police dealt with how she identified him A gun found with Graham when he was arrested a week later was not the murder weapon Most controversial of all is the fact that weapon used to kill Lambert did not produce any Gary Grahams fingerprints

Some groups still claim he did not do this crime Sankofas supporters brought his case international attention They also say that it is against international law to put someone to death for a crime they did before they became an adult of 18 years of age Such unprecedented convictions based on sole witness are rare but they happen in USA other known example was Larry Griffin who was executed in 1991 

There are groups to this day trying to clear Shaka of murder

The voting system is a set of rules about the way people vote and how the votes are counted Different countries have different voting systems There are many different types of voting system One of the first voting systems to be used is called first past the post Under this system each voter writes an x next to their chosen candidate At the end the votes are counted The candidate with the most votes wins Some people think that first past the post is unfair because they believe that many votes are wasted

Single Transferable Vote is a type of voting system It is used to elect more than one person

Write a number 1 next to your favourite candidate a number 2 next to your second favourite a number 3 next to your third favourite and so on

Each candidate needs a certain number of votes to be elected This number depends on how many people are voting and on how many people are to be elected 

Then the number 1 votes for each candidate are counted But it can happen that one candidate or several candidates have more than the needed number of votes These candidates are elected But since they have more votes than they needed they pass on the votes which they do not need to other candidates Which candidate or candidates get those surplus votes depends on the voters number of 2 votes given on the ballots papers of the candidates that have already been elected If those number 2 votes make another candidate win and give them too many votes this new surplus is passed on again using number 3 votes and so on 

If not enough candidates have been elected so far the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded Votes for this candidate are passed on to the candidate given as the next preference of each of his voters This may help to elect another candidate If not the next candidate which now has the fewest votes is excluded 

Passing on the surplus votes and excluding the weakest candidates goes on until the needed number of candidates has been elected

There are many arguments about the barrier People who want the barrier say it is needed to protect Israeli civilians from Palestinian terrorism including suicide bombing attacks Since the barrier was built the number of attacks has gone down

People who are against the barrier say that it is against international law because Israel and the Palestinians have not agreed where the border between them should be Israel has built the barrier without consensus This will make talks about deciding the borders more difficult

In Egyptian mythology Maat pronounced as Muat is goddess of law morality and justice Maat was seen as being charged with controlling the stars seasons and the actions of both people and gods Her first role in Egyptian mythology was the weighing of words that took place in the underworld Duat

The purpose of Maat was to keep order truth and justice She placed the dead mans heart on the other side while her husband Thoth wrote down the results of the scale to see if that person was evil or good and if they would have a happy afterlife or be eaten by the devourer Without Maat the universe would become chaos once again Maat also weighed the heart of the deceased against her feather of truth on a scale during the journey to the afterlife If the dead persons heart was heavier than the feather then it had done evil deeds like lying when it was alive When that happened the heart was devoured by a monster and was not able to go to the afterlife If it was lighter than the feather then it was allowed to go onto the afterlife

Maat had dark skin and hair She was usually shown wearing a white linen dress She like Isis was a winged goddess and she wore lots of armbands and necklaces made from gold and jewels Her feather of truth was strapped to her head Like the other gods and goddesses she wore the black eye makeup around her eyes and on her eyebrows which is known as kohl which showed her high ranking status

The chief judge in charge of the Egyptian law courts was known as The priest of Maat He began court hearings wearing the feather of Maat The person that won his case got to have the feather of Maat The guilty party had violated Maat and it was assumed that he or she would suffer failure poverty sickness blindness and deafness with the final judgment waiting in the court of the dead Tomb robbery was considered one of the most heinous crimes and might involve 100 strokes of a cane five bleeding cuts added or brands as a sign of permanent dishonor Often the entire family of the guilty suffered as well For example when individuals were sentenced into exile there children were automatically outlawed with them Maat represented truth order balance and justice in the universe This concept said that everyone not including slaves should be viewed as equals under the law The king made sure that was carried out and heshe would decide the case and the proper justice maybe asking his viziers who often acted as judges Even the lowliest fisherman was allowed to bring a legal case to the viziers

All goddesses including Maat had power over the Egyptians and different powers over the other gods One of the powers Maat gave the gods was the ability to breath air Like the water of life Maats potion brought an afterlife after death to the peaceful and law abiding people but death to violent and cruel people Maat was very powerful but she still had limits to her powers She could not make the sun travel through the sky like Ra could she could not control the netherworld like Osiris could and she could not make the stars shine like Nut could but she still had her own unique powers like her potion

The Pharaohs prime task in governing was to uphold Maat and they often held seated images of Maat in their hand to the gods which indicated that the Pharaoh represented the divine order The words I have done Maat were spoken by several Pharaohs and several others called themselves Beloved of Maat Even the gods were sometimes shown praising Maat People were interested in how they could please her but they also were afraid of her It was said that a small image of Maat was more pleasing to the gods than piles of rich offerings It was also said that a little truth was welcomer than huge bribes 

There was only one temple for Maat in Karnak but she was still worshiped in all Egyptian temples In every Egyptian temple one area was called the hall of two truths or the hall of Maat In the hall of two truths Maat weighed a mans heart against the feather of truth to see if the man would have an afterlife or his heart would be eaten by the devourer

Maat as a principle was at least partially codified into a set of laws and expressed a ubiquitous concept of right from wrong characterized by concepts of truth and a respect for and adherence to a divine order believed to be set forth at the time of the worlds creation 

The doctrine of Maat is represented in the declarations to Rekhti merti f ent Maat and the 42 negative affirmations listed in the Papyrus of Ani

The Sermon on the Mount is a Biblical speech by Jesus of Nazareth to his followers and a large group of people around AD 30 Jesus gave the speech on the side of a mountain The most popular part of the speech is the Beatitudes which are at the beginning of the speech The sermon also contains the Lords Prayer Other popular lines from the Sermon on the Mount are turn the other cheek salt of the Earth light of the world and judge not lest ye be judged 

Many Christians believe that the Sermon on the Mount is related to the Ten Commandments They believe that is very important in explaining how Christians should act towards others

One of the most important debates over the sermon is how it should be applied to everyday life Almost all Christian groups have created their own ways to understand and use the sermon in their lives McArthur lists twelve basic schools of thought on these issues

The author Christopher Knight says in his book Hiram Key that the Sermon on the Mount did not happen He thinks that Matthew stuck all kinds of passages together as though they were spoken one after another to a crowd on a mountain top Knight believes that the teachings were drafted into this one occasion to avoid interrupting the flow of the overall story The Hiram Key was created by both Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas

E Earle Ellis says that this sermon is Jesus asking believers to live in a way that will be standard in the future kingdom of God As Ellis says we are to speak Jesus words think his thoughts and do his deeds Since this will be the ethic of the future kingdom of God people should live their lives in a way that will help them be ready to live in Gods kingdom

A chapel is a place for Christian worship The word is used in several different ways Generally a chapel is a place of worship that is not a church which belongs to a parish in a village or town but is more private or has a special purpose 

Private chapels 

Some large houses and palaces have their own private chapel where the family and the servants of the house can worship 

Usually these chapels are small As well as being used for prayers the chapel might also hold the graves of members of the family or else have memorials and statues around the walls 

Famous small family chapels are at Haddon Hall in Derbyshire and in the Riccardi Medici Palace in Florence This small chapel has famous frescoes of the Three Kings by Benozzo Gozzoli

Some private chapels are as large as very large churches Because these large chapels can only be built by very rich people they often have magnificent architecture or very rich decoration 

Some of the most famous large private chapels are St Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle the Chapel Royal at Versailles Palace and the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican Palace The Sistine Chapel is the chapel of the popes and is famous for its ceiling painted by Michelangelo 

College chapels Many universities colleges schools law courts hospitals and prisons have their own chapels These might be a grand and beautiful building like the Eton College Chapel or just a small room that is set aside for prayer 

At many schools Chapel Service is an important part of the week when the whole school gets together to pray and to sing hymns Sometimes a big important church or cathedral might also act as a chapel Oxford Cathedral is the chapel for Christ Church College of the University of Oxford St Andrews Cathedral Sydney acts as the chapel to 900 pupils of the cathedral school

Chapels at churches Monastic chapels A monastery or a convent generally has a chapel where the monks or nuns can worship This might be a private chapel just the right size for the people at the monastery or it might be a big church that serves a village or town as well or even a cathedral for the whole region

Many cathedrals show evidence that they were once used by monks as well as the town people One of the signs is a large stone screen that divides the church into two areas Often these churches have a lot of small chapels because the monks or nuns would each say private prayers in one of the small chapels every day Family chapels 

From the Middle Ages wealthy families would often give money to a church or cathedral so that a family chapel could be built attached to the church There were several reasons for this The family might want a place where they could pray privately outsde the regular service time They might want to give thanks to God that a member of the family had been healed or rescued They might want to bury dead family members and have prayers said every day They might want to give honour to a particular saint They might want to avoid taxation by spending a lot of money quickly They might want to beautify their favorite church and make it bigger They might want to make something beautiful that the whole town can use 

Whatever the reason might be there are a great number of family chapels attached to old churches all over Europe The Church of Santa Croce in Florence is famous for its many chapels named after important Florentine families One of the most famous chapels of this type is the one built by Henry VIII to bury his father at Westminster Abbey 

Special chapels Many chapels have a special purpose in the church One of the most important uses for a small chapel within a church is to store the Sacrament the wine and bread or wafer which is used for Holy Communion Some chapels are designed to remind worshippers of a particular part of the Life of Christ particularly the Crucifixion or Resurrection or celebrate a certain Feast Day in the Church Year such as the Assumption of the Virgin 

Other chapels might hold the relics of a saint or a precious painting or statue of a particular saint such as Saint Anthony of Padua Saint Francis of Assisi or Saint Patrick 

Service chapels It is usual for the armed services and other similar organisations to have special chapels at churches or cathedrals 

Most cathedrals have a chapel especially to remember local people who have served their country and perhaps died in a war The chapel might have the colours or flags of the local regiment Services may be held regularly or on special days to remember a particular battle or a particular hero 

Protestant chapels In many Protestant churches the places where people gather for prayer and services are called chapels rather than churches This is sometimes because the pastors of the congregation were not accepted as priests by the Roman Catholic or Anglican churches or because they were set up in places where there was no priest to take services 

Wayside chapels These are chapels built specially for the use of travellers who can drop in as they are passing by They may be found in busy market places deep in forests on lonely mountain roads and nowadays at airports 

Funerary chapels These chapels are found at cemeteries Sometimes they are owned by a particular family and contain the tombs of family members but in most large modern cemeteries the chapels are multi denominational meaning that they are for people of different Christian churches and are used specifically for funeral services

The Franks or the Frankish peoples were one of several west Germanic federations of tribes It was formed out of Germanic tribes Salians Sicambri Chamavi Tencteri Chattuarii Bructeri Usipetes Ampsivarii Chatti Most of them lived at the northern borders of the Rhine

They entered the late Roman Empire from the north and east river bank of the Rhine into modern northern Belgium and southern Netherlands Later invasions conquered and established a lasting kingdom in an area which eventually covered most of modern day France Belgium the Netherlands and the western regions of Germany When the pagan Frankish king Clovis became Christian in the late 5th century that was an important event in the history of Europe 

Modern scholars of the period of the migrations are in agreement that the Frankish confederacy emerged at the beginning of the third century A region in the northeast of the modern day Netherlands north of the erstwhile Roman border still bears the name Salland and may have received that name from the Salians who formed the core of the Frankish sea raiders

From their heartland the Franks gradually conquered most of Roman Gaul north of the Loire valley and east of Visigothic Aquitaine At first they helped defend the border as allies for example when a major invasion of mostly East Germanic tribes crossed the Rhine in 406 the Franks fought against these invaders In the region of Paris Roman control persisted until 486 a decade after the fall of the emperors of Ravenna in part due to alliances with the Franks

In 451 Atius called upon his Germanic allies on Roman soil to help fight off an invasion by Attila the Hun The Salian Franks answered the call the Ripuarian Franks fought on both sides as some of them lived outside the Empire The Merovingians had governors who lead the Franks to war and had many governing responsibilities 

The Carolingian kingship begins with the deposition of the last Merovingian king and the accession in 751 of Pippin the Short father of Charlemagne 

Pippin reigned as an elected king While in later France the kingdom became hereditary the kings of the later Holy Roman Empire proved unable to abolish the elective tradition and continued as elected rulers until the Empires formal end in 1806

In 768 Charlemagne a powerful intelligent and modestly literate figure who became a legend for the later history of both France and Germany Charles restored an equal balance between emperor and pope

From 772 onwards Charles conquered and eventually defeated the Saxons to incorporate their realm into the Frankish kingdom Then he conquered the Lombards and thus could include northern Italy in his sphere of influence He renewed the Vatican donation and the promise to the papacy of continued Frankish protection

Charles created a realm that reached from the Pyrenees in the southwest over almost all of todays France eastwards to most of todays Germany including northern Italy and todays Austria On Christmas Day 800 Pope Leo III crowned Charles as Emperor of the Romans in Rome Though Charles preferred the title Emperor king of the Franks and Lombards as he did not want to get in conflict with the Byzantine Empire the Frankish Empire became the successor of the Roman Empire Charles died on January 28 814 in Aachen where was buried

Charles had several sons but only one survived him This son Louis the Pious followed his father as the ruler of a united Empire When Louis died in 840 the Treaty of Verdun in 843 divided the Empire in three

A bar or measure is used in writing music Each bar is a small amount of time Most music has a regular beat which can be felt Each bar usually has the same number of beats in it Music that feels like 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 will be divided into bars with four beats worth of music in each bar

The bar line is a vertical line which separates the bars 

At the beginning of the music there will be a time signature which shows how many beats there are in each bar

A double bar does not mean two bars It means two single barlines drawn close together one being thicker than the other It is a repeat sign If there are two dots on the left of the double bar line the player should go back to where there was previously a double bar with two dots on the right or back to the beginning of the piece

A double barline without dots shows the end of a piece of music

The first beat of a bar feels stronger than the others When a conductor beats time his hand always goes DOWN for the first beat of the bar This feels strong The last beat of a bar is an upbeat because the conductors hand always goes up

Barlines have been used since around 1600

Alaskan king crab fishing is an event done in the winter in the Bering Sea near Alaska where people fish for many King Crabs The people fish from boats between 40 and 250 feet in length They throw steel cages called pots over the side of the boat and the crab are lured to bait placed in them Once they have been on the bottom of the sea long enough they are pulled back onto the boat using a special kind of crane The crab in the pots are then looked at and crabs that are not good enough are put back into the ocean and the rest are put into a tank When the ship gets back to the shore the crab are sold to stores around the world 

The people working on the boat are paid a lot of money The amount of money can be from nothing to tens of thousands of dollars depending on how many crab the fishermen caught Alaskan crab fishing is one of the USAs most dangerous jobs Because of the big waves and dangerous boats the fishermen work on some people die every year

To show people how dangerous crab fishing is the Discovery Channel made a series called Deadliest Catch about the fishermen And they also catch a lot of Crabs

Tommaso Guidi better known as Masaccio was a famous painter of the Italian Renaissance He worked in Florence Masaccio was a nickname that meant Fat Untidy Tom He lived a very short life and only a few of his paintings exist but they were so different to the style of other artists around him that they helped other painters to see things in a new way 

Biography Youth Masaccio was born on 21 December 1401 in the town of san mexico

In 1422 when he was 21 Masaccio was already known as a painter because he joined the Company of Saint Luke which was a guild that helped artists and set down the rules for their employment

Earliest painting The earliest known painting by Masaccio is the San Giovenale Triptych dating from 1422 A triptych is a painting in three parts most often used as an altarpiece This altarpiece has in the middle panel the Virgin Mary and Christ Child on a throne The wings or side panels each show two saints Kneeling in front of the Virgin Mary are two little angels One of the things that makes this painting different from most other paintings of the same time is that the angels are shown from the back Their position is an invitation for the viewer to kneel down and worship the Virgin and Child as well Masaccio used this way of making the viewer feel part of the scene in many of his paintings 

The plump solemn Baby Jesus with his fingers in his mouth the three dimensional look of the figures and the lack of rich decoration make this picture look very different from most other altarpieces of this time which were painted in a style called International Gothic

In April 1422 an that they all looked like real individual people 

When Masaccio returned to Florence he was given a job a commission to paint a fresco of the procession that had taken place for the opening of the new church Masaccio was inspired by what he had seen in Rome The writer Vasari who must have seen the picture before it was destroyed in the late 1500s wrote that the people were in rows that were five or six deep but painted in such a way that they were all different fat ones and thin ones tall ones and short ones some in long cloaks some in big hats and every single one was a portrait of a real person who lived in Florence at the time And of course Masaccio put his friends Brunelleschi Donatello and Masolino into the picture Luckily several artists made drawings at some time in the 1500s so part of the design has been recorded even though the painting itself has gone

Working with Masolino 

In the Uffizi Gallery in Florence is an altarpiece that shows the Madonna and Child with Saint Anne The Madonna and Child are seated on a throne as is usual Saint Anne who was the mother of the Virgin Mary is shown standing behind Mary with one hand on her daughters shoulder and the other hand above the head of the Baby Jesus in a sign of blessing The painting may have been done for a convent of nuns who honoured Saint Anne 

It is believed that this painting is a collaboration that two artists worked on it together It is believed by Art Historians that Masaccio painted Mary and Jesus and the angel near the top right It is believed that Saint Anne and the other four angels were painted by Masolino 

Masolino was 17 years older than Masaccio His name was Tommaso da Panicale so when the two began to work together they were known as Masaccio and Masolino which means Little Tom Those are the names by which they are remembered as painters 

The Brancacci Chapel 

The Brancacci Chapel is a large chapel at the Church of Santa Maria del Carmine where Masaccio had previously worked painting the procession It was sponsored by the Brancacci family who paid for its decoration There are no written records to show why or how it happened but it seems that Masaccio and Masolino were given the job together At first everything went very well and then things went very badly It looked as if the job would never be finished In fact it is lucky that the paintings in the chapel survived at all 

The job seems to have started in 1423 or 1424 but this is not certain The plan of the paintings was to show firstly how Sin came into the world through the disobedience of Adam and Eve A painting by Masolino shows their disobedience in taking fruit from the forbidden tree A painting opposite it by Masaccio shows Adam and Eve in disgrace being chased out of the Garden of Eden The rest of the paintings show The Life of Saint Peter This is because Saint Peter was the founder of the Catholic Church and the paintings were meant to show that the best way to know about Gods love is through the Church 

It seems that Masaccio and Masolino happily planned a scheme of frescoes that went together is a pleasing way even though they are in two styles It is not hard to tell which scenes Masolino painted and which were done by Masaccio Masolinos are prettier and more elegant Masaccios scenes show figures that are strong and have drapes like the statues that he saw in Rome The thing that was most different in his painting to other artists of the same time was that the figures looked very solid and three dimensional He was influenced by the paintings of Giotto who had worked in Florence at the Church of Santa Croce nearly a hundred years earlier but whose style of painting had given way to the International Gothic style 

Apart from the Adam and Eve scenes which are the smallest of the pictures the most famous is Masaccios picture of The Tribute Money This large picture is set partly against a background of mountains and a lake and partly against the background of a town which is similar to Florence There are three scenes from the story In the centre of the picture is a large group Jesus and his twelve disciples A tax collector has come to ask for a payment but none of the men have any money Jesus tells Peter to go fishing in the lake Peter looks rather annoyed wondering what good it will do To the left the small figure of Peter is kneeling at the edge of the lake with a fish he has caught Inside the fish is a coin To the right side of the picture Peter is shown giving the coin to the tax collector He no longer looks argumentative Instead he looks humble Masaccio has expertly shown the feelings of the characters not only by their faces but also through body language 

Neither Masaccio nor Masolino were able to work on the frescoes continuously as they both kept getting other jobs to attend to In 1428 Masaccio was asked to go to Rome to paint an altarpiece for one of the most important and ancient churches Santa Maria Maggiore He only painted one panel Saint Jerome and Saint John the Baptist before he died at the age of 27 years Masolino and perhaps another artist Domenico Veneziano worked on and finished the altarpiece which was later broken into pieces and scattered to galleries in different countries Masaccios panel is in the National Gallery London 

Masolino lived for another 19 years but he never went back to finish the Brancacci frescoes The Brancacci family fell into disgrace and were chased out of Florence One of Masaccios pictures was attacked because it had portraits of some of the Brancacci family in it Some 50 years later in the 1480s all the scenes that remained incomplete or not begun were painted by Filippino Lippi who tried to respect the styles that Masaccio and Masolino had used before him

The chapel which was dedicated to Saint Peter was re dedicated to Our Lady of the Common People and to her honour a magnificent ancient altarpiece by Coppo di Marcovaldo dating from about 1280 was put into place Because this image of the Virgin Mary was said to work miracles many hundreds of candles were lit in front of it which soon stained the frescoes so that their bright colours could no longer be seen Eventually the painting was moved to a different church Then part of the roof fell in and had to be replaced More damage was done in re decorating In 1680 the Marquis Francesco Ferroni decided that the paintings were too old fashioned and should all be pulled down Luckily the Grand Duchess Vittoria della Rovere stopped this from happening In 1734 a painter called Antonio Pillori cleaned the frescoes Then in the 1770 there was a fire in the church causing worse staining and some damage to the frescoes

In recent years there have been four interesting discoveries During a minor cleaning in 1904 two slabs of marble near the altar were moved Underneath were the bright colours that showed what the frescoes should look like Examination of the areas where two windows had been changed showed the plans for two paintings that had been destroyed The final discoveries in the chapel itself were two painted roundels with little angel faces in them one by Masaccio and one by Masolino 

There was a problem to be solved in the minds of some art historians Despite these interesting findings there was a scene missing from the story of Saint Peter It is the scene where Jesus says You are Peter and on this Rock I build my Church This part of the story is of the greatest importance to the Roman Catholic Church because Peter was the first Bishop of Rome and so the Pope rules as his direct line The scene is usually shown by Jesus giving Peter the Keys of Heaven The Keys for hundreds of years have been the symbol of the Pope But the story of the Keys is completely missing 

Then in the 1940s John Pope Hennessy the director of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London realised that the museum owned a work of art that was exactly the thing that was missing from the Brancacci Chapel It was a thin almost flat marble slab delicately carved with the scene of Jesus giving the Keys to Peter It was just the right size to make the front of an altar And although it could not be proved it was almost certainly carved by Masaccios friend Donatello 

The Trinity At some time while he was working on the Brancacci Chapel Masaccio painted a fresco for another church in Florence Santa Maria Novella the church of the Dominican Order This is a very remarkable painting and one of Masaccios most famous It shows the Holy Trinity God is shown as the eternal Creator as the humble Sacrifice in Jesus on the Cross and as the inspiring Spirit On either side of the Cross stand the Virgin Mary and Saint John The two kneeling figures are the family who paid for the painting 

Masaccio has painted this very holy scene as if it was taking place in a deep recess or small chapel in the wall of the church He has done this by using very accurate perspective It is believed that the architect Brunelleschi may have helped him with this as the painted architecture looks very much like buildings that Brunelleschi designed

Influence Vasari writes that Masaccio was not very famous in his own time In 1440 his body was brought home to Florence and buried at Santa Maria del Carmine but no monument was put up in his honour Shortly afterwards people began to honour him as a painter Michelangelo and many other painters and sculptors went to the Brancacci Chapel to study Masaccios paintings His influence can be seen in the paintings of Fra Angelico Piero della Francesca Ghirlandaio and particularly Michelangelo

The Don is one of the major rivers of Russia It rises in the town of Novomoskovsk 60 km southeast from Tula southeast of Moscow and flows for a distance of about 1950 km to the Sea of Azov

From its source the river first flows southeast to Voronezh then southwest to its mouth The main city on the river is Rostov on Don its main tributary the Donets

In antiquity the river was seen as the border between Europe and Asia In the Hebrew Book of Jubilees it is mentioned as being part of the border beginning with its westernmost point up to its mouth between the allotment of Japheth to the north and that of Shem to the south sons of Noah During the times of the old Scythians it was known in Greek as the Tanas and has been a major trading route ever since 

Tanais appears in ancient Greek sources as the name of the river and of a city on it situated in the Maeotian marshes The name derives however from Scythian Dnu river akin to modern Ossetic don river 

At its easternmost point the Don comes near the Volga and the Volga Don Canal connecting both rivers has been a major waterway The Khazar fortress of Sarkel used to dominate this point in the Middle Ages This part of the river saw Operation Uranus one of the turning points of the Second World War 

The Don has given its name to the Don Cossacks who settled the fertile valley of the river in the 16th and 17th centuries In modern literature the Don figures centrally in the works of Mikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov a Cossack from the stanitsa of Veshenskaya

Clovis I was the first king of the Franks who united that nation He succeeded his father Childeric I in 481 as King of the Salian Franks one of two main groups of Frankish tribes They were occupying the area west of the lower Rhine at that time with their centre around Tournai and Cambrai along the modern frontier between France and Belgium Clovis conquered the neighbouring Frankish tribes and established himself as sole king before his death

Clovis converted to Catholicism as opposed to the Arian Christianity that was common among Germanic peoples because his wife the Burgundian Clotilde was a Catholic He was baptized in the Cathedral of Reims This act was very important in the following history of France and Western Europe in general because he expanded his reign over almost all of the old Roman province of Gaul He is considered to be the founder both of France and the Merovingian dynasty which ruled the Franks for the next two centuries 

The Merovingians were a dynasty of Frankish kings who ruled in the region of ancient Gaul from the fifth to the eighth century

They were sometimes referred to as the long haired kings by people of the time for their symbolically uncut hair The term is drawn directly from Germanic akin to their dynastys Old English name Merewowing

The Merovingian dynasty owes its name to the semi legendary Merovech leader of the Salian Franks from c447 to 457 Clovis I went on to unite most of Gaul north of the Loire under his control around 486 when he defeated Syagrius the Roman ruler in those parts

People who do not have a house or an apartment to stay in are homeless The word homelessness also includes people who sleep in warming centers homeless shelters or in abandoned buildings parking garages or other places not meant for humans to live in Homelessness occurs when people or households are unable to acquire andor maintain housing they can afford

In academic articles and government reports these people are called homeless people You may hear different words to describe homelessness and homeless people Some of these words apply to people who might not be homeless Sometimes they are based upon stereotypes For instance in slang a vagabond is someone who travels without the money necessary to stay in good hotels Such a person may or may not have a home somewhere Sometimes police reports use the word transient to describe people from out of town or who are passing through Many times these words confuse the issues because someone just passing through might own a mansion somewhere or might not 

There are tough questions in sorting out homeless people even when trying to create programs and services to help them Homeless counts are required by the government agencies that deal with homelessness In the USA for instance the Housing and Urban Development agency requires a homeless enumeration count every two years They classify homeless in a careful way and that way is very influential and a lot of other agencies and church groups copy it

Housing and Urban Development spreads information about what works and what doesnt That information is called best practices HUD defines homeless as 1 somebody who lacks a fixed regular and decent place to sleep at night or 2 somebody who sleeps at night in Aa supervised shelter Ba place that provides a temporary residence for people waiting for space in a place like a hospital jail or hospice or Ca place not designed for human beings to sleep such as parks or public streets

he C part of the HUD definition is now getting more attention It is called chronic homelessness defines a chronically homeless person as an unaccompanied homeless individual with a disabling condition There are other conditions to that definition It has to be someone who has either been homeless for a year or more or has been homeless four episodes times in the past three years

People who study these things believe that the chronic homeless cost a lot more than the rest A new approach is to seek information on who those folks are They are using what is called a vulnerability index system It was invented by a doctor in Boston who works with a New York organization called Common Ground These Vulnerability Indexs code for things like bad liver kidney disease HIV AIDS age and visits to the hospital

Salland is a historical region in the west and north of the present Dutch province of Overijssel

The history of Salland goes back to the early Middle Ages when the four quarters of Oversticht came together Salland may have been the early seat of the Salian Franks the founders of the modern Dutch and French nations

Salland is bound to the west by the provincial border with Gelderland which is partly formed by river IJssel to the north by the Meppelerdiep stream and the provincial border with Drenthe which partly consists of the Reest stream to the east by the borders with the German state of Lower Saxony and the eastern Overijssel region of Twente and to the south by the border with the Gelderland region of Achterhoek part of which is formed by the Schipbeek stream

Geologically most of Sallands landscape consists of a lowland covered with river sediment

Hammurabi was the sixth king of Babylon from 1792 BC to 1750 BC He became king after his father abdicated and was the first ruler of Babylonia By winning wars against other kingdoms in Mesopotamia Hammurabi created a large Babylonian empire However his son Samsu iluna and later Babylonian rulers lost much of the land he had gained Hammurabi is most famous for his laws which are known as the Hammurabis Code Hammurabis Code was one of the first written codes of law in history 

Hammurabi became king of Babylon in around 1792 BC when his father Sin Muballit abdicated Babylon was one of many small independent cities in ancient Mesopotamia These cities often fought each other for control of land Babylon was already one of the more powerful cities when Hammurabi became king Earlier kings of Babylon had taken over the nearby city states of Borsippa Kish and Sippar 

Hammurabi did not fight any important wars in the early part of his reign He instead improved the buildings of Babylon He built taller city walls to make the city more difficult to attack and expanded the temples In around 1771 BC the kingdom of Elam attacked Mesopotamia from the east Elam invaded Eshnunna a city state to the north east of Babylon and destroyed its cities It also tried to start a war between Babylon and Larsa a city in southern Mesopotamia However Hammurabi instead made an alliance with Larsa against Elam Hammurabi defeated Elam but felt that Larsa had not given him enough help He therefore attacked Larsa Babylon had entirely conquered southern Mesopotamia by c 1763 BC

Hammurabis allies in northern Mesopotamia had sent their armies to the south to help Babylon This caused unrest in the northern area Hammurabi therefore returned north stopping the unrest and defeating Eshnunna He then attacked and conquered the remaining cities in northern Mesopotamia including Babylons former ally Mari It is possible that Mari surrendered to Babylon without any fighting happening After this Hammurabi was in control of most of Mesopotamia Only Aleppo and Qatna two western cities in modern Syria remained independent When Hammurabi died in c 1750 BC his son Samsu iluna became king

An altarpiece is a work of art that has been made to go above the altar in a Christian church An altarpiece can be a painting or it can be carved from wood or stone Some altarpieces have both painting and sculpture

What is an altarpiece for

A beautiful altarpiece is a way of making a person who goes into a church feel interested so they walk forward closer to the altar This puts them in a good position to see the church service hear the prayers and readings and listen to what the priest says

If there is no service in the church at that time the altarpiece gives a person something interesting to look at and think about It helps them to think about Jesus or a particular saint whose story might be told in the pictures Looking at an altarpiece can encourage a person to pray

What do altarpieces show

There are three most common subjects The Virgin Mary and Christ Child Jesus crucified and Christ in Glory These are three very important parts of Christian belief

Altars of The Virgin Mary and Christ Child were made to remind Christians that God came to Earth as Jesus in the form of an ordinary helpless little baby to grow up among people These altarpieces are to remind Christians of the Christmas story

Altarpieces of Jesus on the cross were made to remind Christians that Jesus who was pure and did not sin died a horrible death like a robber and murderer so that Christians could be forgiven These altarpieces are to remind Christians of the Easter story

Altarpieces that show Jesus sitting on a throne in Heaven were made to remind Christians that they need to put their lives right and turn to God because one day they will see him on his throne These altarpieces are to remind Christians that they never know when their life might end and they should live every day in a way that pleases God

Many altarpieces as well as having one of the three main scenes may have lots of other figures or lots of other small scenes

The other figures are usually saints They might be shown standing around a throne where the Virgin Mary sits with Baby Jesus on her knee Or they might be painted on separate pieces that are joined to the middle part of the altarpiece These saints do not have to be people who were alive at the same time as Mary They are more often the patron saint of the church or the favourites saints of the person who paid for the altarpiece

Smaller rectangular parts of the altarpiece often have stories painted in them They may be stories from the Bible telling the life of Jesus or they might tell the life of a saint

How big are altarpieces

An altarpiece can be as small as a tiny painting put on the wall above a table in someones home Or it can be so big that it fills the wall of a huge cathedral The word is usually used for artworks which are quite big A small painting may be called a Holy Picture or an Icon

The Wood Mouse or Long tailed Field Mouse is a common rodent

Almost entirely nocturnal field mice burrow extensively digging a series of chambers and runs Their usual habitat is woodlands fields and hedgerows although they are also found in open grassland

The geographical isolation and recent glacial history of Shetland have resulted in a depleted mammalian fauna The field mouse along with the brown rat and the house mouse are one of only three recorded types of rodent present on the island Based largely on moprphological studies of epigenetic variations the source of the original founding population has been attributed to Norway with the most obvious date of introduction being presumed to be around the 9th century AD with the arrival of the Vikings However archaeological evidence now suggests that this species was present during the Middle Iron Age and one theory proposes that Apodemus was in fact introduced from Orkney where a population had existed since at the least the Bronze Age3

Field mouse is the name for a large group of mice in the UK but the real field mouse is the Long Tailed Field Mouse or wood mouse 

They have a solid brown coat with a white belly as shown in the picture For their size they have very large eyes and ears They grow to roughly 10cm long and weigh 30 grams when full grown 

They are omnivorous and eat a range of seeds worms berries small insects and carrion In deciduous woodland they will eat acorns and sycamore seeds for the winter buds in spring insects and seeds in summer and berries and fungi in autumn However they will eat their own tail if faced with starvation 

They are prey to many animals including owls and foxes and therefore have a short life normally living for 6 to 12 months However in captivity they can live for over 20 months They live in any place where it can find food or shelter but traditionally live in hedgerows forests and grass lands They make their nests wherever it is warm and there is cover This means that they will usually nest underground but will nest in other warm environments 

The Field mouse has been proven to be extremely intelligent If given time it will think out a strategy before doing something It is also very fast for its size and can go at almost ten strals per hour They have extremely small but sharp claws which they use to dig into houses to scavenge food They assess a situation before doing anything They will judge whether it is too risky dangerous or useless and they often look out for each other However if they are being chased they will dart undercover or into small nooks and crannies

It was written on a stele and put in a public place where everyone could see it The stele was later captured by the Elamites and taken to their capital Susa It was found there again in 1901 and is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris 

The code of Hammurabi had 282 laws written by scribes on 12 tablets Unlike earlier laws it was written in Akkadian the daily language of Babylonia

For each crime a specific punishment is listed The punishments tended to be harsh by modern standards They included death cutting off a body part and the use of the Eye for eye tooth for tooth philosophy The penalties of his laws may seem cruel to modern readers but the fact that he put into writing the laws of his kingdom is considered an important step forward in the development of civilization 

The Code of Hammurabi was one of many sets of laws in the Ancient Near East

Another term to describe a microcontroller is embedded controller because the microcontroller and its support circuits are often built into or embedded in the devices they control

In addition to the usual arithmetic and logic elements of a general purpose microprocessor the microcontroller integrates additional elements such as RAM for data storage read only memory for program storage flash memory for permanent data storage peripherals and inputoutput interfaces 

Microcontrollers often operate at very low speed compared to microprocessors but this is adequate for typical applications They consume relatively little power

Microcontrollers are used in automatically controlled products and devices such as automobile engine control systems remote controls machines appliances power tools and toys these are called embedded systems

Universal Studios a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company is one of the major American film studios that has production studios and offices located at 100 Universal City Plaza Drive in Universal City California an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County between Los Angeles and Burbank Distribution and other corporate administrative offices are based in New York City Universal is the second longest lived studio in Hollywood

The founder of Universal Carl Laemmle was a German Jewish immigrant settled in Oshkosh Wisconsin where he managed a clothing store 

On a 1905 buying trip to Chicago he was struck by the popularity of nickelodeons 

In June 1909 Laemmle started the Yankee Film Company with partners Abe and Julius Stern That company quickly evolved into the Independent Moving Picture Company or IMP In 1910 he actively promoted Florence Lawrence then known as the Biograph girl in what may be the first instance of a studio using a film star in its marketing

On June 8 1912 Laemmle merged IMP with eight smaller companies to form the Universal Film Manufacturing Company introducing the word universal into the organizations name Among them were Mark Dintinfass Charles Baumann and Adam Kessel and Pat Powers The name was later changed to Universal Pictures Company Inc

Following the westward trend of the industry in 1915 Laemmle opened the worlds largest motion picture production facility Universal City Studios on a 230 acre converted farm just over the Cahuenga Pass from Hollywood 

In 1926 Universal also opened a production unit in Germany Deutsche Universal Film AG under the direction of Joe Pasternak This unit produced 34 films per year until 1936 migrating to Hungary and then Austria in the face of Hitlers increasing domination of central Europe With the advent of sound these productions were made in the German language or occasionally Hungarian or Polish In the USA Universal Pictures did not distribute any of this subsidiarys films but at least some of them were exhibited through other independent foreign language film distributors based in New York without benefit of English subtitles Nazi persecution and a change in ownership for the parent Universal Pictures organization resulted in the dissolution of this subsidiary

Taking on the task of modernizing and upgrading a film conglomerate in the depths of the depression was risky and for a time Universal slipped into receivership The theater chain was scrapped but Carl Jr held fast to distribution studio and production operations 

The end for the Laemmles came with a lavish remake of Show Boat featuring several stars from the Broadway stage version which began production in late 1935 However Carl Jrs spending habits alarmed company stockholders especially after the costly flop of Sutters Gold earlier in the year 

They would not allow production to start on Show Boat unless the Laemmles obtained a loan Universal was forced to seek a 750000 production loan from the Standard Capital Corporation pledging the Laemmle familys controlling interest in Universal as collateral It was the first time in Universals 26 year history that it had borrowed money for a production Production problems resulted in a 300000 overrun When Standard called the loan in a cash strapped Universal could not pay 

Show Boat was released in 1936 and is widely considered to be one of the greatest film musicals of all time However it was not enough to save the Laemmles who were unceremoniously removed from the company they had founded

By the late 1950s the motion picture business was in trouble The combination of the studiotheater chain break up and the rise of television saw the mass audience drift away probably forever The Music Corporation of America mainly a talent agency had also become a powerful television producer renting space at Republic Studios for its Revue Studios subsidiary After a period of complete shutdown a moribund Universal agreed to sell its 360 acre studio lot to MCA in 1958 for 11 million Although MCA owned the studio lot but not Universal Pictures it was increasingly influential on Universals product The studio lot was upgraded and modernized while MCA clients like Doris Day Lana Turner and Cary Grant were signed to Universal Pictures contracts

Though Universals film unit did produce occasional hits among them Airport The Sting American Graffiti and a blockbuster that restored the companys fortunes Jaws Universal in the 1970s was primarily a television studio Weekly series production was the workhorse of the company There would be other film hits like ET The Extra Terrestrial Back to the Future and Jurassic Park but overall the film business was still hit and miss In the early 1970s Universal teamed up with Paramount Pictures to form Cinema International Corporation which distributed films by Paramount and Universal worldwide It was replaced by United International Pictures in 1991 when Walt Disney Pictures joined the fold

Universal like any other major movie studio owns a huge library 

The company owns the libraries of USA Films October Films and the 1996 1999 films by PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and its subsidiaries as well as much of the post 1973 NBC library of shows and made for TV movies

It also owns several films made by others including some pre 1952 United Artists material an Alfred Hitchcock feature originally released by Warner Bros  Rope and the UK rights to most of the RKO Pictures library

In the early years of Universal the company absorbed an amount of small firms Among those early film production studios were

For several years some of these junior partners carried considerable weight within Universal inevitably factions and rivalries were the rule At least one version of corporate history claims that the twenty year old Irving Thalberg rose so quickly because he told subordinates that he alone spoke for Carl Laemmle in making production decisions while the others were more concerned with battling among themselves

Following the election of 1800 Thomas Jefferson a Democratic Republican was elected President of the United States During his time as a lame duck outgoing President John Adams a member of the Federalist Party started giving other Federalists jobs as judges His party was losing power but by making Federalists judges that would serve for life Adams was trying to keep Jefferson and his party from changing things too much 

All the new judges were approved by the Senate Secretary of State John Marshall now had to deliver each judge the document that said he had the judge job Marshall delivered most of them but not all as time ran out He thought the new Secretary of State would deliver them because even though the new office holders did not want the new judges the new judges were given their jobs legally However President Jefferson made sure the commissions were not delivered He thought that they would become void if they were not delivered in time

One of the judges who did not get his commission was William Marbury He sued the new Secretary of State James Madison wanting his commission Marbury asked the Supreme Court to order Madison to deliver the commission By this time Marshall had been replaced as Secretary of State and had started in the job of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court

The Supreme Court made a 4 0 decision Chief Justice John Marshall the former Secretary of State made a ruling that said that Marbury was entitled to his commission However Marshall said that a law that gave the Supreme Court the power to rule on the case was against the United States Constitution Thus the Supreme Court did not have the power to make Madison give Marbury his commissionadministration This was the first case where the Supreme Court claimed the right to strike down a law if the Supreme Court thought that it was unconstitutional

Some people say that the power of judicial review in the United States came before Marbury and that Marbury was merely the first Supreme Court case to exercise a power that already existed and was acknowledged These scholars point to statements about judicial review made in the Constitutional Convention in the state ratifying conventions in publications debating ratification and in court cases before Marbury that involved judicial review

Byrd lived in a time of great changes Henry VIII had broken away from the Roman Catholic church and had founded the Anglican Church The monarch was the Head of the Church of England During Byrds lifetime the monarchs who reigned had different ideas about what church music should be like Byrd was always a Catholic This sometimes made life difficult for him but he was always faithful to the monarchy and he had a lot of broken wikt link tacttact in dealing with people

Byrd grew up in the Renaissance period He lived into the 17th century which is the period known in music as the Baroque period 

We know very little about Byrds early life Most books say that he was born in 1543 but a document that was found recently makes us think he was probably born late in 1539 or in 1540 He may have come from Lincoln which is where his first job was but he probably had some of his education in London This is likely because we know he was a pupil of Thomas Tallis who worked in London Tallis was in charge of the music of the Chapel Royal which was the best choir in England and it is likely that Byrd sang in the choir when he was a boy Queen Mary was on the throne at the time She was Catholic and she liked church music to be quite long and complicated with Latin words This gave composers lots to do and the young Byrd started composing church music at this time

Around 1563 Byrd got the job of Organist and Choir Master of Lincoln Cathedral This was an important job for such a young man and he had an extra large salary so people must have thought he was a very good musician By this time Queen Elizabeth I was on the throne She had different ideas from Mary She was Protestant and liked church music to be simpler although she still liked the Latin service In Lincoln Byrd was sometimes told off for playing organ music that was too long and complicated Byrd composed a lot of music for the cathedral He also married in 1568 and they had at least seven children

In 1570 he got a job as Gentleman of the Chapel Royal in London He may have done both jobs for a year or two and he certainly continued to write music for Lincoln for some years after that He settled in London and started to make many friends He was very careful to get to know lots of important people who would be able to help him in his career

In 1575 Queen Elizabeth gave William Byrd and Thomas Tallis together a patent for music publishing This meant that they earned some money for every bit of music that was published printed or sold in England Music publishing had only just started in England It was still very expensive to have music printed Byrd thanked the Queen by publishing some of his Latin motets and dedicating them to her They were called Cantiones Sacrae He also wrote a collection of Psalmes Sonets and Songs and Songs of Sundrie Natures His church music includes settings of the Service and many anthems such as the popular Sing joyfully

In 1593 he moved with his family to Stondon Massey in Essex He spent the rest of his life there Most of his church music from that time on was in Latin He wrote three settings of the Mass and two books of Gradualia which were large collections of music for the whole year 

Byrd also wrote a lot of keyboard music Some of it was for a collection called My Ladye Nevells Booke some of it was for the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book

He died on July 4 1623 and is buried in an unmarked grave in the Stondon churchyard

Byrds music has a lot of variety largely because of the different ideas people had various times during the period There were lots of political and religious arguments between groups of people In the early 17th century people were often sent to prison for writing Catholic music Byrd seems to have escaped such punishment although he was involved in several lawsuits He was lucky that he was able to continue to live as a free man and compose Being on good terms with the Queen must have helped him

Byrd wrote music for the Anglican church and for the Roman Catholic Church His Cantiones Sacrae published in 1589 and 1591 are collections of Latin motets These are the very best of Byrds works and better than anything that was being written in Europe at that time He probably wrote them for private gatherings of Catholics so this meant that he could write in whatever style he wanted His music is very contrapuntal representing the best of the English Renaissance style

His Latin church music was forgotten after his death It only became popular in the early 20th century when it was rediscovered

Byrd also wrote very beautiful music for viols as well as a lot of keyboard music

Cuneiform is the oldest kind of writing that we know of It was first used by the Sumerians around 3000 BC It was written on clay with a tool made from a reed called a stylus Cuneiform is a wedge shaped character made with a reed stylus and were used in writing several ancient languages They are quite similar to pictography

Menes was a pharaoh of the first dynasty of ancient Egypt He lived ca 3100 3000 BC He brought together upper and lower Egypt to make an empire He even wore both crowns the white crown of lower Egypt and the red crown of upper Egypt He built the ancient Egyptian city Memphis and made it the capital

There is extensive archeological evidence that there was a pharaoh named Narmer but little evidence for Menes There is a general suspicion that Menes either was a name of Narmer his predecessor or of his successor Hor Aha

According to Manetho Menes reigned 62 years and was killed by a hippopotamus 

An image of Menes holding an ankh is on the frieze on the south wall of the US Supreme Court building 

Bast was the ancient Egyptian goddess of protection and cats She was the daughter of Ra the sun god As protectress she was seen as defender of the pharaoh and consequently of the chief god Ra

Basts real name is Bastet Ubasti and Pasht She was worshipped at least since the Second Dynasty in Ancient Egypt The centre of her cult was in Per Bast which was named after her Originally she was seen as the protector goddess of Lower Egypt and therefore her image was a fierce lion Her name means devourer She was originally a goddess of the sun but later changed by the Greeks to a goddess of the moon In Greek mythology Bast is also known as Aelurus

In later times Bast became the goddess of perfumes and had the title perfumed protector In connection with this when Anubis became the god of embalming Bast as goddess of ointment and she was regarded as his mother until Anubis became Nephthys son

This gentler characteristic of Bast as goddess of perfumes and Lower Egypts loss in the wars between Upper and Lower Egypt meant that in the Middle Kingdom of Egypt she was seen as a domestic cat and not any more as a lionness Because domestic cats tend to be tender and protective toward their offspring Bast was also regarded as a good mother and she was sometimes shown with kittens Therefore a woman who wanted children sometimes wore an amulet showing the goddess with kittens the number of which showed how many children she wanted to have

 Worship  Bastet was the most honored feline deity in Ancient Egypt The cult of Bastet started around the town of Bubastis located in the Eastern Delta in Lower Egypt and was an important town from the Old Kingdom through the Late Period During early Egyptian times the city was called Per Bast which translates into the domain of Bast Later the city was called Bubastis Today it is called Tell Basta Other cities where Bastet was worshipped were for example Memphis where she was associated with Sekhmet Heliopolis where she was called the Daughter of Tem in a city called Hill of Bast in the precinct of Mut in Thebes when connected to Mut and in the city of Nit Festivals celebrating Bastet were held in the cities of Bubastis Memphis Thebes and Esna Elaborate festivals of Bastet were called Procession of Bastet Bastet protects the two lands Bastet goes forth from Per Bast Bastet appears before Ra and the Festival of Hathor and Bastet Her main festivals were celebrated in April and May in Bubastis Her festivals were some of the most popular in Egypt because of all the music dancing and wine Over 700000 people came from all over Egypt often in boats sailing along the Nile Men and women sailed together During their journey they would sing clap their hands the women would shake their rattles the men would play their flutes Each time when they sailed past people or towns along the Nile everybody would start singing cheering and clapping together In Bubastis the festival began by making sacrifices to Bastet The Temple of Bast stood in the town center so one could see it from everywhere It stood on raised ground The outside wall of the temple was decorated with pictures of animals Inside the temple was a courtyard planted with a grove of trees Inside the group of trees stood her shrine Worshippers came from all over Egypt leaving offerings bronze statues amulets and mummified cats in her temple Thousands of those cats were later found in underground crypts where her temple once stood During the days of celebration the Egyptians spent many days making music dancing and being joyful Worshippers went to her temple playing instruments beating drums shaking tambourines carrying sistras singing and dancing through the streets One aspect of the festival however was quite moving and came on the last night In a town of silence a town of darkness a single light would be lit inside the Temple of Bast And from there the light would spread through the town carried by devotees and prayers would rise into the night accompanied by music and incense Bastet the goddess of cats was important She had temples where she was worshiped The Egyptians people would give sacrifices to her like spicewaterwine milkbread and meat She also would be given gold diamonds silver perfumes and other riches The people of Egypt would also dance and sing to her because she was also the goddess of dancing and singing They also feasted in her temple to show that she was important

Bastet had many different powers and roles As the goddess of plenty pleasure music and dance was sometimes linked with Hathor Bastet was also the protector of motherhood fertility hearth protector of pregnant women their newborn infants and children The Egyptians believed that she could protect men from diseases and demons If a woman was infertile she might make an offering to Bastet hoping that she would have a child Like Hathor and Sekhmet she was called Mother of the Sun God She was seen as the personification of the Warming rays of the sun on the Nile Ancient Egyptians also believed she possessed Utchat the divine all seeing Eye of Ra Later when Bubastis became the seat of the Egyptian Pharaohs she was honored as one of the Mothers of Egyptian Kings As the Eye of Ra she was a god who functioned as a protector or avenger to the pharaoh destroying the kings enemies As the Eye of Ra Bastet possessed the grace charm patience and wile of a domestic cat as well as the power for the raw brute strength of a lion She could also be full of strength speed and cruelty By the end of the New Kingdom she became popular and beloved household goddess She was the protectress of households of all of Lower Egypt She protected both the poor peasants and the rich nobility

Bastet was often seen holding a sistrum in one hand and an aegis in the other hand An aegis was a talisman necklace Sometimes she held the Ankh the symbol of life On other statues she sometimes wore a ritual menat necklace A menat necklace was made of two rows of colorful beads on one side and had a menat at the other end Bastet was often shown holding a scepter It consisted of a straight shaft with its handle in the shape of a canine head and the base ending in two prongs It was a symbol of power held both by deities and kings Sometimes she was shown with a litter of kittens at her feet in pictures and statues because she was also the goddess of fertility and the protectress of motherhood During the Old Kingdom Bastet was usually seen as a woman with the maneless head of a lioness which was related to Sekhmet even though they were not the same During that time one could still find a lot of wildcats and lions in Lower and Upper Egypt During Ancient Egypts Middle Kingdom Bastet started to be represented as a cat That was also when cats became domesticated and became beloved pets in Egyptian homes Cats were valued as good mousers able to kill rats snakes and other vermin that might endanger the family or the crops that were stored in storage houses By that time lions had already completely migrated from Upper Egypt out of Egypt During the New Kingdom Bastet was mostly seen as a cat headed woman wearing a long sleek narrow dress During this Late Period when Bubastis was capital of Egypt Bastet was also often shown as wearing the double crown or pschent suckling the pharaoh The double crown symbolized the kings rule of both Upper and Lower Egypt that is he ruled the Two Lands as one

Bastets father was Ra the God of the Sun and All Creation She had two sons named Konshu the God of the Moon and Maahes a lion headed God of War Bastet did not have a mother because Ra as creator deity was called The Great He She Her husband was Ptah the god of God of Craftsmen Rebirth and Creation When associated with Isis she could be called the Soul of Isis Some texts referred to Bastet and Sekhmet as being linked in a relationship as Twins Balance of Good and Evil Sister Sister Mother Daughter Aunt Niece or Big Bad Lioness Nice Kitty Neither are correct because they are not really related like family What is true is that Sekhmet Bastet and dozens of other goddesses were considered to be an Eye of Ra Bastet and Sekhmet were paired but not as opposite personalities of Bastet They were paired geographically The main place of Bastets worship was in Lower Egypt while Sekhmet was worshipped in Upper Egypt They traditionally called Bastet a She of the North and Sekhmet a She of the South Sometimes they were also called Lady of the East and Lady of the West It is true that Bastet had parts of Sekhmet in her personality

 D10The Eye of Ra

Ras name came from Re and Amen The name Re was from Upper Egypt and the name Amen came from Lower Egypt When Upper and Lower Egypt came together they changed the name to Amen Re Over thousands of years the name Amen Re evolved into Amen Ra and then just to Ra From then on people called him Re or Ra Ra used to mean mouth in the Egyptian Language Some names areRe the Creator Khepry etc

Ra has lots of forms and looks He has a sun disk floating above his head He looked a lot like Horus Ra can be a scarab beetle pushing the sun disc a hawk or a man with a hawk head He has lots of forms when he goes to the Netherworld 

Some time around the Middle Kingdom Ra and Osiris became friends This was unusual because Osiris lived in the Underworld and Ra lived in the Heavens All the other gods wanted to be friends with Ra They hoped that if they were friends with Ra that Ra would tell them Ras hidden name But Ra did have some enemies Seth was sometimes Ras enemy but Seth did help Ra fight Apep a snake god The fact that Seth helped Ra reminded all of the gods that Seth was not all bad Isis was another enemy of Ra She had tricked him into giving her his hidden name so her husband Osiris could be king of the gods 

The cult of Ra began to grow from around the time of the II Dynasty establishing Ra as the sun god By the IV Dynasty the Pharaohs were seen as Sons of Ra His worship increased much in the V Dynasty when he became a state deity Pharaohs had pyramids obelisks and solar temples built in his honor

Ra was the greatest god when it came to powers His powers live in his hidden name Only he knew his hidden name so only he could use the powers It was said that he had the best powers through out the land He could make anything he made people he made the world and he made the heavens That is how great his powers were One day Isis wanted to have his powers so she sent a serpent to poison him on his daily walk and when the pain was so bad Ra gave in and told her his hidden name Ever since then Isis has had some of Ras powers

Everyone wanted to be in Ras family because he was the main god His daughter that he had with Nut was named Hathor the goddess of love Ra had two children Shu the god of air and Tefnut the goddess of morning dew They had two children named Nut the goddess of the sky and Geb the god of earth They had four children named Isis the goddess of home Nephthys the goddess of mourning Set the god of the desert and Osiris god of the afterlife They paired up and had two more babies Anubis god of embalming and Horus god of the pharaohs

The anchovies are a family of small but common schooling saltwater plankton feeding fish They are found in scattered areas throughout the worlds oceans Anchovies are concentrated in temperate waters and are rare or absent in very cold or very warm seas

The anchovy is a small green fish with blue reflections These reflections are due to a silver stripe that runs along the length of the fish from the base of the caudal fin It is maximum nine inches in length and body shape is variable with more slender fish in northern populations The snout is blunt with small sharp teeth in both jaws The mouth is larger than those of herrings and silversides two fish which they closely resemble It eats plankton and fish larvae

The Anchovy can tolerate a wide range of temperatures and salinity Large schools can be found in shallow brackish areas with muddy bottoms as in estuaries and bays 

Spawning occurs between October and March but not in water colder than 12 C The anchovy appears to spawn 100 kilometers from the shore near the surface of the water

There are many Anchovies in the Mediterranean They are regularly caught on the coasts of Sicily Italy France and Spain The range of the species also extends along the Atlantic coast of Europe to the south of Norway

The anchovy is a good food source for almost every predatory fish in its environment including the California halibut rock fish yellowtail sharks chinook and coho salmon It is also extremely important to marine mammals and birds for example California brown pelicans and elegant terns The breeding success of these birds is strongly connected to anchovy abundance As time progresses and the anchovy population drops the population of the predatory species are also expected to declineFactdateMay 2007

They are also eaten by humans Anchovies preserved by being gutted and salted in brine matured then packed in oil are an important food fish both popular and infamous for their strong flavor In Roman times they were the base for the fermented fish sauce called garum that was a staple of cuisine and an item of long distance commerce produced in industrial quantities Today they are a key ingredient in Caesar salad and Spaghetti alla Puttanesca and are often used as a pizza topping Because of the strong flavour they are also an ingredient in several sauces including Worcestershire sauce and many fish sauces and in some versions of Caf de Paris butter They are most commonly marketed in small tins either as flat filets or as rolled anchovies where each fillet is rolled around a caper Both are quite salty The flat fillets are usually more salty than the rolled anchovies They are also marketed in jars and tubes as a paste mostly for use in making sauces such as anchovy essence Fishermen also use anchovies as bait for larger fish such as tuna and sea bass 

The strong taste that people associate with anchovies is due to the curing process Fresh anchovies known in Italy as alici have a much softer and gentler flavor In English speaking countries alici are sometimes called white anchovies and are often served in a weak vinegar marinade This particular preservation method is associated with the coastal town of Collioure in south east France The white fillets are sold in heavy salt or the more popular garlic or tomato oil and vinegar marinade packs

The European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus is the anchovy of commerce Morocco now leads the world in canned anchovies The anchovy industry along the coast of Cantabria now dwarfs the traditional Catalan salters though the industry was only started in Cantabria by Sicilian salters in the mid 19th century

Setipinna taty or ikan bilis is the anchovy commonly used in South East Asian cooking to make fish stock or sambals Anchovy is also used to produce budu by fermentation process

Anchovies can concentrate domoic acid which causes amnesic shellfish poisoning

Overfishing of anchovies has been a problem Since the 1980s large mechanized anchovy fishing vessels based in France have caught the fish in fine mesh dragnets

On September 29th 2006 it was reported in the Associated Press that millions of anchovies with a weight of over three tons had beached themselves in northern Spain near Colunga Asturias Tests on the dead fish did not detect any toxic chemical that could have caused the beaching and the current working theory is that the school beached itself trying to escape from hungry dolphins or tuna If the beached specimens had grown to maturity it would have been more than 100 tons of potential breeders

Indigenous Australians also known as Australian Aborigines are the native people of Australia They used weapons like boomerangs to kill animals for food Many of them suffered when white people from Britain arrived in Australia because of disease the loss of their hunting lands and unfair laws Aborigines have their own type of art

The first people of Australia were nomadic people who came to Australia from southeast Asia Scientists do not know exactly when they arrived but it is somewhere between 40000 and 60000 years ago When British came to Australia in 1788 they called these native people aboriginals meaning people who had lived there since the earliest times They travelled through the bush hunting with spears and boomerangs and searching for food such as plants grubs and insects and hunting for animals They had few possessions and made everything they needed This way of life does not change or harm the fragile environment of Australia The well being of the land and its plants and animals are vital and sacred to the aboriginal people Today there are about 517000 Aborigines in Australia   Most live in cities but a few thousand still try to follow a traditional way of life Aborigines have a unique way of traveling around they use songs passed from generation to generation

Aboriginal Australians believe that they have animal plant and human ancestors who created the world and everything in it This process of creation is called Dreamtime There are many songs and stories about Dreamtime which generations of aboriginal people have passed down to their childrenSay someone dies they get a new life as a plant or another person

Aboriginal art is mostly about dreamtime and is made as part of the ceremonies celebrating Dreamtime Paintings of the people spirits and animals of Dreamtime cover sacred cliffs and rocks in tribal territories Some of the pictures are made in red and yellow ochre and white clay others have been carved into the rocks Many are thousands of years old

Most aboriginal Australian live in cities and towns Some have benefitted from government education and aid programmes and have careers as teachers doctors and lawyers Many though are poor and isolated from white society They have lost touch with traditional aboriginal tribal ways and because they do not fit neatly into white Australian society they cannot share its benefits However they revive interest in the tribal cultural of their ancestors

As well as the curved returning boomerang aboriginal Australians use a straight non returning boomerang as a weapon for fighting and for hunting animals such as kangaroos

When British people came to live in Australia they decided that the land was empty that nobody owned the land in the way Europeans defined that word This was called Terra nullius Latin words for empty land Under British law all land belongs to the king who is then able to sell it to other people The sacred sites and other land which had belonged to aboriginal people for thousands of years were simply taken from them If they did not leave peacefully then the new settlers used force to get them to leave Many aboriginal people were killed during the settlement of Australia The aborigines that were left were made to live on in special areas reservations that the government set aside for them One of these was at Lake Tyers Victoria Many church groups set up missions to both look after the aborigines and to convert them to Christianity One of the church missions was set up by Moravian missionaries from Germany at Ebenezer Victoria

With the help of aboriginal lawyers aboriginal Australians have battled to get some of their land back In 1976 the Australian government agreed that aboriginal people have rights to their tribal territories and some land was given back On 3 June 1992 the High Court of Australia said that the idea of Terra nullius was wrong and the government brought in new laws to set up Native Title If aborigines can prove they have always used particular land it has not been sold or changed by government acts then the land could be claimed as aboriginal land

In Egyptian mythology Amun was a very powerful god He was often combined with Ra to form the god Amun Ra At one point in Egyptian history he was called the King of the Gods

Amun was the name of a deity in Egyptian mythology who became one of the most important deities in Ancient Egypt

Amuns name is first recorded as imn That means The hidden Because vowels were not written in Egyptian hieroglyphics Egyptologists have come to the result that the name must have been pronounced Yamnu originally The name survives into the Coptic language as Amoun

Amun was shown in human form seated on a throne wearing on his head a plain deep circlet from which rise two straight parallel plumes maybe meant as the tail feathers of a bird That would remind of his earlier status as a wind god 

When Amun had become more important than Menthu the local war god of Thebes Menthu was called the son of Amun However as Mut was infertile it was believed that she and thus Amun had adopted Menthu instead 

zh Amun was also known as the sun god He is to be believed to have appeared and sneezed making more gods and his tears became people

Aten was a form of the ancient Egyptian god of the sun Ra When Akhenaten was pharaoh Aten was made king of the gods He was pictured as a sun with rays that ended in hands

A clam is a type of shellfish Clams can be found in saltwater and freshwater Clams eat plankton and are eaten by small sharks and squid Clams can be eaten by people They may be found on menus in restaurants that serve seafood Clams are a fairly common form of bivalve therefore making it part of the phylum mollusca There are many clams in the ocean but some can also be found in some lakes streams and rivers

Clams have a burrowing foot that they use to dig down into the sand or mud to hide If you go to the beach and see little holes that appear in the sand each times the waves go away it is probable that clams made them Scientists classify clams by how far down they dig and what kind of surface they dig into Some burrow less than an inch under the sand while others dig several inches below the surface

The shell has 3 layers The top one is called mother of pearl because it is a coating of pearl material 

A living freshwater clam can work like a filter in fish tanks to keep the water clean

Bes was the ancient Egyptian god of protection of pregnant women newborn babies and the family He was a dwarf wearing a lions skin Bes does not look like he is Egyptian He is like gods found in other parts of Africa

To scare away demons during birth Bes would dance around the room shaking his rattle and yelling to scare away demons that might put a curse on the child After the child was born Bes would stay by himher When a baby laughed or smiled for no reason Egyptians believed that Bes was somewhere in the room making funny faces

His name appears to be connected to a Nubian word for cat besa which literally means protector Egyptians kept cats in order to attack snakes and creatures that might ruin crop stores such as mice and so Bes was naturally singled out as worthy of worship in Egypt

Images of the god were kept in homes to protect from evil and so he was shown quite differently from the other gods Normally gods were shown in profile but instead Bes appeared in portrait and sometimes in a soldiers tunic so as to appear ready to launch an attack on any approaching evil

In the New Kingdom tattoos of Bes could be found on the thighs of dancers musicians and servant girls

Like many Egyptian gods the worship of Bes was exported overseas and he was popular with the Phoenicians and the Cypriots

Bes the family god protected children from the dangers of snakes and scorpions Like the hippopotamus god Taweret Bes was the protector of women in childbirth The Egyptians put a statue in their room or a carving over their bed to protect them from bad dreams He brought good luck and good health to all that honored him This household deity was also the god of music dance and pleasure

Bes was shown in full face unlike the other gods who were drawn in profile This bandy legged large bellied dwarf wore an animal pelt and feathered headdress He brandished a weapon or played a musical instrument while hopping about Bes tail and lions main stood out from his dwarfish features With his tongue sticking out or teeth bared this god had a place in every home

Bes started out as multiple demons which morphed to form a rearing lion as his first combined form His power increased from the Old Kingdom to the New Kingdom He started out as the protector of the pharaoh but shifted to being worshiped by civilians In the New Kingdom the female form Beset developed from Bes Items with his depiction were common in a very broad field which included Sub Sahara Africa modern Turkey Cyprus Syria and Assyria This implies that Bes was highly popular in the Middle East The fact that Bes was depicted full face suggests he originated from Africa

The Hokkaido wolf is a subspecies of Gray Wolf Scientists believe it became extinct in 1889 There are people who said to have seen some Hokkaido wolves after that year but there is no proof that they actually did

In the Meiji Restoration in Japan Japanese farmers wanted to have American style ranches for raising livestock A US farmer named Edwin Dun started to import livestock to Japan When the wolves began attacking the livestock farmers started to kill them using poison

Hornets are the largest of the social wasps They can reach up to 55mm in length The true hornets make up the genus Vespa True hornets can be distinguished from other vespines by the form of their head Hornets live in Europe Asia Africa and The Americas They live in warm and wet forests and in desert climates They do not occur in climates where it is cold all year round

In spring a queen will found a new nest The queen will start building a basic nest In the built space she will lay eggs These hatch and become larvae The queen will feed the first larvae until they make a cocoon After transforming they will become the first workers These will do most of the work The workers will build a hierarchy amongst themselves

If the space where the nest is built becomes too small the colony will move to another spot 

In autumn young queens will hatch Young males will hatch from unfertilized eggs These males are called drones The young queens will build a cocoon to spend the winter once they have been fertilized All the other animals will die with the first frost

Hornets and yellowjackets are good for gardens This is because their prey is mostly made of insects which are considered pests They also feed on bees but their colonies only last for a year they die in winter A medium sized colony made of 300 400 animals will need about 500g of food per day during the high season that is in the summer months Animals hunted include flies wasps bees locusts beetles caterpillars dragonflies and spiders

Hornets are often confused with yellowjackets Yellowjackets are smaller and their coloring is different They are bright yellow and black 

Yellowjackets are attracted to the sweetness of human foods especially in autumn Hornets feed on live insects this sweetness does not attract them

Some other large wasps are sometimes referred to as hornets This is particularly true for the bald faced hornet in North America The bald faced hornet is mostly black and white in coloring This is very different from the black and yellow coloring of other wasps It is set apart by its black and ivory coloration The name hornet is used for this and related species mainly because of their habit to make aerial nests rather than the nests underground the wasps use Another example is the Australian hornet which is actually a species of potter wasp

There are some animals that have changed their appearance to look like hornets In these case looking like a hornet is a defense for the animal because it will be attacked less often These animals include the Lunar Hornet Moth the Hornet Moth the Hornet Mimic Hoverfly This behaviour is called mimicry

There is a kind of beetle called Velleius dilatatus that lives with honet nests It lives from the leftovers of the hornets food and from dead hornets It finds hornet nests with its very good sense of smell

Flying hornets which are hunting and which are not close to their nest will usually not sting unless they feel threatened They should not be squeezed making a breeze at them can also irritate them and make them feel threatened

Hornets hunt when there is only little light available  humans will call it darkness Like other insects they are attracted to light If possible the light should be extinguished for a short time The hornets will then continue as usual If it is not possible to put out the light a glass jar can be used to catch the hornet With a paper under the glass the hornet can then be transported to a safe place away from that light where it can be released

Hornets will defend their nest or hive Depending on the species of hornet they will do this in a radius of between 2m and 6m Concussions within that radius should be avoided If they are disturbed often they will make this radius bigger There are specially trained people who can move hornet nests  note that in many parts of Europe the hornet is an endangered species killing a hornet destroying or disturbing a hornet nest can lead to a fine 

Hornets have a stinger They use this to kill prey and to defend themselves Hornet stings can be very painful but they are not more dangerous than the stings of other wasps or bees With every sting there is the danger of an allergic reaction and of a shock after this reaction Also stings in the area of the mouth can make breathing difficult or impossible 

People who are allergic develop an Anaphylaxis  an allergic reaction This can be fatal if it is not treated immediately with Epinephrine 

Hornets can alert the whole nest This means that all workers there will defend it This can lead to a dangerous situation One sting of a hornet is not dangerous with 200 to 250 of them the situation is different

In Egyptian mythology Geb was the god of the earth Geb was the husband and brother of the sky goddess Nut and the father of Osiris Isis Nephthys and Seth When Seth and Horus fought to become the king of Egypt Geb made Horus the ruler of the living Gebs parents are Tefnut and Shu 

The ancient Egyptians believed that earthquakes were Gebs laughter

The animals of Geb are a snake and a goose Geb is sometimes equivalent to Greek titan Kronos Gebs name means weak one or lame one Geb is also god of vegetation and his other names are Seb Keb Kebb and Sebb

Geb hatched his egg which would become the sun Geb married Nut and had four children Their names were Osiris Isis Nephtys and Set Osiris and Isis married and eventually Set and Nephtys married One night Set measured Osiris to make a tomb for him They made a huge festival and there were many presents The last one was a little box A couple of villagers tried to fit into the box but it didnt work Then Osiris came and it fit perfectly But then Set shut it with Osiris inside and put molten lead over it so Osiris couldnt breathe When Isis found out she was very sad and was crying She looked at Osiris and then closed the lid gently And when Set found the tomb he cut him into pieces Isis put Osiris back together so he looked like a person again Then Isis had her first child named Horus When Horus found out that his dad died he tried to kill Set and Set tried to kill Horus Eventually Set got a huge wound that was filled with blood When that happened Geb said that Horus could take over Osiris place 

In Gebs temple priests fed him everyday like many of the other gods When gifts were given people were allowed to go to the gate or the forecourt The priests would collect gifts that the ordinary Egyptians gave to the gods Priests would pray to honor Geb for the people who came to the temple The temple was made out of big stone columns that supported a great big hall There were also very big gates that opened up to the Great Hall The rooms or chambers were lit by candles and incense would make the rooms smell nice and clean the air in the temple The chambers gradually decreased in size as priests went in and created a mysterious feeling The priests then found the chapel in the shrine which contained the Naos which had the statue of Geb

Gebs symbol was a goose and his skin was sometimes green representing the Nile River or black representing rich soil for vegetation Geb was depicted as a man wearing the crown of the North and other times he wore the crown of the South of Egypt Geb also sometimes wore a white crown or a goose on his head representing the earth Geb held a staff in his left hand and in his right hand he usually held an ankh which is the hieroglyph that meant life Not only did Geb wear a goose on top of his head but sometimes his would be covered by a goose head 

Geb was so powerful that when he laughed he made earthquakes start That is why he was named the Great Cackler Just like other gods Geb was very strong and could live a long time To show his powers for making life from the earth Geb is sometimes drawn with flowers coming out of his elbow He had many names which were Geb Seb Sebb Keb and Kebb Geb was also a Greek god named Kronos Although he was not as famous as his daughters and brothers he still had an important job

The Estates Theatre or Stavovsk divadlo in Prague is one of the oldest and most beautiful opera houses in Europe

The Estates Theatre became part of the National Theatre in 1948 People from three different groups perform opera ballet and drama there The same people also perform at the National Theatre and the Theatre Kolowrat

The Estates Theatre was built during the late 18th century At first it was known as Count Nostitzs Theatre The theatre opened in 1783 with a performance of the tragedy Emilia Galotti by the German playwright Gotthold Lessing It was built in the Neoclassical style Today it is one of the very few theatres that have hardly changed since it was built

Although the building is almost the same it always was the organisation of the Estates Theatre has changed several times in its history In 1798 it was called the Estates Theatre when it was bought by the Czech Estates When the Provisional Theatre opened in 1862 the Estates Theatre started to put on German plays and the name was changed to the Royal Provincial German Theatre From 1920 and 1948 it got its name back again In 1948 the organization became part of the National Theatre and was called Tyl Theatre In 1990 after some restoration it became known again as the Estates Theatre

Many of the greatest artists worked or had their music or plays performed in the Estates Theatre In 1787 the first performance took place of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts opera Don Giovanni Mozarts opera La Clemenza di Tito was also staged there for the first time in celebration of the coronation of Emperor Leopold II Other famous people who conducted there were Carl Maria von Weber and Gustav Mahler 

Czech plays were often performed there This made people interested in performing in Czech and so in 1848 the National Theatre was built

Today the Estates Theatre is still famous for dramas ballets and operas The opera company especially perform the operas of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart The movie about Mozart which was called Amadeus was filmed in the Estates Theatre

The Nrodn Divadlo or the National Theatre in Prague is a very famous building which has been very important for more than 150 years for the culture of Czech history

In the middle of the 19th century there were a lot of political changes in Europe Prague had been part of the Austrian Empire The official language was German Bohemia and Moravia now form the area of the Czech Republic In the 19th century the Czechs in these areas wanted to be able to put on plays and operas in the Czech language The National Theatre was built at a time when this was starting to become possible

The National Theatre was built because the Czech people wanted their own national identity The first stone was laid on May 16 1868 It was opened on June 11 1881 to honour the visit of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria Another 11 performances were given after that Then the theatre was closed down to finish the building While people were working to finish it a fire broke out on August 12 1881 which destroyed most of it However a lot of money was found and it was built again and opened on November 18 1883 with a performance of Smetanas opera Libue which he had composed for this occasion The story of the opera is based on a mythological story about how Prague began

It was an excellent theatre and it was not until 1977 that any more re building was necessary Then it was closed for six years and opened again in time for the 100th anniversary of its opening on November 18 1983 On that day again there was a performance of Smetanas Libue

Today the National Theatre has three ensembles opera ballet and drama These ensembles all perform in the National Theatre the Estates Theatre and the Theatre Kolowrat They put on a lot of Czech plays and operas but also productions from other parts of the world

In music a drone is a note which sounds all the time while a piece of music is played Some folk instruments always make a drone when they are played bagpipes and hurdy gurdies in European culture sitars in Indian music and many other instruments in Asian and African music Sometimes more than one drone is heard

Music with drones has to have simple harmonies because it is not possible to modulate to different keys Other things can make up for this for example Scottish bagpipe music has lots of little ornamental notes to make it interesting

Some Western Composers liked to use a drone to make it sound like bagpipes or other folk instruments Bach Franois Couperin and other Baroque composers often called such pieces Musette Sometimes they did this in orchestral music Haydn used a drone in the last part of his Symphony No 104 to accompany a folk tune

A pedal point is a note which keeps sounding for several bars usually in the bass They are often used towards the end of a piece of music to help to drive the music to a climax They are called pedal notes because they are often heard in organ music where the player puts one of his feet on a pedal note and holds it there 

Pedal points are usually on either the tonic or the dominant tones 

A good example of a dominant pedal can be seen in the Prelude in C major from Book I of the Welltempered Clavier by Bach

An example of a tonic pedal can be seen in the third movement of Brahmss German Requiem where the double basses play continuous Ds in the last section Because this lasts for the whole section some people might prefer to call this a drone

A double pedal is two pedal tones played at the same time

An inverted pedal is a pedal that is not in the bass It is often in the highest part 

Euclidean geometry is a system in mathematics People think Euclid was the first person who described it therefore it bears his name He first described it in his textbook Elements The book was the first systematic discussion of geometry as it was known at the time In the book Euclid first assumes a few axioms These form the base for later work They are intuitively clear Starting from those axioms other theorems can be proven 

In the 19th century other forms of geometry were found These are non Euclidean Carl Friedrich Gauss Jnos Bolyai and Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky were some people that developed such geometries Very often these do not use the parallel postulate but the other four axioms 

Euclid makes the following assumptions These are axioms and need not be proved

Euclidean geometry is a first order theory With it statements like For all triangles can be made and be proven Statements like For all sets of triangles are outside the scope of the theory

Jnos Bolyai was a Hungarian mathematician known for his work in non Euclidean geometry

In Roman mythology Diana was the goddess of hunting and in later times the moon and chastity Cypress trees were sacred to her She was the daughter of Jupiter and the Titan Latona In Greek mythology Diana was called Artemis She is also associated with fertility and nature Diana is also a female name

Thoth was considered the heart and tongue of Ra He was also the one who translated Ras will into speech 

The main shrine of Thoth was at Khemennu It was there that he was the head of the local company of deities He also had shrines in Abydos Hesert Urit Per Ab Rekhui Ta ur Sep Hat Pselket Talmsis Antcha Mutet Bah Amen heri ab and Ta kens

Thoth was mostly prayed to in the early dynasty He was also prayed through the five days of celebration They would sing hymns and chant spells for Thoth There were many celebrations like The feast of Thoth in the year He was a major god for the early dynasty

Thoth played very important roles in Egyptian myths He was said to have resurrected Osiris after he was slain by Seth and also later resurrected his son Horus He was also credited for creating 365 days instead of 360 One myth explains how Ra bans Nut from having children on any day of the year Thoth then goes to the moon god Khonsu and gambles five days out of him therefore giving five days when Nut can have children He also was sometimes said to take the place of the Primeval Goose and be the creator of the world and all other gods 

Thoth had one direct relation to Maat that people know of although some myths say he was the son of Ra His feminine counterpart was a goddess named Seshat She was also sometimes credited to be the inventor of hieroglyphs while Thoth taught them She was also said to be Thoths wife or daughter

Maat also played a big role next to Thoth He was there at the weighing of the heart noting while Maat weighed the heart They both stood on either side of Ras boat and also he was sometimes said to be Maats husband

Thoth was a unique god He is said to have two forms an Ibis headed human and a squatting dog headed baboon He held a stylus and a pallet and sometimes the symbol of life

Thoth had many titles and a lot of roles He was often called Three times Great Great He was mediator messenger scribe and teacher Some of his titles included Scribe of Maat in the company of the gods Lord of Maat Lord of divine words Judge of the two combatant gods Twice great or Thrice Great These numerous titles show that Thoth had a very significant importance to ancient Egyptian mythology He had his high point of worship in the Old Kingdom

When the Greeks conquered Egypt they related Thoth with Hermes their messenger god Thoths center city was Khemenu which the Greeks changed to Hermopolis city of Hermes Today ancient temples and ruins worshiping Thoth are there and what used to be Khemenu is now el Eshmunein

This is a list of Egyptian gods and goddesses from Egyptian mythology The ancient Egyptians worshipped many gods at different times and in different places Some gods changed in importance over time

In Egyptian mythology Nut was the goddess of the sky Her body made a protective layer over the Earth Nut was the sister and wife of Geb and the mother of Isis Osiris Nephthys Horus and Seth 

The ancient Egyptians believed that Nut swallowed the sun god Ra every night and gave birth to him every morning

Although Nut was pictured in many temples and tombs as well as on ceilings she had no building of her own like other major gods and goddesses She was not well observed in popular placesWhen night falls she swallows Ra the sun god

Nut was the goddess of the sky but had many other purposes as well She had three other names Nuit Newet and Nueth Nut was known as the mother of all gods including Ra because she swallowed him up every night and gave birth to him again in the morning She was also the mother of heavenly bodies whose laughter was thunder and tears were rain She often carried the sun across the sky She played a part in funeral beliefs and was sometimes drawn on the tops of sarcophagi Nut was one of the nine major gods She was the personification of the sky and the heavens Egyptians called her the mother of the sky Nut was one of the oldest deities among history

As the sky goddess Nut was shown arching over Geb her fingertips near his head and her toes by his feet She was commonly pictured dark blue and wore no robes although some Egyptians believed that Nut wore a rainbow colored robe with stars all over her body Big paintings of her were often found on ceilings of tomb chambers She can be seen with small vulture wings or a vase on her head She was often shown as a big cow when carrying the sun across the sky The cow was a very motherly figure

Nut was a very beautiful and kind goddess She was loving and caring so she fell in love with Thoth the god of knowledge and Geb the god of the Earth She was a very motherly figure which then again shows how generous and kind she was Nut was a very strong and independent goddess for she would not marry just any person she was forced to she did what she wanted

Nut had a strong relationship with Geb her twin brother and Thoth the god of scribes and wisdom She was the goddess of the sky and Geb was the god of the earth In the morning they were separated but at night they came together which created the darkness This is a story the ancient Egyptians used to explain their 365 day calendar Nut loved Geb and Thoth but she was married to Ra When Ra found out about her secret loves he was furious He told Nut that she could not have any children in the 360 days of the year This saddened her so she went to Thoth for help He gambled with Khonsu the moon god to create 5 more days so she and Geb had five children Osiris was first Horus was second Seth was third Isis was fourth and Nephthys was the fifth These days were called the Demon DaysfactdateJuly 2010 She and Ra also had one daughter named Sekmet the lion goddess who had a flip personality called Hathor the goddess of love and peace She is gorgeous some Egyptians say They worship her a lotShe was a protective goddesses like Bastet

The ancient Egyptians had three calendars but the Agricultural one was the one that was used in everyday life It was made up of three seasons each containing four months The seasons were Akhet Peret and Shemu Nut liked Geb but Ra did not like that so he told Shu their father the air god to separate them Then Ra put a curse on Nut so she could not have babies on any of the three hundred sixty days of the year Thoth wanted to let Nut be able to have babies so he challenged Khonsu the moon god to a game of Senet If he won he would be able to add five days of the year if he lost he would be killed Obviously Thoth won and got five more days for the year On the first day Nut had Osiris to replace Ra but Set later deceived him and Osiris became god of the underworld on the second day she had Horus the war god on the third day she had Set the god of storms and evil on the forth day she had Isis the goddess of magic on the fifth day she had Nephthys the river goddess After a long time the Egyptians realized the calendar was off because they did not have the quarter day at the end like we do by having leap year The calendar said it was flood season but the flood did not come until later The ancient Egyptians noticed the star Sirius would rise right before the flood They used this as the beginning of the year and the beginning of the flood

Paolo Uccello was a painter from Florence in Italy during the time known as the Early Renaissance He is famous as one of the first painters of the Italian Renaissance to use perspective in his pictures

Most of what we know about Uccello comes from Giorgio Vasari who wrote Paolos biography about 75 years after Uccello died Uccello was born about the year 1396 in the city of Florence Vasari says that he was called Uccello which means Bird because he loved all animals and would often paint them but he loved birds best of all When he was about 11 years old he was sent to be trained in the workshop of one of the most famous artists in Florence a young man called Lorenzo Ghiberti

Ghiberti was famous because he had won an important competition to make a huge set of beautiful doors for the oldest church in the city The doors took 27 years to make so in that time lots of different artists helped in the making of them and lots of talented young people like Uccello were trained in the workshop Uccello worked there for 8 years

While Uccello was still quite young he got an important job to do all by himself He was asked to paint some frescoes showing stories of different saints for the monks of a Church of San Miniato on a mountain above Florence It was a large beautiful church but the monks at the monastery did not eat expensive food They only ate bread and cheese So Uccello also ate nothing but bread and cheese for breakfast lunch and dinner sometimes made into soup After a few weeks he thought he was turning into a cheese So he ran away from the monastery and went back to Florence leaving his work unfinished 

One day when two of the monks were walking in the street they chased Uccello and caught him They asked him why he had never finished the job Uccello told them that it was because of the cheese The monks laughed and promised that he would get better food if only he would promise to come back and finish what he had started He came back to finish the frescoes called The Lives of the Church Fathers They are painted in dull colours as a protest against the simple food Vasari who tells this story says that Uccello never ate cheese again in his life

Today these frescoes at San Miniato have been badly damaged by water Most of them have fallen off the wall or have faded However one beautiful angel remains quite clear 

In 1425 Uccello went to the city of Venice where he lived and worked for several years

In 1436 he was back in Florence to do some important jobs for Florence Cathedral The first was to paint a large fresco in honour of an English Knight Sir John Hawkwood

The painting of Sir John is quite unusual It is of Sir John on his war horse Uccello has painted it to look like a statue of the soldier on his horse He has used white and greenish grey against a dark red brown background To add colour Uccello has painted the horses saddle and bridle bright red The horse is standing on a painted plinth like the base of a statue and Sir Johns name is written on the plinth as if the statue was standing in the town square And in large letters are words which translate as The Work of Paolo Uccello

The painting was very popular and some years later another soldier was remembered in the same way with a painting by the artist Andrea Castagno

The second job that Uccello had at the Cathedral was to paint the clock The clock has two faces one that can be seen outside in the square and another which is on an inside wall of the cathedral Uccello had to paint a clock face around the hand on the inside wall Uccello painted the round clockface into a square shape and put the head of a prophet in each corner The prophets faces are all very different but the thing that is the most clever about them is that Uccello painted bright light and dark shadows on their faces as if the light was coming from a real window which is high on the wall to the left side of the clock

The other important job for the cathedral was to design two big round stained glass windows each one 45 metres across The cathedral had been built in the last century but it had been left with a huge hole at the centre which needed a roof of some sort An artist called Brunelleschi had come up with a brilliant plan for a dome and the whole city was excited about getting it built Workmen from every part of the town formed 8 gangs to build the 8 parts As the dome grew it had 8 large windows that needed glass The best artists in Florence were asked to design them Three of Uccellos designs were used but unfortunately one was smashed in 1828 The two that remain are The Nativity and The Resurrection

By 1453 Uccello was married to Tomassa Malifici In that year she gave birth to Donato who was named after the sculptor Donatello In 1456 the couple had a daughter Antonia who later became a nun and a painter

The paintings that are regarded as Uccellos masterpieces are frescoes of Noahs Ark and the Great Flood in the Church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence Unfortunately they are quite badly damaged and partly lost but even so it is possible to see what a clever artist Uccello was There are two things remarkable about the pictures Firstly they are very realistic The second is that they use perspective to give the impression that the viewer is looking into the scene

As in the fresco of Sir John Hawkwood Uccello does not use many colours The pictures are painted in white pale grey blue grey and just a little black The landscape is grey the water is blue grey the people are white with grey shadows But the paintings are made lively by all the bits of red All the man made things like the Ark the old doors barrels up side down tables and broken things that are floating on the flood water are all painted in the same red colour Some of the people are wearing big black and white hats that were popular in Florence In the disaster of the flood one man is floating in a barrel Another man seeing an old man standing on a little hill has grabbed him round the ankles to pull himself up Another man with part of his great big fashionable hat slipped down around his neck is thumping on the wall of the ark with a club The wind is blowing the rain is pouring down and twigs and branches are flying in the wind It is a scene of terror 

One of the richest men in Florence was Cosimo Medici who liked to spend money on works of art He asked Uccello to paint three large paintings on panels each about 3 metres long to decorate his palace The subject was to be Three scenes from the Battle of San Romano in which the Florentine troops defeated the neighbouring town of Siena In fact it was not a very fierce battle Modern soccer matches between Florence and Siena are probably more bloody But it made three very good pictures which were later divided up between three important art galleries The National Gallery London has the left hand scene of Niccolo Tolentino leading his troops on his magnificent rearing white charger and wearing of course a great big Florentine hat of red and gold brocade The Uffizi Gallery in Florence has the middle scene in which the leader of the enemy forces Bernadino della Ciarda has been struck by a lance and is falling off his horse backwards The right hand scene which is in the Louvre in Paris shows the brave Michelotto di Cotignola swinging his horse around to attack an opponent with his sword

Even though at first glance each battle scene looks quite chaotic the paintings are very carefully organised This is particularly noticeable in the way Uccello has arranged the lances that are held upright by the troops and the many weapons that are lying on the ground They all serve the purpose of leading the viewers eye into the painting They create perspective And while the battle is raging in the foreground in the background are mountains fields hedges and woods In them are farmers hunters and animals The difference in size between the figures in the foreground and the figures in the background create distance in the picture

Uccello studied perspective all his life in a way that was quite obsessive Sometimes he would not come out of his house for weeks His friend Donatello another respected artist begged him to do more painting and less study Uccello became very good at mathematical calculation of the perspective of buildings but it was not until his old age that he could fully understand how to calculate the sizes of things like people in the distance His last painting shows a hunting party with a great forest of trees people and dogs all going away into the distance from near to far

In 1469 Paolo wrote on his tax assessment that he was too old to work any more and that his wife was ill Giorgio Vasari who 100 years later researched and wrote the lives of many painters wrote that unfortunately Paolo was badly offended by Donatello who looked at his latest painting and told him for a joke to cover it up Vasari said that Paolo was so hurt that refused to come out of his room but sat working at his drawings and whenever his wife called him to come to bed he would answer What a wonderful thing is perspective

He died on 10 November 1475 leaving behind him his old wife and a daughter Antonia who was also very good at painting Unfortunately none of her pictures are known today

This is the manuscript that the monk wrote

To sing as a round one singer would begin at the beginning a second singer would start at the beginning as the first got to the point marked with the red cross then the third would join in when the second singer got to the red cross and so on until all six were singing The repeated pattern is marked Pes The instructions are written in Latin

The kumquats or cumquats are a group of small fruit bearing trees The edible fruit is similar to other Citrus but is smaller

Kumquats are slow growing evergreen shrubs or small trees from 2545 m tall with dense branches Sometimes they have small thorns The leaves are dark glossy green and the flowers pure white similar to citrus flowers

Kumquats came from China and have long been cultivated there and in Japan They were introduced to Europe in 1846 by Robert Fortune who was collector for the London Horticultural Society and a short time later into North America 

They are much hardier than citrus plants as oranges The Nagami kumquat needs a hot summer ranging from 25 C to 38 C but can withstand frost down to about 10 C It grows in the tea regions of China where the climate is too cold for other citrus fruits even the Mikan orange 

The English name kumquat derives from the Cantonese pronunciation gam1 gwat1 The alternate name broken wikt linkbroken wikt link also pronounced gam1 gwat1 in Cantonese is now more commonly written by Cantonese speakers

A ground bass or basso ostinato is an ostinato pattern in the lowest notes which keeps playing while the melodies in the higher notes change This was often used in baroque musical works An example is the famous Canon in D by Pachelbel

An example of a rhythmic ostinato is the first movement from the Planets Suite by Gustav Holst This is the movement in 54 time which describes Mars the Roman God of War Bolro by Maurice Ravel also uses a repeated rhythm all the way through the piece

An example from popular music is Pink Floyds Money

Using an ostinato is a good way for people to start composing their own pieces of music

The Feijoa also known as Pineapple Guava or Guavasteen is an evergreen shrub or small tree 1 7 m in height It comes from the highlands of southern Brazil parts of Colombia Uruguay and northern Argentina 

The fruit matures in autumn and is green chicken egg sized and ellipsoid shaped It has a sweet aromatic flavour The flesh is juicy The fruit drops when ripe but can be picked from the tree before to prevent bruising Feijoa fruit have a distinctive smell The ester methyl benzoate smells strongly of feijoas and the aroma of the fruit is caused mostly by this and other closely related esters

It is a warm temperate to subtropical plant that will also grow in the tropics but requires some winter chilling to fruit In the northern hemisphere it has been cultivated as far north as western Scotland but does not fruit every year as winter temperatures below about 9C will kill the flower buds Large quantities are grown in New Zealand where the fruit is a popular garden tree and the fruit is commonly available in season

The fruit is usually eaten by cutting it in half then scooping out the pulp with a spoon The fruits have a juicy sweet seed pulp and slightly gritty flesh nearer the skin The flavour is aromatic and sweet If the utensils needed to eat it this way are not available the feijoa can be torn or bitten in half and the contents squeezed out and consumed

Fruit maturity is not always apparent from the outside as the fruits remain green until they are overmature or rotting When the fruits are immature the seed pulp is white and opaque becoming clear and jelly like when ripe Fruits are at their optimum maturity when the seed pulp has turned into a clear jelly with no hint of browning Once the seed pulp and surrounding flesh start to brown the fruit is over mature and should not be eaten

Dietrich Buxtehude was a German composer and organist He is one of the most important composers of the mid Baroque period He is best known for his organ works which are very often heard at recitals and church services He also wrote a lot of excellent choral music and music for instruments including the viola da gamba an instrument which he played He had a very important influence on Johann Sebastian Bach When Bach was a very young man he walked over 200 miles to hear Buxtehude play the organ

Very little is known of Buxtehudes earliest years We cannot be sure where he was born His family came from the town of Buxtehude in North Germany but had moved to Oldesloe which is now in Germany but at that time it was part of Denmark His father was organist in Oldesloe but around the time of Dietrichs birth the family moved to Helsingborg which is now called Hlsingborg and is in Sweden but at that time Helsingborg too was part of Denmark 

In 1641 the family moved to Helsingr which was just across the water in Denmark Dietrich Buxtehude probably went to school in Helsingr and learned music from his father When he was 20 he got his first job at Helsingborg in the Marienkirche where his father had been organist some years before Sweden and Denmark were at war at the time fighting about which country Helsingborg should be in This must have made things rather difficult for the young Buxtehude The people who went to the Marienkirche were German speaking 

In 1668 Buxtehude got the job of organist at the Marienkirche in Lbeck in Germany This was a very important job at one of the biggest churches in Germany The organist before him had been a man called Franz Tunder He had a daughter Anna Margarethe and Buxtehude married her His job was not only to play the organ but also to tune it and do a lot of administration in the church He composed many cantatas for the services and organized five evening musical performances every year These concerts were called Abendmusik and were held at 400pm after the Evening Service Unfortunately we do not know what music was performed at these concerts

Buxtehude stayed in this job for the rest of his life He never travelled very far Nicolaus Bruhns was one of his pupils and Pachelbel wrote a piece of music called Hexachordum Apollonis for him  In 1706 when Johann Sebastian Bach was 21 he got permission for four weeks holiday so that he could go to Lbeck to hear Buxtehude play He stayed in Lbeck for four months and so he got into trouble when he went back to his job at Arnstadt

In 1707 Buxtehude wanted to retire Whoever took his job would have to marry Buxtehudes daughter Anna  Bach and Mattheson were interested in the job but decided not to take it Probably they did not want to marry Anna Buxtehude Buxtehude died and the man who had been his assistant got the job and married Anna shortly afterwards

The organs that Buxtehude played were very large instruments with bright sounds His music is very grand and impressive Many of his organ pieces have several sections each one at a different speed They often sound like a free improvisation Some of the sections are fugues At least 128 vocal works survive they are nearly all church music He wrote instrumental works chamber music and pieces for harpsichord

Buxtehude is a town in Northern Germany It has 39000 inhabitants It is by the Este river which joins the city to the important river Elbe just 6 miles away

Buxtehude is known as The Fairytale Capital of the world The tale of The Bunny and the Hedgehog by the Brothers Grimm is set in this town

The Harlem Renaissance is the name for a movement in African American culture in the 1920s and 1930s which has had a big influence on African American literature philosophy and music The Harlem Renaissance is also called the Black Literary Renaissance The New Negro Movement and The flowering of Negro literature 

The movement began in Harlem New York after World War I In 1925 a book was published called The New Negro edited by Alain Locke This book was a collection of writing by African Americans which looked at their peoples lives and experiences since the Civil War From 1925 onwards there was a movement called the New Negro Movement named after the book 

The movement began to affect the thinking of many African American writers and artists of all sorts They challenged the thinking of many white Americans towards black Americans They refused to be treated as if they were not equal They refused to just copy the sorts of writing art and music that white Americans did They wanted to celebrate the fact that their African culture had survived through the terrible years of slavery and was being reborn

The Thirty Years War caused things like famine and disease These things were very bad The war lasted for 30 years but the problems that caused the war were not fixed for a long time after the war was over The war ended with the Treaty of Westphalia

There were several reasons that the Thirty Years War started

First The Peace of Augsburg which was signed quickly by Charles V agreed with the 1526 Diet of Speyer and stopped the fighting between the Lutherans and the Catholics in Germany

The Peace of Augsburg said that

The Peace made the violence end for a bit But it did not fix the real reason that the Lutherans and Catholics were fighting Both of them said it meant different things The Lutherans said it was only an agreement that would last for a short time Calvinism came quickly into Germany Calvinism was a third Christian group in Germany but it was not part of the Peace of Augsburg

Second a lot of the powerful countries in Europe in the 17th century often disagreed about matters of Politics or Economics Spain wanted land in some of the German states because the Germans owned some of the Spanish Netherlands The Dutch fought the Spanish The Spanish had been controlling them They gained freedom in some wars that ended in 1609

Third the Holy Roman Empire was a broken group of nations The empire had nations like the Austrian House of Hapsburg Bavaria Electoral Saxony the Margravate of Brandenburg the Palatinate Hesse the Archbishopric of Trier and Wrttemberg and other small nations and towns Only Austria was capable of operating on its own Countries often made alliances with other places ruled by relatives

Fourth Religious groups were not agreeing during the second half of the 16th century The Peace of Augsburg was not working because some bishops had not given up their bishoprics and Catholic rulers in Spain and Eastern Europe wanted to make Catholicism strong in the region This caused fighting between the groups The Catholics made many Protestants leave their home lands Some places gave Protestants permission to worship These disagreements caused violence

Fifth the Holy Roman Emperor Matthias died without any children to take his place in 1619 He was Catholic His lands were given to his cousin Ferdinand of Styria Ferdinand was Matthiass closest male relative He became Ferdinand II Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand had been educated by the Jesuits and was a Catholic He wanted to make Catholicism the only religion again This made him unpopular in Hussite Bohemia They rejected Ferdinand and launched the Thirty Years War The War can be divided into four major phases the Bohemian Revolt the Danish intervention the Swedish intervention and the French intervention

Time 16181625

Emperor Matthias who had no children had died leaving the throne to Ferdinand II Some of the Protestant leaders of Bohemia thought they would lose the religious rights granted to them by Emperor Rudolf II They liked the Protestant Frederick V elector of the Palatinate better Frederick V was the creator of the League of Evangelical Union Other Protestants supported the opinion of the Catholics So in 1617 Ferdinand was elected by the Bohemian Estates to become the Crown Prince and automatically upon the death of Matthias the next King of Bohemia The king elect then sent two Catholic councillors as his representatives to Hradany castle in Prague in May 1618 Ferdinand wanted them to run the government while he was gone Suddenly the Bohemian Hussites took them put them on a mock trial and threw them out of the palace window which was 20 feet off the ground Remarkably they survived and did not get hurt The Catholics said that angels appeared and carried them to safety while the Protestants said that they landed in a pile of manure which saved their lives

Certain databases known as relational databases store the data in the form of mathematical relations In that context database normalisation makes sure that the data stored in the database makes sense Depending on how the data is organised certain anomalies or problems can happen when certain data is originally inserted into the database when data is updated or when data is deleted from the database All three operations can lead to data integrity being lost When this happens a certain entry in the database no longer makes sense

The concept of database normalisation was introduced by Edgar F Codd in the early 1970s Codd is also credited as the inventor of the relational database model He himself specified three sets of criteria that different databases must meet He called these sets normal forms If a relation meets a certain normal form it is not vulnerable to certain modifications that will affect data integrity The drawback of meeting such a set of criteria is usually that querying certain data from the database will become more difficult

A clipboard is a thin board with a large clip at the top Clipboards are a little larger than a piece of paper They are used to support paper with one hand while writing on the paper with the other hand Clipboards are often used in situations where a person may not be able to find a good writing surface

Ugliness is a property of physical things which are not nice to look at Something or someone who has ugliness is called ugly This word is commonly used in when talking about human appearance The opposite of ugliness is beauty

Ugliness can be a matter of opinion Two people can look at the same object and one may think it is beautiful and the other may think it is ugly This is shown in the popular phrase broken wikt linkeye of the beholderBeauty is in the eye of the beholder However scientists have found that human ugliness is part of sexual selection and shows poor genetic or physical health

Although ugly usually means a lack of physical beauty the property of ugliness may also be used to describe other things such as music literature or human behavior

The word texture means what things are made of and how they feel Textures can be described as rough smooth hard soft liquid solid lumpy gritty etc The word texture is used for many different things It can even be used in abstract senses eg for music and poetry

We often talk about the texture of surfaces The earths surface may have sand stones soil silt etc These all feel different to touch The texture of plants varies some grasses are rough to touch others are smooth Cacti are very prickly the wood of treetrunks is often rough People who study rocks talk about the different textures of rock

People like or dislike food because of its taste but the texture of the food also plays a part in whether we like it or not We enjoy the feel of it in our mouth Food can be hard soft lumpy gritty eg a cake made with ground rice Adding some lettuce to a cheese sandwich will change the texture of the sandwich it makes it more crunchy 

In architecture we often talk about texture This can mean the things that the buildings are made of It can also mean the general way it looks eg whether everything is built close together or whether there is plenty of space This is an abstract use of the word because it compares the way we see things to the way things feel

Painters talk about the texture of paintings This can be seen clearly in Pointillism which is a way of painting by using lots of little dots This gives the painting a very interesting texture

In music we can talk about the texture of a piece of music If there are a lot of notes being played at once we could call this a thick texture If there are just two or three notes being played so that every note can be heard clearly we could call this a thin or clear texture Music may have a polyphonic texture or a chordal texture The word texture this time is being used to describe something we hear instead of something we feel

Cruiserweight is a division in boxing for fighters who weigh over 175 pounds and up to 200 pounds The weight limit was once 190 pounds The World Boxing Council created this weight division in the late 1970s because it felt that some fighters were too small to fight in the heavyweight division but too big to fight in the light heavyweight division So they made a weight class in between Many cruiserweight champions and contenders may eventually fight in the heavyweight division 

Evander Holyfield was cruiserweight champion

The minimum wage is the least amount of money that employees of a business can be paid Minimum wage is a relative term Different countries have different minimum wages Nunavut in Canada has a minimum wage of 850 per hour Ontario another place in Canada has a minimum wage of 1025 per hour Some people think the minimum wage should be raised so poor people will have more money Others think it is worse because the government will not have enough money to pay all the employees so they will raise the taxes or raise the inflation Some people think that the minimum wage is harmful to employees because companies only hire employees whose labor is worth the price they are required to pay They think that if the minimum wage is raised employees who do nok work well will lose their job because companies cannot afford to pay them the raised minimum wage

Many of the most famous and best loved works of art in the world were created during the time known as the Renaissance The Renaissance began about 1400 and lasted until about 1600 Italy and in particular the city of Florence is thought of as the home of Renaissance art 

Many Flemish painters from the area of modern Belgium were also very busy at this time The style of their pictures and their use of oil painting influenced the Italian painters 

The painting is a half length portrait and depicts a woman whose expression is often described as enigmatic The ambiguity of the sitters expression the monumentality of the half figure composition and the subtle modeling of forms and atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the paintings continuing fascination Few other works of art have been subject to as much scrutiny study mythologizing and parody

Venus of Willendorf also known as the Woman of Willendorf is an 111 cm high statuette of a female figure It was discovered in 1908 by archaeologist Josef Szombathy at a paleolithic site near Willendorf Willendorf is a village in Lower Austria near the city of Krems The statuette is made of a kind of limestone that can not be found in the area It is colored with red ochre

A study made in 1990 suggests that the figure was made between 24000 and 22000 BCE Very little is known about its origin how it was made or what it meant to the people who made it

The Venus is not a realistic portrait but rather an idealization of the female figure Her vulva breasts and swollen belly are very pronounced This suggests a strong connection to fertility Her tiny arms are folded over her breasts and she has no visible face Her head is covered with what might be coils of braids eyes or a kind of headdress The lack of a face has prompted some archaeologists and philosophers to view the Venus as a universal mother 

The nickname urging a comparison of this rather obese figurine to the classical image of Venus causes resistance in some modern analysis The ironic identification of these figurines as Venus pleasantly satisfied certain assumptions at the time about the primitive about women and about taste Christopher Witcombe has noticed At the same time there is professional reluctance to identify her as an Earth Mother goddess of paleolithic Old EuropeFactdateFebruary 2007 Some suggest that her corpulence would represent high status in a hunter gatherer society and that beside her obvious fertility she could be an emblem of security and successFactdateFebruary 2007 

The statues feet do not allow it to stand on its own Due to this it has been speculated that it was meant to be held rather than simply looked at 

Catherine McCoid and LeRoy McDermott think that the figurines were done as self portraits by the women themselves Most scientists agree that the head seen from a profile view while having no distinct facial features appears to be looking down The common physical characteristics of all of the Venus figures are a thin upper torso largely exaggerated breasts large buttocks and thighs a large stomach and oddly bent short legs that end with disproportionately small feet Yet when looked upon as if you were a woman looking down at your body the physical features in perspective seem correct There are striking similarities between the Venus of Willendorf and a pregnant woman when perceived from above

Venus of Willendorf is part of the collection of the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna 

Since this figures discovery and naming several similar statuettes and other forms of art have been discovered They are collectively referred to as Venus figurines

The Acts of Supremacy was passed by Elizabeth I in 1558 This act stated that the king not the pope was the head of the Church of England

When this act was originally passed by Henry VIII in 1534 he had been the Head of the Church in England but under Elizabeths reign she was Supreme Governor of the Church in England

The change may have been made to appease Catholics who could not accept the monarch as Head of the Church seeing the church as the Popes domain or it may have been made because Elizabeth was a woman In the sixteenth century women were regarded as inferior to men in spiritual matters and many were uncomfortable with the idea of a woman being in charge This act also included an oath of loyalty to the Queen that the clergy were expected to take If they did not take it then they would lose their office A High Commission was established to ensure that the oath was taken

A compact fluorescent lamp is a type of lamp designed to fit into the same space and usually also socket as an incandescent bulb but with the advantages of a fluorescent lamp Many CFLs can directly replace an existing incandescent lamp

The purchase price of a CFL is often much higher than an incandescent lamp of the same output and the light from CFLs looks different to light from incandescent lamps CFLs have a longer rated life and use less energy than an incandescent lamp of the same brightness A CFL can save over US30 in electricity costs over the lamps lifetime compared to an incandescent lamp

An electric current is applied to mercury vapor inside the tube causing it to emit ultraviolet light A phosphor on the walls of the tube absorbs the ultraviolet light This causes an electron to jump up to an orbital with a higher energy When the electron drops back down to its normal orbital the phosphor re emits its energy as visible light

The ballast prevents too much electricity from flowing through the tube It also starts the lamp with a high voltage for a split second when it is switched on The ballast is either inside the fixture or most commonly in the plastic base of the bulb If the ballast is in the bulb the bulb is called a self ballasted lamp There are two types of ballasts magnetic and electronic Magnetic ballasts have mostly fallen out of use as they are less efficient than electronic ballasts they cause the bulb to flicker and they do not start instantly Electronic ballasts were at one time more expensive than magnetic ballasts but now the price is about the same

The average rated life of a CFL is 8 to 15 times longer that of incandescents CFLs typically have a rated lifespan of 6000 to 15000 hours whereas incandescent lamps are usually manufactured to have a lifespan of 750 hours or 1000 hours

The lifetime of any lamp depends on many factors including operating voltage manufacturing defects exposure to voltage spikes mechanical shock frequency of cycling on and off lamp orientation and ambient operating temperature The life of a CFL is significantly shorter if it is turned on and off frequently In the case of a 5 minute onoff cycle the lifespan of a CFL can be reduced to close to that of incandescent light bulbs The US Energy Star program suggests that fluorescent lamps be left on when leaving a room for less than 15 minutes to avoid this problem If the light must be switched on and off frequently Cold cathode CFLs can be used Cold cathode CFLs are designed for many more onoff cycles than standard CFLs

The mercury inside the tube is toxic and makes these bulbs hazardous waste The bulbs must be taken to a recycling center after they stop working Most CFLs contain an amount of mercury smaller than the tip of a ballpoint pen During normal use the mercury cannot escape although it will escape if the bulb is broken If a single bulb breaks it is not usually a cause for concern It is recommended to open windows to air out the room and to clean up broken glass with duct tape instead of a vacuum cleaner

A fictional universe is a made up world that is used as the setting for one or many works of fiction It is often used in books but can be used in any form used to tell a story for example role playing games television or movies It can be said that every work of fiction makes a world of its own A fictional universe is used when things in a story become a part either of other stories or of games or other things 

Fictional universes are most often used in science fiction and fantasy stories but they can be used in any type of fiction A fictional universe usually has certain things in them that make them different from the real world These things could affect anything from cities the author created to entire galaxies In most fictional universes the laws of physics are different to let things exist which commonly do not for example magic or space travel to other planets Fictional universes may also take place in any time period during the past present or future 

There are many examples of fictional universes They are often used to provide a common theme to many different types of things

The Star Wars expanded universe is a fictional universe that was started from the first Star Wars movie Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope in 1977 The movie created a universe full of people and planets with space travel to other worlds Alien creatures and a type of magic Two later movies were made that took place in the same fictional universe the movie created After that many books comic books and video games were made that created new characters places and stories all taking place in that same universe Most of this took place either during the time of the first three movies or created more of the story of the universe as time passed after the story told in the movies ended Three additional movies were also made that took place in the same universe but at an earlier period of time This lead to writers creating more stories about the history of the characters and their worlds

In 1997 writer and director Joss Whedon created a television series called Buffy the Vampire Slayer from a movie he had written several years before The stories of the television series mainly took place in the fictional town of Sunnydale California The series had creature such as vampires and werewolves It also dealt with magic Over time as the series went on and more and more stories were written it developed into what is called the Buffyverse While the focus of the main story and its characters was just one town the events of the story and the rules the universe followed had effects on other towns parallel worlds other dimensions and even other periods of time Characters from the show were used to make another show Angel which took place in Los Angeles but still had demons and vampires The universe has been used in many books as well as several video games While the series was still being made several other writers were also making comic books which told stories that took place during the same time of the series Whedon himself wrote a series of comic books dealing with a vampire slayer named Fray from several hundred years in the future Whedon is currently writing a new comic which is often nicknamed Season Eight It tells the stories of what happens to the characters from the series after its seven seasons as a television series

Nearly every type of fiction has its own created universe Many of these examples started in one category and now exist in many of them For example Harry Potter started out as a series of books then moved to movies and then video games

Certain opioids have been used as illegal drugs They can cause impairment if taken in large amounts

The term Opiate is sometimes used as a synonym Most often it is used to refer to opium alkaloids and semi synthetic opioids

So called endgenous opioiods are peptides produced by the human body They are used to respond to stress to suppress pain and hunger They also interact with sex hormones and they can cause a states of Euphoria Mammals produce them in the brain

There are different alkaloids that naturally occur in opium Opium is produced from Opium poppy The most important ones are morphine codeine and thebamine Papaverine and noscarpine also occur in opium but the way they work is different Most of the time they are therefore not counted as opiates

Paracetamol is a common analgesic It is a drug that is used to relieve pain It can also be used to reduce fever as well as certain kinds of headache This makes it an antipyretic It is a common ingredient in drugs used against flu or colds 

The words acetaminophen and paracetamol both come from the chemical names for the compound N acetyl para aminophenol and para acetyl amino phenol In some contexts it is shortened to apap for N acetyl para aminophenol

Harmon Northrop Morse was the first to synthesize Paracetamol in the year 1878 Drugs containing Paracetamol became common in the 1950s Today these drugs are among the most widely used together with those containing salicylic acid or Ibuprofen In the year 1977 Paracetamol was put on the List of Essential Medicines of the WHO 

Paracetamol is considered safe for use The drug is commonly available and easy to get even without a prescription People often take incorrect amounts of Paracetamol Sometimes this is because people do not know how much they should take but other times this is because they are trying to commit suicide Very often the liver is damaged if too much is taken A dose of 150mg per kg will lead to irreversible damage of the liver and may cause it to fail This amount is a dosis of about 10g for an adult For people whose liver has already suffered damage such as for alcoholics as well as for those with a limited secretion of Paracetamol this amount can be much lower

In England and Wales about 30000 people per year go to the hospital because of paracetamol poisoning and about 150 die of the poisoning A limit of the packet size in which Paracetamol is available has shown a limited success in preventing Paracetamol related suicides In Great Britain and the United States Paracetamol is the leading cause of acute liver failure about half the cases occur because of unintentional overdose

Morphine is a strong opiate pain killer drug It is the principal active agent in opium and the prototypical opiate Like other opioids eg diacetylmorphine morphine acts directly on the central nervous system to relieve pain and at synapses of the nucleus accumbens in particular Morphine is highly addictive when compared to other substances and tolerance and physical and mental dependences develop very rapidly 

Patients on morphine sometimes say they have insomnia visual hallucinations and nightmares if these occur then reduction in dosage or switch to an alternative opioid analgesic should be considered

The word morphine is derived from Morpheus the god of dreams in Greek mythology He is the son of Hypnos god of sleep

Morphine is used legally

Codeine is an alkaloid found in opium in concentrations ranging from 03 to 30 percent Codeine can be extracted from opium Today most codeine is synthesized from morphine through the process of O methylation

Codeine is used to treat the following

Codeine is often marketed as drugs in combination with paracetamol as co codamol Research has shown the combination to be very much more effective than paracetamol and much less addictive that pure codeine 

There are similar combinations with aspirin as co codaprin or with ibuprofen These combinations provide greater pain relief than either agent alone Drug synergy is an important principle

Opium is a narcotic resin produced from opium poppies It contains up to 16 morphine an opiate alkaloid which is most frequently processed chemically to produce heroin for the black market The resin also has non narcotic alkaloids in it Some of these are papaverine and noscapine Opium is also known as afeem and was called Gods Own Medicine during its time of greatest popularity It can be yellow or dark brown and has a bitter taste

Opium has been used and produced for thousands of years During this time the source plant has been changed and adapted The methods of processing the plant and extracting substance and consuming it also have The medicinal use of poppies for pain relief dates back to ancient times but widespread use in patent medicines or as a recreational drug has occurred only in the last few centuries Drug prohibition laws in most countries have been introduced only during the last century Today the opium crop is worth in excess of 400 million legally and 7 billion illegally after processing Opium has caused many wars in China such as the Opium Wars because of heavy addiction to the drug People who become addicted to opium become dull lazy and even sleepy

Since the 1980s the political groups of the parliamentary right joined forces around the values of economic liberalism and the building of Europe Their rivalries had contributed to their 1981 and 1988 electoral defeats Therefore some politicians were in favour of the formation of a confederation a party

UMP was founded from the merger of the Gaullist conservative Rally for the Republic the conservative liberal Liberal Democracy and a part of the centrist Union for French Democracy Many Christian Democrats the social liberal Radical Party and the centrist Popular Party for French Democracy joined the party

The party was thus born out of the meeting of four major French political traditions Gaullism Liberalism Christian Democracy and Radicalism

The UMP generally supported the policies of President Jacques Chirac However in 2004 the party showed increasing signs of independence The unpopularity with the electorate of Jacques Chirac and Jean Pierre Raffarins government led most members of the UMP to support Nicolas Sarkozy a rival of Chirac The party also publicly disapproved of Turkeys proposed membership in the European Union which Chirac was in favour of

The first president of the UMP Alain Jupp a close associate of Jacques Chirac resigned on 15 July 2004 On 29 November 2004 Nicolas Sarkozy announced that he would officially take over the presidency of the UMP

 Apophis is a near Earth asteroid that worried people for a short time in December 2004 This was because observations seemed to show that it would hit the Earth in 2029 Other observations had more accurate or better ideas During 2029 Apophis would go through a gravitational keyhole an area in space no more than about 400 meters across This would make it hit the Earth on April 13 2036 This danger made the asteroid Level 1 on the Torino impact hazard scale until August 2006

More watching showed scientists that the keyhole would be missed On August 5 2006 Apophis was lowered to a Level 0 on the Torino Scale As of October 19 2006 the probability that Apophis will hit the Earth on April 13 2036 is something around 1 in 45000 It may also hit in 2038 but however the probability for that encounter or meeting is 1 in 123 million

Dance music is music that is made to be danced to In a broader sense an enormous amount of music sounds like dance music even if it is not composed for dancing The history of dance music is similar to the history of dance as well as to the history of music

Dance music was probably the first kind of music there was Thousands of years ago human beings must have discovered the joy of making noises by beating sticks in rhythm They probably danced as they did this

We know that the Ancient Greeks danced to music although we do not know much about what that music was like

In the Dark Ages dancing was very popular The Christian Church thought that dancing was bad because it was always linked to the devil This is why the church people thought that musical instruments were bad because instruments were used for dancing

The earliest Western dance music that we know are some of the medieval dances such as caroles and the Estampie  Composers started to write their music down on music staves Dance music had to have a regular beat so that the dancers could dance in time This is why barlines were invented The music was divided into bars with a particular number of beats in each bar This was different from church music which was based on plainchant which was very free in the way it was sung

In the Baroque period many composers started to write pieces of music which were based on dance rhythms Composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach wrote suites which were collections of dance movements The most popular dances in a suite were allemande courante sarabande minuet and gigue Even when not writing dance movements a lot of Baroque music is based on dance rhythms for example the grand opening chorus of Bachs St Matthew Passion is based on the rhythm of a sicilienne

In the Classical music period composers wrote a lot of symphonies and string quartets They had four movements The third was normally a minuet although it was not for dancing to Composers such as Mozart and Schubert also wrote a lot of music which was for dancing or easy listening This was the popular music of its time

Baruch Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher of Portuguese Jewish origin He is considered to be one of the great Rationalist philosophers of the 17th century Other famous rationalists include Gottfried Leibniz and Ren Descartes

Spinozas ideas were not cherished by the Jewish community of the time and Spinoza was excommunicated in 1656

An important idea in Spinozas philosophy is God and Nature are the same thing Opposing Dualism Spinoza said that the body and the mind are two of Gods infinite attributes 

There is no good or evil in Nature and that these words only have meanings for human beings For a person an event that leads to happiness is good and an event that leads to suffering is bad 

Spinoza describes two types of thoughts or emotions

The goal of every person is to intellectually love God

Rationalism is a branch of philosophy where the validity of an idea is determined by logic rather than religious means such as revelations meditation emotions or observations

Rationalist philosophers believe that all knowledge can be understood through a process of reasoning without any external sources They do not believe that human beings can understand everything this way but that it is theoretically possible Rationalist philosophers attempt to understand ideas like God and the Soul in this manner

The first people to talk about rationalism were Marin Mersenne and Ren Descartes in the 17th and 18th centuries Other philosophers who are seen as rationalist today include Baruch Spinoza Gottfried Leibniz and Immanuel Kant Famous people opposed to this idea were David Hume and John Locke

Rationalism also influenced natural law Natural law is a theory that says that there are laws given by nature valid everywhere Deism was also influenced by rationalism According to deism a supreme being created the universe This being and other religious truths can be determined by observing nature and finding natural laws This would make religions that are based on revelation unnecessary

Elephants Dream is a short movie made using mostly open source software Blender was the main program used to make the movie It began production in September 2005 and was released on March 24 2006 It was first developed under the name Orange then later changed to Machina then finally to Elephants Dream since the people working on the movie could not decide how Machina would be pronounced The movie is 11 minutes long

The movie has a very random and abstract nature Despite the films title Elephants Dream does not have any elephants or dreams It instead has Proog and Emo in a extremely bizarre construction referred to only as the machine Proog tries to introduce Emo to its nature but Emo is reluctant and argues about its purpose Bassam Kurdali Director of Elephants Dream explained the plot of the movie by saying The story is very simple Im not sure you can call it a complete story even It is about how people create ideasstoriesfictionssocial realities and communicate them or impose them on others Thus Proog has created the concept of a special placemachine that he tries to show to Emo When Emo does not accept his story Proog becomes desperate and hits him Its a parable of human relationships really You can substitute many ideas instead of Proogs machine  the story does not say that creating ideas is bad just hints that it is better to share ideas than force them on others There are lots of little clueshints about this in the movie many little things have a meaning but we are not very tight with it because we are hoping people will have their own ideas about the story and make a new version of the movie In this way we tie the story of the movie with the open movie idea  Ton Roosendaal announced the film in May 2005 He is the chairman of the Blender Foundation The Blender Foundation and the Netherlands Media Art Institute funded the project The Foundation raised a lot of their funds by selling pre orders of the DVD Everyone who preordered before September 1 has his or her name listed in the films credits The film was released for download on the Official Orange Project website on May 18 2006

The Chapel Royal is a department of the monarchs household in the United Kingdom Second the term is often used for Royal Chapels These are churches under the monarchs direct rule

Incorrectly the term is also used for the choirs of these chapels The correct name for these choirs is the Children of the Chapel They are a group of priests and singers who sing church services for the British monarch It is an old tradition 

Today there are two Chapels Royal at St Jamess Palace near Buckingham Palace in London These chapels do not belong to the diocese That is why they are called royal peculiars Services are held every Sunday except during August and September Members of the public are welcome to go to these services This is the only time that the public can go into the royal chapels The choir also sing at special services including one held every year on 6 January to celebrate Epiphany when offerings of gold francinsence and myrrh are made on behalf of the queen

The Chapel Royal dates back to the late 13th century At that time the priests and choir travelled with the king wherever he went

In the 17th century the chapel had its own building in Whitehall which burned down in 1698 Since 1702 it has been based in St Jamess Palace

In the 16th and 17th centuries the choir was the best choir in England William Byrd and Thomas Tallis were both organists there during the reign of Elizabeth I Boy choristers from choirs outside London were sometimes made to join the Chapel Royal if they had beautiful voices These boys also took part in plays at the king or queens court Charles II liked musical instruments so the choir were often joined by violins lutes and viols The men in the choir were called Gentlemen of the Chapel Royal

Some very famous composers were organists at the Chapel Royal These include Thomas Tallis William Byrd John Bull Orlando Gibbons John Blow Henry Purcell Jeremiah Clarke William Croft and George Frideric Handel organist from At the time Handel was appointed he was still German not English so he was not allowed to be a member Instead he was given a special title Composer of Musick of His Majestys Chappel Royal

Today the Choir rehearses twice weekly at St Jamess Palace The choir consists of six Gentlemen in Ordinary who are professional singers and ten boys who have scholarships to go to the City of London School where they are called Queens Scholars 

The composer Sir Peter Maxwell Davies who is Master of the Queens Music works closely with the Chapel Royal He wants to compose a new carol for them every Christmas

The head of the Chapel Royal in Scotland is a Dean Another Chapel Royal once existed in Ireland 

Orlando Gibbons was an English composer and organist He was one of the most important composers of his day He is famous for his church music and organ music He lived in the late Tudor and early Jacobean periods

Gibbons was born in Oxford where his father was a city wait The family moved to Cambridge and his brother Edward who was 15 years older than Orlando became Master of the Choristers at Kings College  Between 1596 and 1598 Orlando sang in the choir of Kings College Cambridge where his brother was master He entered the university in 1598 and got the degree of Bachelor of Music in 1606 He married and had seven children

James I made him a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal where he was organist from at least 1615 until his death In 1625 he became senior organist at the Chapel Royal with Thomas Tomkins as junior organist He was also keyboard player in the privy chamber of the court of Prince Charles and organist at Westminster Abbey He died an early death in Canterbury of apoplexy and a monument to him was built in Canterbury Cathedral

Gibbons wrote a lot of keyboard works around thirty fantasias for viols some madrigals and many popular anthems He was very good at writing counterpoint as well as lovely melodies His famous verse anthem This is the record of John is often sung by choirs at Advent It has a lovely solo for a countertenor who takes it in turns with the full chorus Gibbons wrote two settings of the Evensong service a long one with several verses and the Short service His full anthems include O Lord in thy wrath and the Palm Sunday setting of O clap your hands together for 8 voices

Waits or Waites were British town pipers From medieval times up to the beginning of the 19th century every important British town and city had a band of Waites Some other countries in Europe also had waits They were called Stadtpfeifer in Germany and Pifferi in Italy

The duties varied in different towns and at different times in history One of their most important jobs was to play at certain times of day so that people knew what the time was They often played from the top of church towers Sometimes they were also guards watching from the towers so that they could spot any danger They were like watchmen making sure everything was all right They woke people up in the mornings by playing music in the streets

The instruments they played also varied Mostly they were loud wind instruments such as the shawm It was a paid job The waits wore smart liveries and silver chains of office with the towns arms

In Germany the Stadtpfeifer would also play at church services They would play shawms or trombones on normal days but trumpets and drums on feast days

In Britain there were no more waits after 1835 The name waits is still used in Christmas Waits

The oath was a pledge signed by 576 members out of 577 of Frances Third Estate and a few members of the First Estate on June 20 1789 in a tennis court near the Palace of Versailles 

The meeting hall of the Estates General had been locked accidentally but the Third Estate thought that this was an invasion of their rights and were very angry with the king They stood in a nearby indoor tennis court They swore an oath that they would not move until the voice of the nation was heard and their demands were met They were joined by the nobles and clergy

The vote had always been taken by class and usually the clergy and the nobility voted to support whatever the king wanted so the vote of the middle class did not matter The middle class argued that voting should be by poll not by order because they had more representatives than the first two estates combined They also wanted the Estates General to meet as one body so that voting would be by poll rather than by class

A week later the king agreed and the Estates General met as the National Assembly

A bar chart is a type of chart which shows the values of different categories of data as rectangular bars with different lengths A histogram is a bar chart that shows how data is spread over its categories

A pie chart is a type of chart with the shape of a pie or circle It presents the relationship of different parts of the data One would easily see the biggest or smallest share of the total data by simply looking at the pie chart

Pie charts should be used only when the sum of all categories is meaningful for example if they represent proportions

Pie charts are rare in scientific writing They are more common in business and economics One reason for this may be that it is more broken wikt linkdiffucultdifficult to compare the size of items in a chart when area is used instead of length Stevens power law says that it is harder to see small differences using visual area than when using length This means that length is a better scale to use because differences can be found out easier

This can be shown with the image to the right The pie chart and the bar chart have the same data Most people have difficulty putting the slices in the pie chart in order by size from biggest to smallest When using the bar chart it is much easier to tell the difference between bars that are very similar in size

Stevens power law is a proposed relationship between the magnitude of a physical stimulus and the intensity or strength that people feel 

Most people think that it describes a wider range of sensations than Weber Fechner law But critics argue that the validity of the law is not sure

The theory is named after psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens Although the idea of a power law had been suggested by 19th century researchers Stevens is credited with reviving the law and publishing a body of psychophysical data to support it in 1957

The table to the right lists the exponents reported by Stevens

Stimulus is a change in the environment around a person or thing that can feel the change It is often used in physiology Stimulus can include feelings like heat cold and pain When a stimulus is applied to something that can feel it it causes a reflex For example if an animal is burned by touching fire it will react by quickly moving away from it Because of this stimulus can be thought of as something done to an object to make it react 

When a sensory nerve and a motor nerve communicate with each other it is called a nerve stimulus

A stimulus is often the first component of a homeostatic control system

In psychology a stimulus is part of the stimulus response relationship of behavioural learning theory

A logic gate is an electronic component that can be used to conduct electricity based on a rule The output of the gate is the result of applying this rule to one or more sources These sources may be two wires or the output of other logic gates Logic gates are digital components They normally work at only two levels of voltage a positive level and a zero level Commonly they work based on two states On and Off In the On state voltage is present In the Off state the voltage is at zero The On state usually uses a voltage in the range of 35 to 5 volts This range can be lower for some uses Logic gates compare the state at their inputs to decide what the state at their output should be A logic gate is on or active when its rules are correctly met At this time electricity is flowing through the gate and the voltage at its output is at the level of its On state Logic gates are electronic versions of Boolean logic

With an AND gate both inputs must be at an On state for the output to be On Using the image at the right if A and B are both in an On state the output will be an On state If either A or B is in an Off state the output will also be in an Off state A and B must be On for the output to be On 

With an OR gate if either input in On the output will be On Using the image at the right if either A or B is On the output will also be On If both A and B are Off the output will be Off 

The NOT logic gate simply changes the signal from On to Off or from Off to On

In physiology transduction is the broken wikt linkconversionconversion or change of a stimulus from one form to another 

Transduction in the nervous system typically means synaptic events where an electrical signal is converted into a chemical one by the release of neurotransmitters 

In sensory transduction a chemical or physical stimulus is transduced by sensory receptors into an electrical signal

For example in the visual system sensory cells called rod and cone cells in the retina change the physical energy of light signals into electrical impulses that travel to the brain The light causes a change in a protein called rhodopsin In this example more light hitting the receptor results in the transduction of a signal into fewer electrical impulses

SC Corinthians Paulista is a football club which plays in Brazil

Football had already established itself as the popular new sport in Brazil and when the dry season came and the fields dried out they were soon filled with lovers of the new game So Paulos sporting elite had formed several clubsGermnia Paulistano and Campos Elseos among them but access to the game was still largely restricted to the citys well off

So a group of working class fans  painter and decorators Joaquim Ambrsio Antnio Pereira and Csar Nunes cobbler Rafael Perrone driver Anselmo Correia foundry worker Alexandre Magnani cook Salvador Lopomo labourer Joo da Silva and tailor Antnio Nunes  decided to start their own team Bataglia decided to get involved he was named the clubs first president

The new club needed a name Joaquim Ambrsio suggested they call themselves after the Corinthians Casuals Football Club the famous English team that was then on tour in Brazil The press and fans in Brazil who were following the tour shortened the English clubs name to Corinthians Team and so the founders did away with the aopstrophe and the club won its elegant name Corinthians

Corinthians is also known as Timo Coringo The Musketeer and Champion of the Champions

Finally the club picked colours The clubs first strip was beige with black trim and had the distinctive letters C and P for Corinthians Paulista However when the strips were washed the black bled into the beige The directors could not afford to keep buying new strips every time the colours ran so they decided to change their colours They swapped the beige for white In present day the colours of Corinthians are Black and White

The name of Corinthians s stadium is Alfredo Schrig also know as Little Farm or So Jorge Park and with a capacity crowd of 20000 Because the size of their fans Corinthians host their matches at Paulo Machado de Carvalho Stadium also known as Pacaemb Corinthians is the second best supported club in Brazil after Flamengo with a fan base of approximately 40 million

The team from Varzea Paulista Playing away from home in their first match Corinthians were expected to lose heavily but they showed they were not there just to make up the numbers and they battled hard before narrowly going down by a goal to nil

The defeat turned out to be a one off Four days later Corinthians proved they would be a name to be reckoned with and beat Estrela Polar 2 0 The honour of scoring the clubs first goal went to striker Lus Fabi who wrote himself into the history books by grabbing the opener They followed the match with an unbeaten streak that lasted two years

They then won 1 0 away at Minas Gerais and then beat So Paulo do Bexiga 4 0 at home They had secured their place in the big league

Things got even better the following year and in 1914 a dynasty took hold In just their second Paulista Championship Corinthians destroyed the competition and won all 10 games scoring 39 times in the process Neco ended the tournaments top goalscorer with 12 goals

Corinthians picked up yet another Paulista Championship in 1922 but this victory had something special about it The winner took the title not only of Paulista Champions but also of Centenary Champions a title they would hold for at least the next 100 years

By this time winning the Paulista was becoming routine The team won the league three years in a row in 1922 1923 and 1924 under the command of Neco the clubs first great idol and would do so again in 1928 1929 and 1930

The great and only rival of Corinthians is Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras This is the most derbie and traditional rivalry in Brazilian football The fans of Corinthians called Palmeiras as a pig and the fans of palmeiras called Corinthians as a skunk

However and between 1931 and 1934 a series of bad results left the team trailing Corinthians lost to all their big rivals of the time and failed to make an impression in the league never finishing higher than fourth

The turnaround came in 1937 and for the rest of the decade there was only one team in the state Corinthians won the Paulista Championship in 1937 1938 and 1939 to become the first team ever to win three back to back titles three times Even today no other team has managed to equal such a feat The man who led the way was centre forward Teleco One of the clubs greatest ever goalscorers he topped the scoring charts in 1937 and 1939 The former year he scored almost half the clubs goals while in the latter he got an amazing 60 percent

The 100 goal attack made history not only for the club but also for the league In 1951 a front line made up of Carbone Cludio Luizinho Baltazar and Mrio scored 103 goals in 30 games in the Paulista Championship an average of 343 per game The title was theirs as was the trophy for top goalscorer which went to Carbone who got 30 of the teams goals

In the years that followed more titles were added to the growing trophy room at Parque So Jorge In 1952 the Timo won the Paulista Championship for the second successive year with Baltazar finishing top scorer In 1953 they took the Rio So Paulo title and the Little World Cup  the clubs first international title  and in 1954 they walked off with another Rio So Paulo as well as the Paulista do IV centenrio de So Paulo In 1956 and 1957 they won the Invencible Trophy the cup given to the team that went the longest number of games undefeated

In 1976 Corinthians almost won their first Brazilian League title and the clubs fans played a starring role in one of the most memorable moments in footballing history Corinthians were drawn against Fluminense in the semi finals of the league play offs at the Maracan More than 70000 Corinthians fans made the six hour trip up the motorway to Rio de Janeiro in a massive convoy that was christened the Corinthians Invasion

10131977 Corinthians won the first game but lost the second and so needed to win a third and deciding match to take the title It was quite a struggle with the match goalless until the 81st minute Then a Z Maria free kick was directed onto the bar by Vaguinho Wladimir headed the rebound back towards goal where Oscar was on hand to knock it off the line The ball fell to Baslio in the area and he hammered it into the net and gave Corinthians the goal they so desperately wanted The 1977 Paulista Championship was theirs

The Timo was always one of the most important clubs in Brazil But the Corinthians Democracy movement was unique in world football Through organisation team spirit and democracy they did something no other team has managed before or since When players as politically and socially conscientious as Scrates Wladimir Casagrande and Zenon get together then there are bound to be changes in the dressing room Those four stars were the driving force behind the greatest ideological movement in the history of Brazilian football Corinthians Democracy And this in the middle of the countrys military dictatorship Corinthians Democracy did something that seemed impossible Through football the most popular sport in the country they got people talking about all sorts of important and relevant questions concerning society democracy and the end of military rule In addition to that not inconsiderable feat they showed that it was possible to create a society in which everyones opinions are heard and respected and where democracy through the imposition of the wishes of the majority could prevail They won the Paulista Championship in 1982 and 1983 beating city rivals So Paulo both times In 1982 they battled back after losing the first game 3 2 to take the next two matches 1 0 and 3 1 and lift the trophy The next year they won again thanks to a series of brilliant performances from Scrates The good doctor scored all the teams goals in the semi finals against Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras as well as in the final against So Paulo Futebol Clube His four goals brought the team their 19th Paulista Championship

The 1990s was to prove a glorious decade for Corinthians who captured three Brazilian Championships three State Championships and a Brazilian Cup in quick succession

In 2000 Corinthians who captured FIFA Club World Championship victory against Vasco da Gama at the Maracan Stadium This match had attendance of 73000 peoples This is the most important title of Corinthians Corinthians played the final game with Dida ndio Fbio Luciano Adlson Klber Vampeta Rincn Marcelinho Carioca Ricardinho Edlson Luizo Coach Oswaldo de Oliveira 

The final months of 2004 marked a new era for the Timo and for Brazilian football The partnership between MSI and Corinthians revolutionised the game and brought internationalists like Carlos Tvez Javier Mascherano Roger Carlos Alberto and Gustavo Nery to the club The future was bright for the club and fans could not help but feel optimistic they would enjoy many more triumphs in the coming years

And so it proved with success coming quicker than they could have hoped for Led by Argentine star Carlos Tvez the Timo had a sensational league campaign in 2005 and won their fourth Brazilian League Title in 2005

More new signings were made in 2006 with Ricardinho Rafael Moura and goalkeeper Silvio Luiz coming to the club in a bid to strengthen a squad that would be competing for another Brazilian League title and the Copa Libertadores

Lyrics are the words to a song A person who writes lyrics is called a lyricist

The lyrics of a song will usually have a meaning Some times the meaning is easy to find but other times it can be very difficult to know what the lyrics mean Some lyrics are so strange that it is nearly impossible to understand them In such cases people tend to look more at the form articulation meter and symmetries of the lyrics instead of looking at their meaning

There are many websites that have the lyrics to songs This may be a bad thing since many web sites include copyright lyrics without permission from the copyright holder The United States Music Publishers Association which represents sheet music companies created a campaign against such sites in December 2005 MPA president Lauren Keiser said that the sites are completely illegal and that he wanted to see some site operators put in prison

A style guide is a set of rules for language usage and design of documents Some style guides are about things related to graphic design such as arranging words and white space on a page Website style guides often help with visual or technical things Literary style guides help with choosing the best words common errors in grammar punctuation and spelling and help for how to express ideas in a precise fair and forceful way

Some modern style guides are for use by all people These are usually more about language than about how it should look

Style guides do not stop a writer from using his own unique style but some writers believe style guides are too restrictive

Like language itself many style guides change as time passes For example the Associated Press stylebook is updated every year

The Retiro Park is the best known park in Madrid It was planned in 1632 as palace gardens by King Felipe IV Retiro means retreat or a place to rest

Yellow spot or macula is an oval yellow spot near the center of the retina of human eye It has a size of 15 millimeters in the spock of the eye

It is specialized for seeing things with highest clearness or visual acuity

The retina is the thin layer of cells that lines the back of the eyeball in humans and in many animals It is made mainly of neurons and its role is to sense the light which gets into the eye and send information about it to the brain

The information about light is for two different purposes and it takes two different paths Information about light which travels through the optic nerve is for sight Information about light which travels through the retino hypothamalic tract is for adjusting circadian rhythms to the 24 hour day

4Kids Entertainment gets most of its Anime series from Japan Before showing the series in the United States and United Kingdom the series are edited This editing includes changing the words from Japanese to English It may also include changing other things which could be thought to be bad For example cigarette smoking is often removed before being shown in the United States Changing the names of items from Japanese items to American items is also often done This is done so the person watching can understand the show more easily 

Many times the story of an episode is changed completely to make it better for children Some people believe all the changes to the Anime is a bad thing They say that the series should be shown exactly the same as it was originally created They feel 4Kids made Americanized kiddy version of the original series and that it is not right to do this 

Cubism was a very important avant garde art movement which started in 1906 in France 

Cubism is a style of art which aims to show all of the possible viewpoints of a person or an object all at once It is called Cubism because the items represented in the artworks look like they are made out of cubes and other geometrical shapes Cubism was first started by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque Analytical Cubism is the first type of cubism Most analytical Cubists painted and drew in monochrome so that the person who was looking at the painting did not pay attention to colour but only to the shapes and the forms that were being shown

This was changed in 1912 when Picasso first started painting with colours and using collages Collage is when you glue together different cut up pieces of paper to make an artwork This new form of Cubism was called Synthetic Cubism Picasso invented collage because he was tired of the way he was making his art and wanted to try out something new Pablo Picasso created over 20000 pictures From 1912 to 1919 was Picassos Synthetic Cubism Period 

Picasso and Braque only showed their artworks in privately owned galleries Because of this they are called the Gallery Cubists

Soon there was a group of painters who painted in a Cubist style who showed their artworks in public galleries which in Paris at the time were called Salons This group of painters were called the Salon Cubists These artists were interested in showing in their artworks mathematical and philosophical ideas that were new at the time 

Many critics now think that the work of the Gallery Cubists is better than that of the Salon Cubists but some disagree However most people agree that the Gallery Cubists had a bigger influence overall and more impact on the rest of 20th century art than the Salon Cubists

At the time very few people knew about the Gallery Cubists because they were so secretive and private but everyone knew about the Salon Cubists This is the opposite of how we know about Cubism today Pablo Picasso the Gallery Cubist is very famous but far fewer people know about the Salon Cubists Some of the Salon Cubists include

Visual acuity is acuteness or clearness of vision especially form vision which depends on the sharpness of the retinal focus within the eye the sensitivity of the nervous elements and the interpretative faculty of the brain

VA is a quantitative measure of the ability to identify black symbols on a white background at a standardized distance when the size of the symbols is varied The VA represents the smallest size that can be reliably identified VA is the most common clinical measurement of visual function 

Some people may suffer from other visual problems such as color blindness reduced contrast or inability to track fast moving objects and still have normal visual acuity Thus normal visual acuity does not mean normal vision The reason visual acuity is very widely used is that it is a test that corresponds very well with the normal daily activities a person can handle and evaluate their impairment to do them

Board could mean 

The Pitman arm is a component that converts the angular motion of a sector shaft into linear motion 

It is used in automobiles or trucks to steer the wheels 

The Pitman transmits the motion it receives from the steering box into the drag link So it makes it move left or right to turn the wheels in the appropriate direction The idler arm is attached between the opposite side of the centre link from the Pitman arm and the vehicles frame to hold the centre link at the proper height

A solvent is a liquid that becomes a solution by dissolving a solid liquid or gaseous broken wikt linksolutesolute The most common solvent in everyday life is water 

Most other commonly used solvents are organic chemicals These are called organic solvents Solvents usually have a low boiling point and evaporate easily or can be removed by distillation thereby leaving the dissolved substance behind Solvents should therefore not react chemically with the dissolved compounds they have to be inert Solvents can also be used to extract soluble compounds from a mixture the most common example is the brewing of coffee or tea with hot water Solvents are usually clear and colorless liquids and many have a characteristic smell The concentration of a solution is the amount of compound that is dissolved in a certain volume of solvent The solubility is the maximal amount of compound that is soluble in a certain volume of solvent at a specified temperature

Common uses for organic solvents are in dry cleaning as paint thinners as nail polish removers and glue solvents in spot removers in detergents in perfumes and in chemical syntheses The use of inorganic solvents is typically limited to research chemistry and some technological processes

Some solvents including chloroform and benzene are carcinogenic Many others can damage internal organs like the liver the kidneys or the brain

In chemistry the term inert is used to describe something that is not chemically active The noble gases were described as being inert because they did not react with the other elements or themselves 

No one knows that the reason that inert gases are completely inert to basic chemical reactions is because their outer valence shell is completely filled with electrons With a filled outer valence shell an inert atom is not able to acquire or lose an electron and is therefore not able to participate in any chemical reactions For inert atoms or molecules a lot of energy is involved before it can combine with other elements to form compounds A high temperature and pressure is necessary and sometimes requires the presence of a catalyst

For example elemental nitrogen is inert under standard room conditions and exists as a diatomic molecule N2 The inertness of nitrogen is due to the presence of the very strong triple covalent bond in the N2 molecule

Inert atmospheres of gases such as dinitrogen and argon are routinely used in chemical reactions where air sensitive and water sensitive compounds are handled

The name for electron shells comes from the Bohr model in which groups of electrons were believed to go around the nucleus at certain distances so that their orbits formed shells

The valence shell is the outermost shell of an atom in its uncombined state which contains the electrons most likely to account for the nature of any reactions involving the atom and of the bonding interactions it has with other atoms Care must be taken to note that the outermost shell of an ion is not commonly termed valence shell Electrons in the valence shell are referred to as valence electrons 

In a noble gas an atom tends to have 8 electrons in its outer shell This serves as the model for the octet rule which is mostly applicable to main group elements of the second and third periods In terms of atomic orbitals the electrons in the valence shell are distributed 2 in the single s orbital and 2 each in the three p orbitals  

For coordination complexes containing transition metals the valence shell consists of electrons in these s and p orbitals as well as up to 10 additional electrons distributed as 2 into each of 5 d orbitals to make a total of 18 electrons in a complete valence shell for such a compound This is referred to as the eighteen electron rule

Electron subshells are identified by the letters s p d f g h i etc corresponding to the azimuthal quantum numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 etc Each shell can hold up to 2 6 10 14 18 22 and 26 electrons respectively or 2 electrons in each subshell The notation s p d and f originate from a now discredited system of categorizing spectral lines as sharp principal diffuse or fundamental based on their observed fine structure When the first four types of orbitals were described they were associated with these spectral line types but there were no other names The designations g h and so on were derived by following alphabetical order

A wheelchair is a type of chair usually used by disabled people

A wheelchair is moved either manually or by automated systems such as electric motors which can be controlled by the wheelchair user or by somebody walking behind or beside the wheelchair if the wheelchair user needs help to move their wheelchair 

Wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness injury or disability Wheelchairs can have extra cushions and other parts added to improve support if the wheelchair user cannot keep their body in a good sitting position or to make the wheelchair more comfortable to sit in The earliest record of the wheelchair in England dates from the 1670s Oxford English Dictionary 1989 Vol XX p 203 and in continental Europe this technology dates back to the German Renaissance

Fuel oil is a fraction obtained from petroleum distillation either as a broken wikt linkdistillatedistillate or a residue 

Broadly speaking fuel oil is any liquid petroleum product that is burned in a furnace or boiler for the generation of heat or used in an engine for the generation of power except oils having a flash point of approximately 40 C and oils burned in cotton or wool wick burners In this sense diesel is a type of fuel oil Fuel oil is made of long hydrocarbon chains particularly alkanes cycloalkanes and aromatics The term fuel oil is also used in a stricter sense to refer only to the heaviest commercial fuel that can be obtained from crude oil heavier than gasoline and naphtha 

Fuel oil in the United States is classified into six classes according to its boiling temperature composition and purpose The boiling point ranging from 175 to 600 C and carbon chain length 20 to 70 atoms of the fuel increases with number Viscosity also increases with fuel oil number and the heaviest oil has to be heated to get it to flow Price usually decreases as the fuel number increases No 1 fuel oil No 2 fuel oil and No 3 fuel oil are referred to as distillate fuel oils diesel fuel oils light fuel oils gasoil or just distillate For example No 2 fuel oil No 2 distillate and No 2 diesel fuel oil are almost the same thing Diesel is different in that it also has a cetane number limit which describes the ignition quality of the fuel Distillate fuel oils are distilled from crude oil

Andasol 1 will have a generating capacity of 50 megawatts and liquid salt heat storage will allow for electricity to be generated for seven hours after the sun has gone down Annual electricity production will be 179 gigawatt hours which will cover the electricity demands of 50000 households or 200000 people 

Andasol 1 should be completed in mid 2008 and a second plant Andasol 2 is planned 

The Atlantic slave trade was the selling of African slaves by Europeans that happened in and around the Atlantic Ocean It lasted from the 15th century to the 19th century Most slaves were shipped from West Africa and Central Africa and brought over to the New World Some slaves were captured through raids and kidnapping although most were bought through coastal trading by the Europeans Most historians today estimate that between 12 million and 13 million Africans arrived in the new world Earlier estimates cited numbers as high as 25 to 40 million The slave trade is sometimes called the Maafa by African and African American scholars meaning holocaust or great disaster in Kiswahili The slaves were one part of a three part economic cyclethe Triangular Trade and its Middle Passagewhich ultimately involved four continents four centuries and millions of people The Dahomian army were involved and used to trade peopleslave for weapons to protect themselves Christopher Colombus first came to the Americas in 1492 while seeking the West Indies which allowed for the slave trade to begin

The African slave trade was a trade in slaves and like most of the world has carried on for thousands of years in Africa The first main route passed through the Sahara After the Age of Exploration African slaves became part of the Atlantic slave trade from which comes the modern Western type of slavery Despite being against the law slavery continues in all parts of the world including Africa

The Pocking Solar Park is a 10 Megawatt solar photovoltaic plant which is among the largest in the world Construction of the power plant started in August 2005 and was completed in March 2006 On the former military training area in the Lower Bavarian town of Pocking sheep are now grazing under and around the 57912 photovoltaic modules

Fractional distillation is a way to separate a mixture of chemical compounds so that each part of the mixture can be kept apart from the other chemicals Different chemicals have different boiling points so fractional distillation is done by heating the mixture so that each fraction evaporates and then condenses in its own compartment

It is a special type of distillation Generally the component parts boil at less than 25C from each other under a pressure of one atmosphere If the difference in boiling points is greater than 25C a simple distillation is used 

Fractional distillation is how petroleum is refined

The Monte Alto photovoltaic power plant in Spain has a generating capacity of 955 megawatts peak and will generate 14 million kilowatt hours of electricity per year It cost 65 million Euros US87 million 

The plant covers an area of 51 hectares on agricultural land near the locality of Milagro and contains 889 solar structures of which 864 are equipped with automated solar tracking The rest are fixed structures adapted to the terrain 

An odor or odour is a volatilized chemical compound usually at a very low concentration which humans and other animals perceive by the sense of olfaction  

Odors are also called smells which can be used to describe both pleasant and unpleasant odors The words fragrance scent or aroma are used mostly by the food and cosmetic industry to describe a pleasant odor and is sometimes used to refer to perfumes On the other hand the words stench reek and stink are used specifically to describe unpleasant odors

Odor is a sensation caused by molecules dissolved in air The widest range of odors are made up of organic compounds although some inorganic substances such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonia are also odorants The perception of an odor effect is a two step process First there is the physiological part the sense of the stimulus by receptors in the nose After that the psychological part follows The stimuli are processed by the region of the human brain which is responsible for smelling 

Because of this an objective and analytical measure of odor is impossible While odor feelings are very personal perceptions individual reactions are related to gender age state of health and private affectations Common odors that people are used to such as their own body odor are less noticeable to individuals than external or uncommon odors 

For most people the process of smelling gives little information concerning the ingredients of a substance It only offers information related to the emotional impact However experienced people such as flavorists and perfumers can pick out individual chemicals in complex mixes through smell alone

The concentrations of odorant in Germany are defined by the Olfaktometrie since the 1870s In this connection its about the standard method to define the sense barrier of odors on basis the thinner of concentrated odor loaded assays Following parameters are defined odor substance concentration intensity of odor and hedonism assessment

Pheromones are odors that are deliberately used for communication A female moth may release a pheromone that can entice a male moth that is several kilometers away Honeybee queens constantly release pheromones that regulate the activity of the hive Workers can release such smells to call other bees into an appropriate cavity when a swarm moves in or to sound an alarm when the hive is threatened

In Mammals some pathway of Pheromones identification lay in vomeronasal organ and some  in odor receptors

The European Ash is a tree It is a kind of ash It does not occur only in the north of Scandinavia It can be found throughout Europe It is a deciduous tree that grows to a heigh of 2035 metres

Ash wood is very easy to bend It is therefore the material of choice to make Bows Tennis rackets and the long poles used for snooker are sometimes made from it 

In Norse mythology the tree Yggdrasil was a European Ash

Spain is the fourth largest manufacturer in the world of solar power technology and exports 80 percent of this output to Germany Spain is one of the most attractive countries with regard to the development of solar energy as it has the greatest amount of available sunshine of any country in Europe 

The Spanish government wants to produce 12 percent of primary energy from renewable energy by 2010 That would mean a solar generating capacity of 400 megawatts  Through a ministerial ruling in March 2004 the Spanish government removed economic barriers to grid connection of renewable energy The widely applauded Royal Decree 4362004 equalises conditions for large scale thermal and photovoltaic plants and guarantees feed in tariffs

In March 2007 Europes first commercial concentrating solar power tower plant was opened near the sunny southern Spanish city of Seville The 11 megawatt plant known as the PS10 solar power tower produces electricity with 624 large heliostats Each of these mirrors has a surface measuring 120 square meters that concentrates the Suns rays to the top of a 115 meter high tower where a solar receiver and a steam turbine are located The turbine drives a generator producing electricity PS10 is the first of a set of solar electric power generation plants to be constructed in the same area that will total more than 300MW by 2013 This power generation will be accomplished using a variety of technologies 

Solar thermal power plants designed for solar only generation are ideally matched to summer noon peak loads in prosperous areas with significant cooling demands such as Spain Using thermal energy storage systems solar thermal operating periods can even be extended to meet base load needs For example the 50 MWe AndaSol solar trough power plants are designed with six to twelve hours of thermal storage which increases annual availability by some 1000 to 2500 hours

Construction has started on a 20MW solar photovoltaics power system in Trujillo Cceres in Spain Costing 150m the new plant will have double the output of the 10MW Bavaria Solar Park in Germany the previous largest ever photovoltaic system The project will use 200 100kW units gaining the top feed in tariff for this type of plant

BP Solar has begun constructing a new solar photovoltaic solar cell manufacturing plant at its European headquarters in Tres Cantos Madrid For phase one of the Madrid expansion BP Solar is aiming to expand its annual cell capacity from 55 megawatts to around 300 MW Construction of this facility is underway with the first manufacturing line expected to be fully operational this year

The new cell lines use innovative screen printing technology By fully automating wafer handling the manufacturing lines will be able to handle the very thinnest of wafers available and ensure the highest quality  This is of particular importance since there has been a silicon shortage in recent years

Since the beginning of 2007 Aleo Solar AG has also been manufacturing high quality solar modules for the Spanish market at its own factory in Santa Maria de Palautordera near Barcelona

New building code laws in Spain are now mandating solar hot water for new and remodeled private residences and photovoltaic to offset some power requirements for all new and remodeled commercial buildings The new laws also reflect inceased awareness of the importance of better building insulation and the use of daylighting

The Plataforma Solar de Almera in Spain part of the Center for Energy Environment and Technological Research is the largest center for research development and testing of concentrating solar technologies in Europe
