A page turner is a person whose job is to turn sheet music pages for a solo musician often a pianist usually during a performance

While some music is arranged so that the pages end at places where the musician can spare one hand to turn them this is not always possible A page turner is often needed by musicians who are playing difficult pieces and prefer not to play from memory A page turner needs to be able to understand the musicians signals and follow the music to know when to turn the page Page turners are sometimes friends of the performer or members of the accompanying orchestra helping the musician Professional page turners are usually freelance casual workers

Mechanical page turners are also available sometimes controlled by the musician via a foot pedal Charles Halle is said to have invented the automatic page turner

The Crocodylomorphs are an important group of Archosaurs that include the crocodilians and their extinct relatives

During Mesozoic and early Tertiary times the Crocodylomorpha were far more diverse than they are now Triassic forms were small lightly built active terrestrial animals These were supplanted during the early Jurassic by various aquatic and marine forms The later Jurassic Cretaceous and Tertiary saw a wide diversity of terrestrial and semi aquatic lineages Modern crocodilians do not appear until the Upper Cretaceous

The crocodylian lineage were a very diverse group of reptiles Not only are they an ancient group of animals at least as old as the dinosaurs they also evolved into a great variety of forms 

The earliest forms the sphenosuchians evolved during the Upper Triassic and were highly gracile terrestrial forms built like greyhounds During the Jurassic and the Cretaceous marine forms evolved forelimbs that were paddle like and had a tail similar to modern fish 

Dakosaurus andiniensis a species closely related to Metriorhynchus had a skull that was adapted to eat large marine reptiles Several terrestrial species during the Cretaceous evolved herbivory A number of lineages during the Tertiary and Pleistocene became wholly terrestrial predators

The Lepidosauromorphs are a large group of reptiles It includes all diapsids closer to lizards than to archosaurs 

The only living sub group is the Lepidosauria lizards snakes and the tuatara 

The most important fossil group the Sauropterygia includes the plesiosaurs

Backlash was a professional wrestling pay per view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment which took place on May 1 2005 at the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester New Hampshire It was the seventh annual Backlash PPV 

The Lepidosauria are reptiles with overlapping scales They include the tuataras lizards snakes and amphisbaenians

Lepidosauria is a superorder of Sauropsida It includes the orders 

Backlash was a professional wrestling pay per view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment which took place on April 27 2003 at the Worcester Centrum in Worcester Massachusetts It was the fifth annual Backlash PPV The pay per view had a 067 buyrate and sold 10000 tickets

Casineria was a tetrapod which lived 340 million years ago in the Mississippian It was a small animal length about 15 centimeters 

It lived in what was then a fairly dry environment in what is now Scotland It had a mosaic of basal amphibian and derived amniote characters 

Casineria was at or very near the origin of the amniotes The only fossil lacks key elements most of the skull and the whole lower body is missing This makes exact analysis is difficult

With its advanced features Casineria may have been one of the very first true amniotes

Its name Casineria is a latin version of Cheese Bay the site near Edinburgh where it was found

In 1992 an amateur fossil collector spotted the remains of this four legged creature on the shore of Cheese Bay Scotland For the next five years the fossil waited at the National Museums of Scotland in Edinburgh while researchers focused on other projects In 1997 work began to expose the remainder of the fossil from the surrounding matrix of stone 

The work revealed that the animal probably lived in an environment much drier than previously understood The findings were first reported in 1999

Casineria shows features that ties it in with early tetrapods notably a generally gracile build with light leg bones unfused ankles and toes ending in claws This would enable the animal to use their feet actively in traction rather than as holdfasts and indication of a primarily terrestrial lifestyle These traits shows it was closely related to amniotes

With its advanced features Casineria may have been one of the very first true amniotes that is egg layers before the split between Synapsids and Sauropsids Casineria pushes back the origin of amniote lineages much farther than was previously realized

Casineria and its relatives were perhaps the first vertebrates to live and reproduce on land

Protoclepsydrops was an early amniote from about 314 million years ago Its remains were found at the Joggins Fossil Cliffs World Heritage Site The dating of this site has been debated with dates from 320 million years ago to 305 mya being suggestedp39 It is now settled as 31453134 mya  11 million yearsp40

The skeletal remains of Protoclepsydrops suggest it may have been a synapsid If so it is the oldest synapsid known though its status is unconfirmed because its remains were fragmentary Protoclepsydrops lived slightly earlier than Archaeothyris which was definitely a synapsid Like Archaeothyris Protoclepsydrops had a body shape which resembled modern lizards 

Paleothyris was a small agile anapsid reptile which lived in the Pennsylvanian epoch in Nova Scotia 

Paleothyris had sharp teeth and large eyes it was a nocturnal hunter It was about a foot long It probably fed on insects and other smaller animals found on the floor of its forest home 

Paleothyris was an early sauropsid yet it still had some features that were more labyrinthodont like than reptile like Its skull lacked fenestrae holes found in the skulls of most reptiles and mammals 

Amy Brenneman is an American filmtelevision actress perhaps best known for starring in NYPD Blue and Judging Amy She has also starred in a number of theatrical films She was born in Connecticut June 22 1964

Westlothiana lizziae is an early tetrapod It is a transitional fossil with a mixture of amphibian and early amniote characters282 Its body shape bore a superficial resemblance to modern day lizards It lived during the Carboniferous period about 350 million years ago 

The type specimen was discovered in East Kirkton Quarry Bathgate Scotland in 1984 and was named after the West Lothian district where it was found 

This species probably lived near a freshwater lake probably hunting for other small creatures that lived in the same habitat It was a slender animal with rather small legs and a long tail 

Together with Casineria another transitional fossil found in Scotland it is one of the smallest terapods known being a mere 20 cm in adult length 

The small size has made it a key fossil in the search for the earliest amniote as amniote eggs are thought to have evolved in very small animals Advanced features that ties it in with the amniote rather than amphibian group is unfused ankle bones lack of labyrinthodont infolding of the dentine in teeth a lack of an otic notch and a generally small skull

The long body and small legs were a possible adaptation to burrowing similar to that seen in modern skinks

The phylogenetic placement of Westlothiana has varied from basal amniote to an amphibian Lepospondyl The actual phylogenetic position of Westlothiania is uncertain

Magic Kingdom is one of four theme parks at the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando Florida Magic Kingdom was the first park built at the resort and it opened October 1 1971 Designed and built by WED Enterprises the parks layout and attractions are similar to Disneyland in Anaheim California In 2009 the park had around 172 million visitors making it the most visited theme park in the world

The symbol of Magic Kingdom is Cinderella Castle which is based on the castle in the movie Cinderella

The Transportation and Ticket Center also called the TTC is the first place park guests enter after the parking lot At the TTC guests can buy tickets to enter the park After that they can board either a boat or the Monorail which will take them to the park Walt Disney built the resort to have a big lake between the parking lot and the park so guests would have a magical experience watching the park come slowly into view

Magic Kingdom is divided into six areas Most of them are called lands The lands are Adventureland Frontierland Fantasyland and Tomorrowland The other areas are Main Street USA and Liberty Square

Main Sreet USA is the first area guests enter after going through the gates It was built to look like a typical street in the United States The buildings use forced perspective to make the street look longer than it really is and Cinderella Castle look taller That means the buildings closer to the viewer are taller than the buildings farther away

The street is lined with shops and restaurants The windows of the buildings have the names of people who worked for the Walt Disney Company on them

Adventureland is themed around exploring unknown lands like jungles and islands Rides and shows in this area are the Enchanted Tiki Room the Jungle Cruise and Pirates of the Caribbean among others

Frontierland is based on the American west in the 1800s also called the wild west Rides and shows in this area include Big Thunder Mountain Splash Mountain and the Country Bear Jamboree

Liberty Square is based on colonial America around the time of the American Revolution Rides and shows in this area include the Hall of the Presidents and the Haunted Mansion

Fantasyland is based on the magic of fairytales and has rides based on many of Disneys animated films Rides in this area include its a small world Peter Pans Flight and Dumbo

Tomorrowland is based on visions of the future Rides and shows in this area include Space Mountain Stitchs Great Escape and Walt Disneys Carousel of Progress

Archaeothyris was the earliest definite Synapsid It lived in the late Carboniferous period 306 million years ago 

It was found in Nova Scotia at the same locality as Hylonomus and Petrolacosaurus all of which resemble Archaeothyris

Protoclepsydrops is slightly older but its status as a synapsid is unclear as the remains are more fragmentary  

Archaeothyris belonged to a group of early pelycosaurs that evolved early in the Pennsylvanian It is thus seen as the precursor of all synapsids

Unlike Hylonomus and its kin Archaeothyris was relatively large measuring convert50cmin head to tail It was also more advanced than the early sauropsids having strong jaws that could open wider than those of the early reptiles While its sharp teeth were all of the same shape it did possess a pair of enlarged canines suggesting that it was a carnivore

Archaeothyris lived in what is now Nova Scotia about 306 million years ago in the Carboniferous Period 

Nova Scotia at this time was a swamp similar to todays Everglades in Florida The trees were very tall Some such as Lepidodendron were up to convert50mft0abbroff tall Archaeothyris and the other early amniotes lived on the forest floor

Canine teeth are found in mammals They are the eye teeth fangs or dogteeth 

Their main function is to hold food firmly in order to tear it apart

In some mammals they are weapons of attack and defence Examples are wolves and dogs the cat family baboons walrus In man they are much reduced and sit in line with the other teeth

The premolar teeth of mammals are the teeth between the canines and the molars There are a total of eight of them

As the name suggests they are like smaller molars and their function is to crush and grind food

A water park is an amusement park that features water play areas such as water slides splash pads spraygrounds lazy rivers or other recreational bathing swimming and barefooting environments Water parks in more current states of development may also be equipped with some type of artificial surfing or bodyboarding environment such as a wave pool or FlowRider

Water parks have grown in popularity since their introduction in the late 1940s and early 1950s The United States has the largest and most concentrated water park market with over a thousand water parks and dozens of new parks opening each year Major organizations are IAAPA and WWA

Water parks emerging from spas continue to more closely resemble mountain resorts as they become four season destinations for example Splash Universe Water Park Resort a member of the World Water Park Association is themed to match the community in which it is located The theme is intended to enhance the communities destination appeal Therefore the amusement and leisure time industry is becoming more concentrated as winter sports are becoming commonplace themes in summertime water rides A process of concentration can be observed in the hybrid segments of theme amusement and water parks Some water parks are more spa oriented eg Schwaben Quellen a member of European Waterparks Association has no water slides but instead has many saunas steam rooms adventure showers and relaxation oriented water play areasCitation neededdateSeptember 2011

From 2000s popular water parks were disclosed by long wait line problems of attractions To solve this problem some water parks adapt conveyor belt to lift passengers or use water jets

A unique feature at a water park is ice skating Deep River Waterpark in northwestern Indiana features ice skating thanks to cooling pipes that were added under their massive plaza during a recent expansion

The first ever indoor water park was built in Edmonton Alberta Canada in 1985 at the West Edmonton Mall as part of the 12 billion dollar Phase III expansion Called World Waterpark it is over convert217800sqftm2abbron in size It also includes one of the worlds largest indoor wave pool waterslides of varying degrees tube rides bungee jumping and hot tubs

With 5 indoor water parks Wisconsin Dells Wisconsin is recognized as the Water Park Capital of the World It showcases several of Americas largest indoor and outdoor water parks Indoor water parks in Wisconsin Dells debuted in 1994 after the Polynesian Resort Hotel built the first one in the US The success in extending the tourist season and turning water park resorts into vacation destinations has resulted in tremendous industry growth Usually resort hotels featuring massive indoor water parks that are often reserved exclusively for overnight guests companies like Great Wolf ResortsGreat Wolf Lodge and Kalahari Resorts have branched out from their origin in the Dells to open new locations around the country Mt Olympus Theme and Water Park is another huge water park in the Dells

The premier UK indoor water park is the Sandcastle Waterworld at Blackpool England which has the Master Blaster the worlds longest indoor roller coaster style ride

There are many water parks in Southern Europe where the climate suits a long season For example in Portugal on the Algarve there are three main parks  Aqualand Aquashow and Slide and Splash

Water play areas are similar to water parks and include urban beaches splash pads and smaller collections of waterslides in many hotels and public pools For example the Delta Chelsea hotel in Toronto features a four story waterslide called the corkscrew

Another unique waterpark feature is ice skating Deep River Waterpark in Indiana has ice skating thanks to cooling pipes that were added under their plaza

Morganucodon is an early mammalian genus p79 It lived during the latest Upper Triassic or earliest Jurassicp299 

Unlike many other early mammals Morganucodon is known from abundant and well preserved material Most of this comes from Glamorgan in Wales 

According to Kemp it is impossible to say whether the rock fissures where the remains were found are latest Triassic or earliest Jurassicp142

Morganucodon first appeared about 205 million years ago It was a small animal with a skull 2 3 cm in length and a body length of about 10 cm 4 inches In general appearance it would have looked like a shrew or mousep143

Fossils have also been found in the Yunnan Province in China in various parts of Europe and North America and some at least closely related animals are known from exquisite fossils from South Africap2133 174

From their size and teeth they may have been insectivoresp300 The small size suggests some kind of temperature regulation which in turn suggests insulation in the form of fur Nocturnal activity in an animal of this size virtually requires an increased internal production of heatp124

Brain size is another factor It is certain that early mammals did have enlarged brains relative to their size Reconstructions of the brain size has shown this Apparently brain size in Mesozoic mammals lay within the lower range of brain size for living mammals This is an overall increase of four or more times the volume of basal amniote brains Very likely this involved the development of the neocortex one of the most striking of all mammalian charactersp120 

There has been a long controversy about whether or not to classify it as a mammal Some prefer to include it in a broader clade called Mammaliaformes 

Morganucodon is regarded as very basal Its lower jaw has some of the bones found in its synapsid ancestors in a very reduced form Mammals have a jawbone composed solely of the dentary 

Furthermore the primitive jaw joint between the articular and quadrate bones which in modern mammals has moved into the middle ear and become part of the ear ossicles as malleus and incus is still to be found in Morganucodonp107112 

Morganucodon is special because apart from still having the primitive hinge it has also evolved the derived mammalian one and thus features a double jaw joint 

It is for this and its tooth replacement and determinate growth that Morganucodon is now usually considered a true mammalp324346 Earlier synapsids replace their teeth throughout life as sauropsids also do This is known as polyphyodonty while mammals grow only two sets of teeth in diphyodonty

Castle Vale is a housing estate located near Erdington convert9kmmi0abbron northeast of Birmingham city centre in England The area has an approximate population of 10000 people and has a distinctly modern residential character because a lot of new houses were built after World War II It is known as a postwar overspill estate

The area was originally known as Berwood from the Saxon Bearu meaning the woods Historically the area was a boggy and wooded area and development only started when Edward Darcy began cutting down the trees in the 17th century and the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal was built in the 18th century In the 20th century the land became the site for the first aeroplane take off in Birmingham which led to a long aviation history being associated with the area Castle Bromwich Aerodrome was established on the site and operated from 1914 to 1960 being a major airfield in both World Wars and also having industrial importance as the testing facility for locally manufactured airplanes and the location for the British Industries Fair 

Castle Vale became infamous from the 1970s onwards as a large scale example of a failed postwar overspill estate which suffered from poor construction and maintenance social deprivation and high levels of crime The area became the focus of a targeted regeneration initiative led by the Castle Vale Housing Action Trust from 1993 to 2005 where the estate witnessed the demolition of many of its houses and facilities the repair of remaining properties and the construction of new housing and facilities along with the remodelling of the estate funded both privately and publicly It is now hailed as an example of a successful community led regeneration scheme

Tritylodonts were small to medium sized mammal like cynodonts 

They were the last family of the non mammalian synapsids One of the last cynodont lines to appear the family Tritylodontidae descended from a Cynognathus like cynodont 

The Tritylodonts were herbivorous chewing through vegetation such as stems leaves and roots 

They were the longest surviving of all the non mammalian therapsids They appeared in the latest Triassic period and persisted through the Jurassic until the Middle Cretaceous This shows that the Tritylodonts were a successful group of therapsids even though they lived right beneath the ruling dinosaurs feet 

Chronoperates from the Paleocene after the Cretaceous and the KT extinction event may be a Tritylodont If so then the Tritylodonts were elusive and rare during the Upper Cretaceous because no Tritylodonts were found by that time However the Chronoperatess anatomy also closely resembles to that of symmetrodonts a mammalian lineage 

It is very clear that the Tritylodonts were warm blooded The Tritylodont fossils were found in the Americas South Africa and Eurasia They may have managed to live worldwide including Antarctica

August Belmont Sr was born in Alzey Hesse to a Jewish family He emigrated to New York City in 1837 when he became the American representative of the Rothschild familys banking house in Frankfurt  Later he became an American citizen and married Caroline Slidell Perry daughter of Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry

August Belmont was born on December 8 1813 some sources say 1816  to Simon and Frederika Elsass Schnberg His mother died when he was seven and he went live with his uncle and grandmother in Frankfurt He attended the Jewish Junior and Senior High School until he began his first job as an apprentice to the Rothschilds He would sweep floors polish furniture and run errands while studying English arithmetic and writing He was then given a confidential clerkship in 1832 and promoted to private secretary before travelling to Naples Paris and Rome In 1837 Belmont travelled to Havana to manage the Rothschilds Cuban interests On his way to Havana however Belmont stopped in New York He arrived there during the Panic of 1837 and stayed to look afte Rothschilds interests there instead of continuing on to Havana After he emigrated to the United States he changed his surname Schnberg to Belmont

In the Panic of 1837 hundreds of American businesses including the Rothschilds American agents went bankrupt As a result Belmont postponed his departure to Havana and began August Belmont Company believing that he could supplant the recently bankrupt firm the American Agency August Belmont and Company was an instant success and Belmont restored health to the Rothschilds US interests over the next five years In 1844 Belmont was named the Consul General of Austria at New York He resigned in 1850 because he thought Austria was cruel in the way it treated Hungary

Belmont married Caroline Slidell Perry the daughter of Matthew Calbraith Perry on 7 November 1849 Soon John Slidell his wifes uncle starting helping Belmont Belmonts first task was to campaign for James Buchanan in New York In June 1851 Belmont wrote letters to the New York Herald and the New York National Democrat insisting that they do justice to Buchanans presidential run But Franklin Pierce won the nomination instead and Belmont made large contributions to the Democratic Party After his victory Pierce in 1853 appointed Belmont charg daffaires and minister to The Hague While in Holland Belmont urged American annexation of Cuba as a new slave state in what became known as the Ostend Manifesto

Though Belmont lobbied hard for it Buchanan denied him the ambassadorship to Spain after his election in 1856 thanks to the Ostend Manifesto As a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention Belmont supported Stephen A Douglas who subsequently named Belmont chairman of the Democratic National Committee Belmont energetically supported the Union cause during the Civil War as a War Democrat helping Missouri congressman Francis P Blair raise and equip the Union armys first mainly German American regiment Belmont also used his influence with European business and political leaders to support the Union cause in the American civil war stopping the Rothschilds and other bankers from lending to the Confederacy and meeting personally with the British prime minister Lord Palmerston and members of Napoleon IIIs government

Belmont stayed as chairman of the Democratic National Committee after the war but he thought it was the worst ever time for the party As early as 1862 Belmont and Samuel Tilden bought stock in the New York World in order to make it publish stories supporting the Democrats with the help of Manton M Marble its editor in chief

The Republican party was divided at the wars end so Belmont organized new party gatherings and tried to get Salmon Chase elected president in 1868 He thought Chase was least vulnerable to charges of disloyalty to the party during the Republican Lincoln Johnson administrations 

Horatio Seymours became the democratic candidate instead and lost to Ulysses S Grant by a lot of Electoral College votes although the popular vote was much closer In 1872 the Democrats supported liberal Republican Horace Greeleys disastrous presidential campaign The election of 1872 prompted Belmont to resign as chairman of the Democratic National Committee but he stayed interested in politics as a champion of US Senator Thomas F Bayard of Delaware for the presidency and as a fierce critic of the process granting Rutherford B Hayes the presidency in 1877 and as an advocate of hard money

Belmont died in New York in 1890 The Letters Speeches and Addresses of August Belmont was published at New York in 1890 Belmont left an estate valued at more than ten million dollars He is buried in Newport Rhode Island

Belmonts sons were Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont Perry Belmont and August Belmont Jr

August Belmont threw lavish balls and dinner parties receiving from New Yorks high society mixed reviews He was an avid sportsman and the famed Belmont Stakes thoroughbred horse race is named in his honour It debuted at Jerome Park Racetrack owned by Belmonts friend Leonard Jerome Today The Belmont Stakes is part of thoroughbred racings Triple Crown and takes place at Belmont Racetrack in New York

Also named in Belmonts honor is the town of Belmont New Hampshire an honor Mr Belmont never acknowledged Edith Wharton reputedly modeled the character of Julius Beaufort in The Age of Innocence on Belmont

Ham mousseline la Belmont was created in his honour by Charles Ranhofer at Delmonicos

Parmigiana is a Southern Italian dish made with a shallow fried sliced filling with cheese and tomato sauce on top then baked Eggplant parmigiana is the earliest version Other kinds made with breaded meat cutlets such as veal and chicken parmigiana are popular in other countries usually in areas with a lot of Italian immigrants 

The dish is claimed by both Campania and Sicily While parmigiana means from Parma the dish is not part of Parma food It is based on melanzane alla parmigiana or eggplant parmigiana a classic Southern Italian dish 

Along with the many Italian versions different kinds of Parmigiana have been developed across the world most often in countries where large numbers of Italians immigrated Examples of dishes developed outside of Italy from the early parmigianas include veal or chicken breast dipped in beaten eggs breaded shallow fried and topped with a marinara sauce and mozzarella It is then usually baked until the cheese is bubbly and brown The veal dish is known in Italian as Cotolette alla Bolognese

Parmigiana is also used as an adjective in the names of other unrelated dishes from Parma food such as Trippa alla Parmigiana

The dish consists of a sliced filling pan fried in oil layered with tomato sauce and cheese and baked in an oven In some kinds the sliced filling is first dipped in beaten eggs and covered in flour or breadcrumbs before frying Some recipes use hard grated cheeses such as Parmesan or Pecorino Romano while others use softer melting cheeses like Mozzarella or Caciocavallo or a combination of these

In the United States and Canada veal parmigiana or chicken parmigiana is commonly served as a grinder or a submarine sandwich It is also popular with a side of or on top of pasta Diced onions or green bell peppers sauted or raw are sometimes added

Chicken or veal parmigiana has become very popular in Australia as a pub dish often served with chips and salad It may also contain a lot of toppings including sliced ham or fried eggplant slices This dish is often referred to as a parma or parmi a simple shortening of the name 

A similar dish the Parmo which uses either pork or chicken has been made within the country of England 

There are several theories for the origin of the name parmigiana

One common theory says the name is from Parmigiano Reggiano

Another theory says the name is an alteration of the Sicilian word parmiciana This is an ancient Sicilian dish which in all cookbooks is erroneously stated as obtaining its name from Parmesan cheese which is one of the ingredients Nothing could be further from the truth The name parmigiana does not derive from that of the cheese but is the Italianization of the Sicilian dialectal word parmiciana which refers to the slats of wood which compose the central part of a shutter and overlap in the same manner as the slices of eggplant in the dish

As with Parmigiano Reggiano cheese the word Parmigiana is often rendered as Parmesan in English speaking countries from the French word for from Parma

Veal is the meat of young cattle as opposed to beef from older cattle Though veal can be made from a calf of either sex and any breed most veal comes from male calves of dairy cattle breeds Veal has a tender texture

Veal has been an important ingredient in Italian and French cuisine since ancient times The veal is often in the form of cutlets such as the Italian cotoletta or the famous Austrian dish Wiener Schnitzel Some classic French veal dishes include fried escalopes fried veal grenadines stuffed paupiettes roast joints and blanquettes As veal is lower in fat than many meats care must be taken in preparation to ensure that it does not become tough Veal is often coated in preparation for frying or eaten with a sauce Veal Parmigiana is a common Italian American dish consisting of breaded veal cutlets

Veal is a controversial issue in terms of animal welfare

Many animal welfare groups who strongly focus on factory farming try to educate consumers about several veal production procedures that they consider to be inhumane This education has been successful in creating pressure on the industry resulting in recently announced changes in the methods used by the veal industry

A strong animal welfare movement about veal started in the 1980s with the release of photographs of veal calves tied up in crates where they could barely move After people saw these photographs people started buying less veal They have not started buying more again

Many veal farmers listened to the concern of their customers and have started improving conditions in their veal farms

The American Veal Association has announced they plan to stop the use of crates by 2017 which is often the main focus of controversy in veal farming Strauss Brands is the first veal packer in the US to raise veal calves completely tether free and group raised since December 31 2008

Though a lot of people think the crates are bad because the calves cant move much and get sick the Veal Quality Assurance Program Veal Issues Management Program industry fact sheet and the Ontario Veal Association say the crates are important for keeping out diseases and keeping the calves from getting hurt They also state that it lets veal farmers provide more personal attention to veal calves

Other uses for male dairy calves include raising bob veal raising calves as red veal without the harsh food restrictions needed to create pale meat and as dairy beef

When it comes to the centuries old method of free raised veal calves never experience the stress of confinement separation from their mothers and herd mates or an unnatural diet Many veal producers are realizing this and the demand for free raised veal is rapidly increasing

In 2007 less than 5 of veal calves were raised in a group environment In 2009 this had increased to 35

The following shows where veal crates have been banned or are currently in the process of being banned

Veal crates became illegal in the UK in 1990 and a full ban has been placed for the entire European Union as of 2007 Switzerland with its substantial dairy industry continues to use crates

Veal calf production as such is not allowed in many Northern European countries such as in Finland In Finland it is illegal to give an animal food the caretaker knows is bad for it and it is also illegal to not give the animal enough food

Crates are slowly being banned in the United States As stated above several large veal producers are working on getting rid of veal crates as well as the American Veal Association State by state veal crate bans are as follows

Hyssop is a genus of about 10 12 species of herbaceous or semi woody plants in the family Lamiaceae native from the east Mediterranean to central Asia They are aromatic with upright branched stems up to 60 cm long covered with fine hairs at the tips The leaves are narrow ovals 25 cm long The small blue flowers are on the upper part of the branches during summer By far the best known species is the Herb Hyssop widely grown outside its native area in the Mediterranean

Note that anise hyssop Agastache foeniculum is a very different plant and not a close relation although both are in the mint family Anise hyssop is native to much of north central and northern North America

The name hyssop can be traced back almost unchanged through the Greek word and Hebrew word The Book of Exodus in the Bible records that the blood of the sacrifices was applied to the doorposts using hyssop on the night of Passover Its vomit inducing properties are also mentioned in the Book of Psalms In the New Testament a sponge soaked in sour wine or vinegar was stuck on a branch of hyssop and offered to Jesus of Nazareth on the cross just before he died Both Matthew and Mark mention this but refer to the plant using the general term which is translated as reed or stick

The seeds are planted in spring and the seedlings planted out 4050 cm apart Hyssop can also be propagated from cuttings or root division in spring or autumn Hyssop should be grown in full sun on well drained soil and will benefit from occasional clipping It does not live long and the plants need to be replaced every few years It is good for use as a low hedge or border within an herb garden

Hyssop also has uses in the garden It is said to be a good companion plant to cabbage because it will deter the Cabbage White butterfly It has also been found to improve the yield from grapevines if planted along the rows particularly if the terrain is rocky or sandy and the soil is not as easy to work as it might be Hyssop is said to be bad for radishes and they should not be grown nearby Hyssop also attracts bees hoverflies and butterflies and so has a place in the wild garden as well as being useful in controlling pests and encouraging pollination without the use of unnatural methods

Hyssop leaves can be preserved by drying They should be picked on a dry day at the peak of their maturity and the amount of active ingredients is highest They should be dried quickly away from bright sunlight in order to keep their aromatic ingredients and prevent oxidation of other chemicals Good air circulation is required such as an airing cupboard with the door left open or a sunny room aiming for a temperature of 20 32C Hyssop leaves should dry out in about six days any longer and they will begin to discolor and lose their flavor The dried leaves are stored in clean dry airtight containers and will keep for 1218 months

Hyssop is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Cabbage Moth

Hyssop is used as an ingredient in eau de Cologne and the liqueur Chartreuse It is also used to color the alcohol Absinthe along with the Melissa plant and Roman wormwood Hyssop is also used usually in combination with other herbs such as liquorice in herbal remedies especially for lung conditions Hyssop also kills bacteria makes capillaries stronger and reduces inflammation It can help with about 81 different illnesses including cancer bronchitis insomnia edema colds etc When eaten in extract or tea form it gets rid of mucus in the respiratory tract which relieves congestion can regulate blood pressure and can dispel gas It also helps with circulatory problems epilepsy fever gout and weight problems Poultices can be made from fresh hyssop to help heal wounds It should not be used during pregnancy

Hyssop is a sacred plant used in Judaism It appears a lot in the Hebrew Bible as Ezov In Exodus 1222 the Jews in Egypt are instructed to Take a bunch of hyssop dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe Not one of you shall go out the door of his house until morning It is used by the priests in the Temple of Solomon for purification rites of various kinds in Leviticus 144 7 1449 52 196 18 Hyssop is also often used to fill the Catholic ceremonial Aspergillum which the priest dips into a bowl of holy water and sprinkles onto the congregation to bless them However researchers say that the Biblical accounts refer not to the plant currently known as hyssop It might actually be one of a number of different herbs

The Talmud calls the hyssop and considers it to be an herbal remedy for indigestion

Hyssop leaves have a slightly bitter minty flavor and can be added to soups salads or meats but it should be used sparingly as the flavour is very strong

 Heisenbergs Uncertainty Principle is one of the most important results of twentieth century physics It shows that certain pairs of measurements such as where a small thing like an electron is and where it is going cannot be precisely pinned down Albert Einstein thought that such a quantum theory could give us only a partial description of nature He thought that Heisenbergs discovery showed that human knowledge is limited but he also thought that nature is absolute That is he thought that there is no uncertainty in nature and that the uncertainty exists only in our knowledge about it However many other scientists disagree with Einstein Heisenbergs idea is that if something like an electron were shot into a big box with a certain speed and in a certain direction then it would be possible to calculate a fairly accurate idea of what its path would be like in the future However if the box were made smaller then we would have a more certain idea of where it was located and because of that we would have to have a less certain idea of how it was traveling American physicist Brian Greene gives us the image of a moth that flies placidly around in a large closet but who flies frantically back and forth and up and down when placed in a glass jar Another interesting uncertainty phenomenon which makes possible many electronic devices is called quantum tunneling In our everyday life people cannot move through walls However electrons can move beyond solid walls In the animation to the right you can see a faint white puff on the right side of the wall after a big puff hits the wall from the left That dim spot of light represents the photon or other atomic particle that tunnels through the wall

The following diagrams show what happens when we try to measure both location and momentum

The practical result of this mathematical discovery is that when a physicist makes position more clear then momentum becomes less clear and that when the physicist makes momentum more clear then position becomes less clear Heisenberg said that things are indeterminate and other people liked to say that they were uncertain But the mathematics shows that it is the things in the world that are indeterminate or fuzzy and not that it is just that humans are uncertain about what is going on

Here we will show the first equation that gave the basic idea later shown in Heisenbergs Uncertainty Principle

Heisenbergs groundbreaking paper of 1925 does not use and does not even mention matrices Heisenbergs great success was the scheme which was capable in principle of determining uniquely the relevant physical qualities of hydrogen radiation

After Heisenberg wrote his breakthrough paper he gave it to one of teachers to fix up and went on a vacation Max Born was puzzled by the equations and the non commuting equations that even Heisenberg thought were a problem After several days Born realized that these equations were directions for writing out matrices Matrices were new and strange even for mathematicians of that time but how to do math with them was already clearly known He and a few others worked everything out in matrix form before Heisenberg came back from his time off and within a few months the new quantum mechanics in matrix form gave them the basis for another paper

Heisenbergs uncertainty principle was found in the earliest equations of the new quantum physics and the theory was given by using matrix math However the uncertainty principle is a fact about nature and it shows up in other ways of talking about quantum physics such as the equations made by Erwin Schrdinger

There have been two very different ways of looking at what Heisenberg discovered Some people think that things that happen in nature are determinate that is things happen by a definite rule and if we could know everything we need to know we could always say what will happen next Other people think that things that happen in nature are guided only by probability and we can know only how things will behave on the averagebut we know that very precisely

The physicist John Stewart Bell discovered a way to prove that the first way cannot be correct His work is called Bells theorem or Bells Inequality

Anthony Henday was one of the first white men to explore the interior of the Canadian northwest His explorations were for the Hudsons Bay Company who were worried that La Vrendrye and the other western commanders were taking furs from the northwest to their forts

Henday volunteered to undertake an expedition into this territory He came from the Isle of Wight and was a convicted smuggler and joined the HBC in 1750 as a net maker and labourer Henday had gained some experience in inland travel after arriving at York Factory On June 26 1754 he set out with a group of Plains Indians They passed the French Fort Paskoya where he may have met La Corne the western commander at that time

In October of 1754 he and his group came to what is now Alberta from York Factory with a mission to meet the Blackfoot and perhaps trade with them The Blackfoot did not give a clear answer but Henday decided they meant no so he travelled back to York Factory with news that he had explored the area and had met with the Blackfoot Since the answer had been unsure there was no more expeditions to Alberta

This trip and later ones took Henday across much of the prairies of what is now Saskatchewan and Alberta and his journal shows that he brought a lot of trade to York Factory Records show that some of the trade also went to the French at Fort Saint Louis and Fort Paskoya which were on the route to Hudson Bay He left the service of the HBC in 1762 largely because his efforts for the company at least in his estimation had not been properly recognized

Anthony Henday Drive a large ring road in Edmonton is named in his honour

Disneys Hollywood Studios is a theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando Florida United States Its theme is show business based on Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s It was the third park built at the resort It opened on May 1 1989 as Disney MGM Studios

In 2009 the park had around 97 million guests ranking it the fourth most visited amusement park in the United States and seventh most visited in the world

The park symbol is The Sorcerers Hat which is based on the magical hat from Fantasia It replaced the Earful Tower as the parks icon in 2001

The park has six themed areas Unlike the other Walt Disney World parks Disneys Hollywood Studios does not have a defined layout it is more a mass of streets and buildings that blend into each other much like a real movie studio would The park used to have a large Hidden Mickey in the plaza at the end of Hollywood Boulevard which could be seen in aerial photographs of the park and on the parks early guide maps However construction and other changes to the park have gotten rid of much of this image

Hollywood Boulevard is the parks main entrance and is lined with stores selling Disney merchandise Parades such as the Pixar Block Party Bash travel down Hollywood Boulevard on their route through the park and live street entertainment can be found here throughout the day Michael Eisner who had a major part in the parks creation ever since the earliest development demanded the opening land operate on the same principle as Main Street USA in Magic Kingdom but in a style more fitting to the Studios

At the far end of Hollywood Boulevard is the Sorcerers Hat the icon of Disneys Hollywood Studios Behind it inside a replica of Graumans Chinese Theater is The Great Movie Ride a dark ride with scenes from several classic films including Casablanca The Wizard of Oz and Raiders of the Lost Ark

Echo Lake is the parks small oval shaped lagoon which was designed to form one of the ears in the big Hidden Mickey from the parks original layout Around it are many attractions and services some in buildings designed to look like the California Crazy form of architecture from Hollywoods Golden Age

At The American Idol Experience park guests can audition and sing for live audiences and win a special front of the line pass for the popular TV series real tryouts Next door Sounds Dangerous features a 3 D audio presentation starring comedian Drew Carey In between them is the ATAS Hall of Fame Plaza a display of busts of past and present icons of the television era such as Oprah Winfrey and Walt Disney

Echo Lake has three attractions based on characters and movies produced by George Lucas Lucasfilm studio Star Tours The Adventures Continue is an upcoming motion simulator ride set in the Star Wars universe and is a duplicate of the yet to be opened attraction at Disneyland Jedi Training Academy a live action stage show invites children to become padawan learners and receive lightsaber training from a Jedi master Lastly the live action Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular re enacts various scenes from Raiders of the Lost Ark while illustrating how movie stunts are performed

Originally the New York Street backlot set that was part of the parks original Backlot Studio Tour the section was later opened to pedestrian traffic Recently some of it was changed to look like San Francisco and New York The current version of the Studio Backlot Tour features the American Film Institute Showcase a rotating exhibit of movie props and memorabilia and a tram ride through the backlot areas and through Catastrophe Canyon an effects laden movie set Kids can play on giant plants and toys at the Honey I Shrunk the Kids Movie Set Adventure based on the 1989 Disney film Added in 2005 the Lights Motors Action Extreme Stunt Show is a behind the scenes look at how car action sequences are made for films and is based on a similar show at Walt Disney Studios Park

This section of the park was originally the starting point for the tours of the parks active production studios Its entrance is marked by a square studio arch much like a real Hollywood studio lot entrance might be marked The Animation Courtyard is home to a number of attractions based on Disney characters of yesterday today and tomorrow The Magic of Disney Animation is an attraction that shows how to animate a character It also has games and exhibits along with meet and greet areas for Disney and Pixar characters

Mickey Avenue a section inside the Animation Courtyard has two walk through exhibits Walt Disney One Mans Dream is about the life and legacy of Walt Disney It has photos models rare artifacts and a short biographical film narrated by Julie Andrews At Journey into Narnia guests can see props and set pieces from the Chronicles of Narnia movie series as well as meet Prince Caspian from The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian

The Courtyard section also has two live shows Playhouse Disney Live on Stage has puppet characters from Playhouse Disney shows on The Disney Channel including Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Handy Manny and Little Einsteins Across the plaza Voyage of the Little Mermaid uses glow in the dark puppets lasers music projectors human actors and water effects to re create favorite scenes and songs from the animated Little Mermaid film

The parks newest section has many of the original soundstages used when the park still made TV shows Today Pixar Place looks like the Emeryville California campus of Pixar Animation Studios Its only attraction is Toy Story Midway Mania an interactive 3D attraction based on classic carnival midway games each hosted by characters from the Toy Story film series Pixar Place is also the home of Luxo Jr a six foot tall audio animatronic version of Pixars desk lamp mascot The moving character performs periodic shows throughout the day and evening across from Toy Story Midway Mania

Sunset Boulevard was the first expansion to Disneys Hollywood Studios opening in July 1994 The main attraction on Sunset Boulevard is The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror a thrill ride based on the classic television series Located nearby is Rock n Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith an indoor roller coaster in the dark with three inversions that starts moving at a high speed

Sunset Boulevard has two outdoor amphitheaters for live stage shows The covered Theater of the Stars has Beauty and the Beast Live on Stage a stage show with scenes from the film The open air Hollywood Hills Amphitheater is the home of Fantasmic a nighttime show with Mickey Mouse and many other Disney characters in a story filled with fireworks lasers and water effects

Therocephalians are an extinct group of Theriodonts of infraorder or family status 

They lived from the middle Permian into the Triassic 26502450 million years ago so existing for about 20 million years

The therocephalians are named after their large skulls which along with the structure of their teeth suggest that they were successful carnivores 

Like other non mammalian therapsids therocephalians are sometimes described as mammal like reptiles In fact Therocephalia is the group most closely related to the cynodonts which gave rise to the mammals 

This relationship shows in a variety of anatomical features possibly including whiskers and hair There remain many unanswered questions about the phylogeny anatomy and physiology of therocephalians

The fossils of therocephalians are numerous in the Karoo of South Africa but have also been found in Russia China and Antarctica 

Early therocephalian fossils discovered in Middle Permian deposits of South Africa support a Gondwanan origin for the group which seems to have spread quickly throughout the world Although almost every therocephalian lineage ended during the great PermianTriassic extinction event a few representatives of the subgroup survived into the early Triassic and continued to diversify

However the last therocephalians became extinct by the early middle Triassic The reasons are not known

Matrix mechanics is the first way that physicists found to express quantum physics in mathematical form Werner Heisenberg initially developed this form of expression of the laws of physics just as an equation that he could use to predict the intensities of the photons in the various bands of the hydrogen spectrum

 Heisenbergs teacher and colleague Max Born saw that his equation was essentially the plan for creating and multiplying matrices The matrix form of quantum physics is still used since it is useful and convenient for some purposes Other mathematical ways particularly Erwin Schrdingers equation using a wave function are mathematically equivalent but are easier to use for other purposes 

One of the early successes of this theory was announced shortly thereafter and is now called the Heisenbergs Uncertainty Principle

A Proportionality constant is a number that is used to convert a measurement in one system to the equivalent measurement in another system For instance people who are familiar with the traditional system of units used in the United States pounds feet inches etc may need to find out the metric equivalent for these measures in grams and meters To make these calculations they would need some proportionality constants

One way to write a formula showing how to use a proportionality constant is

For instance people may know that they have 100 eggs and want to know how many dozen eggs they have The proportionality constant K is then 1 dozen 12 eggs

100 eggs 1 dozen 12 eggs 8 dozen eggs 4 eggs

The evolution of the eye is an example of a homologous organ present in a wide variety of taxa 

Certain components of the eye such as the visual pigments appear to have a common ancestry that is they evolved once before the animals radiated 

However complex image forming eyes evolved some 50 to 100 times using many of the same proteins and genetic toolkits in their construction

Complex eyes appear to have first evolved within a few million years in the rapid burst of evolution known as the Cambrian explosion There is no evidence of eyes before the Cambrian but a wide range of diversity is evident in the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale

Eyes show a wide range of adaptations to meet the requirements of the organisms which bear them Eyes may vary in their acuity the range of wavelengths they can detect their sensitivity in low light levels their ability to detect motion or resolve objects and whether they can discriminate colours

The first fossils of eyes appeared during the lower Cambrian period about 540 million years ago This period saw a burst of apparently rapid evolution dubbed the Cambrian explosion One biologist holds that the evolution of eyes started an arms race that led to a rapid spate of evolution 

Earlier than this organisms may have had use for light sensitivity but not for fast movement and navigation by vision

It is difficult to estimate the rate of eye evolution Simple modelling supposing small mutations exposed to natural selection shows that a primitive optical sense organ based upon efficient photopigments could evolve into a complex human like eye in about 400000 years

The earliest light sensors were photoreceptor proteins They are eyespots found in protists Eyespots can only distinguish light from dark This is enough for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms They cannot distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from 

Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups The Euglenas eyespot called a stigma is at the front Its red pigment shades a collection of light sensitive crystals Together with the leading flagellum the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light to assist in photosynthesis and to predict day and night the primary function of circadian rhythms 

Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles By detecting the subtle changes in night time illumination organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation

Vision itself relies on a basic biochemistry which is common to all eyes How this biochemical toolkit is used to interpret an organisms environment varies widely Eyes have a wide range of structures and forms all of which have evolved quite late relative to the underlying proteins and molecules

At a cellular level there appear to be two main designs of eyes one possessed by the protostomes the other by the deuterostomes

Charles Rudolph Boysen was a California horticulturist Boysen worked as Anaheim City Parks superintendent from 1921 1950 He created the boysenberry a hybrid between several types of blackberries raspberries and loganberries

Rudolph Boysen experimented with various berry crosses in Napa California in the 1920s In 1923 his hybrid successfully grew and bore fruit However unable to make his new berry a commercial success Boysen abandoned his crop after breaking his back in an accident

Years later after he had moved to Orange County a fellow grower named Walter Knott heard about the berry and tracked down Boysen Walter Knott was able to bring a few dying vines back to life at his farm now known as Knotts Berry Farm in Buena Park California Knott named the fruit after Boysen

Ribulose 15 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase better known as RuBisCOtagrefThe term Rubisco was coined humorously in 1979 by David Eisenberg at a seminar The abbreviation came from the full namegroupnote is an enzyme that catalyzes the first major step of carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle Carbon fixation is a process by which the atoms of atmospheric carbon dioxide are made available to organisms in the form of energy rich molecules such as glucose RuBisCO splits 6 C molecules into two equal parts

RuBisCO is very important in biology and ecology because it catalyzes the primary chemical reaction by which inorganic carbon permanently enters the biosphere

RuBisCO is also the most abundant protein in leaves and the most abundant protein on Earth It accounts for 50 of soluble leaf protein and 30 of soluble leaf protein in plants

Given its important role in the biosphere there are currently efforts to genetically engineer crop plants to contain more efficient RuBisCO

Dik Trom is the main character in a series of five childrens books written in the Dutch language The author CJoh Kieviet wrote the first book in 1891 It was called Uit het leven van Dik Trom The books became extremely popular and they continue to be very popular today more than 100 years after they were written

Dik Trom was a naughty boy who got up to lots of tricks with his friends However he is a very honest boy and he is very kind so the readers like him

Dik Trom lived in the village of Hoofddorp in the Harlemmermeer in the north of Holland This is the village where the author grew up so he was setting the stories in his own village and based a lot of the characters on real people he had known

Diks real name was Dirk This is a common Dutch name Dirk was very fat even as a boy so he soon became known as Dik The word trom means drum so his name really means Fat Drum

Diks parents love him very much but they are no good at disciplining him When he does something naughty his father just says t is toch een bijzonder kind  dat is ie

Dik is always brave he is never a coward His friends want to go and annoy a little old lady but Dik persuades them to go and annoy the village policeman and he has a leading role in that adventure

Another adventure tells how Dik said he could ride a donkey without falling off The donkey belonged to the village merchant and it was a stubborn beast that always tried to throw off its riders Dik managed to stay on by sitting backwards on the donkey and holding on to its tail This is how Dik is usually seen in pictures and there is a statue of him in the village of Hoofddorp which shows him on the donkey

Kieviet found it difficult at first to find a publisher for his book because the main character was naughty Once it had appeared in a second edition with some illustrations it became very popular and Kieviet followed it with four other books about Dik and one about Diks son Eight films have been made about Dik Trom the most recent in 2010

Personal grooming also called titivating and preening is the art of cleaning and grooming parts of the body It is controlled by the brain

Grooming in humans is usually done in the bathroom for the hair Things such as washing and cleaning the hair combing it and taking out the tangles and styling It can also include shaving done by a man to cut his beard short However sometimes the beard can be groomed as well and washed and grown

Animals usually clean their fur feathers or other skin coverings This is also a form of hygiene Taking out other objects such as insects leaves dirt or twigs are all forms of grooming Among animals birds spend a lot of time preening their feathers They do this to remove ectoparasites keep them in good condition and waterproof them Felidae cats are well known for their grooming which they usually do by licking themselves One of the reasons this is done is to remove all the scent on them so that they will not attract any predators Cats groom so much that they often produce hairballs from the fur they accidentally swallow

In human kind mutual grooming is done to become more close to each other Human mutual grooming plays an important role in making friends Mutual grooming has many reasons potentially done by a parent developing trust or for flirtation

Evidence as to Mans Place in Nature is an 1863 book by Thomas Henry Huxley in which he gives evidence for the evolution of man and apes from a common ancestor 

It was the first book devoted to the topic of human evolution and discussed much of the anatomical and other evidence Backed by this evidence the book said that evolution applied as fully to man as to all other life

In the 18th century Linnaeus and others had classified man as a primate but without drawing evolutionary conclusions 

It was Lamarck the first to develop a coherent theory of evolution who discussed human evolution in this context 

Robert Chambers in his anonymous Vestiges also clearly made the point

The book came five years after Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace announced their theory of evolution by means of natural selection and four years after the publication of Darwins Origin of Species In the Origin Darwin had deliberately avoided tackling human evolution except for a sentence Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history Darwins sequel came eight years later with The Descent of Man and Selection in relation to Sex

I  On the natural history of the man like Apes p156 This contains a summary of what was known of the great apes at that time

II On the relations of Man to the lower animals p57112 This chapter and its addendum contained most of the controversial material and is still important today

III On some fossil remains of Man p119159 A neanderthal skull cap and other bones had been found and various remains of early Homo sapiens Huxley compares these remains with existing human races

The sudo command is a program for Unix based operating systems like Ubuntu which allows a user to do restricted functions It is an abbreviation for substitute user do

It is important for having a sudo command as it prevents the normal user from making changes to the computers files directly and breaking the whole computer making it unusable

The sudo command must be used from the command line but it can run together with any other commands and software that use the command line For example to delete a file that require permissions that normal users do not typically have the user can type

Typing the above would show up like this

After that the program would ask for the password When the password is entered correctly the computer would then run the command

Neuroblastoma is a kind of cancer that mostly affects children and infants This kind of cancer mostly affects the Autonomic nervous system The cancer occurs in the form of tumors but the cells of the tumor do not develop fully There are about 650 cases per year in the United States About half the neuroblastoma cases occur in children younger than two years old The tumor can grow from any neural crest element of the sympathetic nervous system or SNS Most of the time it originates in one of the adrenal glands It can also develop in nerve tissues in the neck chest abdomen or pelvis 

Neuroblastoma is one of the few human malignancies known to demonstrate spontaneous regression from an undifferentiated state to a completely benign cellular appearance  The disease can have many different forms There are three risk categories low intermediate and high risk Low risk disease is most common in infants and good outcomes are common with observation only or surgery High risk disease is difficult to treat successfully even with the most intensive multi modal therapies available

It should be noted that Esthesioneuroblastoma also known as olfactory neuroblastoma is believed to arise from the olfactory epithelium and its classification remains controversial It is not a sympathetic nervous system malignancy but a different disease which should not to be confused with neuroblastoma

Steampunk is an style of fiction having to do with a semi fictional world where old machinery from the Victorian 19th century is still being used Technologies that were new or important to the Victorians such as steam power clockwork or electricity are big themes in steampunk

Important influences on steampunk are the Victorian scientific romances the first science fiction novels Authors like Jules Verne and HG Wells are still very popular Modern novels often cross over with Goth and vampire themes

The fictional style has become an active scene where steampunks dress in costume and attend meetings or conventions This costume is a large part of the scene Many steampunks spend lots of time sewing their own outfits or collecting acessories such as hats and goggles The Maker movement involves many people who are both Makers and steampunks They make Contraptions fanciful devices as either art or a pretended function Some of these contraptions are as large as cars buses or even a steam powered mobile house

Sometimes this aspect is expanded to include cultural ideas of the 19th and early 20th century such as small items like clothing and accessories or large objects such as locomotives or machines that havent even been invented yet like airplanes

Sometimes steampunk is used in stories to give a rough gritty feel This is typical of American steampunk stories where many stories are set around the Old West or the American Civil War 

British steampunk is a contrast to this Instead it considers Victorian society as a more polite society and tries to re create a world of politeness etiquette and distinctions between classes

Neither flavour of steampunk cares too much about historical accuracy The purpose is to have fun not to accurately re enact a period of real history

Steampunks are very fond of particular machines and these keep re appearing as themes in fiction or in costume

The word steampunk is made of the root words steam and punk This use of punk has nothing to do with the punk rock music of the mid 1970s

A well known science fiction author William Gibson wrote books in the early 1980s that created the cyberpunk style Later he and the writer Bruce Sterling wrote one of the early steampunk novels The Difference Engine This book was popular and readers looked for a term to describe this new style They chose steampunk from steam and cyberpunk

There are several related styles that have grown from steampunk These usually have names ending in punk The best known is Dieselpunk which is set in the 1930s Like the Steampunk fondness for Victorian steam machines Dieselpunks like the Modernist style of the 1930s with polished aluminium aircraft and petrol or diesel engines

Jersey is a type of fabric which is mainly used for clothing Originally it was made of wool but today other materials such as cotton or synthetic fibers are also used Since the Middle Ages the island of Jersey exported a lot of knitted goods the fabric used became well known under the name 

Brown hair is the second most common hair color It varies from light brown to black People with brown or black hair are known as brunettes Brown hair is common in Indo European and West Eurasian people However people with brown or black hair are found all across the world

Joy Behar is an American actress comedian and writer She co hosts the television program The View on ABC Behar has been in a number of movies and other television programs She currently hosts The Joy Behar Show She was born October 7 1942

A jersey is an item of knitted clothing Its name comes from the island of Jersey where they were made traditionally in wool or cotton with sleeves worn as a sweater or pullover as it does not open at the front unlike a cardigan It is usually close fitting and machine knitted in contrast to a guernsey that is more often hand knit with a thicker yarn The word is usually used interchangeably with sweater and is the name always officially used in the United Kingdom to refer to the item when worn as part of the uniform of military police or other uniformed personnel

Jersey in the Channel Islands was famous for its knitting trade in medieval times and because of that original fame the name jersey is still applied to many forms of knitted fabric round or flat The traditional jersey and traditional guernsey are dyed a navy blue colour using a dye that does not require stripping the wool of its natural oil rendering these sweaters surprisingly water resistant The wool used in guernseys is often passed through oil in order to render it doubly water resistant 

In sport a jersey is a shirt worn by a member of a team often with the wearers name and team number as well Many Cycling jerseys of specific colour or pattern represent certain statuses in cycling such as the maillot jaune of the leader of the Tour de France or the rainbow jersey The World Cycling Union also says a champion must wear the champions jersey in a race not the team jersey Cycling jerseys are usually made of special synthetic material to help sweat away from the skin The main garment of an ice hockey uniform which was traditionally called a sweater is increasingly known as a hockey jersey This garment along with basketball jerseys which are usually sleeveless and baseball jerseys which are usually button up have become fashion accessories 

In some sports such as baseball basketball and American football a players jersey may be retired When a jersey is retired that players jersey is placed usually where the team plays in honour of that players accomplishment The retiring of a jersey at one time included the retiring of the number on the players jersey leaving it unavailable for future players to further honour that player However as jerseys are usually double digit that leaves only 100 possible numbersif the rules of the sport allow it For example in US college basketball only 36 distinct numbers are possible as rules prohibit the use of any digits greater than 5 As such the practice of retiring the number has dwindled and in most cases only the specific jersey is retired and put on display

It was common for Australian and South African year 12 students and year 13 students in New Zealand to receive personalised jerseys during their last year at school These are commonly referred to as a year or leavers jumpers They are based on the design of a sport jersey feature school colours the year the students graduate and a personalised nickname They are usually worn over the normal school uniform

In Australia there has been a recent trend with many students now preferring to get year 12 hoodies jackets or baseball varsity style jackets instead of the traditional jerseys

Network topology is the layout of the connections of a computer network Network topologies may be physical or logical Physical topology means the physical design of a network including the devices location and cable installation Logical topology refers to how data is actually transferred in a network as opposed to its physical design 

The names used  such as ring or star  are only rough descriptions The computers on a home network can be arranged in a circle but it does not necessarily mean that it represents a ring network

There are seven basic topologies 

Which of these is chosen depends on what devices need to be connected how reliable it has to be and the cost associated with cabling

There are also two basic categories of network topologies 

The shape of the cabling layout used to link devices is called the physical topology of the network This refers to how the cables are laid out to connect many computers to one network The physical topology you choose for your network depends on

The mapping of the nodes of a network and the physical connections between them the layout of wiring cables the locations of nodes and the interconnections between the nodes and the cabling or wiring system

The simplest topology is a permanent link between two endpoints Switched point to point topologies are the basic model of conventional telephony The value of a permanent point to point network is the value of guaranteed or nearly so communications between the two endpoints The value of an on demand point to point connection is proportional to the number of potential pairs of subscribers and has been expressed as Metcalfes Law

Ring 

The value of fully meshed networks is proportional to the exponent of the number of subscribers assuming that communicating groups of any two endpoints up to and including all the endpoints is approximated by Reeds Law 

In most practical networks that are based upon the partially connected mesh topology all of the data that is transmitted between nodes in the network takes the shortest path between nodes The network used a longer alternative path in the case of a failure or break in one of the links This requires that the nodes of the network possess some type of logical routing algorithm to determine the correct path to use at any particular time

Also known as a hierarchy network

The type of network topology in which a central root node is connected to one or more other nodes that are one level lower in the hierarchy with a point to point link between each of the second level nodes and the top level central root node while each of the second level nodes that are connected to the top level central root node will also have one or more other nodes that are one level lower in the hierarchy connected to it also with a point to point link the top level central root node being the only node that has no other node above it in the hierarchy Each node in the network having a specific fixed number of nodes connected to it at the next lower level in the hierarchy the number being referred to as the branching factor of the hierarchical treeThis tree has individual peripheral nodes

Logical topology describes the way in which a network transmits information from networkcomputer to another and not the way the network looks or how it is laid out The logical layout also describes the different speeds of the cables being used from one network to another

The logical topology in contrast to the physical is the way that the signals act on the network media or the way that the data passes through the network from one device to the next without regard to the physical interconnection of the devices A networks logical topology is not necessarily the same as its physical topology For example twisted pair Ethernet is a logical bus topology in a physical star topology layout While IBMs Token Ring is a logical ring topology it is physically set up in a star topology

The logical classification of network topologies generally follows the same classifications as those in the physical classifications of network topologies but describes the path that the data takes between nodes being used as opposed to the actual physical connections between nodes

Notes

Except for star based networks the easiest way to add more computers into a network is by daisy chaining or connecting each computer in series to the next If a message is intended for a computer partway down the line each system bounces it along in sequence until it reaches the destination A daisy chained network can take two basic forms linear and ring

The star topology reduces the probability of a network failure by connecting all of the peripheral nodes to a central node When the physical star topology is applied to a logical bus network such as Ethernet this central node rebroadcasts all transmissions received from any peripheral node to all peripheral nodes on the network sometimes including the originating node All peripheral nodes may thus communicate with all others by transmitting to and receiving from the central node only The failure of a transmission line linking any peripheral node to the central node will result in the isolation of that peripheral node from all others but the remaining peripheral nodes will be unaffected However the disadvantage is that the failure of the central node will cause the failure of all of the peripheral nodes also

If the central node is passive the originating node must be able to tolerate the reception of an echo of its own transmission delayed by the two way round trip transmission time plus any delay generated in the central node An active star network has an active central node that usually has the means to prevent echo related problems

A tree topology can be viewed as a collection of star networks arranged in a hierarchy This tree has individual peripheral nodes which are required to transmit to and receive from one other node only and are not required to act as repeaters or regenerators Unlike the star network the functionality of the central node may be distributed

As in the conventional star network individual nodes may thus still be isolated from the network by a single point failure of a transmission path to the node If a link connecting a leaf fails that leaf is isolated if a connection to a non leaf node fails an entire section of the network becomes isolated from the rest

In order to alleviate the amount of network traffic that comes from broadcasting all signals to all nodes more advanced central nodes were developed that are able to keep track of the identities of the nodes that are connected to the network These network switches will learn the layout of the network by listening on each port during normal data transmission examining the data packets and recording the addressidentifier of each connected node and which port its connected to in a lookup table held in memory This lookup table then allows future transmissions to be forwarded to the intended destination only

In a mesh topology there are at least two nodes with two or more paths between them to provide redundant paths to be used in case the link providing one of the paths fails This decentralization is often used to advantage to compensate for the single point failure disadvantage that is present when using a single device as a central node A special kind of mesh limiting the number of hops between two nodes is a hypercube The number of arbitrary forks in mesh networks makes them more difficult to design and implement but their decentralized nature makes them very useful This is similar in some ways to a grid network where a linear or ring topology is used to connect systems in multiple directions A multi dimensional ring has a toroidal topology for instance

A fully connected network complete topology or full mesh topology is a network topology in which there is a direct link between all pairs of nodes In a fully connected network with n nodes there are n2 direct links Networks designed with this topology are usually very expensive to set up but provide a high degree of reliability due to the multiple paths for data that are provided by the large number of redundant links between nodes This topology is mostly seen in military applications However it can also be seen in the file sharing protocol BitTorrent in which users connect to other users in the swarm by allowing each user sharing the file to connect to other users also involved Often in actual usage of BitTorrent any given individual node is rarely connected to every single other node as in a true fully connected network but the protocol does allow for the possibility for any one node to connect to any other node when sharing files

Hybrid networks use a combination of any two or more topologies in such a way that the resulting network does not exhibit one of the standard topologies For example a tree network connected to a tree network is still a tree network but two star networks connected together exhibit a hybrid network topology A hybrid topology is always produced when two different basic network topologies are connected Two common examples for Hybrid network are star ring network and star bus network

Prostatitis is any form of inflammation of the prostate gland Because women do not have a prostate gland it is a condition only found in men although women do have microscopic paraurethral Skenes glands connected to the distal third of the urethra in the prevaginal space that are homologous to the prostate and may cause symptoms

A prostatitis diagnosis is assigned at 8 of all urologist and 1 of all primary care physician visits in the USA

The term prostatitis refers in its strictest sense to histological inflammation of the tissue of the prostate gland although historically the term has loosely been used as a rubric to describe a set of quite different conditions To try to remedy this the NIH devised a new classification system in 1999

According to the 1999 National Institute of Health Classification there are four categories of prostatitis

Men with this disease often have chills fever pain in the lower back and genital area urinary frequency and urgency often at night burning or painful urination body aches and a demonstrable infection of the urinary tract as evidenced by white blood cells and bacteria in the urine There may be discharge from the penis

Acute prostatitis is relatively easy to diagnose due to its symptoms that suggest infection Common bacteria are E Coli Klebsiella Proteus Pseudomonas Enterobacter Enterococcus Serratia and Staphylococcus aureus This can be a medical emergency in some patients and hospitalization with intravenous antibiotics may be required A full blood count reveals increased white blood cells Sepsis from prostatitis is very rare but may occur in immunocompromised patients high fever and malaise generally prompt blood cultures which are often positive in sepsis

Antibiotics are the first line of treatment in acute prostatitis Antibiotics usually resolve acute prostatitis infections in a very short period of time Appropriate antibiotics should be used based on the microbe causing the infection Some antibiotics have very poor penetration of the prostatic capsule others such as Ciprofloxacin Co trimoxazole and tetracyclines penetrate well Severely ill patients may need hospitalization while nontoxic patients can be treated at home with bed rest analgesics stool softeners and hydration

Full recovery without sequelae is usual

Chronic bacterial prostatitis is a relatively rare condition that usually presents with an intermittent UTI type picture and that is defined as recurrent urinary tract infections in men originating from a chronic infection in the prostate Dr Weidner Professor of Medicine Department of Urology University of Giessen has stated In studies of 656 men we seldom found chronic bacterial prostatitis It is truly a rare disease Most of those were E coli Symptoms may be completely absent until there is also bladder infection and the most troublesome problem is usually recurrent cystitis

In chronic bacterial prostatitis there are bacteria in the prostate but usually no symptoms The prostate infection is diagnosed by culturing urine as well as prostate fluid which are obtained by the doctor doing a rectal exam and putting pressure on the prostate If no fluid is recovered after this prostatic massage a post massage urine should also contain any prostatic bacteria Prostate specific antigen levels may be elevated although there is no malignancy 

Treatment requires prolonged courses of antibiotics that penetrate the prostate well These include quinolones sulfas and macrolides Persistent infections may be helped in 80 of patients by the use of alpha blockers or long term low dose antibiotic therapy Recurrent infections may be caused by inefficient urination prostatic stones or a structural abnormality that acts as a reservoir for infection

The addition of prostate massage to courses of antibiotics was previously proposed as being beneficial It is though not without some risk and has not been shown in more recent trials to improve outcome compared to antibiotics alone

Over time the relapse rate is high exceeding 50

In chronic prostatitischronic pelvic pain syndrome there is pelvic pain of unknown cause lasting longer than 6 months as the key symptom Symptoms may wax and wane Pain can range from mild discomfort to debilitating Pain may radiate to back and rectum making sitting difficult Dysuria arthralgia myalgia unexplained fatigue abdominal pain constant burning pain in the penis and frequency may all be present Frequent urination and increased urgency may suggest interstitial cystitis Ejaculation may be painful as the prostate contracts during emission of semen although nerve and muscle mediated post ejaculatory pain is more common and a classic sign of CPCPPS Some patients report low libido sexual dysfunction and erectile difficulties Pain after ejaculation is a very specific complaint that distinguishes CPCPPS from men with BPH or normal men

Theories behind the disease include autoimmunity for which there is scant evidence neurogenic inflammation and myofascial pain syndrome In the latter two categories dysregulation of the local nervous system due to past traumatic experiences or an anxious disposition and chronic albeit unconscious pelvic tensing lead to inflammation that is mediated by substances released by nerve cells The prostate can become inflamed by the action of the chronically activated pelvic nerves on the mast cells at the end of the nerve pathways Similar stress induced genitourinary inflammation has been shown experimentally in other mammals 

Prostatitis researcher Dr Anthony Schaeffer commented in a 2003 editorial of The Journal of Urology that It is well recognized that even if pathogenic bacteria are present in the prostate as in men with established chronic bacterial prostatitis they do not cause chronic pelvic pain unless acute urinary tract infection develops Taken together these data suggest that bacteria do not have a significant role in the development of the chronic pelvic pain syndrome The clinical observation that antimicrobial therapy reduces symptomatology in men with chronic pelvic pain syndrome is being tested in a double blinded NIH controlled study Since antimicrobials may have anti inflammatory activity it is possible that these drugs may benefit the patient by reducing inflammation rather than eradicating bacteria

A year after making that statement Dr Schaeffer and his colleagues published studies showing that antibiotics are essentially useless for CPCPPS 

The bacterial infection theory that for so long had held sway in this field was again shown to be unimportant in another 2003 study from the University of Washington team led by Dr Lee and Professor Richard Berger The study found that one third of both normal men and patients had equal counts of similar bacteria colonizing their prostates 

Since the publication of these studies the focus has shifted from infection to neuromuscular and psychological etiologies for chronic prostatitis

There are no definitive diagnostic tests for CPCPPS This is a poorly understood disorder even though it accounts for 90 95 of prostatitis diagnoses It is found in men of any age with the peak onset in the early 30s CPCPPS may be inflammatory or non inflammatory In the inflammatory form urine semen and other fluids from the prostate contain pus cells whereas in the non inflammatory form no pus cells are present Recent studies have questioned the distinction between categories IIIa and IIIb since both categories show evidence of inflammation if pus cells are ignored and other more subtle signs of inflammation like cytokines are measured In 2006 Chinese researchers found that men with categories IIIa and IIIb both had significantly and similarly raised levels of anti inflammatory cytokine TGF1 and pro inflammatory cytokine IFN in their expressed prostatic secretions when compared with controls therefore measurement of these cytokines could be used to diagnose category III prostatitis

Normal men have slightly more bacteria in their semen than men with chronic prostatitispelvic myoneuropathy The traditional Stamey 4 glass test is invalid for diagnosis of this disorder and inflammation cannot be localized to any particular area of the lower GU tract 

Men with CPCPPS are more likely than the general population to suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Irritable Bowel Syndrome Prostate specific antigen levels may be elevated although there is no malignancy 

Experimental tests that could be useful in the future include tests to measure semen and prostate fluid cytokine levels Various studies have shown increases in markers for inflammation such as elevated levels of cytokines myeloperoxidase and chemokines

For chronic nonbacterial prostatitis also known as pelvic myoneuropathy or CPCPPS which makes up the majority of men diagnosed with prostatitis a treatment called the Stanford Protocol developed by Stanford University Professor of Urology Rodney Anderson and psychologist David Wise in 1996 has recently been published This is a combination of medication psychological therapy and physical therapy  While these studies are encouraging definitive proof of efficacy would require a randomized sham controlled blinded study which is not as easy to do with physical therapy as with drug therapy

Cat III prostatitis may have no initial trigger other than anxiety often with an element of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder or other anxiety spectrum problem This is theorized to leave the pelvic area in a sensitized condition resulting in a loop of muscle tension and heightened neurological feedback Current protocols largely focus on stretches to release overtensed muscles in the pelvic or anal area physical therapy to the area and progressive relaxation therapy to reduce causative stress Biofeedback physical therapy to relearn how to control pelvic floor muscles may be useful

Aerobic exercise can help those sufferers who are not also suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or whose symptoms are not exacerbated by exercise

Anecdotal evidence suggests that food allergies and intolerances may have a role in exacerbating CPCPPS perhaps through mast cell mediated mechanisms Specifically patients with gluten intolerance or celiac disease report severe symptom flares after sustained gluten ingestion Patients may therefore find an exclusion diet helpful in lessening symptoms by identifying problem foods Studies are lacking in this area

There is a substantial list of medications used to treat this disorder

Alpha blockers are moderately helpful for many men with CPPS duration of therapy needs to be at least 3 months

Quercetin has shown effective in a randomized placebo controlled trial in chronic prostatitis using 500 mg twice a day for 4 weeks Subsequent studies showed that quercetin a mast cell inhibitor reduces inflammation and oxidative stress in the prostate 

Pollen extract has also been shown effective in randomized placebo controlled trials

Commonly used therapies that have not been properly evaluated in clinical trials are dietary modification gabapentin and amitriptyline Therapies shown to be ineffective by randomized placebosham controlled trials levaquin alpha blockers for 6 weeks or less transurethral needle ablation of the prostate

At least one study suggests that multi modal therapy is better long term than monotherapy

In recent years the prognosis for CPCPPS has improved greatly with the advent of multimodal treatment phytotherapy and protocols aimed at quieting the pelvic nerves through myofascial trigger point release and anxiety control

These patients have no history of genitourinary pain complaints but leukocytosis or bacteria have been noted during evaluation for other conditions

Diagnosis is through tests of semen EPS or urine that reveal inflammation in the absence of symptoms

No treatment required It is standard practice for men with infertility and category IV prostatitis to be given a trial of antibiotics andor anti inflammatories however evidence for efficacy are weak Since signs of asymptomatic prostatic inflammation may sometimes be associated with prostate cancer this can be addressed by tests that assess the ratio of free to total PSA The results of these tests were significantly different in prostate cancer and category IV prostatitis in one study

The Descent of Man and selection in relation to sex is a book by Charles Darwin first published in 1871 

It was Darwins second great book on evolutionary theory the first being his 1859 work On the Origin of Species

Darwin had said almost nothing about human beings in the Origin except a single sentence

Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history 

In The Descent of Man Darwin applies evolutionary theory to human evolution and also explains his theory of sexual selection He thought the two topics were closely connected 

In the nearly 12 years between the Origin and the Descent of Man several writers had written works on the subject Noteworthy were

Both were published in 1863

The starting point for sexual selection is the observation that males differ from females not just in sexual apparatus but in many other traits This is true of many animals and the question is why this happens The answer given by Darwin and followed by many other biologists is that the selection on males is different from the selection on females

Sexual selection is the theory proposed by Charles Darwin that states that certain evolutionary traits can be explained by intraspecific competition 

Darwin defined sexual selection as the effects of the struggle between the individuals of one sex generally the males for the possession of the other sex

Biologists today distinguish between male to male combat or intrasexual selection mate choice or intersexual selection and sexual conflict 

Secondary sex characteristics are features that distinguish the two sexes of a species but are not directly part of the reproductive system They are believed to be the product of sexual selection for traits which give an individual an advantage over its rivals in courtship and fighting

Traits selected by male combat are called weapons and traits selected by mate choice are called ornaments

Sexual conflict is a term in evolutionary biology It occurs in a species when what benefits the females is different from what benefits the males 

The word benefit here means what benefits the reproduction of the females genes It is expressed as a difference in biological fitness

The conflict can lead to an evolutionary arms race between males and females It has primarily been studied in animals though it can in principle apply to any sexually reproducing organism such as plants and fungi

In sexual reproduction there is from the point of view of evolution a fundamental difference of interest between males and females This difference of interest plays out differently in different species

Their interest is to mate with a large number of completely faithful females thus spreading their genes widely in the population

Their interest is to mate with a large number of fit males thus producing a large number of fit and varied offspring

A hormone called sex peptide causes the female to become uninterested in mating also males have components in their sperm which kill old sperm from previous males92

The genes that affect hip size must reach a compromise that is at neither the male optimum nor the female optimum In some cases the loci involved are expressed differently in males and females Evidence indicates that intralocus conflict is important in the evolution of many traits

For example male bean weevils have spiny genitalia These allow them to copulate for a longer time without getting dislodged and so transfer more sperm However this damages the female and reduces her fitness Females have evolved the counteradaptation of kicking at males during mating which reduces the time spent in copulation

Some regard sexual conflict as a subset of sexual selection while others suggest it is a separate evolutionary phenomenon

Evolution The Modern Synthesis is the title of a book by Julian Huxley which was published in 1942 It was the book which gave the modern evolutionary synthesis its name and was one of the most important books on biology in the mid twentieth century

Huxley was one of the main architects of the new evolutionary synthesis which took place around the time of World War II 

Huxleys first trial run was the treatment of evolution in the Science of Life and in 1936 he published a long and significant paper for the British Association In 1938 came three lengthy reviews on major evolutionary topics 

Two of these papers were on the subject of sexual selection an idea of Darwins whose standing has been revived in recent times Huxley thought that sexual selection was merely an aspect of natural selection This rather grudging acceptance of sexual selection was influenced by his studies on the courtship of the Great Crested Grebe the courtship takes place mostly after mate selection not before

Now it was time for Huxley to tackle the subject of evolution at full length in what became the defining work of his life 

His role was that of a synthesiser and it helped that he had met many of the other participants His book Evolution The Modern Synthesis was written whilst he was Secretary to the Zoological Society and made use of his remarkable collection of reprints covering the first part of the century It was published in 1942 

Reviews of the book in learned journals were little short of ecstatic the American Naturalist called it The outstanding evolutionary treatise of the decade perhaps of the century The approach is thoroughly scientific the command of basic information amazing

Huxleys main co respondents in the modern evolutionary synthesis are usually listed as Ernst Mayr Theodosius Dobzhansky George Gaylord Simpson Bernhard Rensch Ledyard Stebbins and the population geneticists JBS Haldane Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright However at the time of Huxleys book several of these had yet to make their distinctive contribution Certainly for Huxley EB Ford and his co workers in ecological genetics were at least as important

It was Huxley who coined the terms the new synthesis and evolutionary synthesis he also invented the term cline in 1938 to describe species whose members fall into a series of sub species with continuous change in characters over a geographical area The classic example of a cline is the circle of subspecies of the gull Larus round the Arctic zone This cline is an example of a ring speciesSome of Huxleys last contributions to the evolutionary synthesis were on the subject of ecological genetics He noted how surprisingly widespread polymorphism is in nature with visible morphism much more prevalent in some groups than others The immense diversity of colour and pattern in small bivalve molluscs brittlestars sea anemones tubicular polychaetes and various grasshoppers is perhaps maintained by making recognition by predators more difficult

Yttrium oxide is Y2O3 It is an air stable white solid substance Yttrium oxide is used as a common starting material for both materials science as well as inorganic compounds

It is the most important yttrium compound and is widely used to make YVO4 europium and Y2O3 europium phosphors that give the red color in color TV picture tubes Yttrium oxide is also used to make yttrium iron garnets which are very effective microwave filters

Y2O3 is used to make the high temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 known as 1 2 3 to indicate the ratio of the metal constituents

This synthesis is typically conducted at 800 C

The thermal conductivity of yttrium oxide is 27 W

Yttrium oxide is an important starting point for inorganic compounds For organometallic chemistry it is converted to YCl3 in a reaction with concentrated hydrochloric acid and ammonium chloride

Y2O3 ceramics is a prospective solid state laser material In particular lasers with ytterbium as dopant allow the efficient operation both in cw operation and in pulsed regimes At high concentration of excitations and poor cooling the quenching of emission at laser frequency and avalanche broadband emission takes place

Duchess Louise of Mecklenburg Strelitz was Queen consort of Prussia as the wife of King Frederick William III 

After her husbands ascension Louise developed many ties to senior ministers and became a powerful figure within the government as she began to command universal respect and affection The queen always tried to stay informed of political developments at court and from the very beginning of his reign the new king consulted Louise on matters of state 

Though Prussia had not fought in a war since 1795 its military leaders were confident that they could win against Napoleons troops After a small incident concerning an anti French pamphlet occurred King Frederick William was finally pressured by his wife and family to break off his uneasy peace and enter the war against the French emperor Prussian troops began mobilizing culminating in the October 1806 Battle of Jena Auerstedt which was a disaster for Prussia as the ability of its armed forces to continue the war were effectively wiped out The king and queen had accompanied their troops into battle at Jena but had to flee from French troops

Napoleon himself occupied Berlin and the king queen and the rest of the royal family had to flee despite Louises illness in the dead of winter to Knigsberg in the easternmost part of the kingdom On the journey there there was no food or clean water and the king and queen were forced to share the same sleeping arrangements in one of the wretched barns they call houses according to one witness traveling with them

Napoleon demanded from a highly superior position peace terms in what was to be called the Peace of Tilsit In the midst of these negotiations the emperor agreed to keep half of Prussia intact Louise reluctantly agreed to meet the emperor at Tilsit but only to save her Prussia She tried to use her beauty and charm to flatter him into more favorable terms Before she had called him the Monster but now she made a request for a private interview with the emperor She threw herself at his feet Napoleon was impressed by her grace and determination but he refused to make any concessions Queen Louises efforts to protect her adopted country from French aggression became well admired by future generations

On 19 July 1810 the Queen died in her husbands arms from an unidentified illness The queens subjects attributed the French occupation as the cause of her early death Louises death left her husband alone during a period of great difficulty as the Napoleonic Wars and need for reform continued Napoleon remarked the king has lost his best minister

Stratigraphy is a branch of geology which studies rock formations It is primarily used in the study of sedimentary and layered igneous rocks

The subject was established by Nicolaus Steno whose book De solido contained the law of superposition the principle of original horizontality and the principle of lateral continuity in layers of sediment

The first practical large scale application of stratigraphy was by William Smith in the 1790s and early 19th century Smith known as the Father of English Geology created the first geological map of England He first recognized the significance of strata or rock layering and the importance of fossil markers for correlating strata 

Lithostratigraphy deals with the physical rock type and how it changes from place to place Changes in the rock reflect changing environments of deposition One of stratigraphys basic concepts is codified in the law of superposition which simply states that in an undeformed stratigraphic sequence the oldest strata occur at the base of the sequence

Biostratigraphy is based on fossil evidence in the rock layers Strata from widespread locations containing the same fossil fauna and flora are laid down at the same time 

Biostratigraphy was based on William Smiths principle of faunal succession which was one of the first and most powerful lines of evidence for evolution It gives evidence of the formation and extinction of species 

The geological timescale was developed during the 19th century based on the evidence of biostratigraphy and faunal succession This timescale remained a relative scale until the development of radiometric dating which gave it an absolute time framework

Nicolas Steno who lived 1 January 1638 25 November 1686 was a Danish Catholic cleric and scientist who pioneered in both anatomy and geology

In 1659 he decided not to accept anything written in a book and decided to do research himself He is considered the father of geology and stratigraphy4 96

Steno argued that the chemical composition of fossils could be altered without changing their form

Stenos work on shark teeth led him to the question of how any solid object could come to be found inside another solid object such as a rock or a layer of rock 

The solids within solids that attracted Stenos interest included not only fossils as we would define them today but minerals crystals even entire rock layers or strata 

He published his geologic studies in 1669 De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus or Preliminary discourse to a dissertation on a solid body naturally contained within a solid 

Steno was not the first to identify fossils as being from living organisms His contemporaries Robert Hooke and John Ray also argued that fossils were the remains of once living organisms

Statutory boards and offices are listed below the Department to which they report

Before modern times the government of the Isle of Man was in the hands of the Governor who representated the Lord of Man assisted by his Council consisting of the other permanent officials The Council became the Legislative Council the upper chamber of Tynwald the parliament of the Isle of Man

After the Revestment in 1765 the Lieutenant Governor and his officials were the agents of the British Government and not democratically responsible to the Manx people Conflict between the House of Keys and the Lieutenant Governor came to a head when Lord Raglan was Lieutenant Governor between 1902 and 1918

After World War I the Lieutenant Governor gradually gave up control to Tynwald a process guided by the reports of commissions and other bodies in 1911 1959 and 1969 An Executive Council chaired by him and including members of Tynwald was established in 1949 and gradually thereafter became the effective government of the Island Finance and the police came under local control between 1958 and 1976 The Lieutenant Governor stopped chairing the Executive Council in 1980 and was replaced by a chairman elected by Tynwald and the Council was reconstituted in 1985 to include the chairmen of the eight principal Boards in 1986 they were given the title Minister and the chairman was styled Chief Minister In 1990 the Council was renamed the Council of Ministers

During the 19th century several bodies which came to be known as Boards of Tynwald were created to exercise functions under democratic control These included the Board of Education Highway Board Asylums Board Government Property Trustees and Local Government Board However although direct taxation was levied by Tynwald the Boards freedom of action before the 1960s was limited by the Lieutenant Governors control of the Islands budget and his power to appoint certain of their members

The structure of the Boards of Tynwald along with other bodies variously called Statutory Boards and Commercial Boards became increasingly unwieldy after the 1950s and was eventually reformed in the 1980s when a system of ministerial government was set up

Until 1 April 2010 the Departments were as follows Created in 1985 87 they were the successors of the former Boards of Tynwald

The structure and functions of the Departments were re organised with effect from 1 April 2010 The existing Departments except the Treasury and the Departments of Education and Home Affairs were dissolved and the Department of Education was renamed the Department of Education and Children The Departments and their functions are now as follows

As noted above a number of Statutory Boards and Commercial Boards were created at various times Some were taken over by the Departments in 1985 1987 but others continued as separate Statutory Boards after 1987

Member of the House of Keys or MHK is the title given to a person who has been elected into the House of Keys the lower house of Tynwald the parliament of the Isle of Man The are twenty four Members of the House of Keys Elections are held every five years the last election took place in November 2006 The leader of the House is the Speaker of the House of Keys currently The Hon Stephen Charles Rodan SHK

The House of Keys is situated in Douglas the capital of the Isle of Man The Old House of Keys their former chamber is located in Castletown the former capital it is now a museum

Evolutionary developmental biology interprets development in the light of evolution It is called for short evo devo

In On the Origin of Species Charles Darwin proposed evolution through natural selection a theory central to modern biology Darwin recognised the importance of embryonic development in the understanding of evolution 

Ernst Haeckel proposed that ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny that is the development of the embryo of every species repeats the evolutionary development of that species Haeckels concept explained for example why humans and indeed all vertebrates have gill slits and tails early in embryonic development His theory has since been largely discredited 

A renewed interest in the evolution of development came after the modern evolutionary synthesis The conventional view had been that evo devo had little influence on the evolutionary synthesis but the following suggests otherwise

In Embryos and evolution Gavin de Beer stressed the importance of heterochrony and especially paedomorphosis in evolution 

According to his theories paedomorphosis is important in evolution because juvenile tissues are relatively undifferentiated and capable of further evolution whereas highly specialised tissues are less able to change 

He also conceived the idea of clandestine evolution which helped to explain the sudden changes in the fossil record which were apparently at odds with Darwins gradualist theory of evolution 

If a novelty were to evolve gradually in an animals juvenile form then its development would not appear in the fossil record at all but if the species were then to undergo neoteny in which sexual maturity is reached while in a juvenile form then the feature would appear suddenly in the fossil record despite having evolved gradually 

Stephen Jay Gould called this approach to explaining evolution as terminal addition as if every evolutionary advance was added as new stage by reducing the duration of the older stages The idea was based on observations of neoteny This was extended by the more general idea of heterochrony as a mechanism for evolutionary change

Modern interest in evo devo springs from clear proof that development is closely controlled by special genetic systems involving hox genes 

In a series of experiments with the fruit fly Drosophila Edward B Lewis was able to identify a complex of genes whose proteins bind to the regulatory regions of target genes The latter then activate or repress systems of cellular processes that accomplish the final development of the organism 

Furthermore the sequence of these control genes show co linearity the order of the loci in the chromosome parallels the order in which the loci are expressed along the anterior posterior axis of the body Not only that but this cluster of master control genes programs the development of all higher organisms 

Each of the genes contains a homeobox a remarkably conserved DNA sequence which is similar in many widely different animals This suggests the complex itself arose by gene duplication In his Nobel lecture Lewis said Ultimately comparisons of the control complexes throughout the animal kingdom should provide a picture of how the organisms as well as the control genes have evolved

In 2000 a special section of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences was devoted to evo devo and an entire 2005 issue of the Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B Molecular and Developmental Evolution was devoted to the key evo devo topics of evolutionary innovation and morphological novelty

James Anthony Tony Brown is a Manx politician He is the current Chief Minister of the Isle of Man and Member of the House of Keys for Castletown 

Tony Brown was educated at Castle Rushen and was an electrician He owned Tony Brown Electrics in Castletown until its closure in 2010 He was elected as a member of Castletown Commissioners in 1976 becoming Chairman in 1980 before being elected as the Castletown MHK in 1981 at his first attempt In 2000 he was defeated in his attempt to become Speaker of the House of Keys by David Cannan but instead became the Deputy Speaker Following the 2001 General Election he was elected Speaker and in January 2002 Deputy President of Tynwald

He was reelected in November 2006 as MHK beating Roy Redmayne by 915 votes to 335 There was a great deal of rumour that he might run for Chief Minister but when nominations were put forward his name was not in the list There was a round of voting with neither Steve Rodan John Shimmin nor David Cannan being elected Nominations then reopened with Tony Brown being the only candidate put forward His nomination was confirmed by Tynwald on Thursday 14 December 2006 receiving 27 votes and the Lieutenant Governor appointed him Chief Minister later in the day He then resigned the Speakership of the House of Keys as required by law

The Chief Minister is the executive head of the Isle of Man Government He is the Prime Minister of the island

The office comes from that of Chairman of the Executive Council Before 1980 the Executive Council was chaired by the Lieutenant Governor but afterwards the chairman was elected by Tynwald the parliament of the Isle of Man The title was changed to Chief Minister in 1986

The Chief Minister is appointed by the Lieutenant Governor on the nomination of Tynwald after a general election of the House of Keys He holds office until the next general election and is eligible for re appointment but may be removed from office by Tynwald on a vote of no confidence in the Council of Ministers

After the general election in November 2006 Mr John Shimmin MHK Mr Stephen Rodan MHK and Mr David Cannan MHK tried to become Chief Minister but none got enough votes in Tynwald On a second vote Mr Tony Brown was nominated unopposed

The Lieutenant Governor is the representative on the Isle of Man of the Lord of Mann currently Queen Elizabeth II Heshe has the power to grant Royal Assent and is styled His Excellency In recent times the Governor has either been a retired diplomat or senior military officer No Manx born person has ever been appointed Lieutenant Governor although Manx born First Deemsters have taken on the role Governors terms of office and when the Lieutenant Governor is off the Island

The official residence of the Governor is Government House Governors Road Onchan

The Lieutenant Governor had all judicial fiscal and executive power and in about 1900 had more power over the island than any other Commonwealth leader had in their colony or dominion However he lost his role as Head of the Judiciary and as Head of Government in 1961 as President of Legislative Council in 1980 and finally as President of Tynwald in 1990 Today the role of Lieutenant Governor is ceremonial although certain powers under Isle of Man legislation do still fall to the Governor or Governor in Council

In October 2005 Tynwald wanted to change the title of the Lieutenant Governor to Crown Commissioner This proposal was sent to the British Department of Constitutional Affairs for submission to the Lord of Mann Elizabeth II for approval However in April 2006 after much public disapproval Tynwald rejected their own proposal and withdrew their request for Royal Assent Thus the Lieutenant Governor will remain as currently titled

A deemster is a judge in the Isle of Man The High Court of Justice of the Isle of Man is presided over by a deemster or in the case of the appeal division of that court a deemster and the Judge of Appeal The deemsters also make the Isle of Mans laws official by reading them out to the people in English and Manx on Tynwald Day

The First and Second Deemsters used to have seats in the Legislative Council of the Isle of Man The Second Deemster lost his seat in 1965 and the First Deemster lost his in 1975

There are currently three full time Deemsters in the Isle of Man These are the First Deemster and Clerk of the Rolls the Second Deemster and an additional full time Deemster The offices of First Deemster Second Deemster and Clerk of the Rolls are ancient offices The offices of First Deemster and Clerk of the Rolls were joined in 1918 and a new office of Deputy Deemster was created in 2002 but abolished in 2009 Additional deemsters full time or part time may now be appointed the present full time additional deemster previously held the office of Deputy Deemster and additional part time deemsters are appointed from time to time to hear a particular case

The current Deemsters are

The First Deemster Second Deemster and Judge of Appeal are appointed by and hold office during the pleasure of Queen Elizabeth II Additional Deemsters are appointed by the Lieutenant Governor on the recommendation of the First DeemsterBy virtue of being ex officio Deputy Governor the First Deemster acts in place of the Lieutenant Governor in the latters absence or during a vacancy in that office

Unlike judges in the United Kingdom Deemsters have no security of tenure and thus legal protection against dismissal by the government The process whereby the appointment and removal of Manx judges occurs on the formal advice of United Kingdom politicians is seen as an effective alternative

The coat of arms of the Isle of Man or The Arms of Her Majesty in right of the Isle of Man The arms were adopted on 12 July 1996

The Arms of Her Majesty in right of the Isle of Man were granted by Queen Elizabeth II Lord of Mann on 12 July 1996 They are a form of the traditional arms It has a threefold rotational symmetry

The traditional arms date back to the 13th century The arms are recorded in the English Walfords Roll and Camden Roll as well as the French Wijbergen Roll In the Camden Roll the arms are shown as gules three mailed legs embowed and conjoined at the thighs argent the original Norman French blazon reads lescu de gules a treis iambes armes or Red 3 bent legs in armour joined at the top of the thighs silver

The escutcheon is emblazoned Gules a triskele argent garnished and spurred Or The triskele is an ancient symbol consisting of three branches or legs that radiate from a centre The symbol is found on the Isle of Man and earlier on Sicily The Manx triskelion is known in the Manx language as tre cassyn the three legs The symbol has been associated with the island since at least the 13th century

It is unknown how the tre cassyn were originally adopted and several theories have been put forward their origin In 1607 English historian William Camden stated that the tre cassyn were derived from the Sicilian triskelion In 1885 John Newton considered the tre cassyn to have originated in the mid 13th century when the Pope offered the throne of Sicily to Edmund son of King Henry III of England Newton noted that the wife of King Alexander III of Scotland was Henrys daughter and that Alexander visited the English court in 1255 Later in 1266 Norway ceded the Isle of Man to the Kingdom of Scotland and Newton considered it likely that Alexander utilised the triskelion for the arms of his new possession It has also been suggested that the ancestry of the tre cassyn can be traced to the triquetra in a coin of Amlab Cuarn a 10th century Norse Gael warlord who was king of Northumbria and king of Dublin Lending credibility to this theory is the current belief that the mediaeval Manx dynasty was related to that of Amlab Cuarn However the gap between the 10th century and late 13th century when the tre cassyn is first recorded is wide indeed and it has been noted that several kings from this period are known to have borne a galley as their emblem and not the tre cassyn

Early examples of the symbol are present in the Royal Arms ascribed to the King of Mann in several late 13th century armorials The tre cassyn also appears on the Manx Sword of State which is popularly said to date to the time of King Amlab mac Gofraid although recent analysis has shown it more likely dates to about the 15th century Another example can be seen on a 14th century stone cross in the churchyard of Maughold Another is example is a late 14th century seal of Sir William le Scrope Lord of Mann in which the tre cassyn are depicted in plate armour rather than mail Early representations of the tre cassyn show the legs running clockwise and later representations show the legs running in both directions

The peregrine falcon is derived from the time of King John I of Mann In 1405 he was granted the Isle of Man on condition he paid homage to King Henry IV of England and gave two peregrine falcons to him and every future English king their Coronation Day The descendants of John I ruled the Isle of Man until King George III of Great Britain as the Lords of Mann The presentation of falcons continued on until the coronation of King George IV in 1822

In keeping with the Viking history of the island the raven featured in Norse mythology The chief god Odin was accompanied by the two ravens Huginn and Muninn

The motto is quocunque jeceris stabit which is Latin and means whichever way you shall have thrown it it shall stand The motto dates to the 17th century where it is first recorded as being present on Manx coinage dating to the year 1668 It is possible that the motto became associated to the tre cassyn through these coins

Bells theorem also called Bells inequality is a thought experiment joined with real experiments designed to show that there are no hidden variables that can explain some of the unexpected consequences of quantum mechanics This study which is highly related to Quantum mechanics was produced by John Stewart Bell The following analogy has been provided by Brian Greene

Pairs of boxes have been prepared and sent to recipients on Earth and on Vulcan There is something inside that shows a light when a door is opened If the same doors are opened on both members of the pair then both lights will be blue or both lights will be red What if different doors are opened Maybe the chances that a red light or a blue light shows up were set by the maker of the boxes Or maybe whether a red light or a blue light shows up depends of an individual coin flip in each box How can we tell

In a system that works the way quantum mechanics does there is a 50 chance that opening any pair of doors will give rise to a match For instance Earth could open the door in the gray side of its box and Vulcan could open the door in the black side of its box Quantum physics says that half the time they should get a match But if the decision to produce a certain color for each of the doors opened is programmed into both boxes then there is a 55 or greater chance of getting a match 

Bell argues that because in actual experiments doing the equivalent of opening different doors only yields a 50 success rate there can be no hidden variables in operation that would have preselected states for all six alternatives

The analogy given here follows closely the one used by Brian Greene in The Elegant Universe p 107ff

Single Day Races and Classics

He is a double Madison World Champion and Commonwealth Games gold medallist on the track As a road cyclist he has risen to fame as a sprinter He got eleven wins in his first professional season equalling the record held by Alessandro Petacchi In the 2008 Tour de France he won four stages a then unprecedented achievement for a British cyclist and he has been described as the fastest sprinter in the world He continued his wins in 2009 by taking the Spring classic Milan San Remo Cavendish started racing informally at 12 as a mountain bike rider 

Cavendish was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Douglas in 2008 and collected the award on 14 April 2011 He lives on the Isle of Man and has a training base in Quarrata Tuscany Italy

Cavendish was born in Douglas Isle of Man the son of David Cavendish also from the Isle of Man and Adele from Yorkshire He began riding BMX at a young age racing at the National Sports Centre in Douglas It was at that time that Cavendish met David Millar at a race on the Isle of Man Cavendish said he was inspired by Millar

Cavendish worked in a bank for two years after leaving school He concentrated on earning enough money to support himself as a full time cyclist later on as he attempted to turn professional 

Mark Cavendish began his career with the British Track Cycling team He won gold in the madison at the Los Angeles World Track Championships with Rob Hayles They had not raced together before They finished one lap ahead of the field to claim the gold medal ahead of the Dutch and Belgian teams giving Britain its fourth gold at the championships It was Cavendishs first world champions jersey Cavendish also won the 2005 European championship points race He began road racing in 2005 riding the Tour of Berlin and Tour of Britain as a trialist with Team Sparkasse

Cavendish began 2006 with the Continental team Team Sparkasse a feeder squad for T Mobile Team In June he won two stages and the points and sprint competitions in the Tour of Berlin He rode for the Isle of Man on the track at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne riding the scratch race He lapped the field with three others Rob Hayles Ashley Hutchinson of Australia and James McCallum of Scotland He then beat these in the sprint to win gold for the Isle of Man The race time was 23m 5s an average 519 kilometres per hour 

His success at the Tour of Berlin led to a post as a stagiare with T Mobile from August until the end of the season His best result for T Mobile in 2006 was in the Tour of Britain where he came second three times and won the points classification It brought a full professional contract for 2007 and 2008

Cavendish began 2007 laboriously said the daily sports paper Lquipe It quoted one of Cavendishs team mates Roger Hammond To be honest he started the season so catastrophically that the staff were wondering what they could enter Mark for so that he could finish the race Cavendishs breakthrough came at the Grote Scheldeprijs race in Belgium which he won overall after failing to even finish any of his previous races He went on to win stages at the Quatre Jours de DunkerqueFour Days of Dunkirk and the Tour of Catalonia Volta a Catalunya the third oldest cycling stage race in the world and that brought selection for the 2007 Tour de France starting in London He crashed in stages 1 and 2 and abandoned on stage 8 as the race reached the Alps having taken two top ten placings but unhappy not to have had a top five placing 

Then the pattern changed Everything fell into place Lquipe said His debut season continued moving on to 10 stage wins one behind Alessandro Petacchis record 11 for a dbut season Cavendish took his 11th win in early October the Circuit Franco Belge to equal Petacchis record Among the wins were three in UCI ProTour events the two in the Volta a Catalunya and one in the Eneco Tour of Benelux

In 2008 Cavendish returned to the track winning the Madison World Championships in Manchester with Bradley Wiggins as Great Britain topped the medal table 

On the road Cavendish won his first stages of a grand tour by picking two victories in the 2008 Giro dItalia Cavendish won four further stages in the 2008 Tour de France his first coming in Stage 5 from Cholet to Chteauroux He won again on Stage 8 Stage 12 and Stage 13 making him the first British rider to collect four stages in a single Tour Overnight at the age of just 22 he became the fourth most successful British professional in history said The Independent After Stage 14 Cavendish abandoned the Tour to concentrate on the Beijing Olympics He and Team Columbia manager Bob Stapleton agreed that riding the Alps was a risk to his hopes But Cavendish with Bradley Wiggins failed to win a medal finishing joint eighth in the madison He was the only British track cyclist not to win a medal Following the Olympics Cavendish remained angry with British Cycling for not giving much attention to the madison though Chris Boardman said that Cavendishs professional commitments also interfered with his build up to the Olympics In November 2008 Cavendish said that he had no further plans to return to track cycling

The rest of his season was also successful with a total of eleven further race wins including three each at the Tour of Ireland which he abandoned on the final day and the Tour of Missouri winning his only points classification of the season at the latter At the Tour de Romandie Cavendish won the prologue time trial beating compatriot Bradley Wiggins and emphasising his short distance time trial abilities

Cavendishs 2009 season began at the Tour of Qatar where he renewed his rivalry with Tom Boonen Boonen won the race and one stage though Cavendish took two stages he also won two stages at the Tour of California again beating Boonen in the sprint finishes The Tour of California also saw Cavendish win his first points of classification of the 2009 season Cavendish was a surprise inclusion in the British squad for the 2009 UCI Track Cycling World Championships where he competed in the Scratch Race and the Madison failing to pick up medals in either He took up the European season at TirrenoAdriatico the Italian one week stage race where he won one stage He then entered his first classic race Milan San Remo and after a week of uncharacteristically humble pre race statements rode effectively over the climbs that his rivals had said made this race impossible for him to win  and then tracked down Heinrich Haussler in the last 200 meters to narrowly win the sprint and the race Cavendishs first victory in a race known as one of the five monuments of cycling

Cavendish repeated his two stage victory at the Three Days of De Panne from 2008 also winning the points classification

At the start of the 2009 Giro dItalia Columbia won the Team Time Trial and he was given the Maglia Rosa leaders jersey becoming the first British rider to ever wear it The first 2 road stages however were fruitless for Cavendish who was beaten to the line by Alessandro Petacchi in the first stage and was caught behind a crash and failed to make it back for the sprint the next day Cavendish soon asserted his sprinting dominance on the race however gaining 3 stage wins before abandoning following stage 13 citing a need to rest for beginning preparations for the Tour de France He continued his preparation by racing the Tour de Suisse He won both stage 3 and stage 6 to wear the points jersey However this was taken off him by Fabian Cancellara

In June he published his first autobiography Boy Racer which covered his career to date At a press conference in London ahead of the 2009 Tour de France Cavendish explained that the book was too premature to be seen as a complete biography and that his biggest motivation for writing it had been to explain himself better due to the way he perceives himself when performing post stage interviews Instead he felt that the book was more a biography of last years Tour stage wins

During the season Cavendish developed a remarkable partnership with his leadout man Mark Renshaw Continuing his run of success Cavendish won Stage 2 Stage 3 Stage 10 Stage 11 Stage 19 and Stage 21 of the 2009 Tour de France In winning the third stage he became the first Briton to hold the green jersey for two days in a row Cavendishs win on stage 11 enabled him to reclaim the green jersey from rival Thor Hushovd and equalled Barry Hobans British record of eight Tour de France stage wins However all the points that Cavendish gained in stage 14 were removed after he was judged to have driven Hushovd too close to barriers on the course Cavendish said of the protest which he thought was lodged by Hushovd that Thor either thinks so highly of himself that he thinks I was looking out for him yesterday or he thinks so highly of my team that the only way he can beat us is to complain like that However the disqualification was confirmed before Hushovd and his team lodged a protest Cavendish added that the green jersey was no longer within his reach and that his main objective was now to finish the race and win the final stage in Paris which he did Winning the 19th stage Cavendish set a new record for Tour de France stage wins by a British rider afterwards he said that he was embarrassed for his comments about deserving green jersey wearer Hushovd In winning the 21st stage he lead home a remarkable 1 2 for his team when his team mate and leadout man Mark Renshaw finished second on the Champs lyses

Following on from the Tour de France Cavendish won the Sparkassen Giro Bochum and took part in the Tour of Ireland winning stage two On 7 September he recorded the 50th win of his road racing career in a sprint finish in the opening stage of the Tour of Missouri Before the race he confirmed he will remain with Team Columbia HTC in 2010 ending speculation linking him with a move to newly created British team Team Sky Cavendish retained the leaders jersey by sprinting to victory on stage two but finished fifth on stage three losing the overall lead to Thor Hushovd and was forced to withdraw from the race before stage four due to a lung infection Although selected for the British team for the Mens Road Race at the 2009 UCI Road World Championships his illness prevented him from taking part

Following a dental problem Mark delayed the start of his 2010 season until the 2010 Ruta del Sol in mid February Following the lay off his form was poor and he failed to defend his victory at the 2010 Milan San Remo He was in six minutes after the leaders down in 89th place Cavendishs pre season goals were to win the green jersey in the Tour de France and win the Road Race at the 2010 World Championships Mark also said that he will race in the 2010 Tour of Flanders but said he will not win it stating that the Tour of Flanders requires training but he sees himself winning it in the future

Following a poor start to the season Cavendish found form at the 2010 Volta a Catalunya finishing seventh in the opening time trial and winning stage 2 His team withdrew Cavendish from the Tour of Romandie after he made an offensive gesture after winning the second stage Missing the 2010 Giro dItalia Cavendish instead chose to compete at the 2010 Tour of California starting on 16 May 2010 where he won the first stage for only his third victory of the season On 15 June Cavendish crashed heavily whilst sprinting in the closing metres of the 4th stage of the Tour of Switzerland appearing to veer off line and bring down Heinrich Haussler and several other riders raising criticism from other teams regarding his riding style Cavendish entered the 2010 Tour de France During Stage 1 Cavendish crashed out of the final sprint with just under 3 km remaining in the stage Overhead camera footage showed Cavendish failing to negotiate a corner after entering too fast and turning too late He then leaned his shoulder into a fellow rider as he travelled away from the apex Cavendish returned to form by winning the Stage 5 Stage 6 Stage 11 Stage 18 and Stage 20 bringing his career total to 15 stage wins He ended up second in the points classification 11 points behind Alessandro Petacchi Cavendishs next race was the 2010 Vuelta a Espaa in which his team won the opening team time trial Cavendish crossed the line first and took the leaders jersey He could only place second or third on the subsequent sprint stages but returned to form later in the race winning stages 12 13 18 and the green jersey points classification

Cavendish has been described as confident even arrogant He said cquoteWhen journalists at the Tour de France ask me if I am the best sprinter I answer Yes and thats seen as arrogance but if they dont ask me I dont say Im the best sprinter in the world

Outside races he is seen differently cquoteIn ordinary life hes a polite guy a gentleman Hes the kind of guy who doesnt call you to moan in the way that most riders do He rings to ask how you are or what youre doing said Brian Holm his directeur sportif

Sir Hans Krebs was a German Jewish scientist who became a naturalised British citizen He was a physician and biochemist

Krebs researched metabolism He is famous because he discovered the urea cycle and citric acid cycle 

Krebs won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this in 1953

Krebs was born in Hildesheim Germany His mother was Alma Davidson His father was Georg Krebs Georg Krebs was an ear nose and throat doctor 

Krebs studied medicine at the University of Gttingen and the University of Freiburg from 19181923 He earned his PhD at the University of Hamburg in 1925 Next he studied chemistry in Berlin for one year In Berlin he helped Otto Warburg at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology until 1930

Random Forest is an statistical algorithm that is used to cluster points of data in functional groups When the data set is large andor there are many variables it becomes difficult to cluster the data because not all variables can be taken into account therefore the algorithm can also give a certain chance that a data point belongs in a certain group

This how the clustering takes place

In a random forest algorithm the number of trees grown and the number of variables that are used at each split can be chosen by hand example settings are 500 trees 71 variables

The Cambrian explosion or Cambrian radiation was the relatively rapid appearance of most major phyla around 530 million years ago as found in the fossil record 

Before about 580mya most organisms were simple made of individual cells occasionally organized into colonies Over the following 70 or 80 million years the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude as defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species The diversity of life began to resemble that of today

The Cambrian explosion has generated extensive scientific debate The seemingly rapid appearance of fossils in the primordial strata was noted as early as the mid 19th century and Charles Darwin saw it as one of the main objections that could be made against his theory of evolution by natural selection

The long running puzzlement about the appearance of the Cambrian fauna seemingly abruptly and from nowhere centres on three key points 

Interpretation is difficult due to a limited supply of evidence The evidence is an incomplete fossil record and chemical signatures left in Cambrian rocks

The Cambrian explosion started in the Ediacaran from about 575mya and continued to the Burgess Shale at about 507 mya That is about 70 million years By the end all modern phyla had evolved and since then no new phyla have appeared in the fossil record This is one of the things that experts try to explain

The town of Seward Alaska is actually not there It is much further south on the Kenai Peninsula

The Seward Peninsula was once part of the Bering land bridge This was a strip of land that used to exist that connected Alaska with Siberia with mainland Alaska It existed millions of years ago during a time called the Pleistocene Ice Age People animals and plants all came across the lad bridge into North America Archaeologists have found proof that Inupiat Eskimos have been living there for thousands of years

The Peninsula does not have a lot of people today There are no roads going there The largest town is Nome There are about 3000 people there The next largest town Shishmaref has less than 600 people Most of the other towns there have only a few hundred people Some old mining towns there have no people left at all and have become ghost towns

At the end of 1988 former World Champion Hennie Kuiper set up a German cycling team that was sponsored by the city of Stuttgart and rode on Eddy Merckx cycles The team was called Stuttgart Merckx Gonsor for the 1989 season and had nine riders At that time when there were no German cycling teams and the countrys main cycling event the Rund um den Henninger Turm had not been won by a German since Rudi Altig in 1970 During its first year of existence team rider Dariusc Kajzer brought the team its first success in the National Road Race Championships in Germany The team became Stuttgart Mercedes Merckx Puma in 1990 and Blts continued the success of the team by becoming road race champion of Germany

Deutsche Telekom came in as the main sponsor in 1991 and the team was known as Telekom Mercedes Merckx Puma According to an interview with Godefroot it was Blts 17th place at the 1991 Vuelta a Espaa that prompted him to accept the Telekom managements offer to take over the running of the team Godefroot signed several riders including Classics specialist and 1991 ParisRoubaix winner Marc Madiot Blts who was involved with the team since its beginnings in 1989 stayed with the team until 2003 continued building on the successes of the team by winning stage 19 the Queen stage of the 1992 Giro dItalia Jens Heppner continued this with his tenth place overall at the 1992 Tour de France 

The Telekom team signed all the promising cyclists that were coming from Germany at that time and who were becoming successful These included Jens Heppner and Christian Henn in 1992 Erik Zabel Rolf Aldag and Steffen Wesemann in 1993 and Jan Ullrich in 1994 Many of these riders would ride for more than ten years with the team Olaf Ludwig also signed in 1993 and finished his career with the team In 1994 Zabel won the first UCI Road World Cup victory in the history of the team the ParisTours

In 1993 the team again achieved success in the national championship road race in Germany This was the start of the teams 11 year domination and possession of the German champions jersey Many of the successful team riders that spent many years of their career with Telekom would become German national champions Bernd Grne in 1993 Jens Heppner in 1994 Blts in 1990 1995 and 1999 Christian Henn in 1996 Jan Ullrich in 1997 and 2001 Erik Zabel in 1998 and 2003 Rolf Aldag in 2000 Danilo Hondo in 2002 and finally Andreas Klden in 2004 

The team soon became an important presence on the international cycling stage However the team was not invited to the 1995 Tour de France Eventually the organisers of the Tour agreed that six Telekom members namely Rolf Aldag Udo Blts Jens Heppner Vladimir Pulnikov Erik Zabel and Olaf Ludwig would be joined with three members of the ZG Mobili to form a composite team Zabel went on to win two stages in the race 

The next two years saw the international breakthrough of the team Godefroot brought in Danish rider Bjarne Riis the third place finisher of the 1995 Tour and he went on to win the 1996 Tour de France with the then 22 year old German support rider Jan Ullrich finishing in second place In addition Zabel won the first of six green jerseys for winning the points competition Bolts won the Clsica de San Sebastin and Wesemann won his second and the first of four wins with the Telekom team of the famous stage race the Peace Race 

The 1997 Tour de France saw the emergence of Ullrich as he won the race with support from Riis who in turn had won the World Cup race Amstel Gold Race earlier in 1997 Team Telekom also won the team classification as the overall strongest team of the 1997 Tour In addition Bolts won the Critrium du Dauphin Libr Zabel won Milan San Remo for the first of four times with the team Ullrich also won the Championships of Hamburg semi classic The following year this race was elevated to the status of World Cup In addition the Deutschland Tour returned in 1999 evidence of the continuing popularity of cycling in Germany at the time While Ullrich had a crash in the race and was forced to retire Team Telekom did win the first edition of the race with Heppner and would win the race again with Alexander Vinokourov in 2001 

Ullrich finished second in the 1998 Tour de France but went on to win the 1999 Vuelta a Espaa although he missed the 1999 Tour de France due to a knee injury After winning the Vuelta Ullrich became World time trial champion which enabled him to wear the rainbow jersey during time trials He would win this again in 2001 The next year Zabel won the overall World Cup victory having won the Milan San Remo and Amstel Gold Race while Ullrich placed second again in the 2000 Tour de France to Lance Armstrong Ullrich won the gold medal in the Olympic road race and the silver medal in the Olympic time trial In 2001 Zabel won Milan San Remo for the fourth time Ullrich came in second in the 2001 Tour de France while Zabel won six stages combined in the 2001 Tour and Vuelta Kazakh rider Alexandre Vinokourov won the ParisNice stage race in 2002 a feat he would duplicate in 2003 also winning the Amstel Gold Race and Tour de Suisse that year As Ullrich left the team to form Team Bianchi in 2003 Vinokourov became team leader for the 2003 Tour de France He finished in third place just below the second placed Ullrich Zabel won the 2003 ParisTours while Italian rider Daniele Nardello took the Zri Metzgete

The team had a continuous presence at the top of the professional peloton and continued to sign the emerging German cyclists of the times with Andreas Klden in 1998 Jrg Jaksche in 1999 Matthias Kessler in 2000 and Stefan Schumacher in 2002 to name but a few In addition the team signed many successful non German riders such as Georg Totschnig Alexander Vinokourov Cadel Evans Santiago Botero and Paolo Savoldelli

In 2005 a film titled Hell on Wheels was released It is a record of the 100th anniversary of the Tour de France in 2003 from the perspective of the then Team Telekom

From 2004 the team changed its name to T Mobile Jan Ullrich returned to the team The team achieved a great number of success among which was Steffan Wesemanns win in the Ronde van Vlaanderen Coming up to the 2004 Tour de France Kloden became German road race champion and Ullrich won the Tour de Suisse and raced the 2004 Tour de France as team leader while Vinokourov did not ride the Tour de France for the team Jan Ullrich finished fourth while Andreas Klden was the best placed rider of the team in second place T Mobile Team won the team classification as the overall strongest team of the 2004 Tour In the spring season of 2005 Vinokourov won the LigeBastogneLige classic race Ullrich as the team leader finished 3rd overall in the 2005 Tour de France Alexandre Vinokourov rode in support and finished fifth as he won two stages including the final stage on the Champs Elysees Italian rider Giuseppe Guerini also won a stage and T Mobile Team matched their 2004 feat by once again winning the team classification in 2005 Zabel won the ParisTours for the third time at the end of the season 

In July 2005 during the 2005 Tour Vinokourovs contract was running out and people wondered if he was to stay with T Mobile With four days left of the 2005 Tour he made an announcement that he would leave the team to pursue his own chances of winning the Tour de France as a team captain and after the Tour he joined the Liberty Seguros team After 13 years with Team Telekom and T Mobile Team Erik Zabel also left in 2005 to ride for the newly formed Team Milram Before the 2006 season Walter Godefroot stepped down and Olaf Ludwig became the new T Mobile team manager

In the most controversial scandal since the 1998 tour thirteen riders were expelled from the 2006 Tour de France stemming from a Spanish doping scandal on the eve of Strasbourg prologue to the 93rd edition Jan Ullrich one of the favorites to win the race was among those excluded from the Tour Another T Mobile rider Oscar Sevilla was also expelled leaving the team starting with only seven riders

On 9 July the team announced the dismissal of its sporting director Rudy Pevenage for his implication with former Tour de France winner Jan Ullrich in a Spanish blood doping scandal The contract linking T Mobile to Pevenage has been retrospectively stopped on 30 June the teams general manager Olaf Ludwig said

On July 21 2006 T Mobile fired Jan Ullrich from the team pending the doping investigation

At the 2006 Tour de France T Mobile won the team classification for the third consecutive year Andreas Klden reached the podium for the second time Matthias Kessler won Stage 3 Serhiy Honchar won two individual time trials and wore the yellow jersey for 3 days

After the Tour de France the team completely changed Team manager Olaf Ludwig left the team and was replaced by Bob Stapleton Rolf Aldag Allan Peiper and Tristan Hoffman became directeur sportifs As already discussed Ullrich Sevilla and Pevenage were dismissed from the team Several riders who had been with the team for a long time such as Steffen Wesemann Andreas Klden and Matthias Kessler left or their contracts were not extended Jrg Ludewig was put on suspension and his contract was not increased in connection with intention to dope previously in his career and before he joined T Mobile Eddy Mazzoleni who was in his first year for the team would also leave The contracts of Bram Schmitz and Bas Gilling were not renewed Dr Lothar Heinrich the team doctor since 1995 and Dr Andreas Schmid set up a new comprehensive testing system Following the revelations that came out of the Operacin Puerto investigation Heinrich allegedly nearly quit the sport but instead he joined with Stapleton and other team staff to create a new system of internal controls and health checks that he insisted would demonstrate that T Mobile riders were clean and to restore credibility to the sport

In May 2007 several former riders admitted to using banned substances while riding for the team in the mid 1990s including Erik Zabel Rolf Aldag Brian Holm Bjarne Riis Bert Dietz Udo Blts and Christian Henn including the seasons in which Riis and Ullrich won the Tour de France Team doctors Andreas Schmid and Lothar Heinrich also confessed to participating and administering banned substances The latter was Team Telekoms sporting director until May 3 2007 when he was suspended following allegations published in former team member Jef dHonts book

In an effort to present a renewed image the team brought a young team to the 2007 Tour de France and promoted a drug free attitude and image Despite this team member Patrik Sinkewitz tested positive for elevated testosterone during a training camp The test results were only announced when Sinkiewitz had dropped out of the Tour because of injury He was still in hospital when he was suspended from Team T Mobile and was dismissed on 31 July 2007 

In November 2007 Deutsche Telekom AG announced that it was to end sponsorship of professional cycling with immediate effect The team continued under the name Team High Road through June 2008 The team changed nationality in February 2008 switching from Germany to the United States The team continued thanks to funding solely from the team owner Bob Stapleton as the team did not have enough time to gather sponsors for the new year The team had a successful start to the year with Luxembourg rider Kim Kirchen winning the classic La Flche Wallonne Results like this and also High Roads performance at the Giro dItalia helped the team secure a sponsor for the end of the year

On June 15 2008 Columbia Sportswear announced a three year sponsorship of the team beginning on July 5 the start of the Tour de France The teams new name is Team Columbia The sponsorship includes both the mens and womens teams The announcement of this new deal with Columbia coincided with a highly successful Tour in which the team won 5 individual stages as well as team leader Kim Kirchen leading the general classification in the Tour de France for four days in addition to leading the points classification in the Tour de France The team capped off a successful 2008 by finishing second to Team CSC in the CQ Team Ranking

On June 29 2009 HTC announced a three year sponsorship of the team beginning with the 2009 Tour de France The teams new name is Team Columbia HTC Like the Columbia Sportswear sponsorship the HTC sponsorship includes both the mens and womens teams The team enjoyed great success at the 2009 Tour de France with Mark Cavendish winning 6 stages over the course of the 3 weeks The most memorable of these was his victory on the Champs lyses in Paris where he won by a huge margin almost 30m with his own lead out man Mark Renshaw having enough time to come in 2nd with his arms raised A documentary film called Chasing Legends was later released that covered the 2009 tour through the eyes of HTC Columbia

August proved a very good month for Norwegian allrounder Edvald Boasson Hagen with two stage wins and a podium finish in the Tour of Poland and two more stage wins and the GC win in the Eneco Tour After stage wins in the other two Grand Tours of 2009 it took the team only three days to win yet another in the Vuelta where Gregory Henderson took home the flowers

Despite its many successes Team Columbia does not seem to be able to afford as many top riders as they have and due to their many victories a lot of riders were targeted by other teams for the 2010 season Notable riders such as Kim Kirchen Edvald Boasson Hagen Michael Barry George Hincapie and Thomas Lvkvist elected to leave the team As replacements a lot of young talented riders such as Jan Ghyselinck Rasmus Guldhammer and Martin and Peter Velits were contracted

On October 17 2010 Team Columbia HTC announced a tie up with Specialized for 2011 and beyond Specialized will supply the teams frames forks and helmets The men will race the S Works Tarmac for most road races the S Works Roubaix for cobbled classics and the Shiv TT in time trials The all new S Works Prevail and TT3 helmets will protect the riders in road and TT applications respectively

Sir Peter Brian Medawar OM CBE FRS was a British biologist

His work was important to skin grafts and organ transplants 

Transplants of skin and organs from other people are usually rejected This is an action by the immune system Medawar showed that sometimes this reaction can be avoided and why 

He worked on graft rejection and the discovery of acquired immune tolerance He was awarded the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet 

Until he was partially disabled by a stroke Medawar was Director of the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill London

Medawar was professor of zoology at the University of Birmingham and University College London In 1962 he was appointed director of the National Institute for Medical Research and became professor of experimental medicine at the Royal Institution and president of the Royal Postgraduate Medical School Medawar was a scientist of great inventiveness who was interested in many other subjects including opera philosophy and cricket 

He was knighted in 1965 and appointed to the Order of Merit in 1981

Medawar was awarded his Nobel Prize in 1960 for work in tissue grafting which is the basis of organ transplants He and his team discovered acquired immunological tolerance

At birth babies are protected by antibodies from the mother During embryonic life and immediately after birth immune cells develop They learn to distinguish between their own tissues on the one hand and unwanted cells and foreign material on the other

Medawars work resulted in a shift of emphasis in the science of immunology from one that attempts to deal with the fully developed immunity mechanism to one that attempts to alter the immunity mechanism itself Various ways have been found to suppress the bodys rejection of organ transplants

His books include

Princess of Orange is the title used for the women who were married to the Ruling Princes of Orange in the time between 1171 to 1815 Since 1815 it was also used for the wives of the heirs to the Dutch throne who were titled Prince of Orange The only woman who became a Princess of Orange without being married to a Prince of Orange was Marie Princess of Orange Together with her husband John Prince of Orange they governed the land 

Because the title Prince of Orange was only used for the eldest son of the King Dutch crown princesses did not get the title There were no oldest sons for a few generations and so the title was not used since 1877 Because Dutch law was changed in 1983 to include oldest daughters of the King Catharina Amalia the next Princess of Orange may become the first Dutch Princess of Orange in her own right once her father Prince Willem Alexander becomes King of the Netherlands

The Finke River is one of the largest rivers in central Australia It starts in the MacDonnell Ranges in the Northern Territory it is formed where Davenport and Ormiston Creeks join together just north of Glen Helen The Finke River flows about 600 km to the western edge of the Simpson Desert in northern South Australia Usually the river is a collection of waterholes but it can become a raging torrent during rare flood events In a big flood water from the Finke River can flow into the Macumba River and then into Lake Eyre a total distance of about 750 km Major tributaries include Ellery Creek and the Palmer and Hugh Rivers The Finke River flows through the West MacDonnell and Finke Gorge National Parks

The Finke River was named by John McDouall Stuart in 1860 after William Finke an Adelaide man who was one of the people who paid part of the cost of his expeditions The indigenous name for the river in parts of the Northern Territory is Larapinta Larapinta Drive is a road which runs west from Alice Springs and the Larapinta walking trail

The Finke River has been called the oldest river in the world particularly by tour operators and in popular books and brochures In places such as the James Range the Finke flows through deeply incised meanders Because meanders only form on flat plains the river must have formed before the ranges were pushed up This happened in a mountain building event known as the Alice Springs Orogeny which happened between 400 and 300 million years ago in the Devonian to Carboniferous Periods Some parts of the rivers course must have been already in existence around this time The southern parts of its course must be much younger because the areas where the Finke now flows near the southern edge of the Northern Territory and further south were under the sea during the Mesozoic Era part of the Great Artesian Basin 

The age of the Finke River is not unique There are other large mountain sourced river systems in central Australia including the Todd and Hale Rivers where the mountains were formed at the same time There are other mountain ranges of equal or greater age to the MacDonnell Ranges both in Australia and on other continents The rivers in those areas may have evolved from ancestral streams of of the same age or older than the Finke

Anna van Egmont was a member of an important and rich Dutch family She was the first wife of William the Silent Prince of Orange 

She was the only child of Maximiliaan van Egmond and Franoise de Lannoy She was also Countess of Lingen and of Leerdam and Lady of IJsselstein of Borssele of Grave of Cranendonck of Jaarsveld of Kortgene of Sint Maartensdijk and of Odijk Because she was the only child she also got the title of Countess of Buren and Lady of Egmond 

In 1551 she married William the Silent in Buren Because she was the Lady of Egmond and Countess of Buren he became Lord of Egmond and Count of Buren They had three children

Anna died when she was only 25 years old She was buried in Breda

Central Mount Stuart is a mountain in the south of the Northern Territory Australia It can easily seen from the nearby Stuart Highway which is about 6 km away The mountain is made from dark red sandstone 

The mountain is named after the explorer John McDouall Stuart who reached the area on 22 April 1860 He worked out that a point about 4 km south southwest of the mountain was the centre of Australia Modern geographers do not agree with this and now place the centre at Finke

Stuart climbed to the top on 23 April 1860 writing in his journal Took Kekwick and the flag and went to the top of the mount but found it to be much higher and more difficult of ascent than I anticipatedNear the top of the cone I placed a small bottle in which there is a slip of paper with our signatures to it stating by whom it was raised We then gave three hearty cheers for the flag the emblem of civil and religious liberty and may it be a sign to the natives that the dawn of liberty civilization and Christianity is about to break upon them 

The slip of paper was found in 1871 by John Ross during the building of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line It is now in the Library of South Australia 

Stuart called the mountain Central Mount Sturt after his former expedition leader Charles Sturt The name was changed on a suggestion from the Governor of South Australia Sir Richard MacDonnell This happened soon after Stuarts return to Adelaide at the end of the expedition Central Mount Stuart is the name that was printed in the published expedition journal

Louise de Coligny was the fourth wife of Prince William the Silent She was the daughter of an important French protestant leader Gaspard de Coligny 

She marries Charles de Tligny when she is 17 years old in 1571 He is a protestant diplomat He is also friendly with the French King Charles IX Both her father and her husband are killed during the St Bartholomews Day massacre in 1572 

In 1583 she marries William the Silent in Antwerp She becomes the Princess of Orange Their son Frederik Hendrik was born on 29 January 1584 On the 10th of July that year William was shot by Balthasar Gerards and died 

She stayed in the Netherlands In 1619 she asked her stepson Maurits to stop the execution of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt but he did not listen She then left and went to France where she died in 1620 On 24 May 1621 she was buried in the crypt of the House of Orange Nassau in the New Church in Delft

The African National Congress supported by the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party has been South Africas governing left wing political party since the establishment of non racial democracy in April 1994 It defines itself as a disciplined force of the left Members founded the organization as the South African Native National Congress on 8 January 1912 in Bloemfontein to increase the rights of the black South African population John Dube its first president and poet and author Sol Plaatje are among its founding members The organization became the ANC in 1923 and formed a military wing the Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961

It has been the ruling party of post apartheid South Africa on the national level since 1994 It gained support in the 1999 elections and further increased its majority in 2004 with 697 of the votes In 2009 its share of the vote reduced slightly but it remained the dominant party with 659 of the votes

The ANC was founded in direct response to what was seen as injustices against black South Africans at the hands of their white mostly Afrikaner government The ANC had its origins in a pronouncement by Pixley ka Isaka Seme who said in 1911 Forget all the past differences among Africans and unite in one national organisation The ANC was set up the next year on 8 January 1912

The government of the newly formed Union of South Africa began a systematic oppression of black people in South Africa The Natives Land Act was issued in 1913 The effect of these laws was to force many non whites from their farms into the cities and towns to work and to restrict their movement within South Africa By 1919 the ANC led a campaign against passes and in 1929 the ANC supported a militant mineworkers strike

The ANC became dormant in the mid 1920s During that time black people were also represented by the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union and the once white only Communist party By 1927 JT Gumende proposed cooperation with the Communists in a bid to revitalise the organisation but he was voted out of power in the 1930s This led to the ANC becoming largely ineffectual and inactive until the mid 1940s when the ANC was remodelled as a mass movement

The ANC responded militarily to attacks on the rights of black South Africans as well as calling for strikes boycotts and defiance This led to a later Defiance Campaign in the 1950s a mass movement of resistance to South Africa under apartheid The government tried to stop the ANC by banning party leaders and enacting new laws to stop the ANC however these measures failed

In 1955 the Congress of the People officially adopted the Freedom Charter stating the core principles of the South African Congress Alliance which consisted of the African National Congress and its allies the South African Indian Congress the South African Congress of Democrats and the Coloured Peoples Congress The government claimed that this was a communist document and consequently leaders of the ANC and Congress were arrested 1960 saw the Sharpeville Massacre in which 69 people were killed when police opened fire on anti apartheid protesters

Whites eventually joined the fight against apartheid leading many black supremacists to break away from the ANC

Umkhonto we Sizwe translated Spear of the Nation was the military wing of the ANC Partly in response to the Sharpeville Massacre of 1960 individual members of the ANC thought violence was needed because peaceful passive protest had failed There was a significant portion of the ANC who therefore turned to violence in order to achieve their goals A significant portion of ANC leadership agreed that this violence was needed to combat increasing backlash from the government 

Some ANC members were upset by the actions of the MK and refused to accept violence as necessary for the ending of Apartheid but these individuals became a minority as the militant leaders such as Nelson Mandela gained significant popularity Many consider their actions to be criminal but the MK said violence was justified by the goal of ending apartheid Some members of MK committed terrorist acts to achieve their aims and MK was responsible for the deaths of both civilians and members of the military In cooperation with the South African Communist Party MK was founded in 1961

The ANC calls itself a force of national liberation in the post apartheid era it officially defines its umbrella agenda as the National Democratic Revolution The ANC is a member of the Socialist International It also sets forth the redressing of socio economic differences stemming from colonial and apartheid era policies as a central focus of ANC policy

The National Democratic Revolution is described as a process through which the National Democratic Society is achieved a society in which people are intellectually socially economically and politically empowered

The ANC holds a historic alliance with the South African Communist Party and Congress of South African Trade Unions known as the Tripartite Alliance The SACP and COSATU have not contested any election in South Africa but field candidates through the ANC hold senior positions in the ANC and influence party policy and dialogue During Mbekis presidency the government took a more pro capitalist stance often running counter to the demands of the SACP and COSATU

Following Zumas accession to the ANC leadership in 2007 and Mbekis resignation as president in 2008 the Mbeki faction of former ministers led by Mosiuoa Lekota split away from the ANC to form the Congress of the People

The ANC flag is composed of three stripes black green and gold Black symbolizes the native people of South Africa green represents the land and gold represents the mineral and other natural wealth of South Africa This flag was also the battle flag of the Umkhonto we Sizwe The official party flag also has the emblem of the party incorporated onto the flag

Politicians in the party win a place in parliament by being on the Party List which is drawn up before the elections and enumerates in order the partys preferred MPs The number of seats allocated is proportional to the popular national vote and this determines the cut off point

The ANC has also gained members through the controversial floor crossing process

Although most South African parties announced their candidate list for provincial premierships in the 2009 election the ANC did not It is not required for parties to do so

The ANC was the main opposition to the government during apartheid and played a major role in resolving the conflict through the peacemaking and peace building processes Initially members of the National Party met in secret with ANC leaders including Nelson Mandela to see if peace was possible Discussions and negotiations took place leading to the eventual unbanning of the ANC and other opposing political parties by then President de Klerk on 2 February 1990 These initial meetings were the first crucial steps towards resolution

The next official step towards rebuilding South Africa was the Groote Schuur Minute where the government and the ANC agreed on a common commitment towards the end of violence and intimidation as well as a commitment to stability and to a peaceful process of negotiations The ANC negotiated the release of political prisoners and the immunity from prosecution for returning exiles and moreover channels of communication were established between the Government and the ANC

Later the Pretoria Minute was another step towards resolution where agreements at Groote Schuur were reconsolidated and steps towards setting up an interim government and drafting a new constitution were established as well as suspension of the military wing of the ANC the Umkhonto we Sizwe This step helped end much of the violence within South Africa Another agreement that came out of the Pretoria Minute was that both parties would try and raise awareness that a new way of governing was being created for South Africa and that further violence would only hinder this process However violence still continued in Kwazulu Natal which violated the trust between Mandela and de Klerk Moreover internal disputes in the ANC prolonged the war as consensus on peace was not reached

The next significant steps towards resolution were

These measures ensured no one could claim or be deprived of any rights on the basis of race

In December 1991 the Convention for a Democratic South Africa was held with the aim of establishing a interim government But in June 1992 there was the Boipatong massacre Negotiations stopped as the ANC pulled out Only Cyril Ramaphosa of the ANC and Roelf Meyer of the National Party carried on talking In over 40 meetings the two men discussed and negotiated over many issues including the nature of the future political system the fate of over 40000 government employees and ifhow the country would be divided The result of these negotiations was a temporary constitution that meant the transition from apartheid to democracy was a constitutional continuation and that the rule of law and state sovereignty remained intact during the change which was vital for stability within the country A date was set for the first democratic elections on 27 April 1994 The ANC won 625 of the votes and has been in power ever since

The most prominent corruption case involving the ANC relates to a series of bribes paid to companies involved in the ongoing R55 billion Arms Deal saga which resulted in a long term jail sentence to former Deputy President Jacob Zumas legal adviser Schabir Shaik Zuma now the State president currently faces 7 813 charges relating to alleged fraud bribery and corruption in the Arms Deal The ANC has also been criticised for its subsequent abolishment of the Scorpions the multidisciplinary agency that investigated and prosecuted organised crime and corruption and was heavily involved in the investigation into Zuma and Shaik

Other recent corruption issues include the sexual misconduct and criminal charges of Beaufort West municipal manager Truman Prince and the Oilgate scandal in which millions of Rand in funds from a state owned company were allegedly funneled into ANC coffers Links between factions in the ANC specifically the ANC Youth League leadership and businessman Brett Kebble gained media attention following Kebbles murder in September 2005

In December 2007 the ANC elected their new National Executive Committee the highest structure in the party Out of the 80 member committee 9 are convicted criminals Most of these members have been convicted of fraud while one member Winnie Madikizela Mandela was convicted of the kidnapping of a 14 year old boy James Seipei also known as Stompie Moeketsi According to an article in the Mail Guardian by adding those who have been disciplined or moved and those with dark clouds of unanswered questions hanging over their heads the figure shifts to 29

The ANC has also been accused of using government and civil society to fight its political battles against opposition parties such as the Democratic Alliance The result has been a number of complaints and allegations that none of the political parties truly represent the interests of the poor This has resulted in the No Land No House No Vote Campaign which becomes very prominent each time the country holds elections

The ANC has reportedly wasted over R1 billion of taxpayers money over the past eight months on luxury vehicles expensive hotels banquets advertising and other wasteful expenditure

The main thrust behind this reporting is the official opposition in the country the Democratic Alliance They have kept a tally of the expenditure called The Wasteful Expenditure Monitor

According to the DA this waste could have

The state of Florida in the United States has a lot of different kinds of land and animals and a mild subtropical climate Because of these things millions of people have settled in the once rural state over the last hundred years Floridas population increases by about 1000 residents each day Land development and water use have changed the state mostly by draining the wetlands that once covered most of the peninsula

Much of Florida is made of karst limestone with water filled caves and sinkholes which provide homes to many species of aquatic life some of which only live in Florida As more and more people move to Florida they use up the water in the underground caves When a cave has no more water it will sometimes collapse forming a sinkhole which can hurt animals people and buildings

For a long time the state has been trying to restore the Everglades In 2000 Congress passed the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan a 78 billion 30 year project aimed at preserving and restoring the region and its unique combination of environments

Florida ranks forty fifth in total energy use despite the heavy reliance on air conditioners and pool pumps This includes coal natural gas petroleum and retail electricity sales About 4 percent of energy in the state is generated through renewable resources Florida produces 60 of the nations total energy while total production of pollutants is lower with figures of 56 percent for nitrogen oxide 51 percent for carbon dioxide and 35 percent for sulfur dioxide

There are two oil producing areas in Florida One is in South Florida with 14 fields and the other is in the western panhandle with seven fields The South Florida fields are located in Lee Hendry and Collier county Floridas first oil field the Sunniland field in Collier County was discovered in 1943 It has since produced over 18 million barrels of oil After that 13 more field discoveries were found Although these fields are small production is large Together the three Felda fields in Hendry County have produced over 54 million barrels of oil

Production in the western panhandle began with the discovery of the Jay field in June 1970 Jay is the largest oil field discovered in North America since the discovery of the giant Prudhoe Bay field on the Alaskan North Slope in 1968 Since then six more oil fields have been discovered in the western panhandle of Florida North Florida has dominated Florida oil production since the discovery of the Jay field North Florida oil fields account for 83 percent of the states production with the Jay field alone producing 71 percent

It is believed that significant energy resources are located off of Floridas western coast in the Gulf of Mexico but that region has been closed to exploration since 1981

In July 2007 Florida Governor Charlie Crist announced plans to sign executive orders that would impose strict new air pollution standards in the state with aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050 Crists orders would set new emissions targets for power companies automobiles and trucks and toughen conservation goals for state agencies and require state owned vehicles to use alternative fuels

Florida gets much of its drinking water from the Floridan Aquifer and the Biscayne Aquifer as well as from surface water from Lake Okeechobee and other lakes but population increases have begun to strain available sources The state has built 120 desalination plants more than three times as many as any other state including the largest plant in the United States Additionally an electrodialysis reversal plant in Sarasota is the largest of its type in the world and a nanofiltration plant in Boca Raton is the largest of its type in the western hemisphere

Increasing landfill space is also an issue St Lucie County is planning to experiment with burning trash through plasma arc gasification to generate energy and reduce landfill space The experiment will be the largest of its kind in the world to date and begin operation no later than 2009 If successful experts estimate that the entire St Lucie County landfill estimated to contain 43 million tons of trash will disappear within 18 years Materials created in the energy production can also be used in road construction

Florida is a biodiverse state with 3500 native vascular plants and 1500 vertebrates a higher number than all but three other states A 2003 United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization study stated that the Florida Straits had the highest biodiversity in the Atlantic Ocean and were the home to 25 endemic species

Red tide has also been an issue on the southwest coast of Florida While there has been a great deal of guessing over the cause of the toxic algae bloom there is no evidence that it is being caused by pollution or that there has been an increase in the length or frequency of red tide outbreaks

Native flora is threatened by various invasive plants including the Brazilian Pepper Owning and growing this tree is illegal Large numbers of volunteers cut down these invaders particularly along waterways The Australian pine is being actively attacked

Other foreign pests include the Asian ambrosia beetle which threatens the local avocado industry and redbay trees

It is illegal to import Giant African land snails These threaten buildings 500 types of local plants and carry meningitis

Endemic species in Florida include the Florida Scrub Jay Miami blue Okaloosa darter and Key Deer

Florida is a popular destination for birdwatching because of the many species that can be found in the state at various times of the year The Florida Ornithological Society maintains the official state list of the birds of Florida which currently contains 498 species A study published in 2003 by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission documented 196 species of birds which were confirmed to breed in the state with an additional 19 species listed as possible or probable breeders The Great Florida Birding Trail a 2000 mile long trail is composed of 489 locations throughout the state which are excellent observation sites 

Sport fishing is also popular in Florida over 250 different species of fishes can be found in Florida There are more than 1000 species of fish in Floridas inshore waters

In 2010 NOAA citing the Magnuson Stevens Act banned fishing of red snapper until the population has time to recover

Floridas Atlantic coast is home to the only extensive coral reefs in the continental United States and the third largest in the world The entire reef system in the Florida Keys is part of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and large parts of reef are protected as part of Biscayne National Park

In 1977 the federal government placed alligators on the endangered species list They were removed from the endangered list in 1987 and Florida allowed selective hunting in 1988

In 1987 Brevard County Florida hosted the last member of the Dusky Seaside Sparrow now extinct There have been only two extinct bird species since listing of endangered species began in 1973 This event has presented a challenge to ensure that other environmental concerns are addressed quickly

The Florida Scrub Jay has been thought to be threatened for many years because the species is territorial and cannot move to better grounds when its habitat is in danger

Nesting beaches of loggerhead sea turtles are protected

Micronations are countries started by one or a group of people which is not noticed by the United Nations These countries are mostly used in peoples heads or on the internet 

People make micronations for lots of reasons Some are to show they do not like their main country or if they want to make money or to use it as a place for themselves

Here is a list of some Micronations

Some micronations play in competitions

The biggest football organisation for micronations is known as the MFA founded by Joe Foxon in 2009 It has 13 micronations from 7 countries as members It makes a competition every 4 years called the MFA World Cup for all the micronations in the world to play in The first World Cup will be in Southern England in 2013

Every year there is a chess competition for micronations to play in It is played on the computer and in the first year 3 micronations took part

Every year there is a singing competition called the MicroVision Song Contest Micronations make a song and put it on the internet and then other micronations vote for the best song The winner then makes the next one

Mixed oxide fuel is nuclear fuel that contains an oxide of more than one element Most nuclear fuel that is not of the MOX type only contains uranium dioxide In most cases the additional oxide will be plutonium dioxide sometimes thorium dioxide Any reactor that uses uranium based fuel will produce plutonium dioxide Mox fuel consists of about 93 uranium and about 7 of thorium or plutonium dioxide

One of the benefits of using MOX type fuel is that the plutonium dioxide that is produced can be re used for energy generation Certain types of nuclear power plants need plutonium to work properly

The Principality of Hutt River previously known as the Hutt River Province is the oldest micronation in Australia The principality claims to be an independent sovereign state It is unrecognized except by other micronations but got de facto legal status on 21 April 1972

The principality is located convert517kmmi north of Perth near the town of Northampton 

The principality was founded on 21 April 1970 by Leonard George Casley when he and his friends proclaimed their secession from the state of Western Australia

The Principality of Hutt River was created in 1969 as a province by the name of Hutt River Province in response to a dispute with the government of Western Australia over what the Casley family considered draconian wheat production quotas The Casley farm had around convert4000haacre of wheat ready to harvest when the quotas were issued which allowed Casley to sell only 1647 bushels or approximately convert40haacre Initially the five families who owned farms in Hutt River banded together to fight the quota and Casley lodged a protest with the Governor of Western Australia Sir Douglas Kendrew The Governor replied no rectification of our Quota would be allowed which as he acts as the Queens representative made Her Majesty technically liable in TortcnreasonGenerally the Monarch isnt liable Ever The Crown might be but thats differentdateMarch 2011 for applying an unlawful imposition as the quota had not yet been passed into law Casley then lodged a claim under the Law of Tort for 52 million in the belief the claim would force a revision of the quota Two weeks later the government introduced a bill into Parliament to resume their rural lands under compulsory acquisition After approaches to the government to reconsider the acquisition bill failed Casley and his associates resorted to a British law which they felt allowed them to secede and declare their independence from the Commonwealth of Australia Casley states that he nonetheless remains loyal to Queen Elizabeth II Casley was elected administrator of the new sovereign state by his family

The government of Western Australia determined it could do nothing without the intervention of the Commonwealth The Governor General of Australia Sir Paul Hasluck later stated that it was unconstitutional for the Commonwealth to intervene in the secession In letters with the governor generals office Casley was called the Administrator of the Hutt River Province by mistake The Royal Prerogative makes this recognition binding on all courts After the government threatened him with prosecution Casley styled himself His Royal Highness Prince Leonard I of Hutt to take advantage of a Commonwealth law that a monarch could not only not be charged but that anyone who interfered with his duties could be charged with treason Although the law in this matter has since changed the Australian government has not taken any action against Hutt River since the declaration Under Australian law the government had two years to respond to Casleys declaration the failure to respond gave the province de facto legal status on 21 April 1972

In 1976 Australia Post refused to handle Hutt River mail forcing mail to be redirected via Canada Following repeated demands by the Australian Taxation Office for the payment of taxes on 2 December 1977 the province officially declared war on Australia Prince Leonard notified authorities of the cessation of hostilities several days later The mail service was restored and tax requests ceased Hutt River citizens are now classed by the ATO as non residents of Australia for income tax purposes thus income earned within the province is exempt from Australian taxation The province levies its own income tax of 05 on financial transactions by foreign companies registered in the province and personal accounts

While the principality does not pay taxes the Australian governments current official position is that it is nothing more than a private enterprise operating under a business name

In the early 1980s Hutt River Province declared itself to be a kingdom but soon after reverted to its original status of a principality The principality proceeded to release a number of its own stamps and coins

In September 2006 Prince Leonard decided to change the name to Principality of Hutt River and dropped the word Province

The Principality of Hutt River is situated convert517kmmi north of Perth along the Hutt River It is about convert75km2acrelkon in size 

Exports include wildflowers agricultural produce stamps and coins Tourism is also important to its economy with 40000 tourists visiting the principality every year

Very few people live in Hutt River but the principality claims a world wide citizenry of 13000

The Principality has no standing army but a number of its citizens have been awarded military commissions Honorary guardsmen attend the prince on formal occasions and despite being completely landlocked naval commissions have been conferred on supporters of the principality

The principalitys capital Nain is named after Nain in Galilee

When the Principality of Hutt River seceded a bill of rights a brief document outlining the rights of Hutt River citizens was drafted It also provided for an administration board to govern the principality until a permanent government could be set up When Casley declared himself a prince the administration board was abolished and the Hutt River Principality became a benevolent absolute monarchy with a legislation committee to draft new legislation In 1997 the legislation committee presented a proposal for a constitution to the prince and his cabinet Its most recent version is ffective from 1 January 2011  All citizens over 18 living in the principality have the right to elect the parliament

His Royal Highness Prince Leonard I of Hutt is the style that has been used by Leonard George Casley since his creation of the Hutt River Principality Prince Leonard is married to Her Royal Highness Princess Shirley of Hutt Dame of the Rose of Sharon They have seven adult children among them is Crown Prince Ian who is the Prime Minister of the Principality and is Prince Leonards heir apparent

Prince Ian is involved heavily in the wildflower production with the product not only being exported to Perth Western Australia but to many cities internationally

Princess Shirley plays host to the many dignitaries and diplomatic representativesCitation neededdateJuly 2010 visiting the principality each year as well as receiving many of the television crews and magazine journalists She is also royal patron and chairwoman on the board of directors of the Red Cross of Hutt

In the royal family there are 24 grandchildren and 23 great grand children in the direct line

Prince Leonard pursued a number of occupations before purchasing a large wheat farm near Northampton Western Australia and Geraldton Western Australia in the 1960s A former mathematician and physicist who worked for NASA in the 1950s the prince has had a star named in his honour

Despite his advancing years the prince Leonard is known as a keen minded bush lawyer He is also an adherent of hermeticism a subject on which he has privately published a number of research papers and books

A set of low denomination banknotes was introduced in 1974 The first Hutt River coins were not issued until 1976 

The currency of the Hutt River Province Principality is the Hutt River Dollar which is divided into 100 cents The Hutt River Dollar is tied at a one to one ratio with the Australian dollar

There were four denominations 5 10 20 and 50 These were issued between 1976 and 1978 but the 1978 issue was a proof only issue There was also a silver 30 coin and a gold 100 coin struck only in proof

In 1977 1 coins were struck to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II These coins are known as holey dollarsCitation neededdateJuly 2010 a nickname which is applied to the extremely rare New South Wales 5 coin and the Prince Edward Island 5 coin which were cut and counterstamped from Spanish American Pieces of Eight

Coins of the same design were struck again in 1978 without the inscription Queenss Jubilee

Most of the coins of later series have specific commemorative topics and are usually made of precious metal The issuance of coins went on until 2000 and resumed with new issues beginning in 2007 to celebrate the 60th wedding anniversary of the Prince and Princess

The Australian Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates Jeremy Bruer upon hearing that an office claiming to represent the Hutt River Province was operating in Dubai and allegedly selling travel documents stated that the Australian Government did not recognise the Hutt River Province legally or in any other way

He further stated that The area of land which is described as the Hutt River Province is a privately owned wheat growing property on the Hutt River north of Geraldton in the State of Western Australia It has no special status It has no separate sovereignty and remains subject to the Australian Constitution and the laws of Australia

Regarding the use of titles the ambassador said that The Australian Government does not recognise the royal titles nor titles of office such as Head of State State minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs assumed by the family owning the property nor the use of terms such as consulates and principality in relation to the Hutt River Province

However the Hutt River Province argues that it is an independent entity within the Australian legal system and the Commonwealth has no right to dispute the claimed de facto legality it was given in error by the Governor Generals office and its own failure to respond to the claim To overturn this de facto recognition the West Australian Governor Generals office would have to submit the secession to arbitration something which the Hutt River Province claims is not done due to legal uncertainty related to the fact that Western Australia in its entirety was never officially proclaimed as British Territory

Although passports issued by the Hutt River Province are not legally recognised by the Australian Government they have been accepted on a case by case basis for overseas travel

In 2010 Brendon Grylls the Western Australian Minister for Regional Development and Lands was asked if his state had a position on the province He replied Only that Prince Leonard is an enigmaThere is nothing currently on my agenda as Ministerthat relates to that

On the whole Australian Government departments do not interfere with Hutt River Province While the Australian Taxation Office has issued a warning on its website for the public not to purchase companies from the PHR it has not acted against the principality The principality had plans to start a university in its territory which is illegal within AustraliaCitation neededdateJuly 2010 However the government authorities did not act against PHR Similarly the PHR does not pay taxes to the ATO

In 2008 the Council of the European Union issued a memorandum identifying Hutt River passports among known fantasy passportsissued by private organisations and individuals to which a visa should not be affixed

Bitcoin is a digital currency It was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto It is also the name of the open source software he designed that uses it and the peer to peer network that it forms

Unlike most currencies bitcoin does not rely on a central issuer like a bank or government Bitcoin uses a distributed database across a peer to peer computer network to record transactions and uses cryptography to provide basic security functions such as ensuring that bitcoins can only be spent once and only by the person who owns them

Bitcoins design allows for anonymous ownership and transfers of value Bitcoins can be saved on a personal computer in the form of a wallet file or kept with a third party wallet service and in either case Bitcoins can be sent over the Internet to anyone with a Bitcoin address Bitcoins peer to peer topology and lack of central administration make it impossible for any government or other authority to change the value of bitcoins or induce inflation by producing more of them

The Rhynie chert is an Lower Devonian sedimentary deposit part of the Old Red Sandstone It has extraordinary fossil details and is a Lagersttte 

The chert is exposed near the village of Rhynie Aberdeenshire Scotland A second unit the Windyfield chert is located some 700 m away

The Rhynie chert contains exceptionally preserved plant fungus lichen and animal material preserved in place by an overlying volcanic deposit The bulk of the fossil bed consists of primitive plants along with arthropods lichens algae and fungi

This fossil bed is remarkable for two reasons First the age of the site formed about 410 million years ago This places it at an early stage in the colonisation of land

Second these cherts are famous for their exceptional state of preservation with individual cell walls easily visible in polished specimens Stomata have been counted and lignin remnants detected in the plant material The book lungs of some early spiders can be seen in cross sections Fungal hyphae can be seen entering plant material acting as decomposers and mycorrhizal symbionts

The oldest known insect which resembles the modern springtails was found in the Rhynie chert pushing dates for the origination of insects back to the Silurian period

The chert was discovered by William Mackie while mapping the western margin of the Rhynie basin in 19101913 

Since 1980 the chert has been examined by the Mnster group and from 1987 by Aberdeen University They showed the chert was indeed produced by a hot spring setting Cores were drilled in 1988 and 1997

The chert was formed when silica rich water from volcanic springs rose and rapidly petrified the early terrestrial ecosystem in situ Organisms are petrified that way by hot springs today although that quality of preservation has not been found in recent deposits Hot springs with temperatures between convert90to120CF0 were active the water had probably cooled to under convert30CF0abbron before it reached the fossilised organisms The deposits are interbedded with sands shales and tuffs which speaks of local volcanic activity Deposition was very rapid

The texture of the silica formed is like that found today in freshwater streams at Yellowstone National Park They are typically alkaline and tepid convert20to28CF0 

Living vegetation covered around 55 of the land area with litter covering 30 and the remaining 15 of the ground being bare

Mazon Creek is a lagersttte in northeast Illinois It is a site of exceptional fossil preservation from the Pennsylvanian sub period of the Carboniferous about 300 million years ago

The area was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997 

The sites greatest find is the oldest known beetle

The sediments were laid in a gigantic tropical estuary a river delta with shifting channels and mud and sand bars Much of the continent was then covered by a great internal epeiric sea which sometimes swept over the area and then withdrew

Coal measures are formed like this A low lying tropical swamp or rain forest forms a peat swamp which is short of oxygen Dead plant material builds up and does not decompose entirely The plant material gets buried as a peat bog From time to time rivers bring down a load of sediment from nearby mountains covering the swamp Eventually layers of coal alternate with layers of sandy deposit Pressure turns it all into hard rock Later on the rocks are uncovered by erosion and fossils can be found by humans

The huge growth of vegetation at this time produced coal measures and the fossils were found in concretions in the spoil heaps of coal mines The concretions are caused by iron carbonate FeCO3 which makes the parcel of mud and organic material into hard balls

Fossil specimens have been found which belong to these groups of plants and animals

Makaton is a set of simple sign language and black and white symbols which are used alongside simple talk Makaton is a sign language that is free to teach other people but it is also sold taught guarded and checked up on by the business which started it Makaton started with simple ordinary English and British Sign Language hand signs the pictures were added later It is now used all over the world and changed for the country it is used in It uses the same hand signs as the sign language of the country it is used in but not in the same way For example in Britain Makaton hand signing is mostly made from BSL but the signs are used in a different order alongside the simple spoken words 

Makaton is mainly taught to children and adults with special needs in speech and language with or without hearing problems by teachers teaching assistants and childcare practitioners carers or caregivers such as parents grandparents foster carers other friends and family and specialist clinicians such as speech and language therapists Makaton is also popular to use with babies  baby signing

In British television Justin Fletcher uses Makaton signing in Something Special a series of television programmes aimed at children with special needs shown on CBeebies It was also used by Dave Benson Phillips while telling nursery rhymes on BBC childrens television years earlier than this 

In schools and nursery schools and childcare as well as at home Makaton signs and symbols are often used alongside other ways of talking and showing like photographs and PECS which are drawn colour pictures of parts of a routine like washing hands eating a snack or using the toilet This way of using different ways of showing routines and making requests for people with communication problems is sometimes called total communication

Cladocera is an order of small crustaceans commonly called water fleas Around 620 species have been recognised so far with many more undescribed 

They are everywhere in inland aquatic habitats but rare in the oceans Most are convert02 60mm2abbron long with a down turned head and a carapace covering the thorax and abdomen There is a single median compound eye They swim with jerking flea like movements 

Most species show cyclical parthenogenesis where asexual reproduction is occasionally supplemented by sexual reproduction The sexual reproduction produces resting eggs that allow the species to survive harsh conditions and disperse to distant habitats

The Old Red Sandstone is a dark red sandstone laid down in the Devonian period over a large part of the northern continent of Laurussia 

Laurussia which is often called the Old Red Continent included much of northern Europe Greenland and North America It was at the time between 0o and 30o south of the equator

The Old Red Sandstone was first discovered in Great Britain and it played a big part in early geology The term Old Red Sandstone was first used in 1821 by Scottish naturalist and mineralogist Robert Jameson

In 1787 James Hutton saw what is now known as Huttons Unconformity at Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders

Later on the Berwickshire coast he found Siccar Point There was a beautiful picture of this junction washed bare by the sea where 345 million year old Devonian Old Red Sandstone overlies 425 million year old Silurian greywacke

The unconformity represents a gap in the record of geological time During this time the rocks were raised above sea level and erosion took place Folding and faulting occurred as the Caledonian mountains were formed when a section of northwestern Europe collided with a continental plate made up of parts of present day North America and Greenland The lower strata tilted almost vertical 

The ORS rocks were deposited in a series of low lying terrestrial basins with lakes and rivers These basins were between ranges of the Caledonian mountains The ORS was laid down in this non marine terrestrial environment Thick deposits of sand and mud 11000 metres deep often stained red by oxidized iron minerals collected as the basins sank down

The ORS was laid down over a long period of time from the Uppermost Silurian to the Lower Carboniferous 418355 million years ago

The ORS is a rock formation which varies from place to place as the circumstances at the time must have varied

The dark red colour of these rocks comes from iron oxide However not all the Old Red Sandstone is red or sandstone the sequence also includes conglomerates mudstones siltstones and thin limestones and colours can range from grey and green through red to purple 

These deposits got sediment from the erosion of the Caledonian Mountain chain This was built by the collision of the former continents to make the Old Red Sandstone Continent This sequence is known as the Caledonian Orogeny

Marie Eugne Franois Thomas Dubois was a Dutch paleoanthropologist He earned worldwide fame for his discovery of Pithecanthropus erectus or Java Man Although hominid fossils had been found and studied before Dubois was the first anthropologist to embark upon a purposeful search for them

Between 1887 and 1895 Dubois searched at potential sites near rivers and in caves first on the island of Sumatra then on the Indonesian island of Java

In 1891 Dubois discovered remains of what he described as a species in between humans and apes He called his finds Pithecanthropus erectus or Java Man Today they are classified as Homo erectus These were the first specimens of early hominid remains to be found outside of Africa or Europe 

In 1895 Dubois returned to Europe and toured the continent to convince his colleagues that he had indeed found a missing link Although most anthropologists were intrigued they did not always agree with Dubois interpretations After that Dubois refused others access to his fossils until he was forced to do so in 1923

The Treaty of Good Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation Between the Peoples Republic of China and the Russian Federation is a treaty outlining a twenty year cooperation between China and Russia It was signed by the leaders of the two world powers Jiang Zemin and Vladimir Putin on July 16 2001

The treaty describes actions that should be taken by the two countries to establish for peaceful relations and economic cooperation as well as diplomatic and political reliance Article 9 of the treaty has started controversy because it may be viewed as a defense pact meaning if one of the two countries becomes involved in a war the other country must help them Additionally articles A7 and A16 point at increasing military cooperation including the sharing of military know how namely Chinese access to Russian military technology

The treaty also describes a mutual cooperative approach to environmental technology regulations and energy conservation and toward international finance and trade The document affirms Russias stand on Taiwan as an inalienable part of China and highlights the commitment to ensure the national unity and territorial integrity in the two countries

Analysts have pointed out several different reasons for the FCT mostly involving benefits for both China and Russia

Both China and Russia fear the United States becoming involved in areas which they believe should only be affected by their respective spheres of national influences and interests for China this largely involves Taiwan serving as a US client state while for Russia it involves having various former Soviet Republics as US client states Many of these do not border either country though Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan border China and Kazakhstan borders both

The United States Japan and the European Union are three economic powers which have a skilled workforce and access to capital Russia and China can more effectively compete against these powers in the world economy if Russia has access to Chinese capital and China has access to Russian training and technology

Roman Caucasian Albania was the area of actual Azerbaijan under the Roman empire control with the name Caucasian Albania in the first four centuries after Christ

Rome controlled Caucasian Albania only as a Vassal State but was never able to fully dominate it as a part of the Roman Empire like a Province

This influence started in the first century before Christ and lasted until around 250 AD 

In these centuries Rome brought Christianity to the Caucasian Albanians with a western cultural influence that has lasted until contemporary Azerbaijan Indeed even if few Azerbaijanis are Christians today the alphabet they use is the Roman alphabet

A second and last influence came from the Eastern Roman empire when emperor Heraclius was able to take control of Caucasian Albania in 627 AD with help from the Gokturks of the Western Turkic Khaganate in the Third Perso Turkic War

There was an enduring relation of Caucasian Albania with Ancient Rome

Indeed in 65 BC the Roman general Pompey who had just subjugated Armenia and Iberia and had conquered Colchis entered Albania at the head of his army Crossing the arid province of Cambysenrecently seized from the Armenians by the Albanianshe turned in the direction of the Caspian Sea 

In fording the Alazan river he clashed with the forces of Oroezes king of Albania and eventually defeated them Pompey ensured the control of Albanians nearly reaching the Caspian sea before returning to Anatolia 

But the Albanians influenced by the Parthian Empire were not slow to revolt against Rome in 36 BC Mark Antony found himself obliged to send one of his lieutenants to bring an end to their rebellion Zober who was then king of Albania capitulated and Albania thus became at least in name a Roman protectorate starting a condition of vassalage that lasted for nearly three centuries 

A king of Albania appears in the list of dynasties whose ambassadors were received by Augustus 

In 35 AD King Pharasmanes of Iberia and his brother Mithridates with the support of Rome confronted the Parthians in Armenia the Albanians proved effective allies contributing to the defeat and temporary eviction of the Parthians 

Emperor Nero prepared in 67 AD a military expedition in the Caucasus he wanted to defeat the barbarian Alans and conquer for Rome all the northern shores of the Black sea from actual Georgia Azerbaijan to what is now Romania Moldavia but his death stopped it 

Successively Vespasian was determined to restore and reinforce the full authority of Rome in the Caucasus as far as the Caspian 

The presence of a detachment of the Legio XII Fulminata at a distance of some kilometers from the shores of that sea is attested by an inscription drawn up between 83 and 96 AD in the reign of Domitian 

In 75 AD XII Fulminata was in Caucasus where Emperor Vespasian had sent the legion to support the allied kingdoms of Iberia and Albania 

Indeed in Azerbaijan an inscription has been found which reads IMP DOMITIANO CAESARE AVG GERMANICO LVCIVS IVLIVS MAXIMVS LEGIONIS XII FVL Under imperator Domitian Caesar Augustus Germanicus Lucius Julius Maximus Legio XII Fulminata 

Some historians argue that the actual settlement of Ramana near Baku was possibly founded by the Roman troops of Lucius Julius Maximus from Legio XII Fulminata in the first century AD and derives its name from the Latin Romana 

Among the facts that strengthen this hypothesis are the military topoghraphical map of Caucasus published in 1903 by Russian Administration which spells name of town as Romana various Roman artefacts found in the Absheron region and also old inhabitants referring to the town as Romani 

Additionally Ramana is positioned in an area perfectly suited for a Roman castrum to control nearby Baku s port on the commercial sea route between the Caucasus and the Central Asia plains

Despite the growth of Roman influence Albania never ceased to remain in commercial and probably also cultural contact with Persia but with Trajan in 114 AD Roman control over Caucasian Albania was nearly complete with top social levels fully romanized QuoteThe Princes also of the Caucasian tribes the Albani the Iberieven those of the trans Caucasian Sarmatae were confirmed in the relation of vassallage or now subjected to it

During the reign of Roman emperor Hadrian Albania was invaded by the Alans an Iranian nomadic group 

This invasion promoted an alliance between Rome and the Albanians that was reinforced under Antoninus Pius in 140 AD Sassanians occupied the area around 240 Ad but after a few years the Roman Empire regained control of Caucasian Albania

Indeed in 297 AD the treaty of Nisibis stipulated the reestablishment of the Roman protectorate over Caucasian Iberia and Caucasian Albania But fifty years later Rome lost the area that since then remained an integral part of the Sassanian Empire for more than two centuries

In the late sixth century the territory of Albania became again an arena of wars between Sassanian Persia and the ByzantineEastern Roman Empire During the third Perso Turkic War the Khazars invaded Albania and their leader Ziebel declared himself Lord of Albania in 627 AD under the Roman Heraclius rule levying a tax on merchants and the fishermen of the Kura and Araxes rivers which was in accordance with the land survey of the kingdom of Persia The Albanian kings retained their rule by paying tribute to the regional powers 

Caucasian Albania was later conquered by the Arabs in 643 AD during the Islamic conquest of Persia

Rome has left a huge cultural legacy to actual Azerbaijan not only the Latin alphabet and the western oriented society of contemporary Azerbaijanis but even  like in Armenia and Georgia  the Christian faith 

Indeed Christianity started to enter Caucasian Albania according to Movses Kaghankatvatsi as early as during the 1st century exactly when Romans imposed their initial control on Albania The first Christian church in the region was built by St Eliseus a disciple of Thaddeus of Edessa at a place called Gis and is believed to be the modern day Church of Kish 

After Armenia under Roman influence adopted Christianity as its state religion the Caucasian Albanian king Urnayr went to the See of the Armenian Apostolic Church to receive baptism from St Gregory the Illuminator the first Patriarch of Armenia 

Christianity reached its golden age in the late fifth century under Vachagan the Pious who launched a campaign  influenced by Byzantine priests  against idol worship in Caucasian Albania and discouraged Persian Zoroastrianism

After the Moslem invasions of the seventh century the original Christians have nearly disappeared from actual Azerbaijan 

The only remaining Caucasian Albanians are the Udi people who maintain the Christian faith of their Roman influenced ancestors The last 7000 Udi live mostly in the village of Nij of the region of Kabala and Oguz but a few can be found in the capital Baku

Dudley was born on November 2 1859 Dudley was a slave born into slavery his parents were owned by Edward B Dudley the Governor of North Carolina from 1836 to 1841 The governor had a great impact on Dudley One of the governors thoughts was that all people need to be educated Dudley kept these ideas in mind and they affected everything he did for the rest of his life

Most of the schools in the area were closed after the American Civil War because there was not enough money Dudley was not able to go to school until 1867 when a private school opened Dudley was one of the first students to enroll Dudley later went to public schools when they opened in his area and learned Latin After going to public school Dudley attended the Institute for Colored Youth in Philadelphia Pennsylvania For college Dudley attended Shaw College in Raleigh North Carolina During his education he focused on learning to become an teacher In 1880 at age 21 Dudley took the North Carolina state test needed to become a teacher and passed Later he attended Harvard summer school and gained an Master of Arts from Livingstone College and a doctorate degree from Wilberforce University

In 1895 the North Carolina Legislature appointed Dudley to the Board of Trustees for the College Later that year he was made secretary of the Board he was was secretary until 1896 when the President John O Crosby resigned The next meeting of the Board of Trustees Dudley was voted by all of the members to become the 2nd President of the College While he served as President Dudley focused on making the information taught more relevant He believed that it was best to aim what was taught towards jobs that were currently available He wanted to give the men and women who attended his college to be able to get jobs and raise the standard of living among their people he expanded the curriculum to include carpentry wood turning bricklaying blacksmithing animal husbandry horticulture and floriculture mattress and broom making shoe making poultry raising tailoring electrical engineering and domestic science Along with adding these specific classes Dudley also added an entire teaching department to the school that taught pupils to be a teacher while placing special emphasis on courtesy manners and an appreciation to culture in general Dudley himself was praised for his politeness He also added a summer school program to the college

In 1915 1916 the school changed its name to Agricultural and Technical College The change was because the college did not have enough money Dudley decided that the best way to fix all of the problems faced by the college was to change everything The college did not have enough money because there were not enough students to support it The problem was because many people wanted a professional or classical education Especially many parents wished their sons to become preachers lawyers teachers or physicians Trying to solve this problem Dudley started offering a course study suited to the ability and needs of students Another one of the problems was that many opposed the fact that both men and women were taught together student body As a result when the school reopened it was an all male school

Dudleys career ended while he was principal at the college In early April Dudley left the college due to sudden severe headaches to go home and rest For several days Dudley was able to attend to his duties from his home until he died on April 4 1925 at the age of 65 Dudley was buried in the Pine Forest cemetery on the northern end of 16th street in Wilmington his home town

A formation or rock formation is the fundamental unit of lithostratigraphy 

A formation consists of a certain number of rock strata They have similar lithology sedimentary facies or other properties Formations are not defined on the thickness of the rock strata and the thickness of different formations can therefore vary widely

The concept of formally defined layers or strata is central to stratigraphy A formation can be divided into members and are themselves packed together in groups

Formations were initially described as time markers based on relative ages and the law of superposition The divisions of the Earth historygeologic time scale were the formations described and put in chronological order by the geologists and stratigraphers of the 18th and 19th centuries 

Rock formations are formed by sedimentary deposition in environments which may persist for hundreds of millions of years For example the Hammersley Basin in Pilbara Western Australia is a Proterozoic sedimentary basin where up to 1200 million years of sedimentation is preserved intact Here up to 300 million years is represented by a single unit of banded iron formation and shale

Motrhead is often credited as the first band to inventplay speed metal Some of speed metals earlier influences include Deep Purples Fireball and Queens Stone Cold Crazy from their 1974 album Sheer Heart Attack and Deep Purples song Highway Star from their album Machine Head The latter was called early speed metal by Robb Reiner of speed metal band Anvil Led Zeppelins Communication Breakdown first released in January 1969 could also be said to be an early template for speed metal as mentioned in Mac Randalls

Speed metal eventually evolved into thrash metal Although many tend to equate the two subgenres there is a distinct difference between them In his book Sound of the Beast The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal Ian Christe states that thrash metal relies more on long wrenching rhythmic breaks while speed metal is a cleaner and more musically intricate subcategory still loyal to the dueling melodies of classic metal

Colonel Sir Arthur Edwin Young KBE CMG CVO KStJ KPM was a British police officer He was Commissioner of Police of the City of London from 1950 to 1971 and was also the first head of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to be called the Chief Constable instead of Inspector General Young helped create the post of Chief Inspector of Constabulary 

In the early 1950s he played a crucial role in policing decolonisation in the British Empire and developedg a model of public service policing that was not liked by everyone in some colonies but which time has shown to have been a good idea During the 1960s he led the way in modernising British police recruitment and in improving the training of senior officers

Young was born in Eastleigh Hampshire the third of four children of Edwin Young a builder and contractor and his wife Gertrude Mary He went to school in Southsea from 1912 to 1915 and then Portsmouth Grammar School from 1915 to 1924 He was not very good at school but liked the Officers Training Corps later he returned to present prizes and told the pupils that his parents would have been very surprised to see him in the hall on speech day because he had never come close to winning any school award

Aged sixteen he left to join the Portsmouth Borough Police against his familys wishes His mother and grandmother never approved because they thought the police an unsuitable career for a young man from an middle class family When his maternal aunt Emma Brown married Superintendent Samuel Bowles of the Hampshire Constabulary she made him resign

Youngs fathers business partner Alderman Sir John Henry Corke helped Young get his first job in the Chief Constables office in December 1924 On the advice of Thomas Davies the Chief Constable he first took a course in business and accountancy

Made a Constable in May 1925 he became the Coroners Officer in April 1932 In June 1932 aged 25 he became the youngest Detective Sergeant in the United Kingdom serving with the Northern Division CID While he was there he led investigations into murder blackmail fraud and arson He headed the enquiries into the UKs first case of manslaughter arising from the use of an aeroplane 

At the same time he got more involved in the many royal visits to Portsmouth When Haile Selassie visited the dockyard in September 1937 he acted as his personal escort and French interpreter During these years Young was also entrusted with what he later called enquiries concerning the activities of subversive persons and propaganda and also with other matters affecting state security  looking for spies It was also during these years that he acquired his passion for ever better police equipment and his personal love of new gadgets

Young was promoted to Inspector in June 1937 and appointed to Portsmouths Southern Division In Eastney and Southsea he first had to deal with the problems created by traffic including ways for its efficient control and of the need to promote road safety Young was a keen motorist who moved from a motorcycle to a series of fast cars

Young was qualifiedor promotion but for someone who did not graduate the Hendon Police College and did not go to a public school his promotion over the next dozen years was meteoric for the 1930s and 1940s 

Young wanted to head his own force and tried to become chief constable of the Isle of Wight Constabulary before he became Acting Chief Constable of Leamington Spa Borough Police in September 1938 aged 31 at a salary of 500 per annum One year later he was appointed to the permanent post of Chief Constable He was one of the youngest men ever to become a Chief Constable In his first nine months in Leamington he persuaded the council to hire an extra twelve officers the first increase since 1915 This meant he had 57 police officers to cover all of Leamington Spa 

He also reorganised the boroughs fire brigade and among other police innovations set up twelve of police pillars a network of two way microphone handsets across the borough so that the public could contact police stations and civil defence posts directly The base of the pillar contained first aid equipment while a Leamington innovation a flashing red light on the top called up policemen on patrol

From November 1940 he was seconded by the Home Office for six months to Coventry after its blitz He ran the citys police because the Chief Constable was fully occupied as Civil Defence Controller Young started the good neighbour scheme for bombed out civilians that he had trialled in Leamington and which was later adopted nationally by the Home Office

Leamingtons was a very small force and for a year his command was only acting so from the start Young was looking for a permanent as well as a larger command After several unsuccessful applications in September 1941 he was selected from a short list of six as Senior Assistant Chief Constable of Birmingham City Police then the second largest police force in the UK the salary was 1000 pa He was to be responsible for training and communications  both things he was good at

In Birmingham he started to experiment with police training Learning by example and by demonstration is common now but in 1941 it was a new idea and it caught the approving eye of the Home Office He also made Birmingham the foremost British force in the use of police wireless by establishing in 1942 a duplex ultra high frequency two way radio telephone system linking every police station and every police car

In February 1943 Young was one of the chief constables sent to the War Office Civil Affairs Training Centre for the first course for senior officers Before the course was finished he was transferred to the instructing staff and in June 1943 he was appointed the first commandant of the new Police Civil Affairs Training Centre at Peel House in London He had to set up the training school for policemen and provost officers who would keep law and order in Axis territory as it was liberated by advancing Allied forces Just after the centre was opened and its first students through their course Young was made a Colonel and moved from the classroom in July 1943 to be Senior British Police Officer in the Mediterranean Theatre stationed in North Africa awaiting the invasion of Sicily

Young went ashore on day two of the invasion and became Director of Public Safety in the first functioning Allied military government  the Allied Control Commission for Italy in December 1943 he was given the additional role of Director of Security responsible directly to the Commander in Chief for hunting saboteurs and enemy agents as well as the removal of fascist officials from public offices In Italy Young commanded not just British officers but the 120000 men of the entire Italian police and had responsibility for all Italian prisons fire brigades and civil defence The models Young developed in Italy were later applied across Allied occupied Europe in 19441945 but his proudest achievement was the restoration and reorganisation of the Carabinieri with whom he maintained an association for the rest of his life He also fell in love with Italy returning regularly and frequently holidaying in Positano and visiting his wartime friend Colonel Alfredo Freddy Zanchino of the Carabinieri

Young became Chief Constable of Hertfordshire Constabulary in 1944 He was in charge of 515 officers at a salary of 1290 Still aged only 38 he had twenty one years of experience of small medium and large city and borough forces From Hertfordshire he set the pace in revitalising county police forces pushing his police authority to spend a lot of money to improve officers pay and conditions 

Police housing was one of the outstanding issues of the time Young persuaded his police authority to fund a building programme so that in six years every married man in the county force would have a police house the design and equipping of these houses was agreed between the county architects and a housing committee recruited through the county Police Federation not only of men of all ranks but at Youngs insistence of officers wives In 1946 he wrote

He also persuaded his authority to buy new equipment because he wanted a modern efficient police force The Home Office allowed Hertfordshire to be the first force after the war to introduce a wireless system  Young adapted from his Birmingham model for rural use To make it as effective as possible the Home Office accepted his idea that the wireless network cover more than one county so the neighbouring county force of Bedfordshire was added 

Almost at the same time Young was appointed by the Home Office to a committee chaired by Sir Percy Sillitoe Chief Constable of Kent to see if all forces needed wireless networks

His time at Hertfordshire also saw the start of a professional relationship with James Callaghan They already knew each other from Portsmouth where their mothers had both worked at Agnes Westons Sailors Rest Callaghan had tried unsuccessfully to court Youngs sister Eileen Callaghan was now a junior minister at the Ministry of Transport They met up with each other again on a road safety committee and became working allies to extend speed restrictions and improve road markings cats eyes were perhaps the most significant fruit of their labours They worked together again when Callaghan was Home Secretary and it was Callaghan who selected Young to go to Ulster in 1969 to implement the Hunt Report

Hertfordshire showed that Young wanted to be a chief police officer who made things happen He applied unsuccessfully to be chief constable of Kent in 1946 but his next job was offered to him So impressed was Home Secretary James Chuter Ede he appointed Young to the vacant post of Assistant Commissioner D of the Metropolitan Police in London in charge of organisation recruitment training and communications To bring in an outsider to such a rank in the Met was unprecedented The Home Secretary knew that the nations police forces were stuck to old ways and needed the shake up that the young chief constable had already delivered in Hertfordshire Scotland Yard must not be left out Things however did not go well The Commissioner Sir Harold Scott tolerated him but senior colleagues cold shouldered him Within D Department Young delivered all the Home Secretary had hoped for a success that only alienated the hierarchy even further

In March 1950 Young became the first former constable to be appointed Commissioner of Police of the City of London He built up his reputation as the policemans policeman Improved pay and conditions and professional standards remained his constant pre occupations The police under his command found him forceful but gracious intolerant of failings in himself as well as others In all his forces he was popular with all ranks under his command

Young came to love the City of London He relished command of a force small enough to know every constable well He enjoyed the Citys rich social life too and he much valued the invitation to join the Goldsmiths Company The police needed to recruit and with considerable success he set about making service more attractive Pay and allowances were increased housing modernised and catering improved Uniforms were made more comfortable and practical 

At another level he pushed through changes in career structures He engineered a national recruitment revolution in the British police running command courses and seeing through a fast track entry scheme to attract graduates  and for many years he was director of extended interviews for the Senior Command Course that he had founded These and other changes were designed to make possible the promotion of talented people Young realised that the police could no longer rely on habits little changed for a century He fought for the recruitment and promotion of women He resisted the well ingrained tradition of bringing senior officers from the armed forces into police commands and only with great reluctance did he give in to the demand from the Hertfordshire police committee that he use his wartime military rank He sternly opposed Lord Trenchards officer class way of thinking as wholly inappropriate for the British police service He wanted to follow Sir Robert Peels intention that the police be filled from the bottom up The young man whose own family had thought that being a policeman was far from suitable dedicated his own long career to making the police a respected and attractive profession

Youngs lobby of the 1960 Royal Commission on the Police overcame Home Office objections to a strengthened police inspectorate although Sir Charles Cunningham blocked Youngs selection as inaugural first Chief Inspector of Constabulary

In November 1969 Young was seconded to be the last Inspector General and the first Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary James Callaghan then Home Secretary sent him to carry out the Hunt Report which introduced the standard British rank system for police officers in Northern Ireland and disbanded the controversial Ulster Special Constabulary

He chaired the Police Council for the UK the Association of Chief Police Officers training centres committee and the education committee of the National Police Fund He was a governor of the Police College and of Atlantic College and a member of the committees of the Police Advisory Board the National Police Fund the Royal Humane Society the National Rifle Association the National Scout Council and the Thames Group Hospitals He was President of the Association of Chief Police Officers in 1962

One feature of Youngs career was as a police reformer in colonial hotspots He had four such missions

Young was brought up in a household with strong Anglican evangelical beliefs He also patrolled Portsmouths slums and docks as a young constable and this had an effect on Young Guided by his curate the Reverend Frederick Dillistone later Dean of Liverpool he decided that he must seek ordination The Bishop of Portsmouth Neville Lovett however rejected his application to attend theological college telling him at interview that policemen do not become priests Although later in life Young would drift away from regular worship the impact of Portsmouth on his world view never shifted Shocked by the poverty and injustice which he discovered Young became a staunch Christian socialist and very rare for a chief constable a life long Labour Party voter Throughout his career he sought out contact with clergymen and in the later 1960s encouraged by the Bishop of London again considered Anglican ordination

Young married three times On 11 April 1939 at Boarhunt parish church Hampshire he married Ivy Ada May Hammond a nurse from the Royal Portsmouth Hospital whom he had courted for years  custom then dictated lengthy enagements and police pay then was very low She died of cancer on 14 September 1956 They had one son Christopher John Young born in 1941

Young married Mrs Margaret Furnival Homan ne Dolphin in 1957 The marriage fell apart quickly and they separated She committed suicide in Malta in 1966

On 16 April 1970 he married Mrs Ileen Fryer Turner whom he had known since she was his police driver in Birmingham during the war and who at one time had been the mistress of his great friend Sir Edward Dodd Chief Constable of Birmingham and later Chief Inspector of Constabulary She died on 31 December 2002 In the 1980s she declined a proposal of marriage from Sir Graham Shillington Youngs successor as Chief Constable of the RUC

Youngs career made him the most decorated policeman of his era Young was awarded the Kings Police Medal in 1952 and was appointed Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1953 and Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1962 He was knighted in 1965 and appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1971

The Messel Pit is a disused quarry near the village of Messel Hesse about 35 km southeast of Frankfurt am Main Germany It is a special site where fine fossils are preserved a lagersttte

Bituminous shale was mined there Because of its fossils it has significant geological and scientific importance After almost becoming a landfill strong local resistance eventually stopped these plans The Messel Pit was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995 It was placed on the list solely due to fossils

Amateur collectors developed a transfer technique that enabled them to preserve the fine details of small fossils the method still used to preserve the fossils today 

Many of the known specimens from the site have come from amateur collectors and in 1996 an amnesty on previously collected fossils was put in effect in the hope of getting privately owned collections back into public ownership and available to science

The current surface of the Messel pit is roughly 60 m below the local land and is about 07 km in area The oil shale bed originally extended to a depth of 190 m 47 million years ago in the Eocene when the Messel deposits formed the area was 10 further south than it is now The period was after the PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum and the climate and ecology of the site were very different from today A large series of lakes surrounded by lush sub tropical forests supported an incredible diversity of life The Messel lake bed was probably a center point for drainage from nearby rivers and creeks The pit deposits were formed during the Eocene Epoch of the Paleogene Period about 47 million years ago based on dating of basalt fragments underlying fossilbearing strata 

Oil shale formed by the slow anoxic deposition of mud and dead vegetation on the lake bed is the primary rock at the site 

Its sediments extend 130 m downward and lie atop an older sandstone foundation The fossils within the shale show a remarkable clarity and preservation due to the unique depositional characteristics of the lake 

The upper stratifications of the lake had a variety of organisms but the bottom was subject to little disturbance by current so it had little oxygen This prevented many epifaunal and infaunal species from inhabiting this niche and thus bioturbation was kept at a minimum Overturn of the lake layers lowered oxygen content near the surface and led to a periodic die off of aquatic species Combined with a relatively low rate of deposition this provided a prime environment for the preservation of fauna and flora

The area around the Messel Pit was geologically and tectonically active during the Eocene Volcanic gas releases could account for the large deposition of non aquatic species 

Subsurface shifts released large concentrations of reactive gases into the lake and adjoining ecosystems killing susceptible organisms During these releases birds and bats might have fallen in if near the lake surface and terrestrials could be overwhelmed near the lake shore

The Messel Pit provides the best preserved evidence of early Eocene flora and fauna so far discovered Most other sites are lucky to contain partial skeletons but Messel boasts extensive preservation of structural integrity even going so far as to preserve the fur feathers and skin shadows of some species Unusual preservation has sparked some closely reasoned interpretations The symptomatic dumb bell shaped bite marks on either side of the leaf vein on a fossilised leaf have been identified as the death grip of a carpenter ant terminally parasitized by a fungus that apparently then as today took over its behaviour to release its spores at a good location it is the earliest clear example of fungal behavioural manipulation 

The diversity of species is no less astonishing A brief summary of some of the fossils found at the site follows

The lowest courts in the Isle of Man are the Summary Courts Coroner of Inquests Licensing Court Land Court etc These courts are presided over by magistrates There are two stipendiary magistrates the High Bailiff and the Deputy High Bailiff along with lay Justices of the Peace

The court on the next level is the High Court of Justice of the Isle of Man It has two parts the Civil Division and an appeal division called the Staff of Government Division

The judges of the High Court are the Deemsters and the Judicial Officers The Deemsters are appointed by The Queen on the advice of the Secretary of State for Justice of the United Kingdom The Judicial Officers are appointed by the Lieutenant Governor The High Bailiff and the Deputy High Bailiff are ex officio Judicial Officers and other Judicial Officers may be appointed Often they are appointed because they have special knowledge of a complex legal case

Civil matters are usually heard at first instance by a single Deemster sitting in the High Court Criminal proceedings are heard at first instance before either the High Bailiff or the Deputy High Bailiff or a bench of lay magistrates in less serious cases More serious criminal cases are heard before a Deemster sitting in the Court of General Gaol Delivery in a defended case the Deemster sits with a jury of seven

Civil and criminal appeals are dealt with by the Staff of Government Division Appeals are usually heard by a Deemster and the Judge of Appeal

Final appeal is to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom This dates back to an ancient right of the Manx to appeal to the Crown of England against the decisions of the Lord of Mann The right still exists even though the Lord of Mann is now the Crown of England The right was confirmed by the Privy Council in their decision of Christian v Corren in 1716 several years before revestment

In the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands the Queens Bench Division of the English High Court can hear appeals about habeas corpus This was to allow the king to find out why any of his subjects was being impisoned It dates from before the revestment applied to all the kings dominions even for all other cases the Kingss Bench was restricted to England

Lord of Mann is used on the Isle of Man as part of Queen Elizabeth IIs title The Lord of Mann was the islands feudal Lord Proprietor the Monarch of England was head of state 

The title is not used on its own Since 1399 the Kings and Lords of Mann were feudal subjects of the reigning King of England and then of Great Britain and the United Kingdom who was the ultimate sovereign of the island This right of Lord Proprietor was revested into the Crown when the Isle of Man was bought by the Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765 and stopped to exist separately However for reasons of culture and tradition the title Lord of Mann continues to be used For these reasons the correct formal usage as used on the Isle of Man for the Loyal Toast is The Queen Lord of Mann

The title is now Lord of Mann regardless of gender However during her reign Queen Victoria was styled as Lady of Mann

The formal Latin style is Dominus Manniae

In 1598 a succession dispute between the daughters of Ferdinando Stanley 5th Earl of Derby and Stanleys brother William Stanley was heard It was decided by the Privy Council that the right to the Isle of Man belonged solely to Queen Elizabeth I and the letters patent of 1405 which have conferred the Isle of Man to the Stanley family were declared null and void This was because Percy had not been subject to legal attainder despite his treason and the 1405 and 1406 letters patent had therefore not taken effect

The Queen in consideration of the many eminent services performed to herself and to her royal predecessors by the honourable and noble House of Stanley withdrew her right and referred the contending claimants to the decision of the Privy Council as to the best claim of inheritance

The Law Lords on the Privy Council decided the grant being by letters patent under the Great Seal of England such right would descend according to the Common Law of England to the heirs general and not to the heirs male and the island was therefore awarded to Ferdinandos daughters whereupon William agreed to purchase their several shares and interests

The original letters patent having been declared void the Parliament of England in 1609 under James I passed a Private Act of Parliament entitled An Act for assuring and establishing the Isle of Man in the name and blood of William Earl of Derby 7 Jac1 c4 which established the title in law as Lord of Mann The lordship was conferred by letters patent dated 7 July 1609 upon William Stanley 6th Earl of Derby Subsequent succession was under the terms of this grant

Following the resolution of the succession dispute it was ruled that the daughters of Ferdinando Stanley were the rightful heirs As the oldest of them would not reach the age of majority until 1609 two temporary Lords of Mann were appointed by James I using letters patent so that the daughters could benefit from the Islands revenues

Following the coming of age of the heirs to the Lordship of the Isle of Man the rights over the island were sold to their uncle William Stanley He took up the title of Lord of Mann following the passing of an Act of Parliament

In 1765 Charlotte Murray 8th Baroness Strange sold the suzerainty of the island to the British government for 70000 By the passage of the Isle of Man Purchase Act 1765 the title of Lord of Mann was revested into the British Crown It has therefore since been used on the Isle of Man to refer to the reigning Monarch of the United Kingdom

All remaining rights and property of the Dukes of Atholl on the island were sold to the British government in 1828

The Niko Jiken was a series of several events during the Russian Civil War They happened between February and March 1920 It ended with the killing of many Japanese people in Russia and most of the Russians living in the town Nikolayevsk on Amur Nikolayevsk on Amur is located in the far eastern section of Russia

In September 1918 the town held the people of Imperial Japanese Army which was part of the Siberian Intervention Early in February 1920 the town had about 450 people who were not in the Imperial Japanese Army There were also about 350 people who were part of the 14th division of the Imperial Japanese Army The Russian White Army also had about 300 members located in Nikolayevsk Roughly 15000 civilians also lived in Nikolayevsk In January 1920 the town had been surrounded by an army of four thousand controlled by Yakov Triapitsyn who was allied with the Red Army

On February 24 the commander of the Japanese Armys people in Nikolayevsk realized that there were too many foreign troops so he allowed Triapitsyns troops to enter the town under a flag of truce However Triapitsyn began rounding up all of his forces and deploying White Army supporters the only force cooperating the small Japanese garrison He then demanded that the Japanese garrison disarmremove all their weapons they are holding sure that the small Japanese force would not agree with his request

The Japanese then had an unexpected attack on 12 March However the attack was unsuccessful and most people in the Japanese Army died The few who survived did not stop the attack until they were ordered by the Japanese high command Triapitsyn decided to attack the remaining Japanese troops which helped capture the Japanese garrison and deaths of all but 122 Japanese non army members In all about 700 people died

Triapitsyn decided to terrorize and kill any civilians he felt were a danger to his forces The other way to execute those who he only injured was to stab them with a bayonet and throw them into a hole in the Amur River Using this method Triapitsyn and his army killed thousands of people in Nikolayevsk on Amur In late May as other Japanese people were coming to help Triapitsyn killed everyone living in Nikolayevsk on AmurJapanese or Russianand burned the town to the ground

The Japanese government protested to the Bolshevik government in Moscow demanding compensation for the execution of all the residents in Nikolayevsk on Amur The government of Russia responded by murdering Triapitsyn however the Japanese government felt that this didnt make up for what had happened Japan used this as an excuse to have it residents live in Sakhalin island where they remained till 1925

Soyuz is a spaceship used by RFSA It was used to carry people to and from the Salyut Space Station Mir Space Station and the International Space Station

The Soyuz spacecraft has three parts

The orbital module is also called the Habitation section It has all the equipment not needed for reentry such as experiments cameras and cargo It also contains a docking collar for docking to space stations It does not come back to earth

The reentry module is used for launch and the journey back to earth Half of it is covered in heat protection tiles It comes back to earth

The service module has solar panels It contains systems for temperature control electric power supply long range radio communications and radio telemetry It does not come back to earth

The Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster occurred when Space Shuttle Challenger broke up 73 seconds after liftoff All seven crew members were killed The cause of the explosion was a o ring failure in the right solid rocket booster During the flight hot gases escaped from the o ring causing it to break apart 

The Challengers engineers argued that the Challenger should not take off because the temperature was 31 F The O Rings could not seal right if the temperature was under 53 F However NASA commanders dismissed it and said that the backup O ring would latch perfectly However they were later proved wrong

Another problem was that the temperature had gotten so low that icicles were hanging from some parts of the Challenger 

At T66 the command was given to throttle up Michael J Smith responded with Roger that go to throttle up However at T72 the right SRB pulled away from the strut and attaching to the external tank Right then the Challenger had a burst of speed which may of been felt by the crew At T73 Smith said the last words Uh oh Smith may have been responding to the main engine recordings which later show that he knew about the problem just about 300 seconds before the breakup

Just a little time before the breakup Smith frantically switched many switches in a vital attempt to save them though it came too late as the shuttle broke in two

It remains unknown if the crew survived until it crashed or if they died when it exploded However the NASA report said that Dick Scobee was alive until he and the crew plunged into the ocean 

The Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts Manufactures and Commerce is a British multi disciplinary institution based in London It is often called the Royal Society of Arts instead of by its long formal name The front of the building uses the short name too see photograph It was founded in 1754 and was granted a Royal Charter in 1847 Notable members have included Benjamin Franklin Karl Marx Adam Smith William Hogarth John Diefenbaker Stephen Hawking and Charles Dickens

The RSA was set up to embolden enterprise enlarge science refine art improve our manufactures and extend our commerce but also to reduce poverty and secure full employment

The RSA was founded in 1754 by William Shipley as the Society for the Encouragement of Arts Manufactures and Commerce modelled on the Dublin Society for improving Husbandry Manufactures and other Useful Arts In 1774 it moved into a new building near the Strand in central London which had been purpose designed by the Adam Brothers as part of their Adelphi scheme The address was 8 John Street The RSA is still in there but it also occupies nearby buildings The original building includes the Great Room which features a magnificent sequence of paintings by Irish artist James Barry The progress of human knowledge and culture The first occupant of 18 Adam Street was the Adelphi Tavern which is mentioned in Dickenss The Pickwick Papers The former private dining room of the Tavern contains a magnificent Adam ceiling with painted roundels by the school of Kauffman and Zucchi

In its early years the Society offered prizes which it called premiums for people who could successfully achieve one of a number of published challenges Captain William Bligh suffered the Mutiny on the Bounty while attempting to win a premium for shipping breadfruit from the East to the West Indies He tried again and this time succeeded and the Society awarded him the prize The Society offered premiums for a very wide range of challenges including inventing new forms of machinery and agricultural improvements

The RSA hosted Britains first exhibition of contemporary art which was a big success As a result the Royal Academy of Arts was formed in 1768 by Sir Thomas Gainsborough and Sir Joshua Reynolds two early members of the RSA as a spin off organisation

It was granted a Royal Charter in 1847 In 1908 King Edward VII granted it the right to use the term Royal in its name

The National Training School for Music in London was founded by the Society in 1876 This was later succeeded by the Royal College of Music

The RSA is probably best known for creating the RSA Examinations Board now part of the separate OCR Board following the Societys launch of the modern worlds first public examinations in 1882

It devised a scheme for remembering the links between famous people and buildings by placing plaques on the walls these continue today as Blue Plaques which are administered by a range of government bodies The first of these plaques was in fact of red terracotta placed on the outside of a former home of Lord Byron The Society erected 36 plaques until in 1901 responsibility for them was transferred to the London County Council and later the Greater London Council and most recently English Heritage Similar schemes are now operated in all the constituent countries of the United Kingdom 

The Society was instrumental in the preservation of West Wycombe purchasing the entire village and handing it over the National Trust

In 1936 the RSA awarded the first distinctions of Royal Designers for Industry The honour gained royal endorsement in 1936 and The Faculty of Royal Designers for Industry was established as an association in 1937 to further excellence in design and its application to industrial purposes membership of the Faculty is automatic for all RDIs and HonRDIs The Faculty currently has 120 Royal Designers and 45 Honorary Royal Designers the number of designers who may hold the distinction of RDI at any one time is strictly limited The Faculty consists of the worlds leading practitioners from fields as disparate as engineering furniture fashion and textiles graphics theatre and film design Early members include Eric Gill Enid Marx Sir Frank Whittle and numerous other household names

An example of the Societys success is offered by the Oxford English Dictionary which records the first use of the word sustainability in an environmental sense in the RSAs Journal in 1980

The Society states that Fellows attach the letters FRSA after their name Membership of the fellowship is considered an honour

This was not however always the case According to Sutherland Lyall in 2003 the Royal Society of Arts used to ask you not to use the suffix FRSA because anybody who pays the modest fee becomes a Fellow Being elected a Fellow currently depends on having achieved a contribution to society in a cultural or arts related sphere

The organisation is Incorporated by Royal Charter is registered as a charity in England and has more than 27000 Fellows living in around 70 countries who support the aims of the society and who have achieved or who have the potential to achieve eminence in their profession or calling Its Patron is currently HM Queen Elizabeth II its President is HRH The Princess Royal its Chairman is Luke Johnson and its Chief Executive is Matthew Taylor

Each year a number of medals are awarded including the Albert Medal the Benjamin Franklin Medal and the Bicentenary Medal Medal winners include Nelson Mandela Sir Frank Whittle and Professor Stephen Hawking

In Great Britain and Ireland the RSA has offered some regional activities to encourage Fellows to interact with each other locally and to address local topics of interest The UK Regions are East of England East Midlands London North East North West Scotland South East South West Wales West West Midlands and Yorkshire Northern Ireland part of the UK is treated for historical reasons as a single all Ireland region Ireland that includes the Republic of Ireland The RSA also has a presence in Belgium and further afield in Australia India Southern Africa and the USA

The Society runs a free public events programme which seeks to introduce new and challenging thinking These are made freely available on its website after the event as mp3 audio files and videos Recent lecturers include Michael Sandel Nassim Nicholas Taleb Sir Ken Robinson Don Tapscott Alain de Botton Al Gore Anthony Grayling Zarine Kharas Amir Aczel and Chris Anderson

The choice of speaker for the recent annual Presidential lecture has been a matter of interest in the press Danish professor Bjrn Lomborg was chosen his latest book Cool It suggests that the imminent demise of polar bears is a myth As president of the RSA Prince Philips first choice of speaker was Ian Plimer professor of mineral geology at Adelaide University but this was rejected as too controversial as Plimer argues that the theory of Anthropogenic Global Warming is unproven 

On January 14 2010 the RSA in partnership with Arts Council England hosted a one day conference in London called State of the Arts A number of speakers from various dispclines from art to government gathered to talk about the state of the arts industry in the United Kingdom Notable speakers included Jeremy Hunt MP Secretary of State for Culture Media Sport and his counterpart Ben Bradshaw MP who was then the Secretary of State for Culture Media Sport Notably Jeremy Hunt stated that if the Conservative party won the next elections then government funding for the arts would be cut

The RSA House is also available to hire by external clients providing hospitality facilities for conferences dinners parties and weddings The stunning Vaults are of significant interest and provide a unique space for entertaining

In July 2008 the RSA became a sponsor of an academy in Tipton The RSA Academy which opened in September 2008 New buildings are currently under construction to designs by John McAslan and Partners

Current projects include Arts and Ecology Citizen Power Connected Communities Design and Society Education Public Services Social Brain and Technology in a Cold Climate

Past projects include delivering fresh drinking water to the developing world rethinking intellectual property from first principles to produce a Charter investigating schemes to manage international migration and exploring the feasibility of a UK wide personal carbon trading system It still promotes the practice of inclusive design and is working with artists to communicate ideas about environmental sustainability

documentation 

In firearms a magazine is a container that holds ammunition for a firearm An external magazine is snapped into the firearm which is called loading Sometimes the magazine is built into the gun instead of separate and cannot be easily taken out Taking an empty magazine out of a firearm and putting in a full one is known as reloading the gun but putting more bullets inside the magazine is known as reloading the magazine 

The most common type of magazine is a box magazine which holds the bullets in columns There are also other types of magazines such as drum and helix that hold more bullets that a normal box magazine

The most common type of ammo used with magazines is bullets Almost all modern guns that shoot bullets use magazines for loading ammo Some kinds of shotguns use shotgun shell magazines for faster reloading 

Most magazines use a spring inside to push the ammunition into the gun Magazines may be made out of metal or plastic Metal magazines are more common but plastic magazines can be partly see through so that the user can see how much ammo is left inside

A shotgun shell is the standard type of ammunition for a shotgun It is a cylinder which normally holds either lead shot or a shotgun slug made to be fired from the shotgun Shotgun shells are usually mostly plastic but have thin brass at the base though they can be made of solid brass paper or other combinations of these materials

A shotgun shells size is usually measured in gauge The most common size of shotgun shell is the 12 gauge When measuring gauge a smaller number means a larger shell a 12 gauge shell is larger than a 20 gauge shell

Besides lead shot and slugs which are designed to be lethal there are special less lethal types of shotgun shells which shoot things made to hurt but not kill people Less lethal shells are most often used by police These can be loaded with rubber shot or slugs beanbags and other things

The Royal Canadian Navy was the navy of Canada from 1911 to 1968 

From 4 May 1910 to 29 August 1911 the navy was known officially as the Naval Service of Canada and operationally as Canadian Naval Forces

During the early years of the 20th century there was a lot of talk in the British Empire as to the role the Dominions would play in defence and foreign affairs Because of the developing naval arms race with Germany a key part of this discussion focused on naval issues 

In Canada the naval debate came down to a choice between two options either the young country could provide funds support and manpower to the Royal Navy or it could form its own navy which could help support the Royal Navy if necessary After extensive political debates Canadian politicians chose to set up their own navy

The Royal Canadian Navy Served with the Royal Navy in World Wars I and II but during the Suez Crisis of the 1950s Canada and the United Kingdom had different political views Coupled with mutinies in 1949 partly linked to old British ways the Canadian government started looking at making sure the Canadian Navy had a very separate identity from the Royal Navy At first new flags were used and in 1968 the Royal Canadian Navy was abolished and made part of the Canadian Forces

Many civilizations over thousands of years have portrayed the constellation of Leo as a lion One theory for this is that the Sun was among its stars in Midsummer This was the time when the lions of the Egyptian desert left their usual home for the banks of the river Nile There they could find relief from the heat in the water The Roman writer Pliny the Elder wrote that the Egyptians worshipped the stars of Leo He says this is because the Nile would overflow with water at the same time as the Sun entering into the constellation 

In Egypt the Ramesseum at Thebes mentions Leo in the inscription on the wall On the planisphere of Dendera Leo is shown standing on an outstretched serpent 

The Persians called Leo Ser or Shir the Turks Artan the Syrians Aryo the Jewish Arye the Indians Simha all meaning a lion In Babylonian astronomy these stars were called URGULA  the Great Lion the bright star Regulus that stands at the Lions breast also had distinctly regal associations as it was known as the King Star

There are many variables that determine compatibility in astrology such as birth dates birth months personalities birth years times of birth position of a sign within the Sun the Moon Stars etc The signs listed as compatible are a general guideline and reference to compatibility The branch in astrology dealing with specific interpersonal compatibilities is called Synastry

In astronomy and navigation the celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of a very large unspecified size The sphere is concentric with the Earth This means that the celestial sphere and the earth have the same centre They also rotate upon the same axis All objects in the sky can be thought of as projected upon the celestial sphere This imaginary sphere is a very practical tool for positional astronomy

The equator divides the earth into the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere Similarly the celestial sphere is divided by projecting the equator into space This divides the sphere into the north celestial hemisphere and the south celestial hemisphere One can also locate the Celestial Tropic of Cancer Celestial Tropic of Capricorn North Celestial Pole and South Celestial Pole 

The Earth rotates from west to east around its axis once every 24 hours The celestial sphere and all objects on it appear to rotate from east to west around the celestial poles in the same time This is the diurnal motion This is why stars will rise in the east and set in the west On the next night a particular star will rise again but with our normal clocks running a 24 hour 0 minutes cycle it will do so 4 minutes earlier By the following night the difference will be 8 minutes and so forth with every following night

The reason for this is that the Sun does not stand still on the celestial sphere and the stars do The sun moves about 1 per day eastwards over a great circle known as the ecliptic As an angle of 1 corresponds to 4 minutes in time we need therefore 4 extra minutes of diurnal motion to see the Sun back on the same meridian again making the duration of one rotation just 24 hours exactly

Normal clocks therefore indicate solar time Astronomers studying the movements of stars may want clocks indicating sidereal time going around once in 23h56m

A celestial sphere can also refer to a physical model of the celestial sphere or celestial globe Such globes map the constellations on the outside of a sphere resulting in a mirror image of the constellations as seen from Earth The oldest surviving example of such an artefact is the globe of the Farnese Atlas sculpture a 2nd century copy of an older work

Capricornus is one of the constellations of the zodiac It is often called Capricorn especially when referring to the corresponding astrological sign Its name is Latin for horned male goat or goat horn and it is commonly represented in the form of a sea goat a mythical creature that is half goat half shark Its symbol is

Capricornus is one of the 88 modern constellations and was also one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy Under its modern boundaries it is bordered by Aquila Sagittarius Microscopium Piscis Austrinus and Aquarius The constellation is located in an area of sky called the Sea or Water consisting of many water related constellations such as Aquarius Pisces and Eridanus

Capricornus is the second faintest constellation in the zodiac after Cancer Its brighter stars are found on a triangle whose corners are 2 Capricorni Capricorni and Capricorni

Capricorn has several galaxies and clusters Messier 30 is a globular cluster located 1 degree south of the galaxy group NGC 7103 The constellation also harbors the wide spiral galaxy NGC 6907

Despite it being very faint Capricornus has one of the oldest mythological associations It has consistently been represented as a cross of a goat and a fish since the Middle Bronze Age The earliest picture of Capricornus is on a cylinder seal dating c 21st century BCE From the mid second Millennium it became a popular motif on boundary stones It was explicitly recorded in the Babylonian star catalogues as MULSUURMA The Goat Fish before 1000 BC The constellation was a symbol of Ea and in the Early Bronze Age marked the winter solstice

Because of the precession of the equinoxes the December solstice no longer takes place while the sun is in the constellation Capricornus The astrological sign called Capricorn now begins with the solstice The suns most southerly position is now called the Tropic of Capricorn This term also applies to the line on earth where the sun is directly overhead at noon on that solstice

The planet Neptune was discovered in this constellation by German astronomer Johann Galle near Deneb Algedi on September 23 1846 which is reasonable as Capricornus can be seen best at 400am in September

In Chinese astronomy constellation Capricornus lies in The Black Tortoise of the North

This constellation is sometimes identified as Amalthea the goat that suckled the infant Zeus after his mother Rhea saved him from being eaten by his father Cronos The goats broken horn was transformed into the cornucopia or horn of plenty Some ancient sources claim that this derives from the sun taking nourishment while in the constellation in preparation for its climb back northwardCitation neededdateDecember 2008 

However the constellation is more often depicted as a goat with a fishs tail One myth says that when the goat god Pan was attacked by the monster Typhon he dove into the Nile The parts above the water remained a goat but those under the water transformed into a fishCitation neededdateDecember 2008 

In Sumer the constellation was associated with the god Enki who brought culture out of the sea to humankindCitation neededdateJune 2009

As of 2002 the Sun appears in the constellation Capricornus from January 19 to February 15 In tropical astrology the Sun is considered to be in the sign Capricorn from December 22 to January 19 and in sidereal astrology from January 15 to February 15 

Ptolemys method of connecting the stars of Capricornus has been influential

H A Rey has suggested an alternative way to join the stars which graphically shows a goat The goats head is formed by the triangle of stars Cap Cap and Cap The goats horn sticks out with stars Cap and Cap Star Cap at the tip of the horn is of the third magnitude The goats tail consists of stars Cap and 2 Cap star Cap being of the third magnitude The goats hind foot consists of stars Cap and Cap Both of these stars are of the fourth magnitude

The creodonts are an extinct order of mammals that lived from the Paleocene to the Miocene epochs They shared a common ancestor with the Carnivora

The first creodont fossils were in the later Palaeocene 58 million years ago and the last 8 mya 

They were especially important in the Eocene and Oligocene of Africa Eurasia and North America In Oligocene Africa they were the dominant predatory group 

They competed with the Mesonychids and the Entelodonts and ultimately outlasted them 

Finally they lost ground to the true Carnivora who now occupy their ecological niches The creodonts lasted for a minimum of 50 million years

Creodonts show various adaptations to their carnivorous life style and show convergent evolution with modern carnivores They share for example the carnassial shear a modification of teeth that sliced meat like scissors

The Carnivora also developed larger brains and more efficient running Once forest and woodland was partly replaced by grassland in the Miocene the true carnivores had the advantage and the creodonts lost ground and eventually became extinct

Sindhis are a Sindhi speaking socio ethnic group of people originating from the Sindh province of Pakistan Today Sindhis that live in Pakistan belong to various religious denominations including Islam Zoroastrianism Hinduism Sikhism and Christianity The original inhabitants of ancient Sindh were believed to be aboriginal tribes speaking languages of the Indus Valley civilization around 3000 BC

In his book Kitab ul Hind the Persian scholar Ab Rayhn Brn declared that even before the advent of Islam into Sindh the Sindhi language was prevalent in Sindh

The Persian language influenced the formation of many modern languages of the Greater Middle East Central Asia and South Asian regions including Urdu 

Following the Turko Persian Mahmud of Ghaznis Ghaznavid conquest of South Asia a hybrid language of Turkish Arabic and Persian and local dialects began to form one that would eventually be known as Urdu This language was called Zaban e Ordu to distinguish it from Farsi the court language and was later shortened to just Urdu It grew from the interaction of Persian and Turkic speaking Muslim soldiers and the native peoples Under Persian influence from the state the Persian script and Nastaliq form of cursive writing was adopted with additional figures added to accommodate the Indic phonetic system The national anthem of Pakistan is highly Persianized

Urdu is a morpho syntaxgrammatically an Indic language written in the Perso Arabic script and contains literary conventions and specialised vocabulary largely from Persian Some grammatical elements peculiar to Persian such as the enclitic ezfe and the use of the takhallus were readily absorbed into Urdu literature both religious and secular

Despite the heavy influence of Persian on Urdu linguistically Urdu is not classified as an Iranian language but rather as an Indo Aryan language Urdu soon gained distinction in literary and cultural spheres because of the hybrid nature of the language Many distinctly Persian forms of literature such as Ghazal Qasida Marsia and Nazms caried over into Urdu literature producing a distinct melding of Iranian and South Asian heritages A famous cross over writer was Amir Khusro whose Persian and Urdu couplets are to this day read in South central Asia

A diagnosis is an accurate and precise account of the nature or cause of something 

Medical diagnosis is the best known field but diagnosis can be applied to any subject Whereas a doctor diagnoses what is wrong with a patient a motor mechanic can diagnose the fault in a car In all cases they replace a vague query such as My car wont start with an exact analysis such as Its out of petrol Notice the diagnosis is precise enough so the solution can be seen

These ideas work even in more subtle cases A boy brings an insect in a box to a natural history museum He asks an expert What is this The expert says You mean apart from it being a beetle When the boy nods the expert looks at the insect under a magnifying glass or a binocular microscope Chances are it is a common beetle and the expert can give the boy quite a lot of information about it 

But if it is not known to the expert a much longer study is needed Large reference books will be consulted trays of similar insects will be taken out of store to be compared A full diagnosis needs at least the genus and species If the species is unknown the detailed work of description is needed for publication

Mostly in biology the adjective diagnostic is used for any distinctive trait which places the specimen in a precise category For example A single bone making up the lower jaw is diagnostic of a mammal

Diagnostics is the name given to procedures which spell out what to do to find the diagnosis of a fault This term is used a lot in computer systems

Agoraphobia is a medical condition that causes anxiety The sufferers are afraid of large open spaces crowds and new places Doctors believe that people with the condition are afraid of becoming anxious Places that make them feel unsafe and increase their feelings of anxiety and panic They are afraid they might lose control and embarrass themselves They worry that they may not be able to get away or find help if they have a panic attack The word agoraphobia means fear of the market place People with agoraphobia believe that their home is the only safe place They try to avoid leaving home and may stay in the house for months or in some cases years In extreme cases they may only feel safe in one room

Agoraphobia is usually treated successfully with medication and behavior cognition therapy

Catastrophism is the idea that Earth has been affected in the past by sudden short lived violent events Catastrophes possibly worldwide in scope came between long periods of quiet inactivity This was called Catastrophism by William Whewell in 1837

Catastrophes were thought to be the main cause of the changes seen in the record of the rocks and fossils This record appeared to show that the Earth had suffered occasional gigantic upheavals in what was otherwise a quiet planet

Supporting this view was the greatest comparative anatomist and palaeontologist of the early 19th century He was Georges Cuvier Director of the Musum national dhistoire naturelle in Paris Cuvier had shown that extinction of species had definitely taken place His catastrophism was an explanation for the regular changes in species seen in the rock strata He had no real explanation of why later species were different from earlier ones He rejected the idea of evolution but did not propose a religious solution

 The opposition  James Huttons Theory of the Earth followed lated by Charles Lyells Principles of Geology painted a quite different picture

This was uniformitarianism also a word coined by Whewell Huttons basic idea was present day processes also worked in the past The Earths features had been shaped by same geological processes that could be observed in the present acting gradually over an immense period of time

Lyell developed these ideas and presented a huge number of observations which could only be explained by gradual action His book strongly influenced the young Charles Darwin who took the first volume with him on the Voyage of the Beagle and had the second volume sent ahead to Rio de Janeiro

The age of the Earth is another factor in the debate In the 19th century it was thought the Earth was perhaps 100 million years old Now we know it to be about 4560 million years old and that is definitely long enough for slow process to take effect

As a result for a long period from 1840 to 1980 virtually all geologists were uniformitarians believing the present is the key to the past

Finally it became clear that both slow processes and rapid disasters have played a part in Earth history

A major reason for this is the realisation that asteroid impacts and some other events have influenced Earth history

Walter and Luis Alvarez suggested in 1980 that a convert10kmmi asteroid struck Earth 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period 

The impact wiped out about 70 of all species including the dinosaurs leaving evidence of the KT extinction event In 1990 a convert180kmmi candidate crater marking the impact was identified at Chicxulub in the Yucatn Peninsula Mexico

The only debate now is whether the main extinction mechanism was the asteroid impact or widespread flood volcanism from the Deccan Traps Both mechanisms suggested are catastrophic in nature though only the asteroid impact was sudden

The observation of the Shoemaker Levy 9 cometary collision with Jupiter illustrated that catastrophic events do occur as natural events

The giant impact hypothesis is that the Moon was created out of the debris from a collision between the young Earth and a Mars sized protoplanet This is the favoured scientific hypothesis for the formation of the Moon

Crystallography is the study of the arrangement of atoms in solids 

Before the development of X ray diffraction crystallography the study of crystals was based on their geometry This involves measuring the angles of crystal faces and establishing the symmetry of the crystal in question 

Crystal structure is now found by analysis of the diffraction patterns of a sample targeted by a beam of some type

The technique was jointly invented by Sir Lawrence Bragg and his son Sir William Bragg who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1915 Lawrence Bragg is the youngest to become a Nobel Laureate He was the Director of the Cavendish Laboratory Cambridge University when the discovery of the structure of DNA was made by James D Watson and Francis Crick in February 1953  

X rays are most commonly used but for some purposes electrons or neutrons are used Because of the different forms of interaction the three types of radiation are suitable for different crystallographic studies

Some materials studied using crystallography proteins for example do not occur naturally as crystals Such molecules are placed in solution and allowed to crystallize over days weeks or months

Once a crystal is obtained data can be collected using a beam of radiation Although many universities have their own X ray equipment synchrotrons are often used as X ray sources They produce purer and more complete patterns Synchrotron sources also have a much higher intensity of X ray beams so data collection takes a fraction of the time normally necessary at weaker sources 

Producing an image from a diffraction pattern requires sophisticated mathematics

The mathematical methods for the analysis of diffraction data only apply to patterns which in turn result only when waves diffract from orderly arrays Hence crystallography applies for the most part only to crystals or to molecules which can be got to crystallize 

In spite of this a certain amount of molecular information can be deduced from the patterns that are generated by fibres and powders For example the double helical structure of DNA was deduced from an X ray diffraction pattern that had been got from a fibrous sample

Electron crystallography is a method to determine the arrangement of atoms in solids using a transmission electron microscope The method was invented by Aaron Klug who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this and his studies on virus structures and transfer RNA in 1982

The first electron crystallographic protein structure to achieve atomic resolution was bacteriorhodopsin in 1990

Crystallography is a tool that is often employed by materials scientists The understanding of crystal structures is needed to understand crystallographic defects 

A number of other physical properties are linked to crystallography For example the minerals in clay form small flat platelike structures Clay can be easily deformed because the platelike particles can slip along each other in the plane of the plates yet remain strongly connected in the direction perpendicular to the plates Such mechanisms can be studied by crystallographic texture measurements

Crystallography includes the symmetry patterns which can be formed by atoms in a crystal 

X ray crystallography was the primary method for determining the 3 D molecular structure of biological macromolecules The most important of these are enzymes and nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA In fact the double helix structure of DNA was worked out from crystallographic data 

The first crystal structure of a macromolecule was solved in 1958 The Protein Data Bank is a freely accessible repository for the structures of proteins and other biological macromolecules Computer programs can be used to help visualize biological molecular structures

X ray crystallography has now given way to electron crystallography for macromolecules which do not form large 3 D crystals

The Tea Party is an American populist political movement Most people say it is conservative and libertarian Members of the Tea Party are often called teabaggers

The Tea Party 

The name Tea Party comes from the Boston Tea Party a protest by colonists who objected to a British tax on tea in 1773 They demonstrated by dumping British tea taken from docked ships into the harbor Some say that the Tea in Tea Party also stands for Taxed Enough Already

The Tea Party movement has caucuses in the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States Many of the members of the Tea Party caucus were first elected in the 2010 midterm elections Some of them had never held any public office before

The Tea Party movement has no central leadership but is composed of a loose linking of national and local groups that decide their own platforms and agendas The Tea Party movement has been cited as an example of grassroots political activity although it has also been cited as an example of astroturfing

The Tea Partys most famous national figures include Republican politicians such as Sarah Palin Michele Bachmann and Dick Armey As of 2010 the Tea Party movement is not a national political party but has endorsed Republican candidates 

A Gallup poll shows almost 80 of Tea Partiers say they are Republicans Commentators including Gallup Editor in Chief Frank Newport have suggested that the movement is not a new political group but simply a rebranding of traditional Republican candidates and policies An October 2010 Washington Post canvass of local Tea Party organizers found 87 saying dissatisfaction with mainstream Republican Party leaders was an important factor in the support the group has received so far Though many are opposed to GOP leadership they are even more opposed to President Obama Some teabaggers believe that President Obama was not born in the United States Others believe that Obama is not really a Christian  

One of the main positions the Tea Party took was against the debt ceiling Many voted against any raising of the debt ceiling Others demanded large spending cuts and a balanced budget amendment to the US Constitution Due to the lack of agreement in Congress the US almost went into default 

Maurice Hugh Frederick Wilkins CBE FRS was a New Zealand born English physicist and molecular biologist

His research contributed to the understanding of phosphorescence isotope separation light microscopy and X ray crystallography 

He worked on the development of radar during World War II and was a member of the Manhattan Project 

He is best known for his work at Kings College London on the structure of DNA 

In recognition of this work he Francis Crick and James Watson were awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material His obituary provides extensive information on the topics mentioned here

Wilkins was the Assistant Director of the Biophysics Unit at Kings College and responsible for work on the structure of DNA Wilkins and a graduate student Raymond Gosling got the first X ray diffraction photos of DNA in 1950 He introduced Francis Crick to the importance of DNA and hired Rosemary Franklin on a three year grant Franklin made progress with the crystallography and produced some better photographs of the structure 

In 1953 Watson visited Kings and Crick got sight of a progress report This report included useful information from Franklin about features of DNA she had deduced from her X ray diffraction data

Watson and Crick published their proposed DNA double helix structure in a paper in the journal Nature in April 1953 In this paper Watson and Crick acknowledged that they had been stimulated by the unpublished results and ideas of Wilkins and Franklin

By this time Franklin was suffering from cancer of the ovary She died in 1958 which explains why she was not included in the 1962 Nobel Prize A controversy exists as to the relative contributions of her and Wilkins

Adolf Eichmann was an important member of the government of Nazi Germany during the Third Reich He organized the death camps like the Auschwitz concentration camp that were used to kill millions of people during World War 2 After the war he escaped and in 1960 was discovered to be living in Argentina The Israeli secret service the Mossad kidnapped him and took him back to Israel Eichmann was put on trial for the murder of six million Jewish people He was found guilty on 11 December 1961 and executed on 30 May 1962 His body was cremated and the ashes were scattered in the sea

The trial of Adolf Eichmann was broadcast on radio in Israel and millions of people around the world watched it on television This was the first time that victims of the Holocaust talked openly about what had happened This was an event that helped bring together and unify the many people who had come to live in the new nation of Israel

Gordon Allan Phat Wilson was a Canadian amateur ice hockey forward who won the Allan Cup three times as a member of the Port Arthur Bearcats Seen as one of the top amateur players of his time Wilson was added into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962

A native of Port Arthur Ontario Wilson did not even know how to skate when he joined the towns church league in 1914 Serving as a substitute he improved his skating enough that he earned a full time role on his team the following year and played two seasons of junior hockey before joining the Port Arthur War Veterans senior team at the age of 18

Wilson moved to Iroquois Falls Ontario for a season to play in the Northern Ontario Hockey Association in 192122 before returning to Port Arthur a year later to play for the Port Arthur Bearcats He was a top player in the NOHA leading Port Arthur to an Allan Cup championship in 1925 as Canadas national senior champions Wilson and the Bearcats repeated as champions the following year and won a third Allan Cup in 1929 Professional teams took note of his play teams from Calgary Edmonton and Toronto all offered him but he declined preferring to remain in his hometown

He was an outstanding offensive defenceman who won several scoring titles during his career He retired as a player in 1932 at the age of 37 and took on the dual role of coach and manager of the Bearcats In recognition of his career in Port Arthur Wilson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962 and the Northwestern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in its inaugural class of 1982

In addition to hockey Wilson played baseball and served as a volunteer and executive in both sports He was named the first president of Port Arthurs little league when it was founded in 1952 and helped found the communitys girls hockey league serving also as a coach and referee

Gamma ray bursts are flashes of gamma rays from extremely energetic explosions They have been seen in distant galaxies They are the most luminous electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe 

Bursts can last from milliseconds to several minutes although a typical burst lasts a few seconds The initial burst is usually followed by a longer lived afterglow emitted at longer wavelengths

Most GRBs are a narrow beam of intense radiation released during a supernova as a huge rapidly spinning star collapses to form a black hole A subclass of GRBs seem to come from a different process perhaps the merger of binary neutron stars

The sources of most GRBs are billions of light years away from Earth This suggests the explosions are extremely energetic a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the Sun will in its entire 10 billion year lifetime They are very rare 

All observed GRBs have come from outside the Milky Way galaxy Similar phenomena soft gamma repeater flares are associated with magnetars within the Milky Way It has been suggested that a gamma ray burst in the Milky Way could cause a mass extinction on Earth No such case is known

Gamma ray bursts were first observed in the late 1960s by the US Vela satellites which were built to detect gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear weapons tested in space 

On July 2 1967 at 1419 UTC the Vela 4 and Vela 3 satellites detected a flash of gamma radiation unlike any known nuclear weapons signature Uncertain what had happened but not considering the matter particularly urgent the team at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory filed the data away for investigation 

By analyzing the different arrival times of the bursts as detected by different satellites the team was able to determine rough estimates for the sky positions of sixteen bursts12 16 and definitively rule out a terrestrial or solar origin The discovery was published in 1973 Long GRB afterglow observations at high redshift also suggest GRBs originate in star forming regions This is because observing distant galaxies is to look back in time to galaxies at an earlier stage

Gamma ray bursts are thought to be highly focused explosions with most of the explosion energy in a narrow relativistic jet travelling at speeds over 99995 of the speed of light 

The approximate angular width of the jet can be estimated directly by observing jet breaks in afterglow light curves a time after which the slowly decaying afterglow begins to fade suddenly as the jet slows down and can no longer beam its radiation so effectively Observations suggest significant variation in the jet angle from between 2 and 20 degrees

Because their energy is strongly beamed the gamma rays emitted by most bursts miss the Earth and are never detected When a gamma ray burst is pointed towards Earth the focusing of its energy along a relatively narrow beam causes the burst to appear much brighter than it would have been were its energy emitted spherically When this effect is taken into account typical gamma ray bursts are observed to have a true energy release of about 1044 J or about 12000 of a Solar mass energy equivalent 

This is comparable to the energy released in a bright type Ibc supernova Very bright supernovae have been seen at the position of some of the nearest GRBs 

Philosophy of religion is thinking about questions in religion including whether God exists what God is whether religion is true and so on

It is different from theology because it tries to look at religion in a more neutral way instead of thinking about religion from the standpoint of a religion like Christianity or Islam

In philosophy of religion topics thought about include arguments for the existence of God the problem of evil theodicy divine attributes and the relationship between science and religion

Important philosophers of religion include Thomas Aquinas Augustine and Alvin Plantinga Philosophers of religion can be religious or non religious

The rough skinned newt is a North American newt known for its strong poison 

Juveniles live on land for four or five years after metamorphosis Adults are amphibious and live in water and on land Eggs are laid in water They can be found especially after there has been a lot of rain

Many newts make toxin in their skin to avoid predation but the rough skinned newt is especially poisonous Toxicity is generally experienced only if the newt feels threatened although sometimes skin irritation can be experienced after touching it 

The toxin that the rough skinned newt makes can either paralyze or kill someone Recently a drunk 29 year old man in Coos Bay Oregon died after swallowing a rough skinned newt for a dare

Throughout much of the newts range the common garter snake is resistant to the newts toxin In several populations these snakes successfully prey upon the newts Toxin resistant garter snakes are the only known animals today that can eat a T granulosa newt and survive

This is an example of co evolution The snakes resistance to the toxin has resulted in a selective pressure that favours newts which produce more potent levels of toxin Increases in newt toxicity then apply a selective pressure favouring snakes with mutations conferring even greater resistance 

This cycle of a predator and prey co evolving is sometimes called an evolutionary arms race In this case it results in the newts producing levels of toxin far in excess of what is needed to kill any other conceivable predator

Toxic animals usually warn predators that they are not good food Theres no point in being toxic unless it helps survival and reproduction The underside of these newts is vividly coloured a yellow orange When a threat appears the newt curls up its tail and lifts its head to show the warning colour This can be seen in photographs

 Location  Habitats of rough skinned newts are found throughout the west coast of the United States and British Columbia The southern range extends to California and the northern in Alaska

Mosaic evolution is the idea that evolutionary change takes place in some body parts or systems without simultaneous changes in other parts Another definition is the evolution of characters at various rates both within and between species408 Its place in evolutionary theory comes under long term trends or macroevolution

Evolution from a basal form to a derived form takes place in stages Modules change semi independently of each other They change at different times so producing a mosaic of primitive and derived traits

These changes play a leading role in major evolutionary transitions It may involve speciations producing a series of species only a few of which would be found as fossils

By its very nature the evidence for this idea comes mainly from palaeontology It is not claimed that this pattern is universal but there are now a wide range of examples from many different taxa Some examples

It has long been known that changes in the genes which control development cause changes in the final adult animal

Recent work shows how master control systems in development can organise selective changes in different parts of an organism This is what underlies mosaic evolution

Attachment is a special bond first developed in infancy It is the first relationship an infant experiences usually with its mother the birth mother or adoptive mother or any person who makes a commitment to nurture the infant on a long term basis 

Mammals including humans are social animals They are not hatched from eggs but are born alive and immature They all have a close relationship with their mother during a period of development in infancy This relationship is called attachment  

During the first stage of development the mother nurses the baby and the mother and infant stay physically close to each other unless the mother needs to leave to seek food While the mother is gone the infant remain hidden and quiet sometimes in a nest or den

Infancy is a crucial time of developmentof physical growth and of learning developing social skills to interact with others and learning life skills such as what to eat and how to respond when predators are near

Infancy is also a time of brain development In mammals only some behavior is hard wired in their brain as a fixed action pattern Much behavior is genetically determined only as potential behavioral systems that must be activated and developed These include 

With their increasing size of neocortex primates and especially humans have progressively more complex social behaviors Nursing is an integral part of this and serves four functions

If the infant is part of a litter it plays with its littermates if it is a single infant after the first stage of infancy it will begin peer play with other juveniles nearby close enough for the mother to quickly respond to any difficulty 

Nursing requires proximity proximity facilitates social interaction and social interaction is essential for survival Attachment exists to varying degrees among non human mammals it is greatly increased especially in humans In hunter gatherer and village agricultural societies the mother typically carried the baby or would leave it briefly with an allomothersomeone with whom the child will have a life long relationship such as a grandmother aunt or older sibling Only with the rise of civilization and wealth and especially within the last 60 years has this pattern of childraising embedded in our mammalian biology been significantly altered

Conclusions Infant attachment is a multipurpose behavioral system essential to social animals During infancy patterns of behavior are established on which other long term relationships are built Originating in the infants protection the primary purpose of attachment soon became to support brain development The establishment of homeostasis of physiological systems social and emotional development and learning are other functions Infant attachment is found to some degree in all mammals and is greatly expanded in humans Attachment is a behavioral system that is present at birth but that must be activated and developed

George Wells Beadle was an American geneticist

He won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Edward Tatum they shared the prize with Joshua Lederberg who worked with Tatum on bacterial genetics 

Beadle and Tatum discovered the role of genes in regulating biochemical synthesis in cells

Beadle and Tatums key experiments involved exposing the bread mould Neurospora crassa to x rays causing mutations In a series of experiments they showed that these mutations caused changes in specific enzymes involved in pathways making proteins They proposed a direct link between genes and enzymatic reactions known as the one gene one enzyme hypothesis

George Wells Beadle was born at Wahoo Nebraska on October 22 1903 He was the son of farmers his parents owned and operated a 40 acre farm 

George might himself have become a farmer if one of his teachers had not directed his mind towards science and the College of Agriculture at Lincoln Nebraska 

In 1926 after his degree he worked on hybrid wheat and Zea mays In 1931 he was awarded a National Research Council Fellowship at the California Institute of Technology at Pasadena where he remained from 1931 until 1936 During this period he continued his work on Indian corn and began in collaboration with Dobzhansky and Sturtevant work on crossing over in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster

In 1935 Beadle visited Paris for six months to work with Boris Ephrussi at the Institut de Biologie physico chimique Together they began the study of the development of eye pigment in Drosophila which later led to the work on the biochemistry of the genetics of the fungus Neurospora

In 1937 Beadle was appointed Professor of Biology at Stanford University and there he remained for nine years working for most of this period in collaboration with Tatum 

In 1946 he returned to the California Institute of Technology as Professor of Biology and Chairman of the Division of Biology Here he remained until January 1961 when he was elected Chancellor of the University of Chicago and in the autumn of the same year President of this University

George Beadle died on June 9 1989 

The work of Beadle Tatum was continued later by EB Lewis who worked on the way genes control the development of embryos and by Phillip Sharp Richard Roberts who discovered of introns and RNA splicing All three won Nobel Prizes for their work

In 1977 work by the Sharp and Roberts labs showed that genes of higher organisms are split or present in several distinct segments along the DNA molecule 

The coding regions of the gene are separated by non coding DNA that is not involved in protein expression The non coding regions the introns are cut from the precursor mRNAs in a process called splicing The split gene structure was found to be common to most eukaryotic genes For this reason one geneone enzyme does not hold in the simple way put forward by Beadle and Tatum This is because

However their work was a great step forward in its time

Committing homosexual acts is a considered a taboo vice in Pakistan and gay rights are close to non existent According to law homosexuality has been illegal in Pakistan since 1860 Unlike in neighboring India the law has yet to be repealed Due to the religious intolerance towards such acts the public tend to oppose homosexuality and other forms of alternative sexual orientation

Although Pakistan is officially an Islamic Republic in practice Pakistan is largely secular with mainly Anglo Saxon laws inherited from the British As a result of increasing liberalisation trends and increasing globalisation and social tolerance there have been many public gay parties taking place in the country and such parties have been thriving for a number of years

The Pakistan Constitution does not explicitly make mention of sexual orientation or gender identity It does contain certain provisions that may impact the constitutional rights of LGBT Pakistani citizens

In most South Asian nations a concept of third gender prevails where members of the same are referred to as neither man or a woman Pakistan is no different and has a vibrant culture of hijras They are sometimes referred to as transsexuals in English language publications Like transgender people in many countries they are sometimes the subjects of ridicule abuse and violence That said they enjoy a certain level of acceptance due to their position in precolonial Desi society For example they are welcome at weddings where they will dance as entertainment for the men and are also welcome among the women

Their presence in society is usually tolerated and are considered blessed in the Pakistani culture Most hijras are deemed to have been direct cultural descendants of the court eunuchs of the Mughal era Thought to be born with genital dysphoria and afraid that they might curse one their fate people listen to their needs give them alms and invite their presence at various events and functions eg birth of a child his circumcision or weddings This mysteriousness that shrouds their existence has born of the fact that the hijra communities live a very secretive life In 2004 it was reported that Lahore alone has 10000 active transvestites

Only the underground Green Party of Pakistan has endorsed the LGBT human rights movement and called for greater public openness about sexual orientation and gender identity issues No public organization club or society would be allowed to endorse LGBT human rights or even act as a social network for LGBT people in the Islamic State

Religious segregation is the idea that people should be separated based on their religion Certain laws of a country may only apply to one religious group As an example Sharia only applies to Muslims The term religious apartheid has also been used Apartheid was the term used to refer to racial segregation in South Africa Other examples for religious segregation are that in Iran certain students have been expelled from university because they were not Muslims but Bahai According to the Times Higher Education Bah are required to give up their faith in order to teach in Iranian universities Bah is not among the recognized recognized religious minorities in the Constitution of Iran The Bah faith is considered apostate in Iran because it believes in a prophet more recent than Muhammad This goes against Islamic teachings which teach the belief that Muhammad is the last and final messenger sent to mankind

Paraphyly is a term in cladistics It means a group which does not include all its descendents So Sauropsida without birds is paraphyletic since birds are definitely descended from archosaurs probably small theropod dinosaurs

Paraphyly is corrected to monophyly when the missing group are included So if birds are included in Sauropsida the larger group is then monophyletic Traditional classification is often paraphyletic

Polyphyly is a term in cladistics It describes a group of organisms whose last common ancestor is not a member of the group Polyphyly Greek for of many races 

More common in traditional taxonomy is to include all descendants without the group they evolved from This is done for convenience but it makes the mammals polyphyletic

Biological classification aims to group species together such that every group is descended from a single common ancestor A polyphyletic group can be fixed either by excluding clades or by adding the common ancestor

According to cladistics it should be the aim of classification to ensure that all groups are monophyletic However other taxonomists argue that there is a valid place for groups that are paraphyletic contain their most recent common ancestor but does not all the descendants of that ancestor

Dorudon was a genus of ancient cetacean that lived alongside Basilosaurus 41 to 33 million years ago in the Eocene They were about five meters long and were most likely carnivorous feeding on small fish and mollusks Prehistoric whales lived in warm seas around the world Fossils have been found in North America Egypt as well as Pakistan the eastern part of which bordered the ancient Tethys Sea

Moeritherium is a extinct genus of primitive mammals that represent a very early stage in the evolution of elephants These prehistoric mammals are related to the elephant and more distantly the sea cow They lived during the Eocene epoch and the early part of the Oligocene Epoch in northern Africa

A polemic is a forceful argument or controversy made against one opinion doctrine or person 

It is one sided and extreme not a debate or discussion It often occurs in disputes 

The word is derived from the Greek polemikos meaning warlike hostile 

Polemic journalism was common in continental Europe when libel laws were not as stringent 

To support study of the polemics and controversies of the 17th 19th centuries a British research project has placed thousands of pamphlets of that era online

A thesis is a document written in support of an academic degree or professional qualification It presents the authors research and findings It means the same as dissertation

The term dissertation can be used to describe an argument without relation to academic degrees The term thesis may also be used for the central claim of an essay or similar work

Originally the words dissertation and thesis had separate meanings When at ancient universities the professor had completed his lecture there would be a disputation During this students could take up certain points and argue them The position that one took during a disputation was the thesis while the dissertation was the line of reasoning with which one supported it

The word thesis comes from the Greek meaning position and refers to an intellectual proposition Dissertation comes from the Latin dissertti meaning discourse

The Jayhawks are an American alternative country and rock band from Minneapolis Minnesota They have released several studio albums The band formed in 1985 They did not work together between 2005 and 2009 but have reunited in 2010

The band formed with Mark Olson Gary Louris Marc Perlman and Norm Rogers 

Their first album The Jayhawks was released in 1986 Their music at the time mostly written by Olson showed a strong rootscountry rock influence It was released on the Bunkhouse Label a small independent label 

Blue Earth the second album was released in 1989 on the Twin Tone label Gary Louris shared more of the songwriting together with Olson for this album After touring the US in support of Blue Earth Spencer left the band He was replaced by Ken Callahan in 1988 who stayed with the band until 1993 

In 1991 Dave Ayers the president of Twin Tone was on a phone call with AR representative George Drakoulias from Def American while Blue Earth played in the background Drakoulias asked about the music and eventually met with and signed the band to the label later that year

In 1992 album Hollywood Town Hall was the first to be released on the major label Def American The album was produced by Drakoulias The album was a hit powered by the single Waiting for the Sun and it brought the Jayhawks more fans With Karen Grotberg on the keyboards and vocals the band toured a lot 

In 1995 they went into the studio to make Tomorrow the Green Grass It was released on the renamed American Recordings label Lead track Blue turned out to be a Top 40 hit in Canada The records production had been very expensive and the album did not to sell as was expected in the US Among the albums songs is Miss Williams Guitar a love song for Olsons then girlfriend singer songwriter Victoria Williams Drummer singer and songwriter Tim OReagan joined the band for the 1995 tour

By the end of 1995 Olson unexpectedly left the band to spend more time with Williams The band continued to record as The Jayhawks adding Kraig Johnson on guitar 

The album Sound of Lies was released in 1997 It has Gary Louris composing most of the songs The album mixed straight rock psychedelic elements acoustic elements and even some dub elements The album did not sound like the bands country influenced earlier work 

The 2000 album Smile was produced by Bob Ezrin It had more of a pop music feel which some fans did not like Though still a member through the recording of the album Grotberg left the band before the Smile tour and was replaced by Jen Gunderman The song Im Gonna Make You Love Me appeared in a Ralph Lauren commercial 

Rainy Day Music was stripped down and more acoustic It was generally seen as a return to their alt country roots The band now consisted of founding members Louris and Perlman along with drummer OReagan and touring band member ex Long Ryder Stephen McCarthy from Richmond VA McCarthy added pedal steel lap steel banjo guitar and backing vocals to the album and subsequent live shows This lineup toured in 2003 and early 2004

In addition to their studio albums the Jayhawks released Live From the Womens Club an all acoustic live recording of LourisPerlmanOReagan from 2002 It was sold only at concerts as an Official Jayhawks Bootleg 

Olson and Louris toured together in the winter of 2005 and spring of 2006 billed as From the Jayhawks An Evening with Mark Olson  Gary Louris Together Again Both old and new Jayhawks members progressed to solo efforts and side projects and the band as a whole was generally considered to be broken up and not expected to produce new material soon However the band members appear to keep in touch tour together in their other projects and have been known to reunite on occasion

In September 2008 the 1995 lineup of Louris Olson OReagan Grotberg and Perlman reunited for the Azkena Rock Festival in Vitoria Gasteiz Spain

In January 2009 Olson and Louris released an acoustic album titled Ready for the Flood

The Maya pyramids are structures built in the jungles of Central America by the Maya civilization between 200 and 900 CE Unlike the straight sides of the more commonly known Egyptian pyramids the sides of Maya pyramids are typically steppedsometimes for the purpose of enabling people to ascend to the top Moreover Egyptian pyramids have sharper tips while Mesoamerican pyramids tend to have flatter tops These flatter tops accommodate certain ceremonies such as sacrificial rituals and temples for gods

The pyramids served a variety of very important functions Apart from the religious ceremonies Maya pyramids were used as landmarks to aid in navigation In the jungle where these pyramids were built the pyramids were so tall that they could be seen above the trees Finally inside some of the pyramids there were burial chambers for the highest ranking officials just as in Egyptian pyramids

A whole complex of Maya pyramids can be found at the ruins of the ancient Maya city of Tikal The pyramids at Tikal were the tallest structures in all of the Americas for around 1500 years until 1903 when the Flatiron building was constructed in New York City There are a total of sixteen pyramids at Tikal which is now a national park in Guatemala 

Tikal was one of the largest urban centers of the pre Columbian Maya civilization Its population may have reached 90000 people which is surprising because the swampland at Tikal was unstable for habitation or agriculture It is located in the tropical rainforests of what is today northern Guatemala The name Tikal comes from ti akal which means water hole 

The pyramids at Tikal all face one another The rooms at the top of the pyramids have depressions in the walls which amplify sound and project it in all directions Because of this the normal speaking voice of a person at the top of one pyramid can be heard by someone standing at the top of another pyramid a great distance away

Edward Lawrie Tatum was an American geneticist 

He shared half of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1958 with George Beadle for showing that genes control individual steps in metabolism The other half of that years award went to Joshua Lederberg

Beadle and Tatums experiments exposed the bread mold Neurospora crassa to x rays causing mutations They showed the mutations caused changes in specific enzymes involved in metabolic pathways These experiments published in 1941 led them to propose a direct link between genes and enzymatic reactions known as the one gene one enzyme hypothesis

Tatum went on to study genetics in bacteria Tatum and his student Lederberg showed that Escherichia coli could share genetic information through recombination

Ed Tatum was born in Boulder Colorado He attended college at the University of Chicago and received his PhD in biochemistry from the University of WisconsinMadison in 1934 Starting in 1937 he worked at Stanford University where he began his collaboration with Beadle He then moved to Yale University in 1945 where he mentored Lederberg He returned to Stanford in 1948 and then joined the faculty of Rockefeller Institute in 1957 A heavy cigarette smoker he died in New York City of heart failure complicated by chronic emphysema

The Legend of the Aztec Flag explains the symbols on Flag of Mexico These symbols are the eagle and the snake After winning its independence from Spain in 1810 the newly created nation of Mexico whose capital was built on the ruins of Tenochtitlan adopted the symbol of the eagle and the snake to commemorate its Aztec heritage 

In the early 14th century the Mexica people were a wandering tribe of nomads looking for a permanent settlement in modern day central Mexico They survived by hunting and gathering and were often hired to fight as mercenaries for the city states scattered throughout the region According to legend their god Huitzilopochtli told them to establish a city of their own at a site where they would find an eagle eating a snake on the top of a cactus The legend relates that the people saw the eagle on a small swampy island in the middle of the shallow Texcoco lake The Mexica invented a resourceful system of gardening called chinampas which allowed them to grow small gardens eventually drying out the lake In 1325 they completed construction of a city there That city which they called Tenochtitlan became the capital of of the Aztec Empire which dominated central Mexico until its destruction by Spanish conquistadors led by Hernando Cortes

Franois Jacob is a French biologist He shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Jacques Monod and Andr Lwoff

Jacob with Jacques Monod discovered a fundamental control system in cells Enzyme levels in all cells is regulated by feedback on transcription

Like his colleague Monod Jacob was an almost lifelong atheist

In 1961 Jacob and Monod explored the idea that the control of enzyme expression levels in cells is a result of feedback on the transcription of DNA sequences 

For many years it had been known that bacterial and other cells could respond to external conditions by regulating levels of their key metabolic enzymes andor the activity of these enzymes 

For instance if a bacterium finds itself in a broth containing lactose rather than the simpler sugar glucose it must adapt itself to 

It was known that cells increase the enzymes for these steps when exposed to lactose 

With work on DNA it became clear that all proteins were being produced from their genetic code Jacob and Monod demonstrated that in the bacterium E coli there are specific proteins that repress the transcription of the DNA to its product RNA This reduces the production of thodr particular enzymes 

The lac repressor is a DNA binding protein which inhibits the expression of genes which code for lactase enzymes The repressor is active in the absence of lactose 

This repressor is made in all cells It binds directly to DNA at the genes it controls and physically prevents transcription When lactose becomes available it is converted into allolactose which inhibits the lac repressors DNA binding ability

In this way a robust feedback loop is constructed that allows the set of lactose digesting enzymes to be made only when they are needed

The regulation of gene activity has developed into a very large sub discipline of molecular biology There are many mechanisms and many levels of complexity Current researchers find regulatory events at every level of the processes that express genetic information In the relatively simple genome of bakers yeast 405 of its 6419 protein encoding genes are directly involved in transcriptional control compared to 1938 that are enzymes

Precocial in biology is a developmental strategy It refers to species in which the young are relatively mature and mobile from the moment of birth or hatching It applies mainly to mammals and birds 

The opposite developmental strategy is called altricial where the young are born or hatched helpless These two categories are at ends of a continuum All degrees exist in birds and mammals With the tiny eggs of invertebrates different strategies have evolved Many use some kind of metamorphosis in which different stages of growth occupy different environmental niches

A checklist is used to score a species between precocial and altricial In each case yes means precocial

The contrast between the two extremes is seen most clearly in birds Precocial species leave the nest shortly after birth or hatching Megapodes are a family of birds found in Australasia Their eggs are not incubated by the parents They are buried in compost covered with sand and left though the males test the temperature of the heap and make small adjustments The eggs which have a large yolk hatch with full wing feathers The hatchlings can run and purse prey and many species can fly on their first day These birds are super precocial

At the other extreme are the most intelligent birds the passerines and hawks owls and parrots

Mammals never feed themselves at first Mothers milk is part of the contract a mammal inherits But there is a big difference between some new born deer and antelopes which can run within an hour or so of birth and a baby marsupial which is in the pouch for days or weeks

Of advanced mammals human beings have a long period before they are independent This is partly because their brains have to grow and mature after birth and partly because humans depend more on learning and less on inherited behaviour compared to other mammals Mammalian carnivores take a long time to perfect their prey catching skills and some herd species like elephants also have to do a lot of learning

 Trade offs  Most accounts of the altricialprecocial differences point out that it is a trade off Altricial young require a great investment of parental time and care and are in constant danger of predation However that system permits a long period of supervised learning Also their brains grow more after birth fueled by rich food provided by parents

Precocial young require more pre birth preparation for larger eggs but they are less open to predation and take less parental care after birth Their brains are ready to go but end up smaller in relation to body size

Humans are rather a special case for a baby makes great demands on the parent both before and after birth With its hair and blue eyes and large head a baby looks precocial But few of the bits are working and a baby is completely helpless on its own The key fact is that the cerebral cortex is not yet working properly During the first 18 months the cortex is getting larger and getting into working order Then after about 18 months to two years the infant starts to learn language and from then on theres no stopping them

There is an interesting reason why the brain is not more advanced at birth It is that the babys head has to get through the female birth canal which is a space between the bones of the female pelvis Any larger and the babys head would not get through

There is a cost to the human method It greatly reduces the average number of offspring that any couple can raise

The X wing is a starfighter from the Star Wars fictional universe It is seen in the original trilogy movies and many books games toys and other things It is shown as a main starfighter for the Rebellion and later the New Republic

The X wing was first made for the movie Star Wars A New Hope by Industrial Light Magic Joe Johnston drew and Colin Cantwell made models that became the final X wing fighter in Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope ILM made miniatures in different sizes with wing markings showing which prop was for each pilot Each X wing model was built around a hollow core to hold parts for effects such as lighting

Besides the models the crew made one full size X wing for scenes in the Rebels Yavin IV base hangar they used editing and cardboard cutouts to make it seem as if there are dozens of fighters The crew also made a full size X wing cockpit that was used for all actors the astromech droid behind each actor was changed for each starfighter

ras an Uachtarin is the official home of the President of Ireland The name means House of the President in Irish It is located in the Phoenix Park on the northside of Dublin It used to be known as the Viceregal Lodge

The original house was designed by park ranger and amateur architect Nathaniel Clements in the mid eighteenth century It was bought by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland His official residence was in the Viceregal Apartments in Dublin Castle The house in the park then became the Viceregal Lodge the out of season residence of the Lord Lieutenant where he lived for most of the year from the 1820s onwards During the Social Season he lived in Dublin Castle

In 1882 the grounds around the house became the location for a famous murder Two men were stabbed to death with surgical knives while walking back to the residence from Dublin Castle They were the Lord Frederick Cavendish the British Cabinet minister with responsibility for Irish affairs and Thomas Henry Burke chief civil servant A small insurgent group called the Invincibles was responsible for the deed The Lord Lieutenant the 5th Earl Spencer heard the victims screams from a ground floor window in the drawing roomCitation neededdateMay 2010

In 1911 the house got a large extension for the visit of King George V and Queen Mary After the Irish Free State was established in 1922 it became the home of the Governor General of the Irish Free State until 1932 After that the new Governor General Domhnall Ua Buachalla personally leased a private mansion in the southside of Dublin

The house was left empty for some years until the office of President of Ireland was created in 1937 In 1938 the first President Douglas Hyde lived there temporarily while plans were made to build a new presidential palace on the grounds The outbreak of World War II saved the building which had been renamed ras an Uachtarin as plans were put on hold By 1945 it had become too closely identified with the presidency of Ireland to be demolished But because it had not been lived in a lot of work was needed to rebuild and improve it especially to the kitchens servants quarters and chapel 

The first President Douglas Hyde lived in the residential quarters on the first floor of the main building Later presidents moved to the new wing attached to the main house that had been built on for the visit of King George V in 1911 However in 1990 Mary Robinson moved back to the older main building The current occupant Mary McAleese lives in the 1911 wing

Beside it being the home of the president it has a few state rooms for official occasions ras an Uachtarin also houses the headquarters of the Garda Mounted Unit

Various visiting British kings and queens stayed at the Viceregal Lodge notably Queen Victoria and George V American presidents that visited include Presidents John F Kennedy Richard Nixon Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton who are all of Irish descent Other famous visitors to the ras an Uachtarin have been Princess Grace of Monaco and her husband Prince Rainier III King Baudouin of the Belgians King Juan Carlos and Queen Sophia Pope John Paul II Prince Charles and Prince Philip

Guests do not normally stay at ras an Uachtarin Although it has ninety two rooms many of these are used for storage of presidential files for household staff and official staff including military aides de camp a Secretary to the President and a press office In 2001 the Irish state opened a guest residence nearby in Farmleigh a former Guinness mansion

On 1 May 2004 during Irelands six month presidency of the European Union ras an Uachtarain was the Venue for the European Day of Welcomes in which ten new members joined the EU All 25 heads of government attended the flag raising ceremony in the gardens of the palace 

ras an Uachtarin is now open for free tours every Saturday

The Phoenix Park Murders were the fatal stabbings on 6 May 1882 in the Phoenix Park in Dublin Lord Frederick Cavendish and Thomas Henry Burke were killed Cavendish was the newly appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland and Burke was the Permanent Undersecretary the most senior Irish civil servant The assassination was carried out by members of the Irish National Invincibles

Cavendish and Burke were attacked as they walked through Phoenix Park to the Viceregal Lodge This was the out of season residence of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Thomas Myles surgeon at the nearby Dr Steevens Hospital was called to help the victims The Lord Lieutenant Lord Spencer described suddenly hearing screams before seeing a man running to the Lodge grounds shouting Lord Frederick Cavendish and Mr Burke are killed Responsibility for the political murders was claimed by a small until then unknown Republican organisation called the Irish National Invincibles

The hunt for the murderers was led by Superintendent John Mallon a Catholic who came from Armagh Mallon had a pretty good idea of who was involved He suspected a number of former Fenian activists A large number of suspects were arrested and kept in prison by claiming they were connected with other crimes Mallon got several of them to reveal what they knew about the murders

The Invincibles leader James Carey Michael Kavanagh and Joe Hanlon agreed to testify against the others Joe Brady Michael Fagan Thomas Caffrey Dan Curley and Tim Kelly were convicted of the murder They were hanged in Kilmainham Gaol in Dublin between 14 May and 4 June 1883 Others were sentenced to serve long prison terms

Irish politician Charles Stewart Parnell made a speech condemning the murders in 1882 This increased his popularity in both Britain and Ireland 

In March 1887 The Times printed letters that said they were written by Parnell The letters said that he agreed with the murderers of the English politicians and that his speech saying otherwise was not true It later came to light that the letters were not written by Parnell They were forgeries written by journalist Richard Pigott Parnell was personally shown to be innocent by the Parnell Commission in 1888 89

A garage is a place for storing cars There are many kinds of garages used for different things

A residential garage is a garage that is part of a house or similar building Some garages are directly connected to the house while others are separate and called a detached garage The garage will have a large garage door that opens to let cars in and out which is often opened by a motor

A parking garage is a large covered structure often made of concrete which is used for holding many cars Parking garages may have more than one level

An automobile repair shop may also be called a garage although it is for repairing cars rather than just storing them

The LuriaDelbrck experiment 1943 also called the Fluctuation Test asks the question are mutations independent of natural selection Or are they directed by the selection

Max Delbrck and Salvador Luria showed that in bacteria DNA mutations happen randomly This means they happen at any time rather than being a response to selection 

So Darwins theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms 

Delbrck and Luria won the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine partly for this work

In their experiment Luria and Delbrck grew bacteria in tubes After a period of growth they put equal volumes of these separate cultures onto agar containing phage If virus resistance were not due to random gene mutations then each plate should contain roughly the same number of resistant colonies This however was not what Delbrck and Luria found Instead the number of resistant colonies on each plate varied drastically

Luria and Delbrck proposed that these results could be explained by the occurrence of a constant rate of random mutations in each generation of bacteria growing in the initial culture tubes

The Screen Actors Guild is an American labor union representing over 200000 film and television principal performers and background performers worldwide According to SAGs Mission Statement the Guild was created to negotiate and enforce reasonable salaries benefits and working conditions for its performers collect compensation for exploitation of recorded performances by its members and provide protection against unauthorized use of those performances and preserve and expand work opportunities for its members

The Guild was founded in 1933 in an effort to end exploitation of actors in Hollywood who were being forced into oppressive multi year contracts with the major movie studios that did not include restrictions on work hours or minimum rest periods and often had clauses that automatically renewed at the studios discretion These contracts were notorious for allowing the studios to dictate the public and private lives of the performers who signed them and most did not have provisions to allow the performer to end the deal

In addition to its main offices in Hollywood SAG also maintains local branches in several major US cities including Atlanta Boston Chicago Dallas Denver Detroit Honolulu Houston Las Vegas Miami Nashville New York City Philadelphia Phoenix Portland Salt Lake City San Diego San Francisco Seattle and Washington DC

Since 1995 the guild has annually awarded the Screen Actors Guild Awards which are considered an indicator of success at the Academy Awards

A Screen Actors Guild Award is an award given by the Screen Actors Guild to recognize outstanding performances by its members The statuette given a nude male figure holding both a mask of comedy and a mask of tragedy is called The Actor It is 16 inches tall weighs over 12 pounds cast in solid bronze and produced by the American Fine Arts Foundry in Burbank California

SAG Awards have been one of the major awards events in Hollywood since 1995 Nominations for the awards come from 4200 randomly selected members of the union with the full membership available to vote for the winners The awards have been televised for the past several years on TNT but now also airs on TBS

The first SAG Awards aired live on February 25 1995 from Stage 12 Universal Studios The second SAG awards aired live from the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium while later awards have been held at the Shrine Exposition Center Bob Hope was given the first award

Machair or machar is a Gidhlig word used to describe a fertile low lying grassy plain found on some of the north west coastlines of Ireland and Scotland in particular the Outer Hebrides There are machairs in the Isle of Skye The Isle of Barra the Isle of Harris and all throughout the west coast and islands

Max Ludwig Henning Delbrck was a German American biophysicist and Nobel laureate

Delbrck was one of the most influential people in the movement of physical scientists into biology during the 20th century

Delbrcks big idea was to explore genetics by means of the bacteriophage viruses which infect bacteria This was important in the early development of molecular biology 

Delbrck was born in Berlin German Empire Trained as a physicist he got his PhD in 1930 he traveled through England Denmark and Switzerland He met Wolfgang Pauli and Niels Bohr who got him interested in biology

In 1937 he moved to the United States to pursue his interests in biology taking up research in the Biology Division at Caltech on genetics of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster While at Caltech Delbrck became acquainted with bacteria and their viruses 

Delbrck remained in the US during World War II teaching physics at Vanderbilt University in Nashville while pursuing his genetic research In 1942 he and Salvador Luria of Indiana University demonstrated that bacterial resistance to virus infection is caused by random mutation and not adaptive change This research known as the Luria Delbrck experiment was also significant for its use of mathematics to make quantitative predictions for the results to be expected from alternative models For that work they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1969 sharing it with Alfred Hershey 

During the 1940s Delbrck developed a course in bacteriophage genetics at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to encourage interest in the field In 1947 Delbrck returned to Caltech as a professor of biology where he remained until 1977

He won the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his pioneering work with Max Delbrck and Alfred Hershey on phages in molecular biology

Luria was born Salvatore Edoardo Luria in Turin Italy to an influential Italian Sephardic Jewish family He attended the medical school at the University of Turin There he met two other future Nobel laureates Rita Levi Montalcini and Renato Dulbecco 

In Rome he was introduced to Max Delbrcks theories on the gene as a molecule and began to formulate methods for testing genetic theory with bacteriophages which are viruses that infect bacteria

In 1938 he received a fellowship to study in the United States where he intended to work with Delbrck Soon after Luria received the award Benito Mussolinis fascist regime banned Jews from academic research fellowships 

Without funding sources for work in the US or Italy Luria left his home country for Paris France in 1938 As the Nazi German armies invaded France in 1940 Luria fled on bicycle to Marseilles where he received an immigration visa to the United States

Luria arrived in New York City on September 12 1940 and soon changed his first and middle names With the help of physicist Enrico Fermi whom he knew from his time at the University of Rome Luria received a fellowship at Columbia University He soon met Delbrck and Hershey and they collaborated on experiments at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and in Delbrcks lab at Vanderbilt University

His famous experiment with Delbrck in 1943 known as the Luria Delbrck experiment demonstrated that inheritance in bacteria follows Darwinian rather than Lamarckian principles and that mutant genes occurring randomly can still give viral resistance without the virus being present The idea that natural selection affects bacteria has profound consequences for example it explains how bacteria develop antibiotic resistance

From 1943 to 1950 he worked at Indiana University Bloomington His first graduate student was James D Watson who went on to discover the structure of DNA with Francis Crick In January 1947 Luria became a naturalized citizen of the United States

In 1950 Luria moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign While investigating how a culture of E coli was able to stop the production of phages Luria discovered that specific bacterial strains produce enzymes that cut DNA at certain sequences These enzymes became known as restriction enzymes and developed into one of the main molecular tools in molecular biology

The Maya calendar is a system of calendars and almanacs used in the Maya civilization of pre Columbian Mesoamerica and in some modern Maya communities in highland Guatemala

It shares many aspects with calendars employed by other earlier Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Zapotec and Olmec and contemporary or later ones such as the Mixtec and Aztec calendars Although the Mesoamerican calendar did not originate with the Maya their subsequent extensions and refinements of it were the most sophisticated Along with those of the Aztecs the Maya calendars are the best documented and most completely understood

There are three main Maya calendars the 260 day ritual calendar called Tzolkin the 365 day Haab and the Long Count Approximately 52 years pass before the Haab and Tzolkin calendars converge and are back in the same alignment This is called the Calendar round The Tzolkin is still in use today by the Ixil Kekchi and Quiche peoples of the Guatemalan highlands

Here is an example of a Maya calendar date 12181626 3 Cimi 4 Zotz The 12181626 is the Long Count Going from right to left the units are kin uinal tun katun baktun The Long Count was used to track periods of time longer than the 52 years of the Calendar Round The mythical starting date of the current creation was August 11 3114 BCE 3 Cimi is the Tzolkin date The Tzolkin date is a combination of thirteen days numbered one thirteen and twenty day names 4 Zotz is the Haab date The Haab year contains 18 months with 20 days each The number before the word is the day of that month The Maya then added five days to the calendar after the last month Cumku ends in order to make the year 365 days long Those five days called Uayeb were considered to be unlucky

A common myth about the Maya calendar is that it predicts that the world will end on December 21st 2012 This belief is mistaken According to the Maya there were three previous worlds The first began with the creation of the Earth and it had upon it vegetation and living beings Unfortunately because they lacked speech the birds and animals were unable to pay homage to the gods and were destroyed In the second and third Ages the gods created humans of mud and then wood but these also failed to please and were wiped out The zero date 130000 on the Long Count was when according to the Maya the third world ended and the fourth one the current world began Another 130000 will occur on December 21 2012 There is no evidence that the Long Count ends on 130000 or that the Maya believed that this would be the date of the apocalypse Still a variety of popular books and movies have contributed to the publicity surrounding the Maya calendars supposed prediction of the end of the world in 2012 Some believers have taken advantage of this publicity to sell guides to surviving the apocalypse

The flag of Mexico contains a coat of arms which is derived from an Aztec symbol depicting an eagle with a snake in its mouth

In the early 14th century the Mexica people were a wandering tribe looking for a permanent settlement in modern day central Mexico They survived by hunting and gathering and were often hired to fight as mercenaries for the city states scattered throughout the region According to legend their god Huitzilopochtli told them to establish a city of their own at a site where they would find an eagle eating a snake on top of a cactus The legend relates that the people saw the eagle on a small swampy island in the middle of the shallow Texcoco lake The Mexica invented a resourceful system of gardening called chinampas which allowed them to grow small gardens eventually drying out the lake In 1325 they completed construction of a city there That city which they called Tenochtitlan became the capital of of the Aztec Empire which dominated central Mexico until its destruction by Spanish Conquistadores led by Hernando Cortes 

After winning its independence from Spain in 1810 the newly created nation of Mexicowhose capital was built on the ruins of Tenochtitlanadopted the symbol of the eagle and the snake to commemorate its Aztec heritage The symbol can be found at the center of the Mexican flag

San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan started out as an agricultural and population center for the Olmec civilization which inhabited a region of what is today southeastern Mexico The Olmecs emerged as early as 1500 BC as the earliest complex society in the Americas San Lorenzo is best known as the first city established in the Americas 

The main reason San Lorenzo flourished at such an early period is its location within the Coatzacoalcos flood plain which provided fertile land for farming Thus the settlement of San Lorenzo follows the pattern of settlement of the worlds very first urban centers which emerged in the fertile river valleys of Mesopotamia Because of the high farming value of the surrounding land San Lorenzo ranked as the Olmecs most populous settlement from 1200 900 BC During that period San Lorenzo had the biggest trade market in all of the Olmec Heartland

For unknown reasons many people migrated out of San Lorenzo in 800 BC to the nearby city of La Venta However San Lorenzo was repopulated in 600 BC when it became a center for Olmec ritual sacrifices until the population faded away in 400 BC along with the Olmec civilization Today San Lorenzo remains a significant archaeological site because the artifacts found thereincluding the famous Colossal Heads and jade masksshed some light on Olmec culture and its profound influence on later Mesoamerican civilizations such as the Aztec and Maya

Terrace farming is a type of farming that was developed first by the Inca people This method of farming uses steps called andenes that are built into the side of a mountain or hill On each anden various crops are planted and when it rains instead of washing away all of the nutrients in the soil the nutrients are carried down to the next level Additionally these steps prevent a free flowing avalanche of water that would take plants with it and destroy the all of the crops on the hillside This system also allowed them to build aqueducts which carried water to each andenes The Incas built their aqueduct system so well that it is still used today Terrace farming is often used by the Chinese in their rice farms

Sapa Inca was the title of the Inca emperor Sapa Inca means The Great Inca or The Only Inca in Quechua the Inca language According to legend the first Sapa Inca Manco Cpac was the son of the sun god Inti Manco Cpac became Sapa Inca by founding the city of Cuzco after he was sent on a quest by a god to find a good location for a city and build one He also united the tribes around Cuzco

The position of Sapa Inca was hereditary which means that it passed from father to son The Sapa Inca was the sole and absolute ruler over the Incas His word was law and he was the supreme commander of the military The Sapa Inca lived in great luxury with many wives slaves and riches Another privilege that he had was that he was allowed to marry his sister even though it was prohibited for common people When the Sapa Inca died he would be mummified

The Inca Empire reached its height under Huayna Capac when it stretched from modern day Argentina to Ecuador although Tupac Inca Yupanqui was responsible for expanding much of the empire to those borders Tupac Yupanqui conquered the Kingdom of Chimor the biggest rival to the Inca He expanded the empire into modern day Ecuador Peru and Bolivia Atahualpa was the last pre conquest Sapa Inca He was killed by the invading Spaniards in 1533 and after that there were several Sapa Inca who were installed by the Spanish The last person to hold the title was Tupac Amaru who was killed by the Spanish in 1572

The central dogma of molecular biology is a phrase by Francis Crick who proposed the double helix structure of DNA It means that information passes from DNA to proteins via RNA but proteins cannot pass the information back to DNA

Crick first wrote it in 1958 and repeated it in 1970

The dogma is a framework for understanding the transfer of sequence information 

There are 3 major classes of such biopolymers DNA and RNA and protein There are 33 9 conceivable direct transfers of information that can occur between these The dogma classes these into 3 groups of 3 

The general transfers describe the normal flow of biological information DNA can be copied to DNA DNA information can be copied into mRNA and proteins can be synthesized using the information in mRNA as a template

The dogma is a modern version of the Weismann barrier This is the principle that hereditary information moves only from genes to body cells and never in reverse Hereditary information moves only from germline cells to somatic cells

The Mesoamerican ball game was a sport played by the peoples of Mesoamerica beginning around 1000 BCE A version of the game continues to be played today It was played by the Mayans and the Aztecs and there is some evidence that it might have originated with the Olmecs The Aztec version of the game was called ullamalitzli 

The object of the ball game was to shoot a ball through a stone hoop about 35 inches in diameter The ball called an ulli was made out of rubber and weighed about nine pounds roughly the weight of a brick The court called tlachtili was around 100 to 200 feet long with an outer wall on each side on which the stone hoops hung The court was usually in the shape of an I although the shape sometimes varied There was a center line running the length of the court vertically and from that line the floor sloped to meet the walls The players were allowed to use only their heads elbows legs and hips to hit the ball The ball also was not allowed to touch the ground so the players often dove to avoid losing points If one of the teams managed to get the ball through the stone hoop the game would be over and that team would win However it was also possible to score points by hitting the six markers found alongside the edges of the court 

Gambling played a large part in the culture surrounding the ballgame Nearly anything could be gambled on the outcome of the game such as ornate feathers children or even the wagerers own lives The losers sometimes sold themselves into slavery just so they could pay off their debt The winning or losing of the game especially when played between two rival city states could turn into an excuse to start an attack or attempt an assassination Sometimes one of the teams was even sacrificed after the game 

The Mesoamerican ballgame also held profound religious significance In Aztec culture for example the game was meant to represent the combat that occurred daily on the ball court in the underworld where the sun fought with the night to get across The religious meaning of the game was linked to the Aztec practice of human sacrifice since the Aztecs believes that without human sacrifice the sun would stop and the earth would be plunged into darkness Sometimes skulls of human sacrifices were used to decorate the ball court and the ball itself was said to represent the head of a human sacrifice Sometimes the losing team would be sacrificed after the game 

In modern times the Aztec ballgame was transformed into ulama played in a few communities in the Mexican state of Sinaloa The courts are temporary made by drawing thick lines in the dirt There are three different ways to play ulama all somewhat similar to Tlachtili in which players may use their hips forearms or paddles to hit a ball

He has been a member of the ruling council of the Hamburg Land CDU since 1992 and of the national ruling council of the CDU party since 1998

On 31 October 2001 Ole von Beust became First Mayor of Hamburg

On 19 August 2003 Beust dismissed his vice mayor Ronald Schill causing a scandal Beust had earlier dismissed Walter Wellinghausen senator of the interior and Schills most important official without consulting Schill beforehand This was due to public allegations of misconduct on Wellinghausens part In a private conversation Schill then demanded that Beust take back the dismissal allegedly using personal threats Beust then decided to dismiss Schill as well

In the press conference Schill held minutes after he had heard of his own dismissal he spoke vaguely of homosexual relationships a flat in an infamous hustler district and certain things happened that let one infer the occurrence of love acts between Beust and Roger Kusch who Beust had appointed minister of justice Beust in turn stated that Schill threatened to make his alleged liaison with Kusch public under the premise that Beust intermingled public and private affairs He said he had no sexual relationship with Kusch that they merely knew each other for 25 years and were good friends and that Beust was Kuschs landlord This is all absolutely all according to Beust

His unprepared statement to the press quickly earned Schill an homophobic reputation A popular radio station broadcast a song calling him Mega Proll and gay and lesbian associations protested vocally Schill however later affirmed Beusts version of the story except for the accusations of blackmail saying that he warned Beust to stay clear of nepotism and that this had nothing to do with Beusts sexual orientation He stated I have nothing against homosexualsfactdateJanuary 2012

In a later interview Beusts father confirmed that his son is indeed homosexual Beust himself considers his sexual orientation a private matter when asked directly he usually ironically refers the interviewer to his father

The Hamburg elections of 29 February 2004 ended with an unprecedented landslide victory for Ole von Beust and the CDU with the party achieving absolute majority in the city states parliament The CDU gained 472 percent of the vote a full 21 point increase from the previous election in September 2001 This was the first time since 1993 the city state has had only a single ruling party In the Hamburg elections of 24 February 2008 the CDU gained 426 percent of the vote Thus the CDU continued to be the strongest party in Hamburg However since the CDU lost its absolute majority it formed a coalition government with the GreensfactdateJanuary 2012

On 18 July 2010 Ole von Beust declared his resignation effective 25 August He was a finalist for the 2010 World Mayor prize

Volbeat is an Danish heavy metal band from Copenhagen Volbeat formed in 2000 when singer Michael Poulsen formed a death metal band called Dominus He became tired of the death metal genre and left the band He then formed a new band called Volbeat with other members of Dominus 

Alfred Day Hershey was an American Nobel Prize winning bacteriologist and geneticist

He was born in Owosso Michigan and received his BS in chemistry at Michigan State University in 1930 and his PhD in bacteriology in 1934 taking a position shortly thereafter at the Department of Bacteriology at Washington University in St Louis

He began performing experiments with bacteriophages with Italian American Salvador Luria and German Max Delbrck in 1940 and observed that when two different strains of bacteriophage have infected the same bacteria the two viruses may exchange genetic information

He moved with his wife Harriet to Cold Spring Harbor New York in 1950 to join the Carnegie Institution of Washingtons Department of Genetics There he performed the famous Hershey Chase blender experiment with Martha Chase in 1952 This experiment provided additional evidence that DNA not protein was the genetic material

He became director of the Carnegie Institution in 1962 and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1969 shared with Luria and Delbrck for their discovery on the replication of viruses and their genetic structure

A night terror also known as a sleep terror is a sleep disorder that causes extreme terror and a temporary inability to regain full consciousness The person having the night terror wakes up suddenly usually gasping moaning or screaming while waking It is often impossible to wake up the person fully because they are so concentrated on waking and after the terror the subject normally settles back to sleep without waking A night terror can rarely be recalled by the subject They typically occur during non rapid eye movement sleep

David Hunter Hubel is Professor of Neurobiology Emeritus at Harvard Medical School 

He was co recipient with Torsten Wiesel of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discoveries about information processing in the visual system The prize was shared with Roger Sperry for his independent research on the cerebral hemispheres 

Hubel and Wiesel received the Nobel Prize for two major contributions 

In one experiment done in 1959 they inserted a microelectrode into the primary visual cortex of an anesthetized cat They then projected patterns of light and dark on a screen in front of the cat They found that some neurons fired rapidly when presented with lines at one angle while others responded best to another angle Some of these neurons responded differently to light patterns than to dark patterns Hubel and Wiesel called these neurons simple cells

Still other neurons which they called complex cells detected edges regardless of how they were placed in the visual field and could detect motion in certain directions These studies showed how the visual system constructs complex pictures of visual information from simple stimulus features

They did important work in the study of cortical plasticity

By depriving kittens from using one eye they showed that columns in the primary visual cortex receiving inputs from the other eye took over the areas that would normally receive input from the deprived eye

These kittens did not develop areas receiving input from both eyes a feature needed for binocular vision Hubel and Wiesels experiments showed that ocular dominance develops early in childhood development and cannot be reversed Several childhood vision problems were understood better after this work 

The Red Bull Arena is a football stadium in Harrison New Jersey in the United States It is the homeground of New York Red Bulls a team playing in the MLS the highest league in american soccer

The construction started in 2006 but through differences of the clubowner and the state of New Jersey there was a delay After the buying of the former Metro Stars by the Red Bull Company the stadium was opened on March 20th 2010 with a friendly match of the NY Red Bulls versus FC Santos from Brazil One week later the first leaguematch was held in the new stadium versus Chicago Fire The stadium has 30 luxury suites and 1000 premium seats The design is customized to the design of the owner company Red Bull

Roger Wolcott Sperry was a American neurobiologist and Nobel Prize winner 

He shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel In 1989 Sperry also received the National Medal of Science

Before Sperrys experiments some research evidence seemed to indicate that areas of the cerebral cortex were largely interchangeable In his early experiments Sperry showed that the opposite was true after early development circuits of the brain are largely hardwired

Sperrys work was on split brain research In his Nobel winning work Sperry tested ten patients who had undergone an operation developed in 1940 by William Van Wagenen a neurosurgeon in Rochester NY 

The surgery designed to treat epileptics with grand mal seizures severed the corpus callosum the area of the brain used to transfer signals between the right and left hemispheres 

Sperry and his colleagues tested these patients with tasks that were known to be dependent on specific hemispheres of the brain and demonstrated that the two halves of the brain may each contain consciousness In his words each hemisphere is

This research contributed greatly to understanding how each cerebral hemisphere works 

Some activities such as naming objects or putting blocks together in a particular way can only be done when using one side of the brain or the other It seems the left hemisphere usually specializes in language processes and the right is dominant in visual construction tasks

Machair was a Scottish Gaelic television soap opera produced by Scottish Television Enterprises between August 1992 and September 1998 

Machair was written in English and translated into Gaelic then given English subtitles and broadcast during primetime At first critics thought this process would not work but when the show aired it got lots of praise from reviewers Kenneth Roy television critic of Scotland on Sunday described it as A credit to the company and a smack in the face to those of us who were doubtful and after a few episodes said It is even better than it looked at first glance quite simply the best thing to have happened to television in Scotland for a long time Audiences liked the show too Machair got 30 audience share and made it into the Top Ten of programmes viewed in Scotland even though fewer than 2 of the Scottish population can speak Gaelic It was nominated for awards for production and writing from The Celtic Film Festival and Writers Guild of Great Britain

The American Express Company is a financial company which today is best known for its credit card business Sometimes called Amex cards these credit cards make up nearly a quarter of all credit card transactions in the USA

Since 1958 the companys mascot has been a Roman gladiator

When the American Express Company was founded in 1850 it was an express business This meant that it was a private company whose business was to carry money packages or valuable things from one place to another The US Postal Service had only recently begun  They delivered letters but not large parcels This is why some people started small express businesses An express messenger would carry money in a money bag He would travel by train or stagecoach The trains were very slow and often came off the rails The stagecoaches travelled on terrible roads which were much too bumpy for the horses to trot It was a time when many people were going to California and other areas in the west of the US There was a lot of demand for money to be transferred from one part of the country to another This is why the American Express company was started

Two very important people in the express business at the time were Henry Wells and William G Fargo They had formed a partnership in 1844 When the American Express was formed its headquarters were in a building in Manhattan New York Three other companies merged to form the new company They soon bought several other buildings nearby to use as stables for their horses  For many years it was the most successful company transporting goods securities money etc In 1874 the American Express moved its headquarters to 65 Broadway in the financial district of Manhattan It has been there ever since 

Gradually American Express began to focus their attention on banks and other big financial groups because they found the American Express very reliable and paid them good money for their services The American Express gradually changed to be a financial company In the late 1890s they started to compete with the banks by issuing money orders They had big offices in London Paris Antwerp Zurich and Berlin

By 1890 the company needed a new building so they pulled down the old building and built a new ten story building in its place By 1903 the company had assets of about 28 million In 1916 17 a new building was constructed It was made of concrete and steel and was shaped like an H This building was sold in 1975

When their director J C Fargo travelled to Europe around 1890 he found it very difficult to get cash He was very annoyed because he was carrying with him letters of credit and he felt that as president of the American Express it should have been no problem Fargo went to Marcellus Flemming Berry and asked him to invent a better way getting cash Berry invented the Travelers Cheque The travelers cheque was a very safe way of getting cash out of a bank when travelling The American Express Travellers Cheque started in 1891 was to be used world wide for nearly a century when credit cards took over Travelers cheques made the American Express a great international company 

In 1914 when World War I started many people who happened to be travelling could not get at their money but American Express offices in Europe were among the few companies to honor the letters of credit so that the American tourists could get money to travel back home 

The war made the American Express enter the travel business In 1922 they provided a luxury steamship to take tourists round the world The travelers cheque business made them hugely successful for many years

The idea of a charge card for travel was discussed as early as 1946 but it was not until 1958 that the American Express introduced their first cards The early ones were paper In 1959 plastic cards were introduced

In 1966 American Express introduced the Gold Card and in 1984 the Platinum Card The Platinum Card had a 250 annual fee It was only offered to trusted customers Today customers can apply for it

In 1987 American Express introduced a credit card known as the Optima card Customers did not have to pay in full every month They could now wait to pay later

From early 1980s until the early 1990s American Express offered merchants and restaurants a discount if they accepted only American Express and no other credit or charge cards However in 1991 several restaurants in Boston started accepting Visa and MasterCards even encouraging their customers to use them These cards had a much lower fee than American Express fees which at the time charged 4 for each transaction Some restaurants even stopped accepting American Express cards This revolt was called the Boston Fee Party In the end the American Express decided to reduce their charges

Today the director of the American Express is Kenneth Chenault The American Express continues to be one of the worlds biggest financial companies

A travelers cheque is a preprinted cheque for a fixed amount The person who buys it must sign it and then sign it again when he cashes it It is a good way for a traveller to take money when going on holiday If a travelers cheque is stolen it can be replaced so long as the person still has a receipt to prove that he bought it

Travelers cheques were a large part of the business of American Express Since 2005 the American Express have been issuing American Express Travelers Cheque Cards These can be used in stores like a credit card

Tommy Pickles and the Great White Thing is the pilot episode of the Nickelodeon show Rugrats It aired August 7 1990

The episode starts out with Grandpa Lou getting ready in the Pickles bathroom whilst Tommy stares in awe at the toilet Tommy crawls up to the toilet and reaches out to touch it put is prevented from doing so when Grandpa picks him up telling him that the bathroom is no place for him before walking out with Tommy in his arms Tommy is put in the play pen where he tells Phil and Lil that he heard a noise from Grandpas stinking room and went inside and saw a big white thing in there The gang try to figure out what the big white thing is Suggestions range from a giant dog bowl to a fish bowl Tommy suggests that it is alive and the burping sound was its attempt to talk to him He plans to go talk to it tonight

After being put to bed by his parents Tommy sneaks out of his crib and goes to the bathroom where someone has left the door open Tommy walks up to the toilet knocking on it asking if anybody is home He is surprised when he doesnt get an answer Sad that he is not getting an answer he sees the toilet flusher and climbs a plunger to reach it but instead sees his reflection in the toilet and screams in shock Suprised Tommy nearly falls in and tries to uses the shower curtain to steady himself accidentally pulling it down and into the toilet Still trying to balance Tommy pulls at the toilet paper filling the toilet and turns on the bathroom sink spilling foamy stuff in the water Seeing Spike sniffing around close by Tommy drops onto his back and rides Spike around the house where Grandpa is watching TV Spike sits down to watch TV with Tommy and Grandpa but Grandpa gets up to use the bathroom Grandpa can be heard in the background shouting for Stu to call a plumber out As the grown ups argue how the mess happened and whose responsibility it is to clean it up Tommy watches a band perform on the TV

Tommy Pickles and the Great White Thing was released on the DVD Rugrats Decade in Diapers and will be released on Rugrats The Complete Series

Barbara McClintock was an American biologist She was a distinguished cytogeneticist who worked on inheritance in maize McClintock was awarded the 1983 Physiology or Medicine 

McClintock got her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927 Maize cytogenetics was the focus of her research for the rest of her career 

From the late 1920s McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize She used microscopic analysis to show genetic recombination by crossing over during meiosisa mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information 

She produced the first genetic map for maize and demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere These are regions of the chromosome that are important in preserving genetic information 

She was recognized amongst the best in the field awarded prestigious fellowships and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944

During the 1940s and 1950s McClintock discovered transposition and used it to show how genes are responsible for turning physical characteristics on or off She developed theories to explain the control of genetic information from one generation of maize plants to the next Encountering skepticism of her research and its implications she stopped publishing her data in 1953 Later she made an extensive study of the cytogenetics of maize races from South America 

McClintocks research became well understood in the 1960s and 1970s as researchers discovered the mechanisms behind the genetic change and gene regulation that she had shown in her maize research in the 1940s and 1950s 

Awards and recognition for her contributions to the field followed for the discovery of transposons she is the only woman to receive an unshared Nobel Prize in the category Physiology or Medicine

In the summer of 1944 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory McClintock began systematic studies on the inheritance of colour patterns of maize seeds In early 1948 she made the surprising discovery that two genetic loci Dissociator and Activator could transpose or change position on the chromosomes

McClintock also found that the transposition of Ds and the is determined by the number of Ac copies in the cell

Between 1948 and 1950 she developed a theory these mobile elements regulated genes by inhibiting or modulating their action She referred to Dissociator and Activator as controlling unitslater as controlling elementsto distinguish them from genes 

She suggested that gene regulation could explain how complex multicellular organisms made of cells with identical genomes have cells of different function McClintocks discovery challenged the concept of the genome as a static set of instructions passed between generations 

In 1950 she reported her work on AcDs and her ideas about gene regulation in a paper In summer 1951 when she reported on her work on gene mutability in maize at the annual symposium at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory

Her work on controlling elements and gene regulation was difficult and was not immediately understood or accepted by her contemporaries she described the reception of her research as puzzlement even hostility Nevertheless McClintock continued to develop her ideas on controlling elements She published a paper in 1953 where she presented all her statistical data and undertook lecture tours to universities throughout the 1950s to speak about her work She continued to investigate the problem and identified a new element that she called Suppressor mutator which although similar to AcDs displays more complex behavior

Sir Richard John Roberts FRS is a British biochemist and molecular biologist 

He was awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Phillip Sharp for the discovery that genes in eukaryotes are not contiguous strings but contain introns and that the splicing of messenger RNA to delete those introns can occur in different ways yielding different proteins from the same DNA sequence

Roberts has worked at Harvard University Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and New England Biolab He was knighted in the 2008 Birthday Honours

It used to be thought that each gene on DNA coded for a single protein in a continuous strip Roberts and Sharp independently found out that the genes in adenovirus were split into segments that were combined later in RNA processing 

In 1997 Roberts proved that in the adenovirus coding DNA is separated by stretches of DNA which are non coding The coding sections are exons and the non coding sections are introns 

Furthermore it turned out that this structure occurs in all higher organisms The discovery that a gene in could be present in the genetic material as several distinct and separate segments was revolutionary

The second part of Roberts work was in gene splitting and gene splicing This means to cut pieces out of and add pieces to a coding sequence This creates a protein which works differently from the original version This is now used in genetic engineering

This kind of structure may allow more flexible responses to environmental change and so speed up evolution The structure may also be responsible for a number of inherited genetic defects

Asseco Poland SA is a Polish company in the technology sector the biggest in Warsaw Stock Exchange

It was founded in 1991

She was born as Etta Lucille Reid in Caldwell County North Carolina of African American Native American and European American origin Since the age of three she played 6 and 12 string guitar and Banjo She was thought by her father who was also a Piedmont blues musician She did her first recording in 1956 when folk singer Paul Clayton was asked by her father to listen to his daughter She played One Dime Blues and Clayton was very impressed Next day he did some recordings with his taperecorder in Etta Bakers home

Over the years she played with different musicians like Bob Dylan Taj Mahal and Kenny Wayne Shepherd Etta Baker had nine children one of them died in the Vietnam War She died at the age of 93 in Fairfax Virginia while visiting a daughter who had suffered a stroke

Susumu Tonegawa is a Japanese scientist who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1987

He discovered the genetic mechanism that produces antibody diversity Although he won the Nobel Prize for his work in immunology Tonegawa is a molecular biologist by training In his later years he has turned his attention to the molecular and cellular basis of memory

Tonegawa is best known for elucidating the genetic mechanism in the adaptive immune system If each antibody was coded by one gene it would take millions of genes to protect against any type of antigen

Instead as Tonegawa showed in a landmark series of experiments beginning in 1976 genetic material can rearrange itself to form the vast array of available antibodies 

Antibodies have a variable region in their structure Tonegawa compared the DNA of B cells in embryonic and adult mice He found that genes in the mature B cells of the adult mice are moved around recombined and deleted to make the many versions of the variable region of antibodies

A chamber pot a piss pot a potty or a thunder pot is a container with a handle usually used as a urinal at night It is kept in a bedroom under a bed or in a nightstand

During Victorian times some chamber pots were built into a cabinet with a closeable cover During the first World War chamber pots in Britain had the face of their king on the inside The person using the chamber pot became more satisfied because of this

The chamber pot was originally designed for females Called the Bourdaloue it allowed women to urinate squatting or sitting without accidents It was supposedly named after the French Catholic priest Louis Bourdaloue whose sermon were so long that women brought Bourdaloue so they could urinate without having to leave

In the 19th century water closets started to be more common than chamber pots but chamber pots were still used until the mid 20th century Today they are used in countries that have no indoor plumbing

In North America and the UK potty refer to the toilets made especially for potty training These toilets are similar to chamber pots

In the Philippines chamber pots are used as urinals and are commonly called Arinola in Philippine languages like as Tagalog and Cebuano

In Korea chamber pots are referred to as yogang Currently they are still used in some country regions in the North

Jonathan Dickinson State Park is a Florida State Park and historic site in Martin County Florida between Hobe Sound and Tequesta The park has many kinds of areas such as sand pine scrub pine flatwoods mangroves and river swamps The Loxahatchee River which was named a National Wild and Scenic River in 1985 runs through the park The address is 16450 SE Federal Highway Hobe Sound

The park is named after Jonathan Dickinson a Quaker merchant who was shipwrecked in 1696 with his family and others on the Florida coast near the present day park He wrote a journal about their encounters with local tribes and their journey up the coast to St Augustine

A man known as Trapper Nelson lived on the banks of the Loxahatchee River after coming to the area in the 1930s living off the land trapping and selling furs He soon became known as the Wildman of the Loxahatchee After he died in 1968 the state got his land and gave it to the park 

The United States Army established Camp Murphy a top secret radar training school in the area that is now the park in 1942 The camp included over 1000 buildings and housed more than 6000 officers and soldiers The camp stopped being used in 1944 after only two years Most of the camp buildings were torn down but some of the building foundations remain The property was given to the State of Florida in 1947 and opened as a state park in 1950

The park has such activities as bicycling boat tours boating cabins canoeing fishing hiking horse trails kayaking picnicking areas swimming wildlife viewing and full camping facilities It also has the Elsa Kimbell Environmental Education and Research Center with exhibits about the parks natural and cultural history The park operates a 44 passenger boat for tours of Trapper Nelsons homestead

Sharp was born in Falmouth Kentucky He completed his PhD in chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 1969 After completing his PhD he worked at the California Institute of Technology until 1971 where he studied plasmids and later gene expression in human cells at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory under James Watson

In 1974 he was offered a position at MIT by biologist Salvador Luria He was director of MITs Center for Cancer Research from 1985 to 1991 head of the Biology department from 1991 to 1999 and director of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research from 2000 to 2004

The Anti Comintern Pact was a pact between Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan which would later joined by more countries on Novermber 25 1936 It was set up to directly against Comintern an organization of the Soviet Union On November 6 1937 Italy joined the pact which would be the start of the Axis Powers

The Reichstag fire was an arson on the Reichstag building place of meeting of German Parliament in Berlin on 27 February 1933 It was an important event in the creation of Nazi Germany

A Berlin fire station was called and by the time the police and firefighters had arrived most of the building was covered in flames Inside the building Marinus van der Lubbe was found He was a Dutch communist the Nazis used it as a proof that communists were beginning a plot against the German government Van der Lubbe and other four Communist leaders were arrested shortly after that Adolf Hitler who had become Chancellor of Germany four weeks before urged President Paul von Hindenburg to pass an emergency law to fight back the confrontation of the Communist Party of Germany 

As a result the people had less freedom Many Communists were arrested including all the Communist Party members of Parliament This made the Nazis the majority of the Paliament Following elections gave Hitler more power 

More investigation continued In early March 1933 three men were brought to the court All of them were senior Bulgarians Comintern agents 

Historians still have no idea about planning and ordering or who did it It is still an ongoing topic of research

Operation Sea Lion was the plan to invade the United Kingdom by land of Germany during World War II The plan began in 1940 However Germany first had to control the sky and sea of the English Channel before land invasion With the German defreat in the Battle of Britain the operation was put off on 17 September 1940 and never became real

Operation Barbarossa was the code name for the European Axiss invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II which began on 22 June 1941 More than 45 million men attacked along 2900 km front It also involved 600000 motor vehicles and 750000 horses Planning for the operation started since December 1940

Even though the Soviets were in a terrible condition the Axis did not complete its objectives Tactically the Germans held some of the most important economic areas of the Soviet Union mainly in Ukraine However the Germans were pushed back from Moscow and could not start an attack as large and long as Operation Barbarossa on the Eastern Front again The failure led to Hitlers demands for more operations but all of which failed

Operation Barbarossa was the largest military operation in human history which more men were involved and more were dead The operation opened a theatre which more men were involved than any others in the history Some of the battles fought became the largest battles dealiest cruelty highest dead and most horrific 

Max Ferdinand Perutz FRS OM CBE was an Austrian born British molecular biologist

He shared the 1962 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with John Kendrew for their studies of the structures of haemoglobin and globular proteins The method used was mainly X ray crystallography

He went on to win the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1971 and the Copley Medal in 1979 At Cambridge he founded and chaired The Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology fourteen of whose scientists have won Nobel Prizes Perutzs contributions to molecular biology in Cambridge are documented in The History of the University of Cambridge Volume 4 published by the Cambridge University Press in 1992

Perutz a Jew had worked in Cambridge since 1936 and moved to Britain permanently after the Anschluss the Nazi takeover of Austria He did his war work in Canada and returned to Cambridge after the war Max did some of his most important work after winning the Nobel award and is still held in the highest esteem

The Battle of Moscow is a name given by Soviet historians to two periods of fighting on a 600 km area of the Eastern Front during World War II It took place between October 1941 and January 1942 The Soviet defenses made the Germans unable to attack on Moscow the Soviet capital which was one of the Axiss primary military and political objectives in the invasion of the Soviet Union

The German strategic offensive named Operation Typhoon was planned to attack Moscow from the north and south The Soviets reacted by sending in more reserve from the Far East Shortly German attacks were stopped and the Soviets began counter attack and forced to push the Axis back

The common marmoset is a very small New World monkey that lives in Brazil Marmosets can found in many forest habitats Common marmosets eat gum sap latex and resin from trees the most out of all the members of the Callithrix family 

A common group of marmosets is made up of 15 members but usually has nine members Common marmosets have a complex mating system In a group of marmosets there will usually be one or two females that will have babies and one male to be the father The females are usually closely related while the male is distantly related If the male dies the group will break up and form new groups When marmosets get older they leave the group they were raised with It is not known why

To show fear or submission marmosets flatten their ear tufts close to their heads Marmoset alarm calls tend to be brief and high pitched Marmosets monitor and find group members with calls called trills

An intron is a non coding sequence in a gene

It is any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is removed by RNA splicing to get the final RNA product of a gene The term intron refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts  

Sequences of coding DNA which are joined together in the final RNA after RNA splicing are exons They code for amino acids in the final polypeptide

Introns are found in the genes of most organisms and many viruses and can be located in a wide range of genes including those that generate proteins ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA RNA splicing takes place after transcription and before translation

The discovery of introns led to the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1993 for Phillip Sharp and Richard Roberts The term intron was introduced by American biochemist Walter Gilbert

There are many unanswered questions about introns It is unclear whether introns serve some specific function or whether they are selfish DNA which reproduces itself as a parasite

Recent studies of entire eukaryotic genomes have now shown that the lengths and density of introns varies considerably between related species There are four or five different kinds of intron Some introns represent mobile genetic elements

Alternative splicing of introns within a gene allows a variety of protein isoforms from a single gene Thus multiple related proteins can be generated from a single gene and a single precursor mRNA transcript The control of alternative RNA splicing is performed by complex network of signalling molecules

In humans 95 of genes with more than one exon are alternatively spliced

David James Mac McAllister is a German politician of the conservative Christian Democratic Union On 1 July 2010 he was elected Minister President of the state of Lower Saxony succeeding Christian Wulff who resigned following his election as President of Germany McAllister heads a coalition government with the liberal FDP the Cabinet McAllister

A lawyer by profession he has been the chairman of the CDU parliamentary group in the Landtag of Lower Saxony from 2003 to 2010 and was elected chairman of the state party in 2008 Since 2010 he is also a member of the supervisory board of Volkswagen

McAllister is of German and Scottish descent and he leads a state that has historic ties to Britain as the old Kingdom of Hanover makes up parts of the state and the state capital is Hanover City

McAllister was born in West Berlin on 12 January 1971 to a Scottish father and a German mother His father James Buchanan McAllister was a British civil servant originally from Glasgow He had been stationed in West Berlin since 1969 attached to the Royal Corps of Signals His mother Mechthild McAllister is a music teacher David McAllister was raised bilingual and attended a British primary school in Berlin

After his parents moved to the small town of Bad Bederkesa in Lower Saxony in 1982 he went to the Lower Saxon Internatsgymnasium in Bederkesa where he took his Abitur in 1989 From 1989 till 1991 McAllister served as a soldier in the Bundeswehr in Panzerbataillon 74 in Cuxhaven From 199196 he studied law with a scholarship of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation at the University of Hanover In 1994 McAllister became local chairman of the Junge Union the CDU youth organisation in the Cuxhaven district 

David McAllister is both a German and a British citizen but says that he is more or less completely German Ive lived in Germany all my life I did all my school in Germany and my military service in Germany His upbringing in West Berlin however he describes as very British with British network British schools Holding dual citizenship he could have relinquished his German citizenship to avoid compulsory military service in Germany but opted to serve instead

McAllister has said that my upbringing in West Berlin may have had an impact on my resentment towards communists I became a member of the CDU when I was 17 it was a birthday present My parents said What do you want for your birthday I said I wanted to become a member of the CDU explaining that his father was a Conservative although none of his parents were involved in party politics

In 2005 Chancellor Angela Merkel offered him the position of Secretary General of the CDU but McAllister declined arguing he did not want to rise too far too fast

On 4 June 2010 he was chosen by his party to follow Christian Wulff as Minister President of Lower Saxony if the latter was to be elected President of Germany on 30 June After the election of Wulff as President David McAllister was elected the new Minister President of Lower Saxony the following day He was subsequently also appointed to the supervisory board of Volkswagen the largest company of Lower Saxony and of which the state of Lower Saxony is a major stockholder

He is married to Dunja McAllister who is also a lawyer They have two daughters Jamie Elizabeth and Mia Louise He lives in Bad Bederkesa in the district of Cuxhaven

Proud of his Scottish heritage McAllister proposed to his wife at Loch Ness and married in August 2003 wearing a kilt He later explained it was a family tradition

In molecular biology splicing is a modification of an RNA molecule after transcription in which introns are removed and exons are joined 

This is needed for the typical eukaryotic messenger RNA before it can be used to produce a correct protein through translation 

For many eukaryotic introns splicing is done in a series of reactions which are catalyzed by the spliceosome a complex of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins There are also self splicing introns

Phillip Sharp and Richard Roberts were awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of introns and the splicing process

In 1977 work by the Sharp and Roberts labs showed that genes of higher organisms are split or present in several distinct segments along the DNA molecule 

The coding regions of the gene are separated by non coding DNA that is not involved in protein expression The non coding regions the introns are cut from the precursor mRNAs in a process Sharp called splicing The split gene structure was found to be common to most eukaryotic genes

Alternative splicing is a process by which the exons of the RNA produced by transcription of a gene are reconnected in multiple ways during RNA splicing 

The different mRNAs may be translated into different proteins Thus a single gene may code for multiple proteins 

Alternative splicing occurs as a normal phenomenon in eukaryotes where it greatly increases the diversity of proteins that can be encoded by the genome in humans 95 of multiexonic genes are alternatively spliced

There are numerous modes of alternative splicing observed of which the most common is exon skipping In this mode a particular exon may be included in mRNAs under some conditions or in particular tissues and omitted from the mRNA in others

The production of alternatively spliced mRNAs is regulated by a system of proteins There are splicing activators that promote the use of a particular splice site and splicing repressors that reduce the use of a particular site 

New types of alternative splicing are constantly being found Researchers hope to fully elucidate the regulatory systems involved in splicing so that alternative splicing products from a given gene under particular conditions could be predicted by a splicing code

Abnormal variations in splicing are also implicated in disease a large proportion of human genetic disorders result from splicing variants Abnormal splicing variants are also thought to contribute to the development of cancer although such aberrant splicing products are under normal conditions usually safeguarded and eliminated by a posttranscriptional quality control mechanism

Alternative splicing is a major source of genetic diversity in eukaryotes

One particular Drosophila gene can be alternatively spliced into 38000 different mRNA

Gun control is the attempt usually by a government to restrain or stop people from owning or using guns Gun control may also include the making moving and selling of guns People want gun control because guns are very dangerous Today gun control has become a subject which is very involved in politics such as in the United States Some countries such as Finland the United States Switzerland and Israel allow people to own guns to defend themselves but most countries do not

Because of the 2nd Amendment to the United States Constitution every American citizen has the right to keep and bear arms This has been taken to mean that most people can own guns Originally it was thought that the federal government could not ban guns but states and cities could But recently the Supreme Court said that states and cities could not ban handguns Although banning all guns is not allowed anymore states and cities can still stop the sale and use of certain kinds of guns such as guns that fire many bullets very quickly They can also say that certain people such as criminals cannot own guns There is a strong gun lobby in the United States It is led by the National Rifle Association which is okay with more people owning guns They want it to be fairly easy to get a gun Other groups such as the Brady Campaign want guns to be hard to get because they believe that guns cause violence injury and death Some states have very strict gun laws but others such as Arizona Utah and Mississippi do not

Sydney Brenner CH FRS is a South African biologist and a 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine laureate shared with Robert Horvitz and John Sulston

Brenner made significant contributions to work on the genetic code and other areas of molecular biology 

He established the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism for the investigation of developmental biology and founded the Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley California

Brenner made several important contributions to molecular biology in the 1960s With Francis Crick and others he worked out the genetic code where triplets of nucleic acid bases are translated into amino acids

Brenner then focused on establishing Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism for the investigation of animal development including development of the nervous system Brenner chose this 1 millimeter long soil roundworm mainly because it is simple is easy to grow in bulk populations and turned out to be convenient for genetic analysis For this work he shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Robert Horvitz and John Sulston His Nobel lecture in December 2002 Natures gift to science is a homage to this modest nematode He considers chosing the right organism is as important as picking the right problems to work on In recognition of his pioneering work on C elegans another closely related nematode was given the scientific name Caenorhabditis brenneri

Brenner founded the Molecular Sciences Institute in Berkeley CA in 1996 He is currently associated with the Salk Institute the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology the Singapore Biomedical Research Council and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute In August 2005 Brenner was appointed president of the Okinawa Insitute of Science and Technology He is also on the Board of Scientific Governors at the Scripps Research Institute 

Known for his scientific insight and wit Brenner for many years penned a regular column in the journal Current Biology Brenner is noted for his generosity of ideas and the great number of students and colleagues his ideas have stimulated

The Gerhard Hanappi stadium is a football stadium in Vienna Austria It is the homeground of SK Rapid Wien and is named after Gerhard Hanappi the architect of the stadium and former player of Rapid Wien

The work started in 1971 but there was a delay in finishing it The plan was not fully built because it should be cheaper The new stadium was named Weststadion because it lays in the western part of Vienna It was planned that the two major clubs should play in this new stadium but Austria Wien was not amused that her rival has got a stadium in its own district so they went back to their former homeground the Franz Horr stadium But till 1992 they often came back because the Horr stadium was not licensed for international matches In April 1981 it got the name of its architect Gerhard Hanappi who was player for Rapid Wien

The first match which was played here was a leaguematch SK Rapid versus Austria Vienna But the official opening was on September 14th 1977 with a UEFA Cup match Rapid versus FK Inter Bratislava It was not love at first sight between the fans and the new stadium but meanwhile they accept it It is even called Saint Hanappi following the slogan of the fans Rapid is our religion

Sir John Edward Sulston FRS is a British biologist He is a joint winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine

He was the first Director of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and is now Chair of the Institute for Science Ethics and Innovation at the University of Manchester

After working at the Salk Institute La Jolla California for a while he returned to Cambridge to work under Sydney Brenner at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology

Sulston played a central role in both the Caenorhabditis elegans roundworm and human genome sequencing projects He had argued successfully for the sequencing of C elegans to show that large scale genome sequencing projects could be done As sequencing of the worm genome proceeded the project to sequence the human genome began At this point he was made director of the newly established Sanger Centre

One of Sulstons most important contributions during his research years at the LMB was to find the precise order in which cells in C elegans divide In fact he and his team succeeded in tracing the nematodes entire embryonic cell lineage Sulston is now a leading campaigner against the patenting of human genetic information

Sir Aaron Klug OM PRS is a British chemist and biophysicist 

Klug won the 1982 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing crystallographic electron microscopy and working out the structure of nucleic acid protein complexes

Klug was born in elva Lithuania to Jewish parents The family moved to South Africa when he was two Klug graduated with a degree in science at the University of Witwatersrand and studied crystallography at the University of Cape Town before moving to England completing his doctorate at Trinity College Cambridge in 1953 

He moved to Birkbeck College University of London in late 1953 and started working with Rosalind Franklin in John Bernals lab This experience aroused a lifelong interest in the study of viruses and during his time there he made discoveries in the structure of the tobacco mosaic virus 

In 1962 he moved to the newly built MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge Over the following decade Klug used methods from X ray diffraction microscopy and structural modelling to develop crystallographic electron microscopy in which a sequence of two dimensional images of crystals taken from different angles are combined to produce three dimensional images of the target

Between 1986 and 1996 he was Director of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge and was knighted in 1988 He was elected President of the Royal Society and served from 19952000 He was appointed to the Order of Merit in 1995 

Deportivo Petare Ftbol Club is a Venezuelan football club based in Caracas Formed in 1948 as Deportivo Italia FC the club after fifty years merged with Deportivo Chacao FC in 1998 and was called Deportivo Italchacao for eight years The club has won the Primera Divisin Venezolana five times and the Copa de Venezuela three times

The actual Deportivo Petare was founded on 18 August 1948 with the name Deportivo Italia by nine Italian immigrants Carlo Pescifeltri Lorenzo Tommasi Bruno Bianchi Giordano Valentini Samuel Rovatti Angelo Bragaglia Giovanni de Stefano Giuseppe Pane and Alfredo Sacchi

The golden years of the team were those of the DAmbrosio era that lasted from 1958 to 1978

Deportivo Italia changed their name to Deportivo Petare in the summer of 2010 There is an ongoing dispute because of the strong opposition from the Italian community in Caracas

Deportivo Petare has started de 20102011 season with good results ending fourth at the end of the first half of the season in December 2010 The last match ended in a draw with Deportivo Tachira the eventual Torneo Apertura champion

 Torneo Apertura 2010 Standings

The club played their home matches at Estadio Brgido Iriarte until 2006 which has a maximum capacity of 15000 people Now the team plays at the Estadio Olmpico with a capacity of 30000

The Olimpico stadium is also used as headquarters for some of the matches of the national team as well as FC Caracas

The colors from 1948 to 2010 were the same as the Italian national football team After the name change the actual Deportivo Petare uses those colors as second choice In the 2010 2011 championship the main colors are white and black

The Planck units are physical units of measurement The system of these units was first developed by Max Planck The definition of the five base Planck units are based only on five physical constants found in nature When Planck units are used to express any of these five physical constants the value is 1 This allows physicists to simplify many equations about physical law Planck proposed these units in 1899 They are also known as natural units because the origin of their definition comes only from properties of nature and not from any human construct Planck units are only one system of natural units among other systems They are considered unique because these units are not based on properties of any prototype object or particle but are based only on properties of free space The constants that Planck units by definition normalize to 1 are the

Each of these constants can be associated with at least one fundamental physical theory c with special relativity G with general relativity and Newtonian gravity with quantum mechanics 0 with electrostatics and kB with statistical mechanics and thermodynamics Planck units are very important for theoretical physics because they simplify several recurring algebraic expressions of physical law They are particularly relevant in research on unified theories such as quantum gravity

Planck units may sometimes be semi humorously referred to by physicists as Gods units They eliminate anthropocentric arbitrariness from the system of units some physicists argue that communication with extraterrestrial intelligence would have to use such a system of units to make common reference to scale Unlike the meter and second which exist as fundamental units in the SI system for historical reasons the Planck length and Planck time are conceptually linked at a fundamental physical level

Natural units help physicists to reframe questions Frank Wilczek puts this succinctly

The strength of gravity is simply what it is and the strength of the electromagnetic force simply is what it is The electromagnetic force operates on a different physical quantity than gravity so it cannot be compared directly to gravity To note that gravity is an extremely weak force is from the point of view of Planck units like comparing apples to oranges It is true that the electrostatic repulsive force between two protons greatly exceeds the gravitational attractive force between the same two protons and that is because the charge on the protons is approximately the Planck unit of charge but the mass of the protons is far far less than the Planck mass

Dorothy Mary Hodgkin OM FRS ne Crowfoot was a British chemist credited with the development of protein crystallography

She advanced the technique of X ray crystallography a method used to determine the three dimensional structures of biomolecules 

She confirmed the structure of penicillin which Ernst Chain had proposed and she worked out the structure of vitamin B12 For her work she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 

In 1969 after 35 years of work and five years after winning the Nobel Prize Hodgkin was able to decipher the structure of insulin 

X ray crystallography became a widely used tool and helped to find structures of many biological molecules such as DNA The structure of molecules helps us understand how they work

Apart from the Nobel Prize she was a recipient of the Order of Merit a recipient of the Copley Medal and a Fellow of the Royal Society

She was Chancellor of Bristol University from 1970 to 1988 and President of Pugwash from 1976 to 1988 Pugwash is an organisation which holds conferences on Science and World Affairs Because of her reputation as a peacenik and her relationship with her left wing mentor JD Bernal Hodgkin was not allowed to enter the US except by CIA waiver She received the Lenin Peace Prize in 1987

Her best known student was Margaret Thatcher who consulted her when she was in office 

The Order of Merit display at the Royal Society mentions two interesting facts

A rotary evaporator is commonly used in chemical laboratories to remove solvents by evaporation

The liquid is put in a round bottomed flask and placed in the device The rotavap spins and heats the flask and reduces the pressure inside by creating a vacuum The vacuum makes the liquid evaporate at a low temperature than normal The liquid becomes a gas and is collected by cooling it so it condenses into another flask

If there are substances dissolved in the liquid they will be left behind in when it evaporates If water with salt dissolved in it is evaporated then pure water and dry salt will be separated Scientists use rotary evaporators to remove the liquid a solid is dissolved in

Rotary evaporators are often quicker to use than evaporating basins They can be used for distillations

Electron crystallography is a method to determine the arrangement of atoms in solids using a transmission electron microscope

This method works in many cases where X ray crystallography does not The latter needs large 3 D crystals to work

Protein structures are usually done from 2 dimensional crystals polyhedrons such as viral capsids or dispersed proteins Electrons can be used in these situations whereas X rays cannot because electrons interact more strongly with atoms than X rays do

Electron crystallography is a method to determine the arrangement of atoms in solids using a transmission electron microscope The method was invented by Aaron Klug who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this and his studies on virus structures and transfer RNA in 1982

The first electron crystallographic protein structure to be solved was bacteriorhodopsin in 1990 Since then several other high resolution structures have been done by electron crystallography including the light harvesting complex and the bacterial flagellum

Svante August Arrhenius was an outstanding Swedish scientist 

Originally he was a physicist but he won the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry and was a founder of physical chemistry

Later in life he turned to other scientific problems He was the first person to predict that emissions of carbon dioxide from processes like the burning of fossil fuels would cause global warming 

His early work was on on the conductivity of electrolytes In 1884 based on this work he submitted a 150 page dissertation on electrolytic conductivity to University of Uppsala for the doctorate It did not impress the professors and he received low class degree Later extensions of this work would earn him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry

The most important idea in the thesis was his explanation that neither pure salts nor pure water is a conductor but solutions of salts in water are

Arrhenius explanation was that in forming a solution the salt dissociates into charged particles Faradays belief had been that ions were produced in the process of electrolysis Arrhenius proposed that even in the absence of an electric current solutions of salts contained ions He thus proposed that chemical reactions in solution were reactions between ions

In an extension of his ionic theory Arrhenius proposed definitions for acids and bases in 1884 He believed that acids were substances which produce hydrogen ions in solution and that bases were substances which produce hydroxide ions in solution

About 1900 Arrhenius became involved in setting up the Nobel Institutes and the Nobel Prizes For the rest of his life he would be a member of the Nobel Committee on Physics and a de facto member of the Nobel Committee on Chemistry 

He used his positions to arrange prizes for his friends and to attempt to deny them to his enemies In 1903 he became the first Swede to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry

Now he had made his name he turned to other scientific questions

In 1904 he delivered at the University of California a course of lectures the object of which was to illustrate the application of the methods of physical chemistry to the study of the theory of toxins and antitoxins and which were published in 1907 under the title Immunochemistry

He also turned his attention to geology astronomy physical cosmology and astrophysics accounting for the birth of the solar system by interstellar collision He considered radiation pressure as accounting for comets the solar corona the aurora borealis and zodiacal light

He thought life might have been carried from planet to planet by the transport of spores the theory now known as panspermia 

Arrhenius developed a theory to explain the ice ages and in 1896 he was the first scientist to speculate that changes in the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could substantially alter the surface temperature through the greenhouse effect He was influenced by the work of others including Joseph Fourier Arrhenius used infrared observations of the moon to calculate the absorption of infrared radiation by atmospheric CO2 and water vapour  In its original form Arrhenius greenhouse law reads as follows

His book Worlds in the making was directed at a general audience He suggested that the human emission of CO2 would be strong enough to prevent the world from entering a new ice age and that a warmer earth would be needed to feed the rapidly increasing population 

He was the first person to predict that emissions of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels and other combustion processes would cause global warming Arrhenius clearly believed that a warmer world would be a positive change Nevertheless until about 1960 most scientists dismissed the hot house greenhouse effect as implausible Milutin Milankovitch had presented a mechanism for ice ages it used cyclical changes in the orbit of the Earth Nowadays the accepted explanation is that orbital forcing sets the timing for ice ages with CO2 acting as amplifying feedback

He thought of the idea of a universal language proposing a modification of the English language

Arrhenius was one of several leading Swedish scientists who helped create the The State Institute for Racial Biology in 1922 This was a eugenics influenced idea It had originally been proposed as a Nobel Institute Arrhenius was a member of the institutes board as he had been in The Swedish Society for Racial Hygiene founded in 1909

From 1914 both father and son contributed to the war effort WH Bragg was connected with submarine detection at Aberdour on Forth and at Harwich and returned to London in 1918 as a consultant to the Admiralty

Bragg was appointed Quain Professor of Physics at University College London in 1915 but did not take up his duties there until after World War I 

From 1923 he was Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution and director of the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory This institution was practically rebuilt in 1929 30 and under Braggs directorship many valuable papers were issued from the laboratory

Christine was born in the Palais du Louvre in Paris and was the third child of King Henry IV of France and his second wife Marie de Medici As a daughter of the king she held the prestigious rank of Fille de France Baptised with the names Christine Marie she was known simply as Christine She was a younger sister of Louis XIII of France and lisabeth a future queen of Spain After the marriage of Princess lisabeth in 1615 to the future Philip IV of Spain Christine took on the honorary title of Madame Royale indicating her status as the eldest and most senior unmarried daughter at the court She would be known as this till her own marriage

She married Victor Amadeus of Savoy on 10 February 1619 at the Louvre in Paris Her husband was styled the Prince of Piedmont and as such she the Princess Victor Amadeus was the eldest surviving son of Charles Emmanuel I Duke of Savoy and Catherine Michelle of Austria the latter of which had died in 1597 as a result of childbirth As such Christine was the most senior female at the Savoyard court from the time of her arrival Her husband was nineteen years older than she Despite the age gap the couple were happy and overall produced eight children four of whom would survive childhood 

Victor Amadeus became Duke after the death of his father in July 1630 Her husband died in October 1637 having left Savoy with little money due to wars with Spain 

When her husband died in October 1637 she was created regent in the name of her son Francis Hyacinth who succeeded her husband At the death of Francis Hyacinth in 1638 her second son succeeded as Charles Emmanuel II As a result of Charles Emmanuels age Christine maintained her grip on power Despite this her brothers in law Prince Maurice and his younger brother Prince Thomas Francis disputed Christines power as she was a woman They also had little trust in her French entourage When Francis Hyacinth the brothers started the Piedmontese Civil War with Spanish support There were two parties The principisti supporters of the Princes and the madamisti the supporters of Christine During her regency she styled herself Madama Reale Italian form of the style Madame Royale which she was know as prior to her marriage

Charles Chuckie Crandall Finster is the main character of the Nickelodeon show Rugrats and the sister show All Grown Up

Hoverflies sometimes called flower flies or syrphid flies are the insect family Syrphidae 

As their common name suggests they are often seen hovering or sucking nectar at flowers The adults of many species feed mainly on nectar and pollen while the larvae eat a wide range of foods 

In some species the larvae are saprotrophs eating decaying plant and animal matter in the soil or in ponds and streams In other species the larvae are insectivores and prey on aphids thrips and other plant sucking insects

Aphids alone cause tens of millions of dollars of damage to crops worldwide every year Hoverflies are important natural enemies of these pests and can be used in biological control Some adult syrphid flies are important pollinators

About 6000 species in 200 genera have been described Hoverflies are common throughout the world and can be found on most continent except Antarctica 

Hoverflies are harmless to most other animals despite their mimicry of the black and yellow stripes of wasps This is an example of warning colouration which serves to ward off predators

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm It is very simple for understanding and realization therefore it is considered as a training algorithm In real applications it is not used since it is not efficient

Algorithm compares every two items which stands side by side and swapping them if they are in the wrong order Array of n elements can be sorted within n 1 passes For example

First pass  

Second pass  

Third pass  

This is not an optimized implementation of the algorithm It always does n 1 passes even if the array is sorted already Complexity of this implementation is O

This is pass optimized implementation of the algorithm Obviously there is no necessity to do passes if array was sorted or became sorted after one of the passes So in this implementation there is a flag swapped which signalize whether was swaped elements in the current pass or not If not then cycle is ended In the best case then array is sorted already complexity of this implementation is O In the worst case then array sorted by descending complexity is O

Scientific racism is the idea to use science to promote racism This is different from using the scientific method and simply pointing out differences between races The scientific method does not claim that one race is better than another it may simply show differences between the races 

Very often the term is also used for different theories of anthropology and other closely related disciplines to create evidence which would allow to classify humans into groups These groups are then called races and it is possible to claim tha one race is superior to another based on that evidence Most of these theories were common between 1880 and 1930 in a period called New Imperialism

Rhythm game or rhythm action is a type of music themed action video games These games mostly focus either on dancing or simulating the playing of musical instruments Players must press buttons in time with commands from the game which are in time with the rhythm of a song Doing so will cause the games protagonist or avatar to dance or play their instrument correctly thus achieving a greater score The game can be played with a hand held controller though different control devices have been made to play rhythm games such as guitar and drum shaped controllers for musical instrument games and pressure sensitive pads that the player must step on for dancing games The Kinect for the X Box 360 allows the player to use their whole body to control the game by tracking their movements Some games have a multi player mode where players can play as members of a band or dance crew or compete against each other

The 1996 title PaRappa the Rapper was the first influential rhythm game The basic design of the game became a pattern that later rhythm games followed In 1997 Konamis Beatmania started popularity for rhythm games in Japan The companys music division Bemani released many music games over the next several years The most successful of these was dance mat game Dance Dance Revolution which was also the only one to achieve large scale success outside of Japan The games style was imitated by many other games until the release of Harmonixs Guitar Hero The game was inspired by similar earlier Japanese games but Harmonix added rock music aimed at a Western audience The success of the game revived the genre and two hugely successful franchises were born in Guitar Hero and the later Rock Band The success of both expanded the console video game market and its demographics By 2008 rhythm games were considered to be one of the most popular video game genres behind other action games However because there were so many spin offs from the core titles in 2009 there was a nearly 50 drop in sales for music games causing them to scale back plans for further expansion in 2010

Rhythm game or rhythm action is a subgenre of action game that challenges a players sense of rhythm and includes dance games such as Dance Dance Revolution and other music based games such as Donkey Konga and Guitar Hero These games challenge the player to press the right button at the right time the screen shows which button the player should press next and the game awards points for being on the beat The genre also includes games that measure both rhythm and pitch in order to test a players singing ability In addition to rhythm some games may challenge the player to control their volume by measuring how hard they press each button While songs can be sight read without having performed them before players usually practice to master more difficult songs and settings Other rhythm games offer a challenge similar to that of Simon says where the player must watch remember and repeat complex sequences of button presses

In some rhythm games the screen will display an avatar who performs in response to the players button presses However they are usually in the background and the avatar is less important to the player than it is to spectators In single player mode the players avatar will compete against a computer controlled opponent while multiplayer mode will allow two player controlled avatars to compete head to head The popularity of rhythm games has created a market for different controllers These include a variety of controllers which look like musical instruments such as guitars drums or maracas A dance mat for use in dancing games requires the player to step on pressure sensitive pads Traditional control pads may also be used

The genre has been traced back to the electronic game Simon invented by Howard Morrison and Ralph Baer in 1978 Players take turns repeating increasingly complicated sequences of button presses and the game implemented the call and response mechanic used by later music video games Dance Aerobics was released in 1987 and allowed players to create music by stepping on Nintendos Power Pad peripheral It has been called the first rhythm action game in retrospect The later PaRappa the Rapper has also been credited as the first rhythm game as well as one of the first music games in general The game required players to press buttons corresponding to the order they appeared on screen this basic mechanic would form the core of future rhythm games The success of PaRappa the Rapper sparked popularity of the music game genre Unlike most other games in the genre the game also featured a completely original soundtrack and a good plot Konamis Beatmania released in Japanese arcades in 1997 was a dj themed rhythm game which featured buttons laid out like a keyboard along with a rubber pad that looked like a record The game was a surprise hit inspiring Konamis Games and Music Division to change its name to Bemani in honor of the game and to then begin experimenting with other rhythm games over the next few years One of those successes GuitarFreaks featured a guitar shaped controller While the franchise continues to receive new arcade versions in Japan it was never strongly marketed outside of the country allowing Harmonix to capitalize on the formula several years later with the Western targeted Guitar Hero Similarly DrumMania from 1999 used a drum kit controller and could be linked with GuitarFreaks for simulated jam sessions several years before the concept appeared in Rock Band 1998s Popn Music a game similar to Beatmania featuring multiple colorful buttons was also successful

Dance Dance Revolution released in 1998 was a rhythm game in which players danced on pressure sensitive pads in time with on screen commands The game was highly successful not only in Japan but globally unlike games such as GuitarFreaks DrumMania and Beatmania Released the same year Enixs Bust a Groove revolved around similar dancing themes to Dance Dance Revolution but employed a more conventional input method The game featured competitive one on one battles and also allowed the player more freedom than normally found in rhythm games

Vib Ribbon was released by NanaOn Sha in 1999 and also did not use instrument shaped controllers In this game players had to maneuver the protagonist through an obstacle course by pressing buttons at the correct time These courses were generated in a way that depended on the background music and players could load their own music to play along While it was praised for its unique style and timeless artistry its simple vector graphics proved difficult to market and the game was never released in North America Bemanis Samba de Amigo released in 1999 and on Dreamcast in 2000 featured maraca shaped motion sensor controllers The game made use of social gaming allowing two player gameplay and providing a spectacle for onlookers In 2001 Taiko no Tatsujin combined traditional Japanese drums with contemporary pop music and became highly successful in Japanese arcades The game was later released on consoles in the West and the franchise continues to receive new installments in Japan Gitaroo Man featured a guitar playing protagonist 4 years before the release of Guitar Hero though the game employed a conventional rather than guitar shaped controller Gitaroo Mans creator Keiichi Yano further created Osu Tatakae Ouendan a rhythm game for the Nintendo DS using its touchscreen features which was a highly demanded import title and led to a sequel in Japan and a Western variation of the game in Elite Beat Agents

Harmonix a company formed from a computer music group at MIT in 1995 released Frequency in 2001 The game allowed the player to control multiple instruments and gave a feeling of more creative control The game was well reviewed but its abstract style did not allow the player to give a performance as in other games and thus proved difficult to market Frequency was followed by a similar game Amplitude in 2003 Harmonix later released more socially driven karaoke themed music games in Karaoke Revolution and SingStar Donkey Konga developed by Namco for Nintendo and released in 2003 achieved widespread success due to its use of Nintendos Donkey Kong franchise

Guitar Hero developed by Harmonix was released in 2005 by then relatively unknown publisher RedOctane The game was inspired by GuitarFreaks but while that game had used Japanese pop music Guitar Hero featured Western rock music The game revived the rhythm genre which by this time had begun to get boring flooded with Dance Dance Revolution sequels and imitators The game had several sequels with the franchise earning more than 1 billion in sales the third game was the best selling game in North America in 2007 Harmonixs later Rock Band franchise which also earned in excess of 1 billion used multiple instrument controllers and cooperative multiplayer allowing players to play as a full band The Guitar Hero franchise followed suit with Guitar Hero World Tour developed by Neversoft rather than Harmonix Guitar Hero installments based on specific bands such as Metallica and Aerosmith were later published Additional songs could be purchased on the internet and added to Guitar Hero and Rock Band games Artists whose works have been featured in the games have also benefited from royalties and increased publicity in turn generating further sales of their work The success of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises widened the console video game market and its demographics with the popularity of the music game driving increased sales of consoles In 2008 it was reported that the music game had become the second most popular video game genre in the US with 53 of players being female

Analysts for the video game market considered 2009 to be critical to further success of the genre Both the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises expanded in this year with new games on other gaming platforms including handheld gaming devices and mobile phones and with titles targeted towards specific genres or demographics such as Band Hero for pop music and Lego Rock Band for younger players Sales of music games were down in the first half of the year though part was attributed to fewer purchases of the instrument controllers which players had already purchased and could reuse for other games However though analysis had expected that United States sales of Guitar Hero 5 and The Beatles Rock Band to be high close to or exceeding one million units each in the first month of their release the resulting sales numbers were lower by nearly half of the projections Though signs of the impact of the late 2000s recession on the video game markets were considered a factor in lower sales it was also taken as a sign of the waning popularity of the titles now considered to be saturating the market As a result analysts have lowered expectations for future music games projections for sales of DJ Hero a spinoff of Guitar Hero published by Activision have been reduced from 16 million units in the first quarter of sales in the United Sates to only 600000 Further contributing to the decline is the lack of innovation in the genre as such games have not changed their basic play model over their last several games leading to consumers becoming less likely to buy additional titles Total sales of rhythm games having reached 14 billion in 2008 reached only 700 million in 2009 with analysts predicting the market will settle at the same healthy 500600 million level seen by the Call of Duty series 

The weakening market for rhythm video games has created fallout effects impacting both game developers and distributors Publishers and distributors have recognized that in 2010 most consumers likely have one or more sets of instrument controller hardware at their homes and that further sales would be primarily driven by software sales and additional content Activision scaled back its 2010 Guitar Hero release schedule to just two full games reducing the number of SKUs from 25 in 2009 to 10 in 2010 Activision has also closed some of its in house developers including RedOctane Neversofts Guitar Hero division and Underground Development bringing the remaining employees and assets under their own control Viacom which had previously paid Harmonix 150 million for their performance behind Rock Band in 2007 are now seeking to get a substantial refund on that amount due to the weak sales in 2009 Viacom is also seeking to further reduce costs by negotiating new deals with music publishers to reduce the costs associated with music licensing for the Rock Band series During the third quarter of 2010 Viacom began seeking a buyer for Harmonix recognizing they did not have the efficiency and capacity to deal with the cost of maintaining a video game developer compared with dedicated video game publishers

The kinds of people buying games was changing and they wanted something different Rhythm game developers tried to add new features to their games Rock Band 3 and Power Gig Rise of the SixString added new stringed guitar controllers They also added kinds of game play to help players learn how to hold their fingers as if playing a real guitar Despite these new modes sales of music games were still low in 2010 Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock and DJ Hero 2 sold only 86000 and 59000 copies in North America during their first week of sales respectively a sharp contrast to Guitar Hero III which had seen nearly 14 million units in its first week in 2008 Analysis of music game sales through October 2010 show net sales of around 200 million through October one fifth of the revenue for music games for the same period in 2008 and that the market will likely not break 400 million by the end of the year End year sales were less than 300 million

By the end of 2010 the rhythm market initially propped by game bundles with instrument controllers was considered well past its prime and has shifted towards downloadable content and potential integration with motion control systems Citing the downturn in rhythm games Activision shuttered their Guitar Hero division in February 2011 Viacom completed its sale of Harmonix in late 2010 to an investment backed group to allow it to continue developing Rock Band and Dance Central on its own Analysts suggest that the market for these types of peripheral rhythm games may be stagnant for three to five years after which they may resurge on new consoles or based on different distribution models such as a stronger focus on downloadable content

With the introduction of motion control to both the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 in 2010 and 2011 along with existing Wii motion control some analysts believed the rhythm market would resurges through a new wave of dance based video games and band based ones that use platform agnostic controllers to replicate real life actions Games such as Dance Central Michael Jackson The Game and Child of Eden are all games based on the new motion sensing technology aimed to encourage more engaging dance routines Industry pundits believe that as sales of music games requiring peripheral controllers lag dance based games along with rising popularity of pop music will continue to thrive for some time Dancing games such as Just Dance and Dance Central boosted late year sales Dance Central was the top selling game for the Kinect in North America in November 2010 and both games led to an 38 increase in sales compared to November 2009 according to NPD

The parables of Jesus can be found in all the Canonical gospels as well as in some of the non canonical gospels but are located mainly within the three synoptic gospels They represent a key part of the teachings of Jesus forming approximately one third of his recorded teachings Christians place high emphasis on these parables since they are the words of Jesus they are believed to be what the Father has taught indicated by BibleverseJohn828TNIV and Bibleverse nbJohn1410TNIV

Jesus parables are seemingly simple and memorable stories often with imagery and each conveys a message Scholars have commented that although these parables seem simple the messages they convey are deep and central to the teachings of Jesus Christian authors view them not as mere similitudes which serve the purpose of illustration but as internal analogies where nature becomes a witness for the spiritual world

Many of Jesus parables refer to simple everyday things such as a woman baking bread a man knocking on his neighbors door at night or the aftermath of a roadside mugging yet they deal with major religious themes such as the growth of the Kingdom of God the importance of prayer and the meaning of love

In Western civilization these parables formed the prototype for the term parable and in the modern age even among those who know little of the Bible the parables of Jesus remain some of the best known stories in the world

As a translation of the Hebrew word mashal the word parable can also refer to a riddle In all times in their history the Jews were familiar with teaching by means of parables and a number of parables also exist in the Old Testament The use of parables by Jesus was hence a natural teaching method that fit into the tradition of his time The parables of Jesus have been quoted taught and discussed since the very beginnings of Christianity

The three synoptic gospels contain the parables of Jesus The Gospel of John contains only the stories of the Vine and Good Shepherd which some consider to be parables else it includes allegories but no parables Several authors such as Barbara Reid Arland Hultgren or Donald Griggs comment that parables are noticeably absent from the Gospel of John

The Catholic Encyclopedia states There are no parables in St Johns Gospel In the Synoptics we reckon thirty three in all but some have raised the number even to sixty by including proverbial expressions The Gospel of Luke contains both the largest total number of parables and eighteen unique parables the Gospel of Matthew contains 23 parables of which eleven are unique and the Gospel of Mark contains eight parables of which two are unique

In Harmony of the Gospels Cox and Easley provide a Gospel harmony for the parables based on the following counts Only in Matthew 11 only in Mark 2 only in Luke 18 Matthew and Luke 4 Matthew Mark and Luke 6 They list no parables for the Gospel of John

Parables attributed to Jesus are also found in other documents apart from the Bible Some of these overlap those in the canonical gospels and some are not part of the Bible The non canonical Gospel of Thomas contains up to fifteen parables eleven of which have parallels in the four canonical Gospels The unknown author of the Gospel of Thomas did not have a special word for parable making it difficult to know what he considered a parable Those unique to Thomas include the Parable of the Assassin and the Parable of the Empty Jar

The noncanonical Apocryphon of James also contains three unique parables attributed to Jesus They are known as The Parable of the Ear of Grain The Parable of the Grain of Wheat and The Parable of the Date Palm Shoot

The hypothetical Q document is seen as a source for some of the parables in Matthew Luke and Thomas

In the Gospel of Matthew Jesus provides an answer when asked about his use of parables

 The disciples came to him and asked Why do you speak to the people in parables He replied The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you but not to them Whoever has will be given more and he will have an abundance Whoever does not have even what he has will be taken from him This is why I speak to them in parables Though seeing they do not see though hearing they do not hear or understand 

While BiblerefMark433 34TNIV and BiblerefMatthew1334 35TNIV may suggest that Jesus would only speak to the crowds in parables while in private explaining everything to his disciples modern scholars do not support the private explanations argument and surmise that Jesus used parables as a teaching method Dwight Pentecost suggests that given that Jesus often preached to a mixed audience of believers and non believers he used parables to reveal the truth to some but hide it from others

Christian author Ashton Axenden suggests that Jesus constructed his parables based on his divine knowledge of how man can be taught

 This was a mode of teaching which our blessed Lord seemed to take special delight in employing And we may be quite sure that as He knew what was in man better than we know He would not have taught by Parables if He had not felt that this was the kind of teaching best suited to our wants 

In the 19th century Lisco and Fairbairn stated that in the parables of Jesus the image borrowed from the visible world is accompanied by a truth from the invisible world and that the parables of Jesus are not mere similitudes which serve the purpose of illustration but are internal analogies where nature becomes a witness for the spiritual world

Similarly in the 20th century calling a parable an earthly story with a heavenly meaning William Barclay states that the parables of Jesus use familiar examples to lead mens minds towards heavenly concepts He suggests that Jesus did not form his parables merely as analogies but based on an inward affinity between the natural and the spiritual order

A number of parables which are adjacent in one or more gospels have similar themes The parable of the Leaven follows the parable of the Mustard Seed in Matthew and Luke and shares the theme of the Kingdom of Heaven growing from small beginnings The parable of the Hidden Treasure and parable of the Pearl form a pair illustrating the great value of the Kingdom of Heaven and the need for action in attaining it

The parables of the Lost Sheep Lost Coin and Lost Son form a trio in Luke dealing with loss and redemption

The parable of the Faithful Servant and parable of the Ten Virgins adjacent in Matthew involve waiting for a bridegroom and have an eschatological theme be prepared for the day of reckoning The parable of the Tares the parable of the Rich Fool the parable of the budding fig tree and the parable of the barren fig tree also have eschatological themes

Other parables stand alone such as the parable of the unforgiving servant dealing with forgiveness the parable of the Good Samaritan dealing with practical love and the parable of the Friend at Night dealing with persistence in prayer

Of the thirty or so parables in the canonical Gospels four were shown in medieval art almost to the exclusion of the others but not mixed in with the narrative scenes of the Life of Christ These were the Ten Virgins the Rich man and Lazarus the Prodigal Son and the Good Samaritan Artists famous for depicting parables include Martin Schongauer Pieter the Elder Bruegal and Albrecht Drer The Workers in the Vineyard also appears in Early Medieval works From the Renaissance the numbers shown widened slightly and the various scenes of the Prodigal Son became the clear favorite with the Good Samaritan also popular Albrecht Drer made a famous engraving of the Prodigal Son amongst the pigs a popular subject in the Northern Renaissance and Rembrandt depicted the story several times although at least one of his works The Prodigal Son in the Tavern a portrait of himself as the Son revelling with his wife is like many artists depictions a way of dignifying a genre tavern scene His late Return of the Prodigal Son is one of his most popular works

As well as being depicted in art and discussed in prose a number of parables form the inspiration for religious poetry and hymns For example the hymn The Ninety and Nine by Elizabeth C Clephane is inspired by the parable of the Lost Sheep

 There were ninety and nine that safely lay In the shelter of the fold But one was out on the hills away Far off from the gates of gold Away on the mountains wild and bare Away from the tender Shepherds care Away from the tender Shepherds care

Similarly My Hope Is Built is inspired by the parable of the Wise and the Foolish Builders and How Kind the Good Samaritan is inspired by the parable of the Good Samaritan

The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree written in the New Testament is a parable of Jesus It is a parable about a fig tree which does not produce fruit unlike the parable of the budding fig tree

Then he told this parable

The owner of the vineyard represents God The fig tree is a symbol for Jerusalem The vineyard where the tree was planted is the earth The tree was meant to bear the good fruit of the Holy Spirit and the gardener is Jesus Fig trees are often planted in vineyards

The parable indicates Jesus is giving his hearers one last chance to repent their sins These three years refers to the period of his ministry on earth The parable is connected to the miracle of cursing the fig tree Richard Whately commented that this parable is one which our Lord may be said to have put before his hearers twice once in words once in action

The Parable of the Budding Fig Tree is a parable of Jesus It is written in the New Testament in Matthew 2432 35 Mark 1328 31 and Luke 2129 33 The parable compares the Kingdom of God with a budding fig tree the opposite of the barren fig tree

He told them this parable

This eschatological parable follows the Olivet discourse in Luke 215 28 New buds appear on the branches of trees when Winter ends The buds open into blossoms and green leaves in Spring Fruit starts to appear as Summer arrives When the signs of the end of the age start to happen it means Jesus will return soon

Counting the cost is the name of a pair of parables Jesus told The two parables are written in the New Testament in Luke 1425 33 

Large crowds were travelling with Jesus and turning to them he said

The disciples of Jesus gave up everything they had for the kingdom of God even their lives Fidelity to Gods salvific aim meant putting family and possessions second Christians believe the cost of being a disciple is worth the promised rewards

The Parable of Drawing in the Net is a parable of Jesus written in the New Testament in Matthew 134752 It is a parable about the final judgment It is the seventh and last parable in the chapter which began with the Parable of the Sower

The parable

It is like The Tares and the Wheat and The Sheep and the Goats a parable about the final judgment Here the edible fish must be separated from the inedible fish after they caught with a net 

Four of his disciples were fishermen and Jesus spoke using imagery they understood Because it is a parable about the end of the age a modern interpretation can be considered with the net representing the Internet Jesuss next words about old and new treasures indicated he did have in mind a future time At that time true teachers of the kingdom display the kingdoms treasure for all to see

The Parable of the Faithful Servant is a parable of Jesus written in the New Testament in Matthew 2442 51 Mark 1334 37 and Luke 1235 48 

The parable

The parable immediately precedes the Parable of the Ten Virgins in the Matthew 25 It means be prepared and remain alert The exact time of Jesus Second Coming is unknown 

The bridegroom is Jesus Christ The wedding banquet is his wedding banquet The advice is for the church his bride while she waits for him He has chosen her That privilege brings responsibility and that responsibility entails accountability Priests will be judged more severely than pagans who never heard of Jesus

The Parable of the Friend at Night is a parable of Jesus written in the New Testament in Luke 115 8 An unsympathetic frenemy refuses to help his neighbour during an emergency at midnight His neighbour persists in asking until he changes his mind 

The parable

Based on the Parable of the Ten Virgins the unexpected arrival of the neighbours guest at midnight could mean it is Jesus himself

Jesus told this parable after he taught his disciples how to pray the Lords Prayer 

The most famous depiction of this parable is The Importunate Neighbour by William Holman Hunt kept at the National Gallery of Victoria Australia

The Entscheidungsproblem is a famous problem of mathematics David Hilbert formulated the problem in 1928 Is there an algorithm that will take a formal language and a logical statement in that language and that will output True or False depending on the truth value of the statement The algorithm does not tell how it reaches the answer nor prove it as long as the answer is always correct

In 1936 and 1937 Alonzo Church and Alan Turing showed independently that there can be no answer to the Entscheidungsproblem They showed that it is impossible for an algorithm to decide whether statements in arithmetic are true or false For this reason there can be no solution for the Entscheidingsproblem

The dance is thought to have come from about 5000 years ago when the Koreans believed that the Sun Moon and Earth controlled the world The people would dance under the brightest full moon of the year in order to bring a good harvest 

In the 16th century when the Japanese were attacking Korea Koreas Admiral Yi Sun sin ordered women to do this dance He told them to do this because he wanted to trick the Japanese into overestimating them The women were said to have worn military uniforms and danced on Mount Okmae 

On February 15 1966 ganggangsullae was included in the list of the Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea 8

Traditionally this dance not done with any instruments Young and old women dance in a circle at night under the moonlight They go outside in hanbok traditional Korean clothing hold hands make a circle and start rotating clockwise The lead singer sings a line Then the rest of the people all sing ganggangsullae Then the lead singer sings another line and the rest of the people reply ganggangsullae This is probably where the name of the song came from As the dance continues the tempo of the song can get faster They sing about their personal hardships relationships and wants During the dance the women also play some games The ganggangsullae can last until dawn

Joshua Holt Hamilton is a Major League Baseball player who currently plays for the Texas Rangers In the 2010 season he was named American League MVP

Runs batted in or RBI is a statistic used in baseball and softball to credit a batter when the outcome of his at bat results in a run being scored except in certain situations such as when an error is made on the play

The official rulebook of Major League Baseball states in Rule 1004

A base on balls is given to a batter and against a pitcher in baseball statistics when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls balls It is also known as a walk

Another version of base on balls called intentional base on balls or intentional walk is when the pitcher deliberately pitches the ball away from the batter in order to issue a base on balls As with any other walk an intentional walk entitles the batter to first base without liability to be put out and entitles any runners to advance if forced Intentional walks are a strategic defensive maneuver usually done to bypass one hitter for one the defensive team believes is less likely to initiate a run scoring play or to set up a double play or force out situation for the next batter They do carry an inherent risk however as they give the offensive team another runner on base without any effort on their part who could potentially score a run

The Wilhelm scream is a movie and television sound effect first used in 1951 for the movie Distant Drums The effect became popular again after it was used in Star Wars and many other movies as well as television shows and video games The scream is often used when someone is shot falls from a great height or is thrown from an explosion

The sound is named for Private Wilhelm a character in The Charge at Feather River a 1953 western in which the character is shot with an arrow This was believed to be the third movie to use the sound effect It was the first use of the sound from the Warner Brothers sound library

The sound effect comes from a series of sound effects made for the 1951 moviesDistant Drums In a scene from the movie soldiers are walking through a swamp in the Everglades One of them is bitten and dragged underwater by an alligator The scream for that scene was recorded later in one take The sound was labeled as man getting bit by an alligator and he screams 

The Wilhelm scream began to become popular when Benjamin Burtt Jr found the original recording and put it into a scene in Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope Burtt is credited with naming the scream after Private Wilhelm Over the next decade Burtt began using the effect in other films he worked on This included most projects with George Lucas or Steven Spielberg It is used in all of the Indiana Jones movies Other sound designers picked up on the effect and use moof the sound in movies became a tradition in the community of sound designers

Research by Burtt shows that actor and singer Sheb Wooley best known for his song Flying Purple People Eater in 1958 is likely to have been the voice actor who first performed the scream This has been supported by an interview in 2005 with Linda Dotson Wooleys widow Burtt discovered records at Warner Brothers from the editor of Distant Drums These records include a short list of names of actors scheduled to record lines of dialogue for roles in the movie Wooley played the uncredited role of Private Jessup in Distant Drums He was one of the few actors used for the recording of more vocal parts for the movie Wooley performed more sound effects including the screams for a man being bitten by an alligator Dotson confirmed that it was Wooleys scream that had been in so many westerns adding He always used to joke about how he was so great about screaming and dying in films

Sir Richard Timothy Hunt FRS is an English biochemist He is usually known as Tim Hunt 

Tim shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on cell division

At the age of eight he was accepted into the Dragon School where he first developed an interest in biology thanks to his German teacher Gerd Sommerhoff 

When he was fourteen he moved to Magdalen College School Oxford where the science prizes now bear his name There he became even more interested in science studying subjects such as chemistry and biology

In 1961 Tim was accepted into Clare College Cambridge to study natural sciences graduating in 1964 and immediately beginning work in the university Department of Biochemistry

He finished his PhD in 1968 and worked in New York to work on protein synthesis Tiny amounts of glutathione inhibited protein synthesis in reticulocytes and tiny amounts of RNA killed the synthesis altogether After returning to Cambridge he continued work on substances which started or inhibited protein synthesis

In 1982 at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole Massachusetts he used the sea urchin egg as his model organism He discovered the cyclin molecule Hunt found that cyclins begin to be made after the eggs are fertilized and increase in levels during interphase until they drop very quickly in the middle of mitosis in each cell division 

He also found that cyclins are present in vertebrate cells where they also regulate the cell cycle His group showed that cyclins bind and activate a family of protein kinases now called the cyclin dependent kinases One of these had been identified as a crucial cell cycle regulator by Paul Nurse

In 1990 he began work at Imperial Cancer Research Fund In 2001 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Leland Hartwell and Paul Nurse for their work on cell division Other honours followed and he was knighted by the Queen in 2006

As they move forward GLaDOS begins to repeat things that Caroline says and becomes confused When they move into part of the lab that was used during the 1980s a message from Cave says he has gotten cancer from working with moon dust and he is dying After a rant about the unfairness of life he says that he wants Caroline to run the company after he dies GLaDOS comes up with a plan to destroy Wheatley once they find him 

Chell and GLaDOS make it to the modern day lab near the surface and find Wheatley GLaDOS attempts to short circuit him by telling him a paradox Unfortunately Wheatley is not smart enough to understand it and the plan fails Wheatley has discovered his new body gives him a feeling of euphoria when a subject solves a test He tried to make cubes with legs to solve puzzles but they were not good at it Instead he forces Chell to solve puzzles As she solves more tests Wheatleys feelings of euphoria become weaker so he builds more and more complicated tests by smashing together test chambers that GLaDOS built 

When Wheatley cannot get the result he wants from the tests he decides to kill Chell and GLaDOS They escape and eventually find him leading to the final fight GLaDOS helps Chell attach broken personality cores to Wheatley to weaken him and she tries to press the button that switched GLaDOS and Wheatley in the first place When she is unable to she shoots a portal on the floor below Wheatley and another on the moon which can be seen through a hole in the roof Wheatley is pulled from GLaDOSs body and released into space Chell is almost pulled out too but GLaDOS saves her and closes the portals

After saving Chell GLaDOS speaks kindly to her explaining that when she was created she was given part of Carolines personality She thanks Chell for helping her find where Carolines personality is in her brain then deletes it Returning to her former self GLaDOS tells Chell that she is too difficult to kill so she will stop trying and release her instead Chell is sent to the surface by an elevator while the turrets sing opera Once she makes it out the Companion Cube is thrown at her and she is free to go As the credits roll GLaDOS sings the song Want You Gone

A Child of Our Time is an oratorio by Michael Tippett It was composed between 1939 and 1941

Tippett composed this oratorio at the beginning of World War II He had already lived through World War I and he was very upset about all the evil in this world He wanted to write a musical work about it He did it by taking the story of the beginning of World War II as a basis of the oratorio but he also made the work speak in general about the evil of this world

In 1938 a 17 year old Jewish boy Hershel Grynspan who lived in Paris desperately wanted to attack the Nazis because of the cruel way his parents in Germany had been treated He therefore murdered a Nazi diplomat in France The Nazis in Germany were so furious that they attacked and murdered lots of Jews in Germany This terrible attack became known as the Kristallnacht This series of events can be found in the words of Tippetts oratorio Tippett wrote the words himself

The title comes from dn von Horvths novel Ein Kind unserer Zeit written in 1938 and published in English in 1939 Tippett began composing it on 5 September 1939 two days after Britain declared war against Germany

In 1958 Tippett arranged the five negro spirituals so that they could be sung by unaccompanied chorus They are often performed like that separately from the oratorio

Tippett uses a similar structure to the Passions of Bach This meant that he used a narrator who tells the story Instead of Bachs Lutheran chorales he adds five negro spirituals which add an emotional comment to the events The music of these spirituals blend very cleverly into the style of Tippetts music The whole oratorio which lasts a little over one hour has three parts This idea is based on the three parts of Handels Messiah Tippett calls the three parts 1 Prophecy 2 Narrative 3 Meditation

Part one opens with a picture of the world in darkness The alto solo shows what the persons soul is feeling The bass tells of the purges in Russia the lynching in the USA the terrible poverty in Britain The chorus tell of their despair

The chorus describes an atmosphere of icy stillness They talk of The Scape Goat The Child of Our Time There is a chorus of the Persecutors and the Persecuted The choir are split into two like the crowd scenes in Bachs Passions In the Chorus of the Self Righteous we hear about the attitude of countries who refuse to accept more than just a few of the persecuted Jews The boy tries to save his mother We are told of the murder of the Nazi diplomat There is a chorus of terror We see the boy in prison and the grieving of the mother

This is about the descent through evil and the discovery of rebirth and liberation The bass suggests that if we have patience we shall be healed The chorus finish by singing of the universal nature of the problem
